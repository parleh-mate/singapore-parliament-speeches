<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question [23rd April],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That an Address be sent to His Excellency the

Governor expressing the thanks of this Assembly for

his  speech delivered on Wednesday, 9th  of  April,

1958."-(The Chief Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>10.02 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Assembly  adjourned  yesterday,  I  was  mentioning

about  the  Government's  efforts  to  improve  the

living conditions of the people in the rural areas.

I  quoted  two  very outstanding  efforts  in  this

direction,  namely, the road development  plan  and

the  Rural Development Panel. Besides these efforts

of  the  Government to improve  the  lives  of  the

people,  Sir,  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  has

introduced the Factories Bill which is designed  to

protect  the welfare of the working people  in  the factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is evidence to prove that the Government

is quite earnestly endeavouring to bring prosperity

to  the  people of Singapore. The hon.  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar, Sir, referred in his speech - I  quote

the Straits Times of 23rd April:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Referring to the Labour Front Government, he said

the  party had never grown up from what it was when

a  group  of individuals got together to  fight  an

election  and got the surprise of their lives  when

they  became  Ministers. They never recovered  from

the shock."



<br><br>I  think all these achievements of the Labour Front

go  on  to  prove  that the Labour Front  Coalition

Government - "the ship" he referred to is  safe  and

sound, and that it is sailing along smoothly in the

best interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while the Government is endeavouring to do

that, the P.A.P. does not want to do anything about

those  achievements. They are  only  interested  to

know when the elections will be held.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



This means that the P.A.P. is not interested in the

welfare  of the people; it is only endeavouring  to

seek  power. We know this; the people of  Singapore

know it; and I am happy indeed that there are signs

to indicate that the people have realised fully the

implications of the Member's speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government cannot easily give way to the

political passions of the P.A.P. It cannot give  up

its  duty  to  the public. If the hon. Member  felt

that  the  ship is sinking, and if the  Member  can

contribute  anything  to make  it  safer,  I  would

invite him to join the Labour Front. Failing  that,

I would request him to mind his own business in the

P.A.P. and not try to meddle in the business of the

Labour Front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member also mentioned the over-optimism of his Party's achievements in the

forthcoming Legislative Assembly elections. Sir, if

only  the  P.A.P. knew its weakness, it  would  not

boast  so  much. I am hopeful that even the  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  will  admit  that  the  P.A.P.

policies  have  antagonised the people  to  a  very

considerable   extent.   Workers,    farmers    and

hawkers - everybody   in   Singapore - are   completely

frustrated.  The  P.A.P. is  gradually  losing  its

faith  in  the  coming elections. The people,  too,

have  completely lost confidence in the P.A.P.  For

instance,  the  wise  policy of  the  Labour  Front

Government  has been responsible for  winning  over

all  the Chinese middle and primary school students

who once backed the P.A.P. to its side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working population of Singapore are also

dissatisfied with the P.A.P. Sir, the Labour  Front

Government   has  always  tried  to   foster   good

relationships   between  the  employers   and   the

employees.   It  has  been  responsible   for   the

promotion  of genuine trade unionism in  Singapore.

Once, the P.A.P. said the same thing. That was when

they were not in power either in the Assembly or in

the  City  Council. They had been  responsible  for

telling  workers  to demand more money  and  better

conditions of service. But today what do  we  find?

They  shun trade unionism and they try to make  use

of the workers for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



their  own  interests.  Sir,  I  am  not  making  a

guesswork of the whole thing; I have solid proof of

this, and I think the people of Singapore also have

evidence to prove this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first act of the P.A.P. Councillors in

the  City Council against trade union interests was

this:   when   the  City  Council   Labour   Unions

Federation  started  negotiations  with  the   City

Council,  the City Council very willingly  accepted

but  when it found that the Unions were not  toeing

their  line,  it  decided to  send  its  agents  to

individual  workers to split the  unity  which  was

existing   in   the  City  Council  Labour   Unions

Federation.  As a result, P.A.P. agents  went  into

individual  houses of the labourers and asked  them

to  accept the proposals put forward by the  P.A.P.

Councillors.  Sir, I think this is a very  bad  act

and  I do not think for a moment that this kind  of

trade union policy is good for this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is evidence to show that the P.A.P.

has  tried  to  split the trade union  movement  in

Singapore and to disrupt its unity. Sir, I  am  now

reading  a  press release which was issued  by  the

Information Bureau of City Hall, dated 22nd  March.

It states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chairman of the Labour Sub-Committee, Mr Ong

Pang Boon, is happy to announce that 70 per cent of

the  redundant  workers in the City Gas  Department

have today accepted the Council's ...".



<br><br>Sir,  this was an attempt to break "black legs"  in

the  trade  union  movement, disrupting  the  trade

union movement in Singapore. This is undemocratic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Yellow unions!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I do not think that in the history

of the Labour Front Government, it has ever engaged

people  to  go  out  and  see  workers  against   a

recognised trade union. We have kept our faith with

the   working  people,  but  today  the   so-called

champions  of  labour in Singapore  are  trying  to

disrupt   the  healthy  trade  union  movement   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also allegations which I received

from City Council employees that P.A.P. agents  are

propagating communalism among the workers.  I  have

heard it said and workers complain to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



me  that  the  Chinese members of the trade  unions

have  been told, "These 8,000 Indian employees have

got  an independent country and they can very  well

go off, and we are going to stick firm to our terms

and  if  we  win the day we will see that  we  will

replace them with Chinese and Malay labour."  I  do

not  think,  Sir,  this is a very healthy  sign  in

Singapore.  This happened in the Naval  Base;  this

happened in the Harbour Board; and this will happen

wherever  the  P.A.P. has influence  in  the  trade

union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, Sir, is proof to show that the P.A.P.

has  completely  failed in its policy  towards  the

labour  movement in Singapore. Sir, the P.A.P. can

only  fool  some people some time but  they  cannot

fool  all  the people all the time. The  people  of

Singapore, particularly the trade union people, now

realise  that all the empty promises all the  empty

policies which the P.A.P. normally urge before they

get  into  power, will not be fulfilled  when  once

they  get  into power. This is a solid and concrete

example of its policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Sir, I think the P.A.P. trade union

policy is to enslave the trade union people  on  to

its  side and make them work as slaves. I  do  hope

that  those trade union people in the City Council,

in  the  Harbour Board and in the Naval  Base,  who

have  suffered under the P.A.P. trade union policy,

will realise where their loyalties should lie.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have heard it said that even if the P.A.P.

gets  a  few  seats  in  the  Assembly  to  form  a

government, it is not preared to form a government.

It  is afraid of forming a government and face  the

people. It prefers to continue in opposition and to

do the same kind of talking as it is used to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the activities of the P.A.P. in recent months

have  resulted in a genuine fear among the minority

communities  in  Singapore. Recently,  one  of  the

P.A.P. leaders in the City Council asked a minority

member - an Indian member - to pack up all his  things

and  go  to  India if he so wishes. The P.A.P. has

tried  to  meddle with the Malays. Sir,  very  many

minority community members have approached  me  and

posed me questions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



as  to  their  future in Singapore. I have  assured

them   that   under   a  Labour   Front   Coalition

Government, they have nothing to fear. But they are

not  satisfied. They are not satisfied  because  of

the  tactics  of  the P.A.P. in  its  treatment  of

minorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that genuine fear can be seen in writing if

one  goes  outside the Victoria Memorial Hall.  The

Singapore  Indian  Congress has  called  out  at  a

public  meeting demanding reserved  seats  in  this

Assembly.  I  do  not personally  support  reserved

seats  in  this  Assembly because  I  believe  that

communalism  has  no  place in Singapore.  But  all

these demands have now come out as a result of  the

fears of the minority communities in Singapore if a

future  government which is opposed  to  them  gets

into power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, Sir, I have to reply to some of

the remarks which the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar

has made. Unfortunately he is not here to listen to

me but I do hope that he will read my statements if

the  newspapers publish them. Sir, the hon.  Member

has referred to the sad sights he has seen in which

the junior ministers of the Government throw stones

at  the sinking ship to make it sink faster. I have

already  told this Assembly, Sir, that  the  Labour

Front  ship  is safe and sound; it is not  sinking.

And  I would assure him that my relations with  the



Ministers and Party members are very, very cordial,

and  I  would  serve  my Party  and  the  Ministers

loyally  and  faithfully for ever. I  have  been  a

front-line soldier in the struggle for freedom  for

this   country  for  so  many  years,  and  I  have

undergone  several sacrifices in the best interests

of  the  people. I think the Member  has  tried  to

throw  a spanner into the works and to disrupt  the

unity  which we have achieved among us. Had it  not

been  for  the  fact that the P.A.P. leaders  waged

constant war on individual leaders of the Front and

poisoned its members against the Front, the  P.A.P.

would not have survived. The P.A.P. today, divorced

from  the  anti-British supporters  of  the  M.C.P.

members and subversive elements is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



worth its name, and all their hopes of winning  the

51  seats  in the Assembly will remain nothing  but

empty dreams.



<br><br>10.19 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whenever the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar speaks in this House, we

can  always rely on hearing something new. The  day

before yesterday, the hon. Member gave us a lengthy

discourse  on  how to catch votes.  He  gave  us  a

brilliant  analysis  of why,  as  he  alleged,  the

Labour  Front  was on its way out. He  accused  the

Labour Front, Sir, not of not doing enough for  the

people - he has admitted many times in the past  that

the  Labour Front has done a lot of good things - but

he  accused the Labour Front of failing to  capture

the imagination of the people. Now therein lies the

fundamental difference between us and the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member believes in firing the imagination

of  the  people  to  catch  votes.  He  even  cited

examples of action which his Party has taken in the

City  Council,  like the removal of  the  mace  and

perhaps  the firing of crackers. Why, even the  ex-Chief  Minister goes about brandishing hammers  all

over  the  place,  and  he  has  got  his  henchmen

shouting   slogans,  `We  are  leftists!   We   are

leftists!' - as if leftist is a pass-word to  gaining

access  to this Assembly. `We are leftists! We  are

leftists!'  by  people  who  depend  on  trade  and

commerce  for their livelihood, who depend  on  the

flow  of  trade;  they go about  shouting  `We  are

leftists, we are leftists'! And brandishing hammers

all  over Singapore! All very well indeed,  Sir,  I

say,  to  fire the imagination of the  people,  but

what  then?  Will the people eat slogans?  Do  they

live  on  slogans?  Do  they  live  on  strings  of

crackers?  Do they earn their livelihood by  waving

hammers  in public places? We, Sir, do not  believe

in  these  empty  things.  In  fact,  that  is  the

fundamental difference between us and the P.A.P. or

the    ex-Chief   Minister's   hammer   brandishing "heroes".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in serious work. We believe in doing

things  for  the  people, in  providing  education,

housing,  medical  facilities,  in  broadening  the

basis of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



economy,  so  that these slogan - calling  people  of

today will find jobs tomorrow when their ardour for

waving hammers and shouting slogans has cooled  off

and hunger gnaws at their insides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time the people of Singapore are told

the  truth.  It  is  time the people  of  Singapore

realise that dark clouds are already looming on the

economic horizon. It is time they realise that  all

this  shouting of "isms" is not going to fill their

stomachs.  It  is time they realise  that  if  they

follow this talk of right, left, left, right,  they

are  very  soon going to left, right,  left,  right

themselves  to  destruction! Just as Hitler's  army

goose-stepped itself out to oblivion.  It  is  time

the  people  realise, Sir, that the  only  possible

"ism" in Singapore is "practicalism", or "realism",

if you like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, Sir, is the purpose of our politicians? Is

it  to  gain  seats for themselves in  the  elected

Assembly?  Is it to fill their pockets? Is  it  the

lust  for power? The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar,

Sir, says that it is to capture the imagination  in

order to catch votes. Then let the people beware of

such  politicians. For my part, Sir, I am proud  to

say that I am a businessman by vocation and that  I

am  not  a politician, because there is nothing  so

dangerous as a professional politician who will  go

to  any length to retain his seat. He will not stop

at anything. He will lie, he will plot, even betray

his  Party,  his  loyalty, just to keep  his  seat,

because to him it means his livelihood - he needs his

seat to earn his so many hundred dollars or so many

thousand dollars if he becomes a Minister. But does

it do any good to the country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party, Sir, stands for Singapore, not for the

reactionaries,  not  for the  revolutionaries - these

are  hackneyed words, Sir, that can be  twisted  by

politicians as they please - words which really  have

no  meaning  in  an  entrepot trading  centre  like

Singapore.  Sir, we believe in good government.  As

an example that anyone in Singapore can see - all the

statutory boards and committees - we have not stuffed

them with people just because they are loyal to the

Labour  Front. We have put people on  these  boards whom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



we consider are capable of running those boards and

undertakings,  not caring whether  they  belong  to

whatever Party, whether they are in the opposition,

whether  they  wave  hammers,  or  go  about   with

lightning banners, or go about with torches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an example which is fresh in the

mind   of   everyone  in  Singapore.  The   Central

Provident Fund - a few days ago we read that the City

Council was floating a loan of $30 million  and  it

was  said  that  the  Central  Provident  Fund  has

promised its support. Sir, if the Government wished

it,  it  could  have put pressure  on  the  Central

Provident  Fund not to lend its money to  the  City

Council,  and  thereby prove  to  the  citizens  of

Singapore that the Central Provident Fund Board has

no  faith in the City Council. But for the sake  of

good  government,  we, Sir, do not  stoop  to  such

levels of pulling strings behind the scenes. We  do

not  pack the boards with our Labour Front members.

We  let the boards operate of their own free  will.

Even,  Sir,  against pressure from the  Member  for

Serangoon  a  few months back for the  Beehoon  Co-operative Society, asking me to put pressure on the

Industrial Promotion Board - I point-blank refused to

do so. It is true, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> On a point of

clarification,  Sir - I  certainly  have   not   been

putting  pressure on the Minister because  pressure

would not do any good, but it was persuasion on  my

part to see whether he would see the right path  to

fulfil a promise made by him.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thanks to the Member, Sir, for

clarification - "persuasion"  can  be   in   inverted

commas.  But, Sir, I have not made such  a  promise

because in fact legally I have no right to ask  the

Board  to fulfil any promises I make. Otherwise  it

could mean I could make promises to so many people:

"vote  for me and I will get all the money for  you

from the Industrial Promotion Board." If we come to

that  stage, Sir, then I say that Singapore is  not

worth  living in, and therefore I refuse to meddle.

When I set up a board, I say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



let the board work according to its own conscience.

We  heard  criticism  yesterday  of  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust  delays and  I  have  all  along

personally  been  sympathetic with  the  criticism,

because  I myself have fought the S.I.T. for  five

years during my political career, over delays.  And

I  say  that  just  because a board  is  under  the

control of a particular Minister, that is no excuse

for  the Minister to defend it. If that board  does

things wrong, let it get public criticism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Abolish it!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is going to be abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short we stand for Singapore and the good

of  the people of Singapore, and we will go to  the

people, Sir, on the past performance of the  Labour

Front. We will go to the people, Sir, telling  them

honestly  what the future is, and what  the  remedy

for  the  future  is, and how far that  remedy  can

succeed,  and what are the pitfalls in the  future.

In  these  days,  Sir, of dishonest, power-seeking,

budding dictators, this may sound unbelievable, but

it is true. We are not going to thrust ourselves on

the  people  with lies and slogans  to  fire  their

imagination.  We are going to be frank  and  honest

with  them. If they still wish to choose  dishonest

slogan-shouting fanatics, it is their funeral. They

can  have the choice and they are welcome to it.  I

for  my part, Sir, am entirely against politics  as

they  are  today, with all the dishonesty  that  is

going on in politics today. And it is not only  our

misfortune, Sir, that politics are dishonest; it is

the  misfortune  of  many other countries  in  Asia

today, where there are politicians who are out  for

power and for personal gain. I, Sir, quote what the

President of the Republic of Pakistan said on  23rd

March. This is what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pakistan is riddled with insincerity, disloyalty

and  lack of consistency. Self is universally above

service."-

<br><br>How true also of Singapore-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All that matters is the craze to make money or

gain power."-



<br><br>And I can tell the House one thing: the man who

holds my seat in the Ministry of Commerce and

Industry can make a fortune if he wishes to; and

perhaps there are many who are after it just for

the sake of making money. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is true. I am not speaking

of any particular person, but there are many; I can

see  on the political horizon many figures who  are

just out to fill their pockets if they can get hold

of that ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the President of Pakistan goes on to say - no - the Prime Minister of Pakistan has this to say,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I cannot help reminding you that the economic

difficulties  with which the country is  faced  are

due   to  a  large  extent  to  unstable  political

conditions."



<br><br>Again  how  true  of Singapore;  not  because  this

Government  is unstable because it has not  got  an

elected majority. That is a lie. Stability  is  not

the  word. This Government is quite stable. It  has

carried  on for two years and it is going to  carry

on  for  another year. But it will not, if  as  the

Chief  Minister said we find that our  purpose  for

governing is over. We are not going to occupy those

seats  if we are not wanted. Instability here means

instability created by these budding dictators  who

shout their heads off with leftism, rightism, this-ism, that-ism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The paramount need" - I quote again, Sir, the Prime

Minister  of Pakistan, "The paramount need  of  the

moment  is  sound  and stable political  conditions

within  the  country,  and  unless  we  have   such

conditions, it is futile to hope that we can  bring

about balanced economic conditions." Hear, hear,  I

say!   "Politicians  are  perpetually  engaged   in

unprecedented political manoeuvring." How true!  We

have  people crossing the floor of this House  left

and  right, right and left, and who even will bring

in a hammer if Mr Speaker will allow so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This absorbing game of permutation and

combination in which various political groups  have

been indulging in with such abandon must cease.  We

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



know  that  this  pastime  no  longer  evokes   any

response   except  one  of  disgust  at  home   and

amusement abroad." In our case, Sir, it is not just

amusement  abroad,  it  is our  livelihood;  it  is

cutting off our stomachs.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister identify those

papers?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, this is from a Pakistan

press  release dated 23rd March - both  of  them  are

dated  23rd March - and this was quoted in the  local

newspapers  but  I could not lay my  hands  on  the

local newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the Prime Minister of India, the man

whom  every  Asian today respects  as  one  of  the

biggest  leaders of Asia, he, speaking of  his  own

Congress   Party,  one  of  the  biggest  political

parties  in  the world, said this, "We are  worried

about  many  things  and  most  of  all  about  the

lowering of standards of political behaviour." This

is  from  the  Straits Times  of  5th  April.  What

matters to us, Sir, is that Singapore has the  same

problems. Democracy unfortunately is probablly  not

as   suitable  here  as  it  is  suitable  in  some

countries   in  Europe.  Perhaps  we   start   with

democracy but we might end up with dictatorship - with  these goose-stepping, left-right, left-right,

slogan-shouting,  hammer-waving  fanatics.  Let  us

hope that democracy is not killed at the inception.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> I endorse it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, in Singapore we have

people   who   are   out   to   exploit   emotions.

Emotionalism is their stock-in-trade for they  have

nothing better to offer. You have the hammer-waving

ex-Chief   Minister  calling   loudly   for   trade

representation in China - an issue that is calculated

to  arouse the emotions of the Chinese people: `Our

motherland,  our  fatherland, we  must  have  trade

representation.'  Naturally they will  support  the

man who says, `We must have trade representation in

China.'   Then   somebody  else  starts   shouting,

`Minority  seats for the Indians' and so  on.  Does

the  ex-Chief Minister justify the need  for  trade

representation in China?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



What  likely  benefit is this  going  to  bring  to

Singapore?  He does not state that our  trade,  our

imports are much more than our exports to China. He

does not state that the Chinese Government's policy

is  to purchase direct from producing countries and

therefore since we have nothing of our own to  send

to  China she is not going to buy from us more. The

only  profit will be to China to sell more consumer

goods to us, goods which are not costed, which  are

produced  with  cheap labour, like  the  eggs,  and

dumped  on our market. And that will mean  that  in

the  end our labour will have to cut down its wages

and   lower  its  standard  of  living.  Then  what

happens? This is muddled thinking, muddled thinking

which is misleading the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we also have this hysteria about the

postponement of general elections by a few  months,

if  compulsory voting was introduced. Sir, we  have

waited one hundred years to get rid of colonialism,

but these hammer-waving fanatics, and even for that

matter the hon. Member for Telok Ayer, cannot  even

wait a few months more in order to ensure that  the

democratic right of voting is exercised by everyone

who  is eligible to exercise such a right. Sir, the

Member   for   Telok  Ayer  and  the  hammer-waving

fanatics  are  at  one  with  each  other  in  this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> This is not the first time, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. No point has been raised.

Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, these people have no

patience.  They want to get at the plums of  office

immediately but they have no constructive  economic

policy.  Sir,  I  challenge  the  hon.  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar - I am sorry he is not here but  I  am

sure  that  it  will  be conveyed  to  him  by  his

colleague   (the   Member  for  Ponggol-Tampenis) - I

challenge him, Sir, to come to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



House and debate the economic policy of the P.A.P.,

what  the  P.A.P. is going to do on  the  economic

front if it gets into power. So far the P.A.P. has

talked  in  broad outlines, but what  is  its  true

economic  policy? It has never publicly  announced,

"We are going to do this, we are going to do that."

In  fact,  most of these Parties, what they  do  is

they  talk in broad outlines and just in  order  to

get  into  power,  play on the  sympathies  of  the

people on emotional issues, shout about colonialism

which is a dead horse already and flog it. That  is

all they can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me warn the House, Sir, and let me warn the

people  of Singapore, that the future is  bleak  as

far  as economic conditions are concerned, and that

that  is going to affect every man, woman and child

in  Singapore.  It is not just a matter  for  those

sitting  in  this House or for those who  carry  on

trade.  It  is  a matter for every man,  woman  and

child.  They earn their livelihood because  of  the

economic   prosperity  of  the  colony.   If   that

prosperity goes, they are sunk. And I am not  going

to be a partner, Sir, to that sort of destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in England when the Nazi bombers were

hammering away at England in the battle of Britain,

Sir  Winston  Churchill  said  all  that  he  could

promise  was blood, sweat and toil. Blood  we  have

had,  Sir. Not much, some; but if we are not  going

to  sweat and toil from now on and forget all  this

nonsense  about isms and slogans, we are  going  to

get  more  blood,  Sir,  more blood - secret  society

activity,   gangsterism,  murders  and,   possibly,

riots,  because when men's stomachs are empty  they

will go to any length to fill them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Then the P.A.P. will come into power.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I say, Sir, let us forget all

this  nonsense. Let us get together. The  time  has

come  for all good citizens who are honest  to  get

together   in   saving  Singapore  from   dishonest politicians.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Coming down to more mundane

affairs, Sir, of day-to-day administration - the hon.

Mr  Sutherland piously hoped that every Party will

improve  and  encourage capital investment.  It  is

with tongue in cheek, Sir, that politicians talk of

encouraging  capital. I remember, Sir,  a  delegate

from  Hongkong to the ECAFE Conference went to  see

his  Lordship or Worship - I do not know  the  right

term - but  he went to see the Mayor, and  the  Mayor

agreed with him that we need more capital here,  we

need  industrialisation. Yet - I am sorry, Sir,  that

the  Member [for Tanjong Pagar] has just  come  in - yet  what  is  his Party doing? What  steps  is  it

taking   to   see   that  capital   investment   is

encouraged? All the actions that it takes  and  all

the  actions that its rank and file take - some  even

following hammer wavers of another Party-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is perhaps

getting  a  little  too  excited.  I  cannot  allow

pointing  at  Members, at the same time  using  the

pronoun  "his" - I think it is the Member for Tanjong

Pagar.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir, but when I

think   of  the  damage  that  is  being  done   to

Singapore, I cannot contain myself.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Address the Chair, Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these politicians who talk with tongue in

cheek   of   encouraging  capital,  of  encouraging

investment  in industry - are they really  doing  it?

They are killing all initiative for capital to come here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Incentive; the Member has got it mixed up.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us not have unnecessary interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am not an expert in the

colonial  language, Sir, as the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  evidently seems to be, together  with  other

colonial   addictions  like  golf,  and  beer   and Studebakers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr Sutherland expressed another hope

that  the Industrial Promotion Board should develop

now  into  something bigger than what he called  "a

pilot scheme". Sir, let me remind him that I wanted

to set up something bigger from the very beginning.

This Board is just an apology, because I could  not

get the bankers and insurance companies to come  in

and  participate with Government on  a  fifty-fifty

basis  for industrial development. If the hon.  Mr

Sutherland can use his good offices I will be  very

happy  to  sit down and discuss and find  ways  and

means of enlarging this proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Ponggol-Tampenis suggested

that the Labour Front has gone all-out to achieve a

lot  during its fourth year, and he asked why could

it not have done this before? Perhaps, Sir, that is

lack  of understanding. There are many things which

need  a  lot  of  time in planning,  and  when  the

planning stage is finished, then only can you bring

it  to accomplishment. And therefore the first  few

years  have  got to go into planning these  things.

When  things are ready, they appear on  the  stage.

The  appearance on the stage is always at the  last

minute. The planning takes a much longer time  than

the showing on the stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Queenstown, Sir, was shouting

at  the  portion  in His Excellency the  Governor's

Speech  which  said that the Government,  with  the

assent  of  the  United Kingdom  Government,  would

decide on trading relations with other countries - or

words  to  that effect. He was not aware,  Sir,  of

this portion in the White Paper which was published

when  the  All-Party Delegation returned - perhaps  I

may quote it for his benefit:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We recognised, however, in our discussions on

this   subject  that  international  law  made   it

impossible  to  create  an  `international  person'

responsible  only  for certain specific  fields  of

external  affairs  of any one territory,  with  the

result   that   so  long  as  the  United   Kingdom

Government  remained responsible  in  international

law  for  the  external affairs of Singapore,  they

could  be  held  ultimately  responsible  for   any

agreements made by the Singapore Government."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>And so on; then it continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We therefore agreed, particularly in order that

the  exercise  by the Singapore Government  of  the

powers  delegated to them should not be  called  in

question by other Governments with whom they  might

negotiate,  that  the Constitution  should  provide

that  the  Singapore Government would act in  these

matters   with   the   assent  of   Her   Majesty's

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We therefore agreed that the Constitution should

contain a provision on the following lines:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Majesty's Government to have the conduct of

external  defence and external relations,  provided

that  the  Government  of the State  of  Singapore,

acting with the assent of Her Majesty's Government,

shall  have  the  power  to  initiate  and  conduct

matters ..."



<br><br>That,  Sir, is part of the agreement. It is nothing

new that has popped out of Pandora's Box.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown goes on to talk about

our  fishing industry. "How can you encourage local

fishermen  when you also encourage foreign  fishing

companies?"  Sir, fisheries is something  different

from  many other things. Fish is the cheapest  form

of  protein  that could be made available  for  the

people  in  general.  People like  the  Member  for

Queenstown could probably go and buy more expensive

types of proteins like pork or mutton or beef,  but

the  poor people have to depend largely on fish for

their  proteins.  And therefore it is  Government's

duty  not to restrict activities just for the  sake

of safeguarding the livelihood of 4,000 inefficient

local  fishermen. It is Government's  duty  to  see

that the catching of fish-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Has the Government done anything?

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> -is efficient. It is true,

that the supplies of fish are thereby increased  so

that  the  price of fish comes down but  people  in

general  can  now  get a type of protein  which  is

available at prices which they can afford to pay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> They are inefficient because -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the habit has arisen

of  unseemly interruptions. If the hon. Member  for

Queenstown  thinks he has been misunderstood,  then

he  can rise, and I am sure the Minister will  give

way    for   an   explanation.   But   a   murmured

interruption, I think, is disorderly.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, he said that the training

scheme we have cannot succeed because of inadequate

salaries,   and   he  suggested  pre-sea   training

schools. Sir, pre-sea training schools are a costly

affair,  and I do not think that we have the  right

kind of material for those schools yet. But we  are

planning  to  have courses in our  village  schools

now,  schools in the rural areas, on fisheries,  on

agriculture  and so on. That is being prepared  now

and I hope it can be put into operation shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as regards the salaries paid by the Japanese

companies  to  local trainees, he  said  they  were

inadequate.  That  is not so; those  salaries  were

fixed  by  the  Apprenticeship Training  Committee.

However, for his enlightenment, I will quote  these

figures, Sir, to show the type of material we  have

in   Singapore.  The  total  number   of   trainees

recruited  in 1957 was 170; the number of  trainees

resigned  after less than one month,  41,  or  24%;

number  of  trainees resigned after one month,  26, 15%; number of trainees resigned after two to three

months, 28, 16%; number of trainees resigned  after

four  to  six months, 19, 11 %; number of  trainees

resigned  after  seven  to twelve  months,  4,  2%;

number  of trainees still in service, 52, 32%;  but

out  of  the 52 trainees still in service, 33  have

been  in service for only one month, 13 for periods

ranging  from two to six months, and six  only  for

periods  exceeding six months. In other words,  out

of  a  total  of 170 trainees recruited,  only  six

trainees, or 3½%, can be said to have taken on the

idea of serious training for these offshore fishing

projects. The wastage is 96½%. Now, Sir, with  this

type of material-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.  The  reasons for these mass resignations  are

entirely  due to the fact that they are  not  given

proper training and not given the proper type



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



of  work that they are supposed to be training for.

As  I  said yesterday, they were used as deck-hands

and  similar  work - is  that  the  proper  type   of

training?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That, Sir, is not so.

Whenever   somebody  is  inefficient,   he   blames

somebody  else. It is like using "colonialism"  for

hiding inefficiency. When you have nothing else to

offer  the  people, you say, Colonialism,  leftism,

this-ism, that-ism, that is all! It is not so, Sir.

These people do not want to work. That is true, and

nothing that we do about it is going to make  them.

Sir,  these people go out to the sea. First  voyage

they  go  out, they come back and say,  "We  cannot

stand  the sea, we cannot stand the sea; the  China

sea  is too rough." If that is the type of trainees

we  are  going  to  have  in  Singapore,  God  help

Singapore, I say, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to produce hardier types of

youngsters - youngsters who will fight to keep  their

place  in  the  world. This  is  not  the  type  of

material  and  that is why I say that  we  want  to

start  with the villagers in the rural areas, teach

them  the  fundamentals of fishing, of  agriculture

and  so  on.  And  then give them the  training - not

these people. Even if you pay them a higher salary,

you will not get the right type of men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the industrial front, hon. Members may be happy

to  hear  that  the  Chief Minister  has  issued  a

circular  to  heads of Government departments,  and

all the Ministers have issued similar circulars  to

heads  of  statutory boards and  committees  within

their  control and attached to that circular  is  a

confidential  approved  list.  For  items  on  this

approved list, whenever they are purchased  by  any

of  these bodies, they are forced by compulsion  to

buy  only local manufactures. Formerly they  had  a

choice.  A circular had been issued by the ex-Chief

Minister saying preference must be given, but  from

my experience - from bitter experience - I have learnt

that  that  "preference to be  given"  remained  on

paper - no  real  preference  was  given.  Heads   of

departments,  Sir,  have  been  prejudiced  against

local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



manufactures. I have checked certain items of local

manufacture  and found that they are comparable  in

quality  and  price,  and that  the  factories  are

capable  of  producing to capacity to meet  demand,

and  there can therefore be no excuse for heads  of

departments now to say that they will not buy them.

If  they have any real excuse on any item they  can

come  to me and put their case before me, and if  I

find  that they are justified I will remove it from

the  approved  list.  But if not - I  will  stand  no

nonsense, and I am sure the Chief Minister is  with

me in that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> They must buy local

manufactures  in  spite  of  all  their  likes  and

dislikes  about  foreign manufactures.  That  is  a

practical step.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The P.A.P. line.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Oh, I am glad, Sir, that the

P.A.P. is falling in line with us; the right  wing

of  the P.A.P., Sir, may one day come to the Labour

Front; it looks as if we have not much difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Serangoon says the Governor's

Speech  is  filled with pious hopes.  That  is  not

true. The Speech is filled with solid facts of what

legislation  we are going to bring to  this  House,

what  we are going to do in this last year  of  our

office. Comparing with past speeches, this may seem

to  be  a  fruitful one as the Member for  Ponggol-Tampenis  pointed out, but as I said, planning  had

to be undertaken and this is the result of previous planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given a solid example of what we

are  doing  in the field of encouraging industries.

The   other   one  of  course  is  the  point-blank

statement  in  the  Speech that pioneer  industries

legislation  is  being drafted. I can  assure  this

House that that legislation is in the draft now and

should  be before this House in the course  of  the

next  three  or  four months, I should  say - I  hope

earlier.  That  legislation  would  mean,  in   the

layman's  language, "tax holidays" - what period  and

what  type  of  "holidays"  I  am  not  allowed  to

disclose at this moment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Member for Serangoon asks, "More

home-grown  food - what are you  doing  about  that?"

Sir,  what  we have done about it I will tell  him.

The  rate of inoculation of poultry, from 3,000,000

per  year in 1955 has gone up to 7,000,000 per year

last  year, and now the House is going to be  asked

for  a  further  sum for the Veterinary  Department

which  will make the rate of inoculation go  up  to

11,000,000  or 12,000,000 per year. That  is  solid

work.  It  means that the farmer can  rest  assured

that he will not lose large numbers of his stock in

the hazards of diseases beyond his control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in 1955, Sir, when this Government took over,

the poultry production rate was 5,000,000 per year.

Last  year  it  was 22,000,000. As I said  the  day

before  yesterday  in answer  to  a  question,  the

prices of poultry and eggs have come down by  about 30  per cent in the last three years. Pigs - we  were

importing -  60  per cent we were importing  before;

today  we  are exporting. All this, Sir, shows  the

attention given to growing more food. And on top of

that now, Sir, the Rural Development Panel is being

set   up  and  that  panel  will  co-ordinate   all

activities  connected  with the  rural  areas  - the

necessary  road-making, assistance  to  farmers  in

different  forms, and so on. Once that  panel  gets

going, you will see the rural areas receiving  much

more  attention  than they have in  the  past.  The

whole  question  is  one of finance,  Sir;  finance

plays  a  very big part; one would like to do  many

things  but one can not do all those things because

of lack of finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the entrepot trade is not going to remain for

ever.  That  I have told this House time  and  time

again, even though the Member for Telok Ayer  might

say  that he has said it before me. It is  true.  I

can  see the clouds looming ahead and I have warned

this  House many times. I warn the House and I warn

the people of Singapore not to rely on the entrepot

trade  only. It is not going to last. It has lasted

you a hundred years, you are lucky; it is not going

to  last  another hundred years, even though  civil

servants  might  say, `We have  survived  the  last

hundred years and we will continue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



to  survive.' I say that that trend of thought is

dwelling in the past. They do not understand  what

the  future is; they cannot accommodate themselves

to  the developments, political and otherwise,  of

this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion was made, `Why do we not cut down

costs  by mechanising the Harbour Board?' That  is

being done. The Harbour Board is being mechanised,

and  I think the hon. Mr Tan Siak Kew, who  is  a

member  of  that Board, would know about  it;  and

extensions  are being made to the Harbour  Board's

berthing space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a suggestion was made to encourage local

shipping.  Now  we  have  in  His  Excellency  the

Governor's  Speech  a paragraph  which  says  that

discussions   are   going  on  with   neighbouring

governments to allow local masters to have  bigger

scope  for  operation. In fact  these  discussions

have been going on for more than a year. But I  am

sorry  we cannot rely on ourselves alone  in  this

matter   because  these  ships  ply  between   the

Federation  of  Malaya, Singapore and  the  Borneo

territories, and we have got to get the  agreement

of  all these three governments before we can move

in this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion was that we should try to

encourage   local   shipping  - that   is   locally

registered, locally owned ships. Now, Sir, that is

not  easily possible. Firstly, even if we do, most

countries  would insist that their cargoes  should

be  carried  in their bottoms - their own cargoes - we

have  no  cargoes of our own to carry in  our  own

bottoms. If we say tin and rubber must be  carried

in our bottoms, the Federation is going to say "in

our bottoms, not yours; it is our tin and rubber".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the surprising suggestion from

a  businessman, Sir, that perhaps - this  Government

is  a  bad  government; the Member for Telok  Ayer

says  this is a bad government - the next government

might  consider legislating that all coastal trade

should be carried in our ships. What is the length

of  coast we have, Sir? We are only a tiny  island

of 225 square miles. Our ships



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



will go round and round the island? We cannot even

do  that because there is the Causeway. We  cannot

legislate for our ships to carry coastal trade  to

the  Federation  because that is the  Federation's

coast,  not ours. How can you legislate for  going

into other territories? If you do that and say our

ships  must  carry the trade, they  are  going  to

bring in counter legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is an example of half-baked political

ideas   without  proper  debate,  without   proper

understanding of the problems, and  that  is  what

the  country is going to fall for hook,  line  and

sinker    in    the    next   elections - half-baked

politicians with half-baked theories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Perhaps we could establish trade missions.'

Trade  missions are a costly business, Sir, If  a

Minister  goes to another country and spends  $800

to   attend  a  ministerial  conference  like  the

Colombo    Plan   Conference - in   a    ministerial

conference,   Sir,   other  countries   too   send

ministers - and incidentally we get an advantage out

of it by getting something free from Australia, by

saving several hundred thousand dollars due  to  a

rice deal with Thailand - he is asked, `Why did  you

spend  $800?' This in spite of the fact  that  the

same  hon. Member could go gallivanting round  the

world  as  a Member of the Legislative Council  of

the  old  days without any responsibility  to  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is their attitude, Sir - miser-like - shall I

say Scrooge-like - I think that is the word.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. First, of course, I must

discover  whether  the  Minister  is  using  those

expressions  in  relation  to  a  Member  of   the

Assembly. If he is, he will have to withdraw those

expressions.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I meant it

as  a  sort of general charge on people  who  make such charges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Do not be excited!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I have got

to  say  these things. It hurts me as much to  say

it, but we must face the truth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Promotion Board should not

require stringent securities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



and so on, the Member for Serangoon suggested. But,

Sir, we are trustees of public funds; it is not our

money. If the I.P.B. feels that a risk is not worth

taking,  it is up to it. If the money is  lent  and

does  not come back, the same hon. Member will  say

`Why  was  money  lent to so and so the  taxpayers'

money?'  Sir, naturally the Board has  got  to  see

that  what  money it lends is not given merely  for

the asking. And I strongly support it. These Boards

should  not be used for political purposes  because

if  they are the Party in power can make sure  that

it  can buy all the votes through these Boards. And

the  same thing about beehoon, Sir,I say the  bee-hoon industry

- the  way they put forward their proposals - they

do  not deserve any assistance from the Board,  and

the  Board  has  now put to them counter-proposals,

telling  them  what to do in order  that  they  can

qualify for the loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on "vacant land". The Member for Serangoon

(Mr  Lim Choon Mong) said that there is a  lot  of

vacant  land and that Government should  set  aside

some  of  it  and allow farmers to develop  but  as

everyone  knows, Sir, the problem is that once  you

let anybody occupy land that is set aside for later

development  for  hospitals or schools  he  is  not

going  to get out when it is wanted back. You  give

him a contract - everything typed neatly, signed, and

so  on - which says that he is temporary and no  more

and when after five years you tell him, "Sorry,  we

want  to  build a hospital; will you go?", he  will

run  to  the Opposition politicians to put pressure

on  the  Government.  That  is  what  is  happening

here - like  the  case of the illegal attap  huts  in

Kampong   Amber - and  then  you  do  not  get   your

hospital,  you do not get your school, because  the

land  is not available. The occupant will say, "Put

me on another piece of land. Give me compensation."

All with the tax-payers' money, mind you, for which

the politicians are acting as trustees!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a suggestion that more experimental

roads  should  be  built. I  agree,  Sir.  More  of

everything should be done. It is only a  matter  of

finding the money. If we come to this  House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



and  raise taxes, there will be a howl, "Why do you

raise taxes and why do you need so much money, this

and  that?"  Well, if you are not  going  to  raise

taxes,  then you cannot get more of everything.  It

is  just  simple  logic, but of course  maybe  some

Members  here are not accustomed to logic. They  go

more for emotional issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, "Deep-sea fishing licences were turned down."

That  was  the  allegation made by the  Member  for

Serangoon. That is not correct, Sir. These licences

have  not been turned down. I have got the figures.

Sir,  when we opened up this deep-sea fishing joint

project with the Japanese, the first lot was to  be

only  three  licences  for  approva4l  as  a  pilot

scheme.   When  we  found  that  the   scheme   was

successful,  we  threw it open  to  all  applicants

provided that they complied with certain conditions

we laid down. Since then, 16 applications have come

in. Out of those 16, when correspondence took place

between  the  Ministry  and them,  asking  them  to

comply  with  those conditions,  only  four  showed

interest.  The  rest just backed out.  Out  of  the

four,  two were approved, one has been refused  and

one  is  still  under consideration.  So  not  many

licences have been refused! These are facts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not much progress.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Well, not much progress

because out of 16, only four showed interest - 25 per

cent. The rest were frivolous applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member suggested, "Let us follow others if the

Government has no original ideas." The tax  holiday

is  not something borrowed from the Federation,  as

the  Member suggested. In fact, in my statement  to

the Assembly on 7th November, 1956, I said this:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government is investigating the question of

making   tax   concessions  to   industries   whose

expansion   or  establishment  it  is  desired   to

encourage."



<br><br>That was 7th November, 1956. The fact that we could

not get on with it was because income tax is a Pan-Malayan  subject and we have got to  keep  in  line

with the Federation. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



it  is not something that we have borrowed from the

Federation.  Rather it is something  that  we  have

brought  out  ourselves  and  which  is  now  being

adopted on a Pan-Malayan basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an `advice section' in the Ministry which

gives  advice  to  all those who  ask  for  it.  If

anybody is interested in getting advice he  can  go

there  and  he will be given all the assistance  he

requires; the Industrial Promotion Board also gives

assistance.  I  personally,  Sir,  give  a  lot  of

assistance  and  advice to  many  people  who  come

asking   about   the   possibilities   of   opening

industries. I give hours of my time to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> A considerable length of time!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is true. I work at night

because  I cannot work during the daytime. I  bring

files home at night and that is a cause of constant

quarrel between my wife and myself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Passing time!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I did not know what the new

words "Pl. D.W." which the Member for Tanjong Pagar

(Mr  Lee Kuan Yew) quoted yesterday meant until  I

heard what he said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The S.I.T. delays the passing of plans." I admit

that  there is some delay but we do all we  can  to

help in that and an approach to the Ministry or  to

the  Industrial  Promotion Board  would  solve  the

headache much quicker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the Member for Farrer Park (Mr A. R.

Lazarous), one wonders if he became a Member of the

P.A.P. whether he would be in the Left or the Left-Right  or  the  Right-Left or the  Left-Left-Right.

Perhaps  we  might  even  see  him  bringing  in  a

"hammer"  to  this House one of these  days - if  you

will  permit  it,  Sir, which I am  sure  you  will

not - but he can use it outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the nominated Member Mr Tan Siak Kew said

with  regard  to  the Industrial  Promotion  Board,

"There  is  a  danger  of spoon-feeding  industries

without   ascertaining  the  bona  fides   of   the

enterprises or the sponsors." That is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



exactly  what I say, Sir, that we should  stop  any

spoon-feeding and that is why I tell the Member for

Serangoon,  Sir, that we should not  put  political

pressure  but  that  we  should  see  whether   the

industries  are capable of establishing  themselves

if given a helping hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member also said, "Do not meddle in

the  entrepot  trade." Now,  Sir,  it  is  not  our

intention to meddle in the entrepot trade. In fact,

what  we  want to do is to help the entrepot  trade

and  we have in the past, in many instances, helped

the  entrepot  trade  considerably.  For  instance,

Members  must  have read in this  morning's  papers

that  three  ships  which  were  detained  by   the

Indonesians  for so long have been  released.  That

was  as a result of strong representations made  by

my  Ministry.  Likewise, in the  past,  some  other

ships were detained and again we took the matter up

strongly  with  them.  There were  also  impossible

barter  trade  recommendations  or  proposals  last

November  and  we  took  it up  strongly  with  the

Indonesian  Consulate  and  told  them,  "This   is

impossible.  You will kill all the trade."  In  the

end  we  got  them  to  agree  to  scale  down  the

proposals  so that the trade could continue.  These

things go on behind the scenes, Sir. We do not  put

loudspeakers  outside the Ministry  like  the  City

Council  does and blare it all out. Neither  do  we

issue  bulletins  every day like the  City  Council

does, "$10 for the relief fund or this or that." If

we  do  that,  Sir, I am sure that a lot  of  paper

would  be  required and our estimate for stationery

will go up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to Australian timber duties. There was a

proposal to increase import duties in Australia  on

Malayan   timber.  There  again  we   made   strong

representations through Mr Leembruggen who was the

Malayan Deputy-Commissioner then, though we do  not

know the outcome of it yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australian Apple and Board is another example.

We   been   fighting  constantly  with   Australian

Government regarding this Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copra from the Philippines is a recent example.

When  supplies from Indonesia were cut off, I  took

the matter up with the Secretary of State and said,

"We  must  have  dollars  to  buy  copra  from  the

Philippines." Then getting his agreement, I took it

up  again  with the Federation because  the  dollar

question  is  Pan-Malayan. When I was up  in  Kuala

Lumpur  "spending  public funds" on  travelling  up

there  for  the E.C.A.F.E. Conference, I  took  the

matter  up and got the Minister to agree and  there

was a joint statement issued by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the case of relaxation of duties when

India  put into the preferential category  what  so

far  had been treated as non-preferential. That was

in  1955  when I went up to New Delhi with the  ex-Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall) and later on to

Bangalore for the E.C.A.F.E. Conference. I took  it up personally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the things, Sir - there are a lot of

things - you  cannot do by correspondence.  You  have

got  to have personal contact and if Members of the

House  are  going  to  take a "skinflint"  attitude

about  it,  well,  then  we  will  not  have  these

benefits. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rice exports, Sir. "The merchants were in

difficulties because the 21-day period of exemption

for the export of rice was found to be inadequate."

We said, "We will give another 21 days." And so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Colombo, payments were stopped by the Ceylon

financial  authorities  for shipments  of  chillies

made  by local Indian merchants. I took it up  with

the  representative here and then gave  letters  of

introduction  to  the  Indian Chamber's  delegation

which  went there and as a result we got the  money

released.  These are some of the things, Sir,  that

we have done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction in copra freight rate, Sir. The

Nominated Member Mr Tan Siak Kew will bear me  out

on  this, that I took this matter up with a leading

member of the Conference when we were having  lunch

together    and    the    Ministry    then     made

representations. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



a  result, there has been an increase in the  copra

trade lately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other examples I could quote, Sir,

but  commerce  is  a subject on which  you  do  not

advertise.  Secrecy  is the essence  of  trade  and

commerce  and  therefore we do  not  advertise  all

these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have exhausted the formidable list

that  I  had and I have nothing more to say  except

that I hope the public will take note and give  due

consideration to all these things. As I  said,  the

future is not bright; in fact, the future is bleak.



<br><br>11.12 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee (Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Mak Pak Shee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quote what dying Horace Greeley exclaimed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fame is vapour; popularity an accident; riches

take  wings.  Those  who  cheer  today  will  curse

tomorrow. Only one thing endures - character."



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, character is the  only  diploma

that God gives man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)

just  left  the House thinking that, after  he  had

quoted Hamlet and Macbeth in the past, he would not

like to hear what I have to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar referred to the

Straits Times alleging that I, as Chairman  of  the

Attap   Dwellers   Association,   criticised    the

Government's land resettlement policy. His  remarks

did  not come to me as a surprise, used as I am  to

the  policy of the P.A.P. which delights in hitting

below the belt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here with me a petition from members

of  the  Association who have been  evacuated  from

Queenstown to the various resettlement areas in the

Colony, it  is a lengthy document and to  read  it

here  will be to take up the valuable time of  this

House which has a long agenda in front of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any hon. Member who wishes to know the contents of

this petition is welcome to read it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This petition was tabled at the extraordinary

general meeting of the Attap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



Dwellers   Association  held  on  Sunday   at   the

Singapore  Badminton Hall. It was read out  by  the

Hon.  Treasurer  who later, at the request  of  the

Press, passed it on to them to copy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Straits Times came to put the words of

this  petition into my mouth I do not know. It  may

have  been  the enthusiasm of the reporter  or  for

some reason best known to the newspaper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I sit down, I should like

to  point  out  that it is the Party to  which  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar belongs which  does  not

fulfil promises. We can see ample proof of this  in

the  City Council where the employees are in revolt

against a Party which claims to be the "champion of the workers".



<br><br>11.14 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not indulge myself in the

political  "isms" of this House. However,  I  would

like,  at  the  risk of repetition, to  say  a  few

things  about the achievements of the Labour  Front

especially after the attack by the Member for Telok

Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) that the Government has done

nothing  during  the  past three  years.  Once  the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew)  told

me - he rather seems to be an expert on Marxism - that

if  you  tell  a  lie often enough the  people  who

listen to that lie will be inclined to believe  it.

Well, I am not quoting any lie; I am merely quoting

facts and figures to show what the Labour Front has

done.  Perhaps  people  might  forget  about  these

things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Coalition Government came into power,

there have been many outstanding achievements which

stick   out   a   mile.  We  have,  for   instance,

Malayanisation in which all the posts of  Permanent

Secretaries to the various Ministries are now  held

by   local   persons   who  have   been   appointed

irrespective  of whether they are  members  of  any

political    Parties   or   have   any    political

affiliations or of race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent, in 1957, more than $50 million on

education - an increase of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



over 40 per cent over the expenditure for 1956. The

Government's  readiness to grant financial  aid  to

the  Nanyang University, as announced by  the  Hon.

the   Chief  Minister,  is  another  proof  of  our

sincerity  towards  Chinese  culture  and   Chinese education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other achievements, such as the

Shop Assistants Employment Ordinance and the Clerks

Employment Ordinance whereby the workers now  enjoy

limited  hours of work, extra pay for overtime  and

maternity  leave  for the women workers.  There  is

also  the  other  major achievement in  citizenship

whereby all aliens who have hitherto not been given

the chance or right to take part in the affairs  of

Government  are now given such right  both  in  the

City  Council and the Government. Trade unions  for

the  first  time  in the history of Singapore  have

been given the absolute right to strike. These  are

but  a few of the achievements and I would like the

people   to  know,  as  I  said  at  the  risk   of

repetition, such worthy achievements of the  Labour

Front  and  we  will go to the next elections  with

those achievements in front of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hearing the speech of the Member for Farrer

Park (Mr A. R. Lazarous), I was rather amused.  At

one time it sounded to me as like an overture to an

application  for membership in the  P.A.P.  At  the

next  moment,  I  thought it was a censure  on  the

P.A.P. leader (the Member for Tanjong Pagar in this

House) and at another moment, I thought that he was

a  spokesman for the City Council in this Assembly.

I  am  not  surprised at all in view of the  mental attitude of that Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to more mundane matters that have been put

before  the  House. Sir, the Member for  Queenstown

(Mr  Lee Choon Eng) and the Member for Telok  Ayer

(Mr  R. Jumabhoy) touched on the question  of  the

omission  of  the Tamil language in the  Governor's

Speech.  Well,  the Governor's  Speech  is  only  a

statement  of  broad  policy.  It  does  not   give

details.  But to set at rest the minds of the  hon.

Members referred to and especially the minds of the

Indian public in the Colony, I give the assurance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



that, as far as this Government is concerned, Tamil

education  enjoys equal status with all  the  other

three,  namely,  Malay, Chinese and  English.  Now,

Tamil  teaching  in  the  primary  English  schools

started  in 1952. There were then only eight  full-time  teachers teaching that language in 32 primary

English schools. This year, Tamil is taught in  110

schools  by  53 full-time teachers; almost  all  of

them  being  trained either in India or in  Malaya.

The  number of pupils learning Tamil as  a  subject

for  five  days of the week during school hours  is

now 5,926. Now, I will give the comparative figures

of  the  number  of pupils in the  various  schools

during the period under review. As I said, in 1952,

there  were  only 32 schools teaching  Tamil.  This

year, we have 110. The number of pupils in 1953 was

1,228  with seven teachers. In 1958, we have  5,926

with  53  teachers. In addition, we  have  Saturday

Tamil  classes being conducted in several  schools.

Attendance  and  progress at these  Saturday  Tamil

classes are very satisfactory indeed, although some

parents  are  reluctant to send their  children  to

Tamil  classes held on Saturdays mainly because  of

transport difficulties or some parents prefer their

children to be taught Tamil at home. In 1957  also,

a  common  Tamil  language paper  was  set  by  the

Ministry  for  Primary  VI  pupils  to  assess  the

progress  made in the teaching of Tamil in  primary

English  schools. The paper set was  of  Grade  III

standard  in Tamil. Out of 343 candidates  who  sat

for  that  examination in November 1957,  142  were

successful. Now, Tamil classes were also  conducted

for  pupils in English secondary schools. They  are

now  being  conducted at Beatty School and  Raffles

Institution and these have carried on since 1956. I

have  still  more figures about Tamil education  to

prove  that the Government has not left  out  Tamil

education at all. It is treated at par with all the

other  three  languages and that is the  policy  of

this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also touched on the

matter  of  an architectural course in the  Colony.

Well, I advise the Member for Queenstown who is not

here to go to the Singapore Polytechnic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



and   he   will  be  given  the  syllabus  for   an

architectural   course.   We   are   providing   an

architectural  course in the Singapore  Polytechnic

and the degrees awarded by the Polytechnic will  be

recognised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

stressed  the importance of vocational schools  for

children.  In view of the large number of  children

in  Singapore  and  the  large  number  who  cannot

benefit  from  a secondary education, the  Ministry

has  now  in the planning stage an artisan  school.

Overage  pupils  or  pupils  who  cannot  go  to  a

secondary  grammar  school or  those  from  Chinese

schools  who  do  not  have  satisfactory  academic

qualifications  will be given an intensive  artisan

course  to  fit them to take up a trade after  they

have  passed  the examination set  by  the  artisan

school.  This will be a pilot scheme  for  a  Trade

Training  Centre  which I  propose  to  set  up  in

Singapore in the coming years. Of course, the Trade

Training Centre will be a very costly affair and it

needs  a  lot  of  planning as  regards  costs  and

teachers  and  it will be several years  before  it

comes into existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the few facts as I have expressed them,

as  there are indeed very few comments on the  work

of my Ministry.



<br><br>11.24 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I do

not  wish  to take up the time of the Assembly  any

longer  than  is necessary but there are  just  two

points I wish to touch on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns the matter of law and order and

in  particular the police. It is my impression that

all  hon.  Members would be agreed on  two  things:

firstly,  that  the  present  level  of  crime  and

lawlessness  in  Singapore gives  grave  cause  for

concern; secondly, that if this state of affairs is

to be successfully tackled there is only one way of

doing  it and that is through the joint efforts  of

the  police and the public working in co-operation.

What  hon.  Members have concentrated  on  in  this

debate and in the debate which we had yesterday  on

the   two   Bills  which  were  approved  are   the

shortcomings of the police which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



they claim to militate against the development  of

this  co-operation. I shall, Sir, be dealing  with

some  of  the  specific points in a minute  but  I

should like to say at the outset that I have  been

frankly disappointed that in all the comments that

have been made in the course of the debate on this

motion as well as on the Bills there has not  been

one  word  of credit, one word of commendation  or

one  word of encouragement for a body of  men  who

are  faced  with as formidable a task  as  perhaps

faces any police force in the world and who by and

large as a force are working night and day to  the

best  of  their  ability and with  a  considerable

measure   of  success  despite  the  limited   co-operation they receive, striving to do their  duty by their fellow-citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng)

who  I  am  sorry to see is not in his place  drew

attention  to  the  reference  in  the  Governor's

Speech  to  the  morale  of  the  police   and   I

understood  him not to understand what was  meant.

Perhaps  I  could draw attention  to  one  example

which  took  place recently when a police  officer

off  duty  walking along a road saw two  gangsters

making  an  attack with acid bombs. He gave  chase

and  single-handed he tackled them  despite  being

attacked  himself and burned by a bomb  thrown  by

one  of  these  gangsters  and  he  succeeded   in

achieving the capture of one of these two men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there are shortcomings in the police, we

shall  certainly do our best - and I speak for  the

Commissioner on this also - to remedy them. If there

are  black sheep, we shall do our best to discover

them and weed them out. Above all, we shall do our

best to break down this barrier between the police

and  the public and my hon. friend the Member  for

Seletar  (Mr M. P. D. Nair) has already  detailed

some of the measures we have taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be idle to pretend that

shortcomings  do not exist and that there  are  no

black  sheep to be found but if you took any other

community, any other body of persons in  Singapore

today, do hon. Members not think that the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



position or even worse would be found? Let  us  at

least  maintain a sense of proportion in this  and

let us think how many persons in Singapore outside

the  police  share responsibility for the  present

state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said of secret societies. As a

relative newcomer to Singapore, I cannot vie  with

certain others in my knowledge of these bodies but

one  thing  is  very  apparent  and  that  is  the

alarming  extent  to which these secret  societies

have   extended  their  tentacles  into  so   many

activities  in Singapore. If these tentacles  have

penetrated  the police force, as the  hon.  Member

claimed, is that altogether so surprising when  it

is   clear   how   widely  they  have   penetrated

elsewhere?  The  hon. Member for Changi  suggested

that it is the deliberate policy to recruit secret

society  or  ex-secret society  members  into  the

police  force.  That,  Sir, I  emphatically  deny.

Whatever  may have been the position in the  past,

that  is certainly not true today. Moreover, there

is  no  direct recruitment to the C.I.D.,  as  the

hon.  Member  implied.  All  entrants  today   are

recruited  to the uniformed branch of  the  force,

and  only after they have completed their training

and  preliminary service are they  considered  for

service   with  the  C.I.D.  There  are  certainly

opportunities  for corruption in the  C.I.D.,  but

the  Commissioner is very alive to these risks and

to  the  advisability of making regular transfers,

and  there  have,  in  fact,  been  a  number   of

transfers in that branch recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hon. Member suggested that the lack of

information from detectives in the C.I.D. was  due

to  their secret society connections. Another hon.

Member,  however,  complains because  disciplinary

action  is  taken against those who are not  doing

their   jobs.  He  claims  that  this  is  causing

dissatisfaction. It seems to me, Sir,  that  these

two accusations cancel each other out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was urged by the hon. Member for Changi to

recruit more Chinese into the force. My answer  to

that,  Sir,  is  that  we  welcome  every  Chinese

recruit  we can get. The hon. Member also  invited

me  to make a comparison with the police force  in

Hongkong. That, Sir, I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



find  a  very invidious task, but I will say  this:

that  I think both forces are confronted with  very

exceptional and very formidable tasks and that,  to

the  best of their ability, they are tackling those

tasks  courageously. It may be that  Singapore  has

something  to learn from Hongkong. It may  also  be

true  that  Hongkong has something  to  learn  from

Singapore,  and  it may interest the  hon.  Member,

whom  I  am glad to see back in his place, to  know

that  when I arrived in Singapore, among  those  to

meet me on the quay was the Commissioner of Police,

Hongkong,  who was down in Singapore to learn  what

he could from the Singapore police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, may I reiterate that this

problem of lawlessness is one on which we have  all

got  to pull together. If there are faults with the

police,  we will try to remedy them. If  there  are

faults with the public, let us try and remedy  them

also,  but above all, let us try and approach  this

problem  in  a  constructive and not a  destructive

spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only other matter on which I wish to

touch  was a remark dropped by the hon. Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar in the course of his speech to  this

motion.  He  will  perhaps forgive  me  if  I  have

forgotten his exact words, but he indicated that if

he  and  his  friends won the next  election,  they

intended  to  govern,  and  if  they  received  any

obstruction  from  the civil  service,  then  swift

retribution  would follow. Sir,  I  hope  that  all

political Parties will always subscribe to what  is

a   fundamental  principle  in  the  working  of  a

democratic  administration-that the public  service

must   be   immune  from  all  forms  of  political

influence,   political  pressures   and   political

threats. Whichever Party wins the next election and

forms a government will inherit a hard-working  and

an  honest and loyal public service. It is the duty

of  the public service to carry out the policies of

the  government in power at the time; it  is  their

duty  to  deal  with  the  day-to-day  minutiae  of

government  business within the  framework  of  the

policy laid down by the government; and it is  also

their duty to advise their elected Ministers on the

problems that come up and to give that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



advice  to  the best of their ability;  and  I  can

assure  the  hon.  Member that  the  present  civil

service  will  always subscribe to  and  carry  out

those   duties.  I  do,  in  all  earnestness   and

sincerity,  appeal  for  the  maintenance  of  this

principle,  that  there should  be  no  attempt  to

undermine the integrity of the civil service, since

I feel it would be a sorry day for Singapore if-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Point of order, Sir, I take it

the  Chief  Secretary considers  that  his  remarks

apply  equally to the civil service  of  the  local

government  and  that  they should  carry  out  the

policy  of  the Party which is entrusted  with  the

administration of local government?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> If the hon. Member is referring to the

City  Council,  then  I certainly  agree  that  the

public  service is there to carry out the  policies

of what ever body they are serving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.  And that therefore the Chief Secretary  would

deplore  a  civil  servant of the local  government

authority saying that the policy of the Mayor-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Deputy Speaker (Mr R. C. H. Lim):</b>  Order, please. I think this should be put in the form of a

question.  The hon. Member should not question  the

Chief  Secretary  at  this stage.  Will  the  Chief

Secretary carry on, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I have nothing further to say,

but  I  was  dealing with the question  of  general

principle, because it is one on which I  feel  very

strongly   and  I  feel  it  is  in  the  essential

interests  of Singapore that the principle  I  have

outlined should be observed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And by civil servants.



<br><br>11.39 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, in

the  course of an intemperate speech yesterday, the

Member  for  Pasir Panjang claimed that  I  was  in

sympathy  with him in certain matters. I take  this

opportunity of saying that, while I am in  sympathy

with  any  one who is anxious to reduce  costs  and

save Government money, I am certainly not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



in sympathy with any one who takes advantage of his

privileged position as a Member of this Assembly to

make  a  completely  unjustified  and  uncalled-for

attack   on  officers  who,  by  reason  of   their

employment,  are  prevented  from  countering   the

attack in the manner which it deserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accusations of corruption and obstructionism

which  the hon. Member levelled at officers of  the

Improvement Trust are completely without foundation

and  are,  in my opinion, unworthy of a  Member  of

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of the Trust whom the hon. Member has

chosen to calumniate are men of integrity who  have

worked   unselfishly  in  the  interests   of   the

population of Singapore. Their technical  skill  is

of  a  high  order. The buildings which  they  have

erected will stand as a permanent memorial to them.

The  Government thinks so highly of their  services

that it is prepared to offer them a full career  in

the  new Housing Authority if they are prepared  to

accept  it.  What  I  am  afraid  of  is  that  the

intemperate attack of the hon. Member may make them

doubt  the advisability of doing so. Recent  events

in  the  City Council must already have given  them

pause  to  think.  It would be a tragedy  if  these

officers  were to leave because it would mean  that

the   building  activities  of  the   Trust   would

virtually cease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accuse these officers of corruption, "grabbing"

(whatever  that  may mean), and  self  interest  is

quite   inexcusable.  To  do  so  under  cover   of

privilege is worse. At no time has any evidence  of

corruption  or  the like ever been adduced  against

these  officers either to the Minister  or  to  the

Corrupt Practices Bureau. The hon. Member,  who  is

so free with his general accusations, certainly has

never  done  so.  I challenge him  now  to  produce

evidence to substantiate his accusations. If, as  I

suspect, he cannot do so, I call on him to  retract

at  once  and  offer his apologies to the  officers

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also challenge him to give the name of the

member of the Board of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



Trust  who  stated that the officers of  the  Trust

were  capricious  in the movement of  the  boundary

lines  of planning zones. If he cannot or will  not

do  so, I call on him to offer his apologies to the

Board of Trustees whom he has involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member's accusations of obstructionism

are  equally  unjust. I have been a Member  of  the

Board of Trustees for considerable periods over the

past  6  years  and  have  now  a  fairly  intimate

knowledge  of  the  workings  of  the  Trust.   The

Planning  Department of the Trust is  an  efficient

body    which   has   worked   under   considerable

difficulties. Planning during that period has  been

subject  to  many  restrictions, principal  amongst

which  is  the preparation of the Master Plan.  But

the  officers of the Planning Department have  been

invariably  helpful to all who  wished  to  develop

land  and  have  gone out of their  way  to  assist

architects  and  their  clients.  There  have  been

delays. These were inevitable when staff was  short

and  working at full stretch. It will interest hon.

Members to learn that in 1956 (the last information

I  have), the Planning Department dealt with  1,347

applications. That is no mean achievement.  I  have

seen   or  heard  no  evidence  of  obstructionism.

Admittedly,  being busy men and human, the  members

of  the  department may possibly have  given  short

shrift   to  humbugs  and  people  who  sought   to

circumvent the rules. On the contrary, I have  been

impressed by the trouble which the officers of  the

Trust,  and the Planning Committee, which  consists

of   the  Chairman  of  the  Rural  Board   and   4

unofficials, take over applications. Much  time  is

devoted to explaining the reasons for decisions  to

applicants,   their  lawyers  and  architects,   in

committee. No plan is rejected except by the  Board

of  Trustees  as  a whole. I speak from  experience

when I say that consideration of plans takes up  an

inordinate  amount of the time of  the  Board.  The

Board  consists of a majority of unofficial members

who  represent the views of the City  Council,  the

Rural Board and the population as a whole, together

with senior officers of the Government and the City

Council. On many occasions I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



have  heard  the views and feelings  of  applicants

expressed   at   Board  meetings  by   unofficials.

Invariably they have had a fair hearing  and  on  a

number  of  occasions the plans have been  referred

back for further consideration. In short, Sir,  the

Planning  Department of the Trust works efficiently

and  fairly  and  without  wilful  obstruction   of

legitimate demands. I call upon the hon. Member  to

substantiate  his  accusations  to  the  Board   of

Trustees,  or  failing that, to  apologise  to  all

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member made reference to one-room housing

in  Hongkong and suggested that we follow the  same

model  here, implying that we have taken no  action

in  this connection. We also have made enquiries in

Hongkong and officers of the Trust have visited the

schemes there. What the hon. Member failed to  make

clear  was  that  these  one-room  flats  are   for

refugees  from China and were built as a  temporary

solution to an extremely urgent problem. They serve

their  purposes very well in Hongkong but they  are

not  quite  suitable for Singapore. The  Trust  has

already designed a rather better one-room flat with

kitchen  and  bathroom accommodation  built  in.  A

trial  block of these flats will be started in  the

near  future and it is hoped will prove successful.

If so, more will be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly the hon. Member mentioned the P.W.D. and

P.W.D. costs.  I am not prepared to  embark  on  a

discussion of P.W.D. costs at this time. The matter

has   already   been  explored  by  the   Estimates

Committee and doubtless will be explored further. I

am  however  anxious to do everything  possible  to

reduce  costs  of  buildings  generally.  The  hon.

Member took me to a block of flats recently to show

me what could be done for prices which he said were

considerably below those of the P.W.D. I am neither

an  architect  nor  a builder and  have  no  expert

knowledge of these matters. In the circumstances, I

am  reluctant to express an opinion. I am even more

reluctant to use the cover of privilege to  express

opinions  which  might  be misinterpreted  or  hurt

feelings. My views on the design and workmanship of

the flats which I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



saw,  by comparison with those constructed  by  the

P.W.D.,  have been conveyed to the Minister  and  I

shall be prepared to repeat them, if called upon to

do so, to the Estimates Committee. I am afraid that

it  is not a matter of unconditional agreement with

the views expressed by the hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter on which I should like to

touch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my capacity as Financial Secretary, I am

concerned  to  a  certain extent  with  the  credit

worthiness of Singapore and consequently the credit

worthiness of the City Council. That is  my  reason

for touching on the affairs of the City Council  in

this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council is about to float a loan of $30

million   for  the  further  development   of   its

electrical,  gas  and  water  undertakings.  If  it

cannot  float  this  loan, these undertakings,  and

consequently  the  development of  Singapore,  must

suffer. It has been promised support by the Central

Provident  Fund  but  it  also  hopes  to  persuade

holders of another City Council loan which is about

to be redeemed, to convert into the new loan and it

hopes   to   obtain  support  from  other   private

provident funds, and possibly from members  of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the present floatation, the City

Council  will continue to require loan  capital  in

large quantities for some years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council will not obtain the funds it

requires  unless  its  policies,  organisation  and

method  of running its business command the respect

and confidence of the subscribing public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not for me to attempt to assess in this

place the effect which recent events must have  had

on   this  confidence.  I  merely  ask,  with  such

sincerity  and  earnestness as I can command,  that

the  City Council should bear in mind the  need  to

promote  confidence in itself in the  eyes  of  the

investing  public, - and this includes the  Board  of

the  Central Provident Fund - if it wishes to  obtain

the  funds  for  the development which  it  rightly

regards as so important.



<br><br>11.50 a.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course

of this debate, the hon. Members for Queenstown and

Serangoon  and  my colleague, the hon.  Member  for

Pasir Panjang, have spoken on those passages of the

Governor's  Speech concerned with  public  housing,

the  new  Development and Housing  Authority,  land

clearance  and  resettlement,  and  land  use   and

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard harsh criticisms because the

Development  and  Housing Authority  has  not  been

established.  Land use and control as envisaged  in

the  Master Plan has been scorned and described  as

arbitrary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Improvement Trust has been accused

of obstruction while the integrity of its staff has

been disparaged in the most uncalled for manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation in respect of the new Development

and  Housing  Authority  has  admittedly  taken   a

longish  time,  but that has not prevented  housing

going ahead more rapidly this year. The legislation

is  in  its final draft stages and will come before

this  House  at  an  early sitting - in  about  June.

Earlier  introduction of this legislation has  been

complicated  by  the  fact  that  since   the   new

Development  and Housing Authority  will  not  have

planning  functions, as in the case of the  present

Singapore  Improvement  Trust,  it  has  also  been

necessary to provide for the establishment of a new

Planning  Authority  to  be charged  with  planning

responsibilities.   Two  Bills,   therefore,   will

shortly be introduced. Basically, however,  it  can

be  said  that delay in introducing legislation  or

creating  the  new  Authority  has  not  in  itself

impeded progress in the provision of housing. Had a

new  Authority been created earlier, this would not

have  helped the situation which depended basically

on  the resettlement of families before more houses

could be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most unfortunate single factor impeding the

rapid  provision of housing so urgently needed  for

the  low  income groups of our population has  been

due



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



to  the fact that almost all the urban and suburban

sites required for public development have been and

are  occupied  by families who, if  evicted,  would

suffer  great  hardship. As a  consequence,  public

housing  and other development has inevitably  been

slowed  down - and in some cases has come to a  stop.

It  was not until the Government established a Land

and Resettlement Authority to overcome this problem

by  properly  providing alternative  accommodation,

either  by  rehousing  or  resettlement,  that  any

headway  could be made in the provision  of  houses

for the general public. The Resettlement Department

up to date has:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired 19 areas for resettlement and allocated

farms - altogether   3,870  acres   have   been   so  allotted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed 16 areas of Crown land amounting to several thousand acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mapped and designed a further 12 areas amounting to 4,680 acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settled 1,235 old families and 1,032 new

families.  A  further 2,000 vacant  lots  are  now ready for allocation.



<br><br>In the last year, approximately $1,800,000 was used

to this end, while a further $2 million is included

in the Estimates for this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards public housing, only 1,274 housing

units  and 70 shops were completed in 1957; whereas

4,815 housing units were completed in the two years

1955 and 1956. Now that the Resettlement Department

is  succeeding in resettling families,  more  rapid

strides are being made with low cost housing and at

the  present  moment  the situation  is  much  more

satisfactory in that a further 4,971 housing  units

and  127  shops are under construction.  A  further

building programme - Programme No. 9 - providing for  a

further  3,500 ordinary dwellings, 95 cottages  and

95  shops  will shortly come before the  House  for

financial approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As may be seen, therefore, despite difficulties,

Government  has  succeeded  with  resettlement  and

public  housing.  In fixing rents,  Government  has

also taken into account the needs of the low income

groups  in  order to bring S.I.T. homes within  the

reach  of  ordinary working families.  Accordingly,

two-room flats either built or are now being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



built  under  Programme No. 8  at  Kallang,  Albert

Street, Rochore Road, Bukit Timah Road, New  Bridge

Road,  South Bridge Road, and elsewhere are let  at

subsidised  rents of only $35 per  month,  although

the  economic  rent for such a flat  is  more  than

twice that amount. As a further concession-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Point of information, Sir. May

I  know from the Minister, Sir, when he refers to a

two-room flat which is subsidised by Government  at

$35 per month, does he really mean two bed-rooms or

only one bed-room and one sitting room?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang:</b> When I say "two-room

flats",  it means a bed-room and a hall. As  I  was

saying, Sir, as a further concession, rents of only

$30 per month are charged for such flats in respect

of tenants rehoused as a result of slum clearance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special needs of Malays are also provided for.

Malay  settlements are being further developed  and

with  the establishment of the Malay settlement  at

the  8 milestone West Coast Road in September  last

year,  there  are  now  two  Malay  settlements  in

Singapore.  The  first Malay  settlement  at  Jalan

Eunos  is  being  extended by  the  addition  of  a

further 164 acres to provide accommodation for  700

families. The immediate development of 34 acres  to

provide  accommodation for 186 families has already

begun. The lots have been surveyed and 40 lots have

been  pegged  out. This means that  allocation  can

proceed  within  a  week  or  so.  A  third   Malay

settlement at Ayer Gemuroh is also under  way.  The

present Kampong Ayer Gemuroh occupies an area of 21

acres. Plans for the extension of this area to give

a  total  area  of  95 acres to provide  additional

accommodation for 400 families are envisaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to reply to criticisms

concerning land use and control. As already stated,

planning  legislation is shortly to be  introduced.

This  legislation, coinciding with the approval  of

the  Master  Plan,  is designed  to  implement  the

Master  Plan. A Notice of Approval is about  to  be

gazetted together



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



with  information concerning the exhibition of  the

approved  Master Plan, with an explanation  of  all

its  provisions.  The  Master Plan  represents  the

culmination  of many years' careful  study  of  all

those aspects of life in Singapore which materially

influence  the  use  of lands  and  buildings,  and

provides a blue print for the future development of

the whole island, taking into account, in the light

of  our  rapidly increasing population, our  future

expanding needs for homes, schools, public services

and  utilities,  new  urban and  suburban  centres,

including  new towns, improved road communications,

industrial  expansion - all of which are designed  to

offer a better future for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing arbitrary about the Master Plan.

Objectors  to any of the provisions of  the  Master

Plan  were  given the opportunity of  having  their

objections heard at a special Court of Inquiry held

in  1956. Hundreds of objections were heard and the

Plan  has  been amended in many ways. Hon.  Members

will  have  an  opportunity shortly  of  expressing

their  views on the final provisions of the  Master

Plan  when  the planning legislation  comes  before

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the Singapore Improvement Trust, we

have  heard  accusations of delays and obstruction.

Regarding  planning approval by  the  S.I.T.,  this



organisation  has also suffered from  shortages  of

staff  which in the past may have caused delays  in

the consideration of plans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Eight years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang:</b> The situation today,

however, is much happier than in the past. There is

only  one  plan in the Singapore Improvement  Trust

which was received prior to the 1st of March, 1958.

Every other application received before the 1st  of

March,  1958, has been dealt with. On  an  average,

the  S.I.T. receives about 150 plans each month for

consideration. Plans are, in fact, now being  dealt

with expeditiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of houses or buildings which

can  be  constructed per acre, densities  are  laid

down  in the Master Plan and take into account  the

proper use of land and availability of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



services  etc, over  the next  20  years.  Clearly

proper  control to prevent the reversion to  slums,

to  safeguard against haphazard development and  to

ensure cohesion and use of available services is  a

fundamental necessity. The provisions of the Master

Plan were made public in 1956 and objectors had  an

opportunity  of  stating  their  views,   including

questions of density.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accusations of corruption in the S.I.T. are

more  serious.  The  hon.  Member  who  made  these

accusations also referred to two specific instances

of   which   he  described  as  futile  delays   or

obstruction. His disappointment in matters in which

he  was personally concerned can be understood, but

an  attack on the integrity, of the S.I.T. on  such

grounds is unwarranted-



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> That is the police evidence.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang:</b> It is not only unwarranted,

but  it  is  unfair and unethical. In  one  case  a

planned  roundabout required a building to  be  set

back - this  was  in the interest of better  highways

and  traffic  flow, in the other case,  an  ancient

monument  had first to be dispensed with  owing  to

its   dilapidated  state  of  repair   before   new

development could proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards corruption, general accusations without

substance  are  not good enough.  The  Ministry  of

Local Government has not received a single specific

allegation from the hon. Member concerned. It would

be relevant to enquire if he has placed his special

knowledge at the disposal of the Commission dealing

with  corruption  or the Corrupt Practices  Bureau.

Until  proof of any general or specific  corruption

has   been   established,  his  accusations   stand

refuted.    Certainly   disappointment    or    the

disapproval of development projects which  are  not

in  the  interest of Singapore does not  constitute

corruption.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I suspend this sitting to 2.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at seven</i></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Clerk:</b> Honourable Members, I have to announce

the unavoidable absence of Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereupon Mr Deputy Speaker took the Chair, pursuant to the Standing Order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been listening to the debate on the

Governor's  Speech for three days now. During  this

debate,  this  House has heard that  the  Assistant

Ministers have been adding holes to the ship  which

has already been holed by some other persons. I can

assure  this  House,  Sir, that  we  the  Assistant

Ministers are sincere and honest to the skipper  of

the  ship  who  is  leading  us  to  the  land   of

prosperity  and  we will remain together  with  the

skipper  whether  the  ship  floats  or  sinks.  We

believe in the leader who navigates the ship and we

believe that the skipper has gone through all sorts

and has succeeded in weathering the storm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to tell this House, as one of

the  citizens of Singapore, that I believe  in  one

"ism".  The  "ism" in which I believe is "realism".

For  the  last  61  years, Sir,  I  have  lived  in

Singapore. In the old days, we had no Party leaders

but  what  we  had  were community  leaders.  These

community  leaders,  when they assembled  together,

had  a  sense of believing and trusting each  other

for  the  welfare  of the country and  the  people.

Today,  we  are  being given the chance  of  having

Party  leaders  and  when  we  gather  under   such

leadership,  we do not have the sense of  believing

and trusting each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the criticisms which have been thrown

at my Ministry with which I am concerned, they have

been  fully answered by my Minister. I have got  no

more to say on the subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a Government which has been elected

by  the people. If the Opposition thinks about  the

welfare of the people and the country, they  should

at  least have the sense of telling this House what

good the Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



done, but for the past two days and today, we  have

heard nothing except the criticisms that have  been

levelled  against us. Do you think, Sir, that  that

is  fair  after what we have done and what we  have

gone  through? Indeed, we have done it for the sake

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This country depends on commerce. We depend on

capital. If there is unrest, the money will  surely

go  out  from Singapore. We will then be left  with

nothing   and   we  will  see  nothing   else   but

frustration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have one thing more to say: let us be

united for the good of the people and the country.



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  surprises me to find so many beautiful promises

in  the  Governor's Speech. It is apparent  to  the

smallest  child  that  these  promises  cannot   be

carried out in so short a time that is left for the

Government.  We  heard  on  Tuesday  the   P.A.P.'s

arrogant   boast   that  they  will   capture   the

Government during the next general elections. I for

one  do not believe that Government will fall  into

the  hands of the P.A.P. So far, they have  managed

to  fool a section of the people. They have  misled

the  workers  and the students by shouting  slogans

like,  "Down with colonialism!" Today, in the  City

Council,  the workers have awakened to  the  truth.

They  find that the P.A.P. can be more hard-hearted

task  masters  than the colonial officials.  Today,

the  workers  have found the truth.  Tomorrow,  the

students will see the light. They now know what the

P.A.P. really stands for - a Left-wing  organisation

dedicated  to  the destruction of our Island  Home.

The  leaders of the P.A.P. have proved in times  of

crisis  to  be shiftless whenever there was  action

taken  against the extremist elements in the P.A.P.

Where  were  the Right-wing leaders of the  P.A.P.?

Sir,  I  regret to note that the Member for Tanjong

Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) is not here to hear what I

have  to  say,  as I have the facts that  even  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar at the time of crisis  was

having  his golf vacation in the Cameron Highlands,

far away from the place of disturbances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



Sir, the P.A.P. has fooled many  people

in the past; they cannot fool them any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I said that I would speak on the

incidence  of  crime.  During  `Operation  Dagger',

hundreds of people have been arrested just  because

they  have tattoo marks on their bodies. That  does

not  mean  to show that they are members of  secret

societies.  I am not protecting members  of  secret

societies. Despite these arrests, even the Hon. the

Chief   Secretary   (Mr  E.  B.  David)   admitted

yesterday in this House that crimes have increased.

Now  the police would be the first to admit that  a

tattoo mark does not necessarily mean membership of

a  secret  society. Many innocent people have  been

put  in  fear  just because of `Operation  Dagger'.

Many   in  their  ignorance  have  suffered  untold

hardships by disfiguring themselves just to  remove

the  tattoo marks from their bodies and a few  have

died  after applying acid on these marks. This  has

shown clearly that the police have been barking  up

the wrong tree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I would like to read

from column 10 of the Governor's Speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government pledges itself anew to safeguard

the  welfare of the people of Singapore,  to  raise

their  level of living and to use this last Session

towards achieving these ends."



<br><br>Sir,  can Government tell us how it will carry  out

this  pledge? Will it proscribe the P.A.P. who have

saddled the people of Singapore with the threat  of

strikes  in  the City Council? Will the leaders  of

these  extremist  elements  be  sent  to  join  the

backseat-drivers of the People's  Action  Party  in

jail?  The people of Singapore would like  to  know

the  answers  to  these questions.  Let  Government

speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also deeply shocked at the speech made by the

Hon. the Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart) this

morning  when  he challenged the Member  for  Pasir

Panjang   (Mr  Wong  Foo  Nam)  about  allegations

against the Singapore Improvement Trust. I have  no

self-interest  in this question but I  would  like,

with your permission, Sir, to inform the House that

on the 28th of March, 1958, I sent in a Question to

the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



Local  Government, Lands and Housing  (Inche  Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat) to supply monthly figures  of

applications submitted to the Singapore Improvement

Trust for approval under sections 61 and 62 of  the

Singapore  Improvement Ordinance in the years  1956

and  1957  and the figures to show the  numbers  of

applications  approved, the numbers of applications

received  and the numbers of applications  approved

and  outstanding at the end of each month.  I  have

received  a  letter from the Hon. Mr  Speaker  who

informed me as follows - I quote the third paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Question has been considered by the hon. Mr

Speaker  and I am directed to inform you that  this

is  inadmissible because it concerns a  matter  for

which the Minister is not responsible."



<br><br>Sir,  after these allegations, charges and counter-charges, challenges and challenges, I for one would

be  most  happy if the Government would  set  up  a

Commission  of  Inquiry  to investigate  into  this

matter.  This  is very important and  I  personally

would strongly support such a Commission.



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a debate on the Governor's

Speech which affords an opportunity for Members  to

criticise  the Government and to offer constructive

criticisms or suggestions. Several hours have  been

absorbed  by  a number of speeches. What  have  you

heard,  Sir?  A  lot of time was  taken  in  chest-thumping and trumpet-blowing for his Party  by  the

leader  of  the P.A.P. - the reason I  suppose  is

that  he  has no one else here to blow his  Party's

trumpet-the  usual  tirade and dismal  warnings  of

destruction   and  doom  for  the   Parties   which

constitute  the Government. One would have  thought

he  was  addressing the hundreds of eager listeners

gathered  from those who flock to the City  Council

galleries.  The  Government for which  he  predicts

doom  has steered courageously - with the welfare  of

Singapore  and  its  teeming population  always  at

heart - through  troubled seas. The passage  is  like

crossing the English Channel. Shortly after leaving calm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



waters,  one  meets  choppy  seas  which  at  times

increase   with  unabated  fury,  and   without   a

determined man at the helm the ship flounders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has fulfilled its duty and

obligation  to  the people of Singapore  under  the

able  and persevering foresight of its helmsman - our

Chief  Minister - who will hand over his  stewardship

with the pride and satisfaction that the Government

has not failed to govern wisely and achieve much in

its  short term of office. Bouquets though  sparing

have  been  handed  to us by some  Members  on  the

opposite   side.   An   hon.  Member,   though   an

expatriate,  who by his very profession  and  daily

experience,  knows  and  feels  the  pulse  of  the

business  and  economic  world,  has  offered   his

commendations - and   a  Member   of   the   Liberal-Socialists  in  all  honesty  has  said   for   the

Government, "Give credit where credit is due."  But

he was immediately contradicted by his Party Member

(the  Member  for Telok Ayer) - of course,  any  mud-slinging  from  this hon. Member is understandable.

He  says  that the Government has achieved  nothing

but  when  faced with realities of the Government's

good work he grudgingly glosses them over with  the

trite phrase that we are paid to do our duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking of the Governor's reference to the

inevitable merger with the Federation of Malaya, he

says  that he is tired of its repetition. I  wonder

if  the hon. Member realises how tired every one in

this House is of listening to his reiterations that

the  Government is composed of an elected minority,

and how flat that sounds today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things, the Member for Telok Ayer

inferred  that  in the field of health,  Government

has achieved nothing. Surely he is not blind to the

fact  that  the  Government has been  able  to  add

nearly 2,000 beds in its term of office and, by way

of  comparison, may I remind him that from 1946  to

the  end of 1954 at a time when I think he  sat  in

the Legislative Council only 340 beds were added by

the previous Government? Of course we were paid  to do it!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take another example. Government has

increased  in the rural areas maternity  and  child

welfare  centres from 40 to 54 - a provision  at  the

rate  of  one  centre for every 10,000  persons - and

this measured by international standards is no mean

achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has laid stress on two matters of

policy  calculated to improve the health  standards

and   reduce  pressure  on  hospital  beds:  health

education  for  which the Health Education  Council

was formed and the provision of domiciliary nursing

facilities.  I  could enumerate a number  of  other

rapid advances in the Health Ministry: the addition

of  mobile dispensaries, floating dispensaries  for

the  islanders, and so forth, in keeping  with  our

promise to bring the health services to the people.

Also,  during our term of office, we have  won  the

coveted  Kettering Shield awarded to a Commonwealth

country  which gives the best infant service.  But,

of  course, to the Member for Telok Ayer,  we  have

achieved nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each elected Member on the Government Front

Benches  and those Back Benchers who will face  the

electorate  in  the  next  elections  can   do   so

fearlessly, and with pride and satisfaction in  our achievements.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our Chief

Minister  in moving this Address to His  Excellency

remarked   that   constitutional  developments   in

Singapore  were a challenge to the people  to  make

democracy work and if democracy is going to work in

Singapore  we  shall  need  a  higher  standard  of

democratic  leadership than the Opposition  has  so

far  been able to produce - at least in this  debate.

It  has  been a saddening experience for the lovers

of  democracy to listen to the extraordinary  hotch

potch, the  sayoh rampai or chup-chye dishes  they

have served of confused and muddled scraps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence by and large in the

Opposition  of  any attempt to do any  work  before

this sitting, or even to know the facts. Government

has  been  attacked where it should not  have  been

attacked, where the facts surely and clearly do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



justify  it.  I  might even suggest that  where  we

could   have  been  attacked,  we  have  not   been

attacked. Probably they have not taken the  trouble

to look for the suitable points of attack.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy is not an easy form of government, Mr

Deputy  Speaker - but the hardest form. In  order  to

succeed in democracy, you must have at least  three

essentials  and  one is a fairly high  standard  of

living. We have got that in Singapore. Then we must

have  an  efficient civil service to  transmit  the

political    decisions   into    the    field    of

administration, and thank God we have an  efficient

civil  service in Singapore. The third  requirement

is  the very highest qualities of character in  the

people and in their leaders because democracy means

that  you  have got to accept unpleasant facts  and

deal  with  them and vote if necessary  for  higher

taxes on your own income and that is what people do

not like to do. These three essential bases we have

got  in  Singapore  but we by no  means  have  them

permanently  and certainly they could  be  lost.  I

shall  be  saying  a word about the  civil  service

later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already had a number of words about our

national  wealth  and how it is exposed  to  forces

outside  which cannot be controlled and we need  in

our  leaders - if  we  are going to  have  democratic

leaders - a  capacity  for  hard  work,  a  sense  of

responsibility and commonsense which have not  been

easily  found  in  many of the  speeches  from  the

Opposition today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard a number of speeches about the City

Council and the suggestion from one Member that the

City  Council is in danger because the P.A.P. were

in control. The fact is of course that the PAP, are

not  in control of the City Council. Nobody  is  in

control; that is where the danger lies. There is no

Party  which  is able to run the City Council.  All

can have a veto but none can have a policy and that

is a very dangerous situation indeed. If it came to

be so in this Assembly after the next elections, it

would  mean  disaster for Singapore. Any particular

Party may have wrong policies and do great harm but

it is better to have even a Party with bad policies

ruling the country than to have no rule at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



all.  The  tragic breakdown of democracy which  has

been  taking  place progressively in  France  is  a

clear  indication of the danger that we  too  could

run  into  here  if  we cannot  get  our  political

situation  put  into order. I  do  not  regard  the

events   in  the  City  Council  myself   as   very

significant  or menacing. Somebody said  in  horror

how  two City Councillors leaving were actually  in

danger from the excited crowd of people outside and

had  to be escorted out to their cars, as if it was

a new thing; but it is not a new thing. It happened

in  the  old City Council. I think it was over  the

question of the delimitation of taxis when a couple

of City Councillors had to be escorted out to their

cars because there was a small crowd outside making

hostile gestures at them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  have  done a  great  deal  of  free

advertising  for the P.A.P. in the course  of  this

debate.  The  debate has turned  far  more  on  the

P.A.P. than  on any other subject, as  though  the

P.A.P. was the big bad wolf coming to eat them  all

up.  I  do not think that the P.A.P. is a  big  bad

wolf and I do not think that it is going to eat  us

all  up  either. It is not my job to give publicity

to  the P.A.P. They are just a Party like any other

Party.  If  they succeed, it is because  they  work

hard  and maintain unity. If they fail, it will  be

because they have stopped working hard and  do  not

maintain unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just take one point from the P.A.P. leader (the

Member for Tanjong Pagar). He made one remark  that

the  hon.  Mr Sutherland had praised  the  present

Government  and  that  this  praise  was  the  most

damning thing that could be given to the Government

because  it came from a banker. I do not  agree  at

all.  Any  Government in Singapore which wishes  to

succeed  in  its  task must hope  for  the  general

approbation  and  confidence  of  the  banking  and

trading houses. I have here an interesting magazine

called Far East Trade. If the P.A.P. Members  would

like  to  borrow it from me, they can see that  the

world  of  commerce and finance looks at  Communist

China  from a purely practical point of view.  They

express no views as to the moral value



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Communist form of government but they  are

certainly not intimidated because the government is

Communist. They consider it purely from  the  point

of  view  of whether they can effectively do  trade

with  China  and that is the sort of Government  we

want in Singapore. It is when people look at us and

say, "Singapore is the place through which and with

which we can trade with confidence," that our trade

will  grow prosperously and that there will not  be

some  ridiculous  breakdown  which  will  stop   us

trading and increasing our profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate has gone on for a considerable time,

Mr Deputy Speaker, but I must deal with one or two

matters.  I  am  the  acting  Minister  for   Local

Government, Lands and Housing. There have been some

attacks  on  the S.I.T. which have been dealt  with

already but I feel that I shall be shirking my duty

if  I  did not reply to them in my own way as well.

We heard suggestions of things being wrong with the

S.I.T. which  were based on misinformation - failure

to find out what the current facts are - and my hon.

colleague   the   Assistant  Minister   for   Local

Government,  Lands  and  Housing  (Mr  Tan   Theng

Chiang)  gave facts. Although there may  have  been

delays  in 1950, 1954 or 1956, the state  today  is

that not one plan has been with the S.I.T. for more

than  seven  weeks,  that  is  to  say,  since  the

beginning of March. All other plans have been dealt

with.  That  is the fact but hon. Members  of  this

House  are  not prepared to deal with  the  current

facts. They prefer to go back far into history  and

thus  create confusion and waste the time of  other

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) went

so  far  as  to call for a Commission  of  Inquiry.

Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, here is the Report of the

Inquiry  Commission into Allegations of  Corruption

against Members of the Legislative Assembly  or  of

the Public Service, or against Members or Employees

of  the  City Council or other Statutory Bodies  in

Singapore,  together  with  a  Statement   by   the

Government.   It  was  appointed  in   April   last

year - just a year ago - and the report has been in his

hands  now for some little time. I do not find  his

name amongst those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



gave   evidence  to  that  Commission  of   Inquiry

although presumably he had the facts then.  He  has

not  just  learned them but he sat  back  thinking,

"Let this Commission pursue its course and find  no

truth  in  the allegations. I will ask for  another

Commission  as  soon  as this  one  has  reported,"

unless  indeed I am wronging him and he is  one  of

the  anonymous people who appeared under the  tides

of  "People  suffered the high  rates  of  interest

preyed by Pawnbrokers of Singapore"-



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Not like you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> -or "An Umpire of Justice" or "There

is  no  smoke  without a fire". In  any  case,  his

evidence was not identifiable if he gave it and was

dismissed by the Commissioner as being worthless if

he did give it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Panjang (Mr Wong Foo Nam)

led  the attack on the S.I.T. The Member for Changi

(Mr Lim Cher Kheng) I think joined in as well  and

he also attacked the C.I.D.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sure, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Now, when a member of the public,

particularly  an  elected  representative  of   the

people,  has  reason to believe that  something  is

wrong  with  some  statutory  body  or  with   some

Government   department,  he  has   a   clear   and

unquestioned  duty to bring his suspicions  to  the

notice of those who are responsible for cleaning up

whatever  is wrong. He is not required  to  produce

proof  which could go into a court of  law.  He  is

required  to  say, "I have good reason  to  believe

that  this  is  so and I think that  it  should  be

looked   into."   People   have   sometimes    made

allegations  about the Public Works  Department  or

other departments to me. When I say, "Yes, good.  I

will  take that up at once. Just give me a date,  a

subject.  Who  did this? Why did he  do  it?  When?

Where?  What did he do?", the answer is, "Oh  I  do

not  know.  I  just know that there  is  a  lot  of

corruption in the P.W.D." What good is that coffee-shop  rumour? In the Ministry of Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing, no allegations have been  made

whatsoever by the Member for Pasir Panjang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I did.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> They are not on record if they have

been made but if, however, he will make them giving

some  reasonable guide as to who did what, to whom,

when  and where, then they can be examined. In  the

Chua  Commission which was the proper body  sitting

for  a  year, his name does not appear amongst  the

witnesses nor indeed is the S.I.T. mentioned as far

as  I  recollect  by anybody at all.  Despite  this

widespread suspicion alleged against it, no  member

of the public appears to have alleged against it at

all   in  spite  of  the  publicity  given  by  the

Commissioners in an endeavour to get people to come

forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have these hon. Members made their reports to the

Corrupt    Practices   Investigation   Bureau    in

confidence and secrecy, hiding themselves  so  that

they need not get into trouble? Well, if they have,

they  can  say  so. Have they informed  the  Public

Prosecutor?  Apparently not. In  other  words  they

have conducted themselves in the way that the Elias

Commission remarked:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is unfortunate that neither the Police nor the

Corrupt   Practices   Investigation   Bureau   were

afforded  the opportunity of investigating  at  the

time  the  rumours said to have been  prevalent  of

corrupt  and  illegal  practices  during  the  Bye-Elections. The result was that the rumours remained

rumours, without   the   searching   light    of

investigation  being focussed  on  them,  and  they

survived  and  were  repeated  in  the  Legislative

Assembly, and were repeated to us. We have inquired

into them, but in seeking the origin of the rumours

we  were  met on several occasions with  the  reply

that  the rumour had been recounted to the  witness

by  a  stranger, or had been casually overheard  by

the witness being discussed between strangers in  a

bus or other public place."



<br><br>And  the time of this House has been taken up  with

allegations on that level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations were also made against the P.W.D. that

there  was  corruption there. Almost my first  task

when  I  was made Minister and reluctantly took  my

seat  in the ministerial chair was to study a  file

dealing  with what appeared to be corrupt practices

involving an officer of the P.W.D. and a Member  of

the  present elected Assembly. I went into that  as

fully as I could and spent a great deal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



of  time  on  it. In the end, it was impossible  to

bring  anything more than a cloud of suspicion.  It

was not possible to go any further - no smoke without

a  fire  perhaps but not enough to  take  any  firm

action  on. The officer concerned has now left  the

P.W.D.  The  Assemblyman is still sitting  in  this

Assembly.  Without reliable support in the  way  of

evidence, it is not proper that allegations  should

be  made  public  and people's names  brought  into

disrepute.   General   allegations   without   some

indication  of  who  did what, when  and  why  mean

either  that  the accuser himself is  involved  and

therefore dare not be specific because he  will  be

implicating himself; or else they mean that  he  is

talking nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by no means impossible, in my opinion, that

there  are  or  have been in the P.W.D. or  S.I.T.

officers whose conduct has not been above reproach.

It   may  well  be  so  in  any  country,  in   any

department, that somebody gets in who should not be

there. When he is found out, out he goes. But vague

general  overall attacks of this sort do  not  hurt

the  wrongdoers. What they do hurt is  the  general

public  service. They dangerously damage  the  good

and honest officers and they camouflage and conceal

any  criminals  there  may be  because  by  casting

suspicion  on  everybody, they completely  fail  to

spotlight  and  isolate  anybody  who  actually  is

wrong;  and the criminal can sit back and laugh  to

himself and say, "Ha, ha, that pure man on the next

desk is now being accused. Maybe, they cannot catch

me."  Attacks  of  this sort do serious  damage  to

morale  and in every way tend to encourage and  not

to discourage corrupt practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to another allegation which I think I must

refute.  "The P.W.D. buildings were incredibly  (or

unbelievably or unimaginably) expensive." This  was

an  allegation which has been made in this Assembly

frequently  and I think it was at the end  of  1956

that I pressed again and again in this Assembly  to

say,  "Let  us have this taken up in the  Estimates

Committee.  All  right,  if  you  say  it  is   too

expensive, let us take it up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Estimates Committee." Well, the  Estimates

Committee sat through last year. They had on it the

Member  for  Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh  Chew  Chua)

amongst   others   who  himself  was   formerly   a

contractor  and  should be in a position  to  know.

They  had  the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon

Teck)  who is well-versed in building problems  and

who  is  himself working on very large  development

projects. The Estimates Committee on page 3 of  its

Report found that further study should be given  to

the  matter but that as far as they could see,  the

high  cost  of the P.W.D. buildings was not  solely

due  to  higher standards but might be due  to  the

fact   that   there  was  a  restricted   list   of

contractors; and they found nothing else.  On  page

33,  one  hon.  Member  tried  to  compare  popular

buildings - one-storeyed houses - sold for $30,000 each

including  land, sanitation, roads  and  everything

complete  and he said, "How does that compare  with

$38,000 for a government bungalow?" And the  answer

he  got from the Director of Public Works was  that

the  houses  he was praising were extremely  poorly

built, "flashy" but badly finished inside and would

not  last  more than a few years before  they  gave

trouble. There was a proposal that we should go and

compare  buildings  erected by the  P.W.D. and  by

private enterprise and I went to have a look  at  a

block  of  flats  built by private  enterprise  and

another one built by the P.W.D. There did not  seem

very much to choose between them. The one built  by

the  P.W.D. had for its contractor a Member of this

Assembly and unfortunately the standard of his work

was  not very good. There was endless trouble  with

it.  Probably, he would have had the contract taken

away  from him except that there was great pressure

at   that  time  on  the  P.W.D. to  complete  the

buildings in order to get people out of hotels-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of order. Is it

right  for  a  Minister in his speech  to  make  an

inference  against  a Member of  this  Assembly  in

connection   with  his  activities   outside   this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. Carry on, Mr Thomas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> In the case of the privately built

block  of  fiats, all the plaster was off the  main

staircase. I do not know what had happened  for  it

to  fall  off; it had come off for some reason.  It

seemed  to be a pretty large undertaking  to  strip

all  the  plaster off when it could not  have  been

built  for many years. In any case, these arguments

about  whether  the  P.W.D. flats  are  a  bit  too

expensive are all relatively minor matters  because

the  main work of the P.W.D. is not building flats.

That  is the S.I.T.'s job. The main bulk of  P.W.D.

building is in quite other types - schools and large

buildings  of that sort. This attack on the  P.W.D.

concluded with a challenge to a debate in public on

the question of P.W.D. costs. I do not know how you

can  debate  in public on P.W.D. costs  because  it

would not be a matter of debate; it is a matter  of

getting  the plans and the bills of quantities  and

getting them all down and comparing the comparative

costs  and  all the practical details of  surveying

what  actually went into the building and what  you

got for your money. It could not be debated. It  is

a   matter  of  arithmetic  and  calculation.   The

Estimates  Committee is the place where that  could

be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> On a point of

order,  Sir.  The  Minister for Communications  and

Works  was  expressing that the Estimates Committee

would be able to go into the extensive cost of  the

buildings. I submit with apology that the  Minister

does  not  know  exactly  what  he  is  saying.  An

Estimates Committee could-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, please. That is not a

point of order. Please carry on, Mr Thomas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am sorry that the Member for Farrer

Park  finds  my  remarks painful but the  Estimates

Committee  has  of  course the power  to  send  for

persons  and papers like other Assembly  committees

and  if  they  want to go into bills of quantities,

they  send  for them and if they want  to  have  an

expert to go into the bills of quantities for them,

they can have the expert.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken up a little time in dealing with

this. I do not want to take up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



much more time but I think I ought to refer briefly

also  to  the  report which I had done  on  private

buildings.  Private developers have  done  a  great

deal  of work in Singapore and it is very essential

that there should be ample private development  but

there is some ground for thinking that a good  deal

of  private  development is of an  undesirably  low

standard.  The  report which I had made  and  which

cost $8,000 is not a report on public buildings. It

is  a  report on the standards at present or  which

are  likely  to  appear in the  future  in  private

building  and whether anything should  be  done  to

ensure  that the standards are maintained;  and  if

something should be done, what should be done. That

is  the  nature of the report which I have got  and

the suggestion that I was wasting $8,000 on getting

the  P.W.D. to  report  on  itself  is  of  course meaningless.

the  consent of the Speaker and the general  assent

of Members present."



<br><br>The  "general  assent", I take it,  is  that  every

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNOR'S SPEECH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

now  rise to reply to the various points raised  by

Members  of  the  Opposition which  have  not  been

covered by my colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Opposition have attacked the

Governor's Speech in that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



date of the general elections was not mentioned. We

have  been  accused of being vague on a  matter  of

extreme importance to Members of this Assembly  and

to  the  people of Singapore. It is indeed, Sir,  a

matter for regret that Members of the Opposition do

not  know  what they are talking about as has  been

evidenced  a  few  minutes ago by  the  display  of

ignorance  by  the Member for Queenstown  (Mr  Lee

Choon Eng).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Report of the Singapore Constitutional

Conference, it has been made abundantly clear  that

the date of the general elections, that is the date

of  coming into effect of the new constitution  for

the  State of Singapore, is dependent on  a  motion

being moved by this Assembly to the Governor saying

that  the  time has come for general  elections  to

take place. The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon

Mong)  while touching on this challenged the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) to table such

a  motion.  The  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  while

criticising the vagueness of the Governor's  Speech

did  not  say whether he was in favour  or  not  of

early  elections. All he did was to pound his chest

and say, "No matter when it is, we will win." All I

can say is, "We shall see."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar said that recent

events  have shattered our confidence. I  think  he

was  referring to the results of the  City  Council

elections.  If he were, Sir, I think recent  events

in  the  City Council have shattered the confidence

of the public in the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is what you are hoping for.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He accused us, with regard to

the  date  of  the  coming into force  of  the  new

constitution whether we introduce compulsory voting

or  not, that the Government was not going to  hold

early  elections. Sir, surely it  is  not  for  the

Government to fix a date for the general  elections

but  under  agreement reached in London it  is  for

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) who is

not   here,  Sir,  said  that  we  are  a  minority

Government.  Yes, we are. We are proud  to  be  the

minority Government that cannot be overthrown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



because  the  Opposition do not have  the  guts  to

overthrow us. They can at any time table a motion - a

vote  of  no confidence to get us out. Let them  do

it.  All they know is that this Government is brave

and  courageous enough to do something  which  they

themselves  dare  not do and which they  themselves

know  that we are doing for the good of the  people

of Singapore and even my hon. friend the Member for

Tanjong   Pagar  is  quite  pleased.  It   was   by

Government's action that the subversive elements in

his  Party  are now enjoying hospitality in  Changi

prison.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thanks to the `Marshall' law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister Had it not been for that, Sir,

I  think the Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng)

would  not  have said that the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar is the Rightist of the Leftist movement. I do

not know what that term implies but one thing which

I  did  say  and  which the public  knows  is  that

without   the  action  of  my  so-called   minority

Government  the,  shall we say,  "champion  of  the

working  class" might be having a large  number  of

backseat  drivers still driving and  would  not  be

driving  himself. In fact, one significant backseat

driver is still in Changi prison.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, Sir, in my speech that this year is indeed

a  very crucial year. I warned the Members of  this

Assembly - and in their heart of hearts they  believe

it  is  true - and yet they played party politics  in

this  Assembly. I told them, "Please, hon.  Members

of  this Assembly, do realise that the fight  ahead

of  us is a very stiff fight. It is not a fight  of

the   Parties  represented  in  this  Assembly   at

present. It is a fight of democratic forces against

Communist forces in Singapore. Are we to be foolish

enough  to  play  party  politics  and  allow   the

security  and  happiness  of  the  people  of  this

country to be jeopardised?" I appeal to them, "When

we  go  forward  to the general elections,  let  us

fight   hard,  but  fight  wisely,  otherwise   the

subversive  elements with their new fronts - the  old

fronts  having  been denied to them  by  Government

action - will do all they can to capture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



the  prize or the fruit that we have all worked  so

hard  to  achieve." Quarrel among ourselves  if  we

like - that  is democracy - but in the big  thing  that

lies ahead of us never forget that we face the same

danger. The security of this new State of Singapore

that is to come into being is in jeopardy if we  do

not  wake up in time to meet the threat that is  at

present mustering all their resources to throw  all

their forces into the general elections. But I  say

this  (I have been asked to name a date although  I

need  not  have  to name a date) - the  date  of  the

general  elections will be dependent  on  when  the

Government is satisfied that subversive forces  are

not  going  to capture the Government  of  the  new

State  of Singapore, but we will not go beyond  the

Rendel  Constitution. I say, "Blame me as  much  as

you  want but who am I when I have the security and

the  happiness of the people of Singapore at stake?

They are greater than this Government here which is

not  more concerned with being returned at the next

general  elections." We would be happy to surrender

this   Government   to  any  democratic   form   of

Government  if they will meet this threat  strongly

and boldly and not dilly-dally. Sometimes, they are

comrades and sometimes they are not comrades. We do

not  like that, Sir. Come out boldly on your  stand

and say, "We are for this."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from the Member for Tanjong Pagar that

the Labour Front Coalition is a sinking ship. I  do

not know; I have not seen any water leaking in yet.

Then   he   tries  to  teach  us,   to   teach   me

particularly, Sir, who have been working  hard  for

the good of the people of Singapore since 1948, how

to suck eggs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, he touched on the fire victims, "Ha,

let  us appeal to the masses. Let us capture  their

imagination.  Let  us exploit, shall  we  say,  the

sufferings  of  the  people.  Let  us   make   this

suffering  the  basis  of a  grand  appeal  to  the

masses."  He  said, "We the P.A.P. do this  and  do

that.  The people poured in the money to help these

victims  just  because the City Hall has  now  been

turned  from  the so-called colonial building  into

something that is grand and something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



that  understands the feelings and the  aspirations

of  the people of Singapore." So much so that there

is  booing and shouting when the City Council  sits

every  time! Sir, in this Assembly as Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare,  I  say  that  all  political

Parties and all sections of the people in times of,

shall  we say, emergency and distress of this kind,

should  rise  above  party  politics  and  help  to

ameliorate  the sufferings of the poor. The  people

of  Singapore rose to the occasion and  donated  so

much  money,  clothing and goods, and  as  much  of

other things. They did all these things not because

of  the antics in the City Hall, but because  today

they are the citizens of Singapore and they realise

it.  It  is their responsibility to ameliorate  the

sufferings of their fellow-citizens not because  of

what  one Party said or what another Party  did.  I

understand  that even the Workers  Party  tried  to

cash in on the sufferings by selling sweets outside

the camp.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, the Member for Tanjong Pagar is fond of

issuing threats - wonderful! "You want to fight, come

on.  I am not afraid of you. If you do not do this,

watch out!" Sir, we on this side of the House  have

been doing all we can quietly - without show, without

wanting  to  seek publicity and without  having  to

issue,  shall we say, a press release almost  every

day. We do it quietly. We regain the confidence  of

the  people  of Singapore. We regain the confidence

of the people outside Singapore and yet just by one

silly  utterance of a politician in this  Assembly,

everything    is   damaged.   What    heights    of

irresponsibility!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park (Mr A. R. Lazarous)

said  something about the Member for Tanjong Pagar.

I  do  not know whether he is making an application

to  join  the P.A.P. or to meet the ex-comrades  of

the  P.A.P. - I do not know which. I do not even know

whether  he  has joined the Workers Party.  He  has

said  a  number  of things in this  Assembly  which

puzzle us a bit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown and the Member for Telok

Ayer  criticised that part of the Governor's Speech

which  deals  with  trade.  They  said  that   this

Government  must  have  the assent  of  the  United

Kingdom  Government before we can  enter  into  any

trade agreement. Their attention has been drawn  to

paragraphs  33,  34  and 36 of the  Report  of  the

Singapore  Constitutional  Conference.  Sir,   they

approved  this Report when we debated the talks  in

London,  and  now  they  do  not  know  what   they

approved.   They  say  this  is  all  wrong.   Very

lamentable!  I only hope, Sir, that the  electorate

will  open their eyes and know the type of  Members

they returned to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on compulsory voting. This matter was brought

up at one of the civics courses. I never brought it

up,  nor  did  I  think  of it.  But  at  my  Party

conference it was decided that if the public wanted

compulsory  voting,  we  should  accept  that   and

introduce  legislation for it.  Organisations  have

written  to me. I met them last Saturday and  as  a

result  of  the discussion I told them  that  since

they  wanted  compulsory voting, we will  introduce

legislation. The Government has not yet decided  on

this,  but  the Labour Front part of the  Coalition

Government is committed to introducing legislation.

Our  coalition partners, the U.M.N.O., are  against

it, and I respect their views. This is a matter  in

which we should allow all sections of opinion, even

among  Ministerial colleagues, to voice. I did  not

want  to touch on this subject, because the  Member

for Changi has a motion on the Order Paper, but  it

is  clear  from the report in last Sunday's  papers

that  the  Labour  Front  has  been  committed   to

acceding   to   the  wishes  of  the  organisations

concerned. We are not using anything as  an  excuse

to  delay  the elections. We pointed  out  that  if

compulsory voting has to be introduced, it will  be

necessary  to have a few months more in  which  the

electorate can be educated. Compulsory voting, they

say, would be a good thing because we will then  be

able  to  put  an  end  to so many  allegations  of

corrupt practice at election



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



time.  The  Report  of  the  Elms  Commission  also

supports  compulsory voting and has  given  reasons

why it should be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party and the Liberal-Socialist Party have said that they will see to it

that   the  draft  constitution  will  not  contain

anything  other than what has been  agreed  in  the

report. Surely they need not have to suggest  that.

We  went to London as an All-Party delegation.  The

Government  did  not and do not  propose  to  claim

credit for having brought back the constitution. We

said it was an All-Party effort, and because it was

an All-Party effort, it is stated in the Governor's

Speech  that the draft constitution will be settled

by the same delegation. There is no sinister motive

in  bringing the delegation to London. Some  people

have  alleged that we are going there for something

else!  In a way, of course, I can understand  their

qualms,  especially as they have not  yet  received

copies  of  the  draft  constitution.  I  have  not

received  it  too,  but I have  been  assured  that

copies will reach us at the end of this month,  and

as  soon  as  copies  are received,  they  will  be

despatched   to   the  members  of  the   All-Party

delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer said he wanted early

elections.  I  say this to him: if he really  wants

early elections, and as it is already in the Report

of  the Constitutional Conference in London, he can

table a motion. No one is going to prevent him from

doing  it.  He  can table it and  achieve  what  he

wants, instead of harping at every sitting that  we

are a minority Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we have a number of motions on the Order

Paper  to be settled today, I do not think I should

take  up  some  more time of hon.  Members  on  the

political  speeches of Members of  the  Opposition,

but  I  would like to say this once again:  Let  us

wake  up to the facts. Unless we work hard and work

well,  the people of Singapore are going to  suffer

if subversive elements capture the government.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

have  His  Excellency the Governor's  authority  to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $610

shall be supplied to the Government under the heads

of  expenditure and for the services  specified  in

the  Schedule  B contained in Sessional  Paper  No.

Cmd. 5 of 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion deals with the creation of the

General Executive Service of which mention was made

in  introducing  the new schemes  for  the  General

Clerical Service and the General Clerical Assistant

Service  last year. The Executive Service shall  be

intermediate  in status between the  Administrative

and  the Professional Services on the one hand  and

the  Clerical  and  lower services  on  the  other.

Members    of    the    service   will    undertake

responsibility for day-to-day execution of  routine

matters over a wide range of subjects. Their duties

will  include  inspection work, the enforcement  of

laws, the issue of licences and other documents  in

conformity with regulations, and many other matters

where  policy is clearly established. As a  result,

higher  graded officers should be freer to consider

matters  of  more  than  ordinary  difficulty,  and

questions of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schemes of service have been agreed with the

representatives  of the Staff Side  and  have  been

recommended  for  approval by  the  Public  Service

Commission.  These schemes provide that  candidates

with  a  Higher  School Certificate  or  equivalent

qualification will be eligible for admission to the

service.  For  the  first  three  years  after  its

introduction,  special provision is  made  for  the

entry  of  serving officers and the Public  Service

Commission has already advised the selection of 250

of these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey has been made of the administrative,

executive and clerical work of each department  and

an establishment of posts for the Executive Service

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



been drawn up. This is shown in Schedule A attached

to  the  Sessional  Paper. In  this  connection  it

should be noted that there has been no increase  in

the total number of posts in the establishment as a

result of the creation of the Executive Service. It

is  purely  a  matter of conversion.  331  existing

posts  will  be  converted into 8 Senior  Executive

Officer  posts, 89 Higher Executive  Officer  posts

and 234 Executive Officer posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to estimate exactly the cost of

implementing this scheme from the 1st  of  January,

the  date  which  has been agreed  with  the  Staff

Association,  but  it should be  of  the  order  of

$6,000,  and this can be met from savings.  In  the

circumstances,  token votes only  are  required  to

give legal sanction to the creation of the posts on

the  establishment of the Executive Service.  I  am

sure  hon.  Members will appreciate the advantages,

in  terms  of increased efficiency, of the creation

of the Executive Service and give it their support.

Sir, I beg to move.

give   legal  sanction  to  the  creation  of   the

establishment of the Executive Service.  I  realise

this  procedure is somewhat irregular, but it would

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $871,940 shall be supplied to the Government under the heads of expenditure and for the services

Paper No. Cmd. 6 of 1958.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as soon as the elections to the District

Councils have been held in the middle of this year,

three  District Councils will replace  the  present

Rural  Board  and will be entirely responsible  for

the  provision and maintenance of local  government

services in their own districts. This will  involve

the division of existing staff, equipment and votes

of  the  Rural  Board  between the  three  District

Councils and all necessary arrangements to this end

have  already  been  made,  so  that  the  District

Councils can assume full responsibility as soon  as

they  take  office. It will, however, also  involve

the   provision  of  additional  staff,  funds  and

equipment. Hon. Members have always been aware  of,

and have expressed their willingness to accept, the

fact  that  the development of local government  by

the  replacement  of the Rural  Board  by  District

Councils would, at least in the early stages of the

scheme,   result  in  increased  expenditure.   The

additional staff, funds and equipment which will be

required in 1958 are shown in the Schedule attached

to the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 2 is set out a list of the new posts which

will be required to enable the District Councils to

function properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendices A, B and C on pages 3 and 4 indicate

the  additional  funds  for recurrent  expenditure,

daily  paid  wages  and  equipment  which  will  be

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements for additional staff and

equipment have been examined with great care in the

Treasury,  and I can assure hon. Members that  they

have  been reduced to the minimum which we consider

essential for the task in hand. There has  been  no

'build-up'  or  extravagance in the compilation  of

the  estimates. The funds now sought will be  added

to  the  existing Rural Board votes and apportioned

in due course between the Councils along with these

votes.  Provision has been made for 9  months,  but

quite  obviously the total sum thus  provided  will

not  be  required. On the other hand, it is desired

to  recruit staff as soon as possible, so that they

can  be trained and experienced in their duties  by

the  time the new Councils are set up. I can assure hon.  Members that any savings which may   eventuate will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



not   be  used  for  other  purposes  without   the

authority of the Legislature. Next year, Sir,  each

District  Council  will have its own  estimates  on

what might be termed Rural Board lines. Sir, I  beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$3,150,024  shall  be supplied  to  the  Government

under the heads of expenditure and for the services

specified  in  the Schedule contained in  Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 9 of 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a fairly substantial message. It

involves a supplementary vote of over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



$2  million  for  the Ordinary Estimates  and  $1.7

million  for the Development Estimates.  These  may

seem  fairly large sums for one message but it must

be remembered that there has been no sitting of the

Assembly  since 8th January and that  the  work  of

Government must go on. Full explanations of all the

items  are  given in the message and my  colleagues

and  I  will be happy to amplify these explanations

if  this  is necessary. I should, however, like  to

draw  attention to one or two items of  outstanding

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with item 5, Sir, hon. Members will

note  with much regret that Dr Benham's  leave  of

absence from Chatham House expires in May. We  have

been   singularly  fortunate  in  having  had   the

services of such a distinguished economist  as  Dr

Benham for the past eighteen months, and I am  sure

I  will  be  speaking for all the Members  of  this

House  when  I  say  how  sorry  we  are  that  his

secondment cannot be extended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 6 to 19 make provision for the establishment

of  a  Rural Development Panel. Government has been

concerned for some time that the activities of  the

Government and other bodies in connection with  the

development  of  rural  areas  has  not  been   co-ordinated to the extent which they might have been.

This has not been due to any neglect on the part of

the authorities concerned but has resulted from the

fact  that  there  has been a  great  expansion  of

development  activity in the rural areas  over  the

past  two  years, and that attention has until  now

been  entirely concentrated on launching individual

schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has recently been considered by the

Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers  and

it  has  been decided that the best way to  achieve

the required degree of co-ordination is to set up a

development  panel with an official entitled  Rural

Development  Commissioner as the executive  officer

of  the  Panel. The task of this Panel will  be  to

plan  and  co-ordinate  development  in  the  rural

areas.  There will be a close liaison  between  the

Rural  Board and, later, the District Councils,  so

that  functions  of  the  various  bodies  do   not

overlap. Later when plans have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



been  worked  out in detail, the Assembly  will  be

asked  to  vote  such additional  sums  as  may  be

required. In this connection, however, an assurance

can  be  given  that  no money will  be  wasted  on

schemes which have not been considered in all their

implications. We have seen elsewhere the way  money

can   be   wasted   as  a  result  of   misdirected

enthusiasm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it is proposed to establish a close

liaison  between  the Government  and  the  farming

communities by the introduction of a small band  of

field  development or liaison officers  who,  after

training   in  the  Land  Office,  and   with   the

Veterinary,  Agriculture and Fisheries Departments,

will live among the farmers, pass on the advice  of

the  experts and inform Government of the needs  of

the various communities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 33 to 51, Sir, concern items required for

stepping  up of the war against tobacco  smugglers.

The  proximity  of  the Indonesian  islands  around

Singapore   encourages  smuggling,  and   we   have

evidence that certain of the ports in these islands

are  being  used as bases for smuggling operations.

Again,  the  great  developments which  have  taken

place  recently in outboard motors have  given  the

smugglers  far  more  efficient  means  of  running

contraband  than  they have ever  had  before.  The

increase  in tobacco duty has given added incentive

to the smugglers, who are now prepared to run great

risks  since the rewards of success are  so  great.

The  matter  is one of great importance  since  the

valuable  tobacco  revenue  is  in  danger.  It  is

difficult to say just how much is being lost at the

present time but from information at my disposal  I

estimate that it is about $2 million a year despite

all  the  efforts of the Customs Department.  Steps

are and must be taken to contain, and eventually to

eliminate,   smuggling.  It  is  not  a  short-term

problem; it is long-term. The incentive to  smuggle

will always be there as long as duty is imposed  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the policy of the preventive branch

of  the  Customs Department has been  revised.  All

available   men   are  deployed  on  anti-smuggling

patrols. Ship-building programmes have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



amended to provide faster small craft Use has  been

made  of  captured craft, which is a dangerous  and

not  very  satisfactory expedient. Now we  wish  to

carry  the  matter further and to obtain  funds  to

build  further small craft which are essential  for

close  pursuit in shallow waters, and for the staff

and equipment necessary to step up the campaign. At

a  later date I shall probably come forward with  a

proposal to divert funds already voted for a  large

launch, for the construction of still more launches

of  the Kilat class and also a radar station  on  a

strategic  island to control all the approaches  to

Singapore.  I trust that hon. Members will  support

all these proposals which I regard as essential  to

the  successful  prosecution  of  the  war  against

smugglers. At the same time I should like  to  take

this  opportunity to pay a further tribute  to  the

excellent work which the Customs officers are doing

night  in  and  night  out  in  all  weathers,   in

conditions  of extreme discomfort and sometimes  of

considerable personal danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any hon. Member would like to see the

Department at work, I shall be happy to arrange it.

It  is  a rewarding experience to see local Customs

officers  planning  each  night's  operations   and

carrying them out with great success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 68 deals with a project to which publicity

has   already   been  given  by  the  Ministry   of

Education. It represented a long-sighted policy the

immediate  aim of which is to give the  opportunity

for a secondary education to many of those who have

failed  to  gain admission to secondary schools.  I

have no doubt that my Hon. Friend the Minister will

be  only too willing to elaborate on the details of

the scheme if required to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 69 describes in some detail the arrangements

for  the  campaign for the gradual  elimination  of

tuberculosis  which is planned by  the  Government.

The scheme is based on proposals thought out by the

Ministry  of  Health, and examined and approved  by

Sir   Harry  Wunderley,  the  great  authority   on

tuberculosis  as a public health problem;  Due,  in

the   main  to  a  recommendation  of  Sir,   Harry

Wunderley,  we  have been fortunate to  obtain  the

promise of generous assistance under the Colombo



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



Plan from the Australian Government, whose interest

in  Singapore is well known and manifested in  many ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 93 seeks funds for the accelerated

implementation of Government's road  programme  for

the  rural  areas. I think that my Hon. Friend  the

Minister  for  Communications  and  Works,  who  is

acting for the Minister for Local Government, Lands

and Housing, will wish to speak on this item.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, Head 25

item  27  indicates  a  grant  of  $3,000  to   the

Badminton Association of Malaya in connection  with

the  preparations  for the Thomas Cup  Championship

which  will be held in Singapore next June. Sir,  I

have  looked  up the old Estimates to see  whether,

for the old Thomas Cup Competition, this Government

made   contributions  to  the  Singapore  Badminton

Association.  I  was unable to discover  any  grant

having been made to them. Why is it that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



are being asked to give a grant this time when they

were   able  in  past  years,  quite  rightly   and

properly, to carry on without a Government grant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It is indeed a fact, Sir, that hitherto

no   grant   has   been  given  to  the   Badminton

Association of Malaya in connection with the Thomas

Cup  trials. We did make a contribution  after  the

first   Thomas  Cup  expedition  to  England.   The

Association finished up with a deficit on the trip.

It  was  shared  between  the  Governments  of  the



Federation  of  Malaya and of  Singapore.  In  this

particular  case,  we received an application  from

the  President  of  the  Badminton  Association  of

Malaya.  He informed us that the training programme

would cost a considerable sum which he had to  bear

from  his  private  purse  in  previous  years.  He

appealed   to   both  Governments  to   make   some

contribution    towards    the    expense.    After

consultation  with  the Federation  Government,  we

each decided to make a contribution of $3,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is it really suggested that we

should  pay as much as the Federation?  Just  as  a

matter of principle, should we bear half the cost?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, the amount is really so small that

I  think  we can afford to make a token payment  of

$3,000, exactly the same as the Federation payment,

without  worrying too much about  the  question  of

more apportionment.

<div align="center"><b>COMPULSORY VOTING IN ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS</b></div>



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following motion stood in the name of Mr Lim Cher Kheng-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly holds the view that, with the

introduction of Singapore Citizenship by this

Assembly in its effort to secure the loyalty of

the people to this country, Singapore citizens

have a bounden duty to vote at elections held

under the provisions of the Singapore Legislative

Assembly Elections Ordinance (Chapter 53) to

ensure that the Legislative Assembly is fully

representative of the electorate; and calls upon

the Government to introduce legislation to provide

for compulsory voting in Legislative Assembly

elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, the reply from the Hon. the Chief Minister to

the debate on the Governor's Speech clearly

indicated that the Government is in favour of

compulsory voting. I take this to indicate also

that the Government will soon introduce legislation

in connection with-



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Point of order, Sir; the hon. Member has not moved his motion.

quick, Sir. - certain necessary provisos and make

this compulsory voting more workable. Therefore I

do not propose to take up more time of this House

just to debate this "hot" motion. Sir, I beg to

withdraw the motion standing in my name.

<div align="center"><b>ALLEGED ILL-TREATMENT OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DETAINEES BY POLICE</b></div>



<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise to move the motion standing

in my name, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly views with very grave concern

and alarm the repeated allegations of ill-treatment, by means of electric wires and cold

freezing treatments, of some persons detained

under the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance, 1955, by some officials of the

Singapore Police Force at the Central



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



Police Station, and, in view of the very serious

nature of these allegations, is of the opinion that

a Public Inquiry Commission, headed by a High Court

Judge with two or more independent and impartial

members of high standing and having public

confidence and respect, be set up forthwith to

inquire into and report on the truth or otherwise

of these allegations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving my motion, it brings my memory back

to the old days of the Japanese regime. During the

Japanese regime, everyone trembled at the word

Kempetai; that word was a very dangerous one during

the Japanese time. Today, we are supposed to live

in a world of freedom, and Singapore is considered

the most peaceful country in the East. But, Sir,

the Government, under the guise of the Preservation

of Public Security Ordinance, has made the people

fear it more than they feared the Kempetai during

the Japanese regime, because of the powers given to

the police under this Ordinance. Under this

Ordinance the people are frightened to death to

criticise either the Government or the police. How

can then a person develop his personality under

arbitrary detention without open trial?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse, apart from this, is that torture is

practised by the police on detained persons. Every

country or society must enact laws to protect

itself from criminals and other evil-doers; and in

order that such laws of the country are complied

with and maintained, Government has got to

introduce legislation to safeguard the interests of

all shades of people, be they coloured or

uncoloured. Such powers as arrest, search or

detention are given to the police, and as long as

these powers are properly exercised, they are the

safeguards of freedom and human rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, daily we experience or hear of many cases of

abuses of power by some officials of the police

force. It was only yesterday when two Bills were

introduced that we hear Members of this Assembly

criticise the abuses, or are afraid that the powers

given to the police may be abused. If such powers

given to the police are abused, then arbitrary rule

takes place. It leads to the hater Gestapo or

Kempetai rule and then the country becomes a police

state. Like the Japanese rule, Sir, false

confessions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



are   put  on  through  Kempetai  methods  and  the

Kempetai methods are nothing but torture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During peace-time, a man can be sent to prison for

the  crimes that he has committed in the past.  But

the   Government  cannot  detain  any  person   for

imaginary   offences  of  the   future   that   the

Government  expects  him to commit.  In  Singapore,

Sir,  there  is no civil war; there is no  national

war.  So we consider ourselves to be lucky to  live

in a world of paradise. Apart from how lucky we may

be,   Sir,  we  have  the  Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance, which is in fact forced  on  us

and passed by this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Ordinance, if the Governor in Council

is  satisfied that a person is acting in  a  manner

prejudicial  to  the security of the  country,  the

Chief  Secretary  shall  make  an  order  for   the

detention  of that person for any period,  but  not

exceeding two years. Such wide powers given by  the

Government  cannot  be carried  out  by  the  Chief

Secretary  alone. He is a single man and he  cannot

carry  out such orders single-handed. So the  Chief

Secretary  then  relies upon the police  force  and

calls upon the police force for the enforcement  of

these  rules, orders or instructions issued by  him

under   the   Preservation   of   Public   Security

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Ordinance, Sir, the rules, orders or

instructions made by him are not even published  in

the  Government Gazette for the information of  the

public.  Whatever is passed here  or  whatever  the

Government  does  is published  in  the  Government

Gazette, and that is what the Government Gazette is

for - for  the  information of the public.  But  such

things are not published in the Government Gazette.

So,  Sir, the handing over of this blank cheque  by

the  Chief Secretary has in some instances resulted

in very, very grave abuses of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of Lim Chin Joo, Goh Boon Toh, Tan

Bok  Teng and Tan Juat Seng. I understand that  the

grievances  or  complaints of these four  detainees

were  circulated to the majority of, if not to  all

the Members of this Assembly. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



with  the  complaints I understand that  a  medical

report  by  a  private practitioner  was  attached.

These  complaints of torture, Sir, are  very,  very

grave  abuses of the law and a threat to  our  very

existence. Police officers engaged in the detention

of  offenders should not be allowed to discard  the

detention skill, if they have any, and try  to  use

more  easy and tempting measures of torture to make

people  confess and so obtain the clues  that  they

want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a lawyer, Sir, but I am told by some

legal  friends  that  the law of  evidence  of  the

courts  provides  that  a  confession  made  by  an

accused person whilst in the custody of the  police

cannot  be admissible in a court of law. The object

of  this  law,  Sir,  is to safeguard  the  accused

person  from  being  subject  to  abuse  by  police

officers  for extortion and oppression to  get  the

information required. I have known quite a  lot  of

cases where the police often extort confessions, by

undue  influence  of  torture  and  oppression.  To

prevent such abuses, this law was enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, I cannot see how torture can be used to

obtain confessions. Are we, Sir, going back to  the

old  Japanese  regime,  when  we  feared  the  word

Kempetai? As I said earlier just now, Sir,  when  I

introduced this motion my memory brings me back  to

the  old, old days - 1942 to 1945. Now it appears  to

me,  Sir, that people, instead of fearing the  word

Kempetai,  fear the word P.P.S.O. - the  Preservation

of Public Security Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, even in this Ordinance I cannot find

the  word "torture" at all. I have gone through  it

and  there is not a single word which says torture.

Therefore,  Sir,  how  is it possible  that  brutal

methods, as alleged, have found their way into  the

administrative system? If the allegations are true,

then  there is no doubt of the inevitable  collapse

and destruction of our administrative machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever we may say, Sir, the vital issue before

us today is not of the torture. It is whether these

allegations  are true or not, whether they  are  in

fact true or not. In the case of Lim Chin Joo, Sir,

I understand he is the brother of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



Member  of  this Assembly who is now, I  think,  in

Changi Gaol with him. The allegations were made  by

Lim  Chin  Joo  on  oath before a  Commissioner  of

Oaths, and I think that they should be accepted.  I

understand, Sir, that a few days after he had sworn

to his complaint, he was removed to Changi Gaol.  I

presume  that it was only after his complaint  that

he  was  transferred to Changi Gaol.  Otherwise  he

might  be  confined in the Central  Police  Station

lock-up for more torture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed, Sir, that this detainee was

confined  in the Central Police Station  for  about

five-and-a-half  months  in  all.  Soon  after  his

arrest  he  was kept in the Central Police  Station

for  48  days.  The Chief Secretary said  yesterday

that  a  man cannot be detained for more  than  six

weeks,  which  is  only 42 days and  not  48  days.

During this period he was not questioned at all. If

the  police did not intend to question him, why did

the  police  confine  him in  that  Central  Police

Station  lock-up  for 48 days? The Chief  Secretary

told  us  yesterday,  while  introducing  the   two

amending Bills, that people are detained there  for

interrogation purposes. Then why was Lim  Chin  Joo

not questioned or interrogated at all?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, this appears to me a gross

disregard and misuse of the Preservation of  Public

Security Ordinance. Not satisfied with this initial

confinement of 48 days, he was again removed to the

Central  Police Station on 15th November last  year

from  Changi  Prison. There he was kept  until  the

11th  or 12th of last month-it was only last month,

Sir - a period from 15th November until that date  is

roughly about four months, to be precise, 116 days.

Why,  Sir, when the Chief Secretary said  a  person

can  only  be  confined for  six  weeks,  was  this

detainee  confined  in the first  instance  for  48 days?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon.

Member  for  Queenstown to confine  his  speech  to

facts more relevant to the motion, which appears to

be  allegations of treatment by means  of  electric

wires and cold-freezing treatment?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr

Deputy Speaker. I am just introducing my subject to

point  out  how  the  police confine  detainees  or

persons  in the Central Police Station for torture.

When  it comes to a certain stage or when it  comes

to  the right time, I have documents with me  which

refer to torture and freezing treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total period during which this detainee was

confined in the Central Police Station was, in  the

first  instance,  as I said, 48  days.  The  second

instance was 116 days, making a total of 164  days,

which  is  roughly  five-and-a-half  months.   This

discloses a shockingly long period for carrying out

investigations. In the normal course of events, the

police  cannot  detain a person for  more  than  24

hours  unless ordered by a court of law. Under  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance,  section

17 (3), a detainee can be confined in a police lock-up  for  about  16  days, 24  hours  in  the  first

instance  and  another  24  hours  in  the   second

instance, and then after investigation if the Chief

Secretary is not satisfied, another 14 days. I will

read the relevant section:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Section 17 (3). No person shall be detained under

the  provisions  of  this section  f  or  a  period

exceeding   twenty-four  hours  except   with   the

authority of a police officer of or above the  rank

of  Assistant  Superintendent of Police  or  for  a

period of 48 hours in all:"-



<br><br>which means a detainee can only be confined for  48 hours-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that if an officer of or above the rank

of  Superintendent of Police is satisfied that  the

necessary enquiries cannot be completed within  the

aforesaid  period of 48 hours he may authorise  the

further  detention of such person for an additional

period  not  exceeding fourteen days and  shall  on

giving  such  authorisation  forthwith  report  the

circumstances to the Commissioner of Police."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this section a detainee can only be

allowed  to be confined for 16 days, but the  Chief

Secretary  told us it is six weeks. I do  not  know

how he gets his six weeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this section, Sir, you can now note that, as

I just said, it is for 48 hours in the first place,

then  another  14  days.  When  he  was  originally

arrested on 22nd August, 1957, he was confined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



in  the Central Police Station lock-up for about 48

days, then for four months, making a total of five-and-a-half months.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I feel obliged to

remind  the  hon.  Member for Queenstown  that  the

wording of his motion reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly views with very grave concern

and   alarm  the  repeated  allegations   of   ill-treatment,  by  means of electric wires  and  cold-freezing treatments."



<br><br>All we have heard so far have been certain sections

of  the  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance,

nothing  touching upon the wording of  the  motion.

May  I  once  again, therefore, ask the Member  for

Queenstown to confine his speech to the wording  of

his motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Again I am much obliged to you,

Mr Deputy Speaker. My motion is closely related to

this Ordinance, the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance.  It  refers to four detainees  who  were

arrested  under  this Ordinance,  and  I  think  in

introducing   my   motion  I   should   bring   the

preliminary in - what this Ordinance is and how those

detainees  were arrested under it. Unless  I  quote

the  section  under  this Ordinance,  there  is  no

indication  of how the detainees were arrested  and

why  they were arrested. That is why I have got  to

quote  this  Ordinance before I come to the  actual

torture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, he was confined there for five-and-a-half months. Where then is the legal and moral

justification for this detainee to be  confined  in

the  Central  Police Station for nearly five-and-a-half  months? Is this not abuse of the  application

of  section  17  (3)  of the  Ordinance?  The  only

conclusion  is  that  the Chief  Secretary  or  the

police force took the law into their own hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am under the impression that the Chief Secretary

may  no  doubt  seek his legal justification  under

section  12  of this Ordinance. For information,  I

will read section 12 now, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"12.-(1) The Chief Secretary may by order direct

the  removal from any place of detention to another

place of detention to be specified in such order of

any person detained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



in  pursuance  of the provisions of this  Ordinance

and  may by arrangement with the Government of  the

Federation  of  Malaya direct the removal  of  such

persons  to  the Federation of Malaya to  be  there

detained"-



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Point of

order,  Sir; may I enquire what provisions  or  how

the   provisions  of  the  Ordinance  relating   to

removals from Malaya are relevant to the motion now

before this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have already reminded the

Member  for  Queenstown  that  what  he  has   been

speaking   on - referring   to   sections   of    the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance - does  not

appear  to me so far to be relevant to the  wording

of  the motion. I once more ask him to confine  his

speech to matters relevant to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, as I have said, this is

closely  related to the Ordinance but since  it  is

your  ruling  that I should confine myself  to  the

wording  of  the  motion, I will now  come  to  the

"torture" part of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, the majority of the

Members  of  this Assembly have received complaints

from  Mr Lim Chin Joo. To those have not,  I  will

read  extracts of the affidavit filed  by  Mr  Lim

Chin  Joo  and  signed  in  the  presence  of   the

Commissioner  of  Oaths,  and  this  is  where  the

"torture" part comes in:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On or about the 15th day of November, 1957, I was

removed  to  the Central Police Station lockup.  On

the following day the 16th of November, 1957, I was

ordered to leave my cell and was taken to Room  No.

6  (the interrogation room). I was ordered to stand

in  front of a fully opened air-conditioner and  to

place  both  my  hands on the said plant.  At  this

time, I was with a bare body from waist upwards. It

was  extremely cold and it was beyond my endurance.

Shortly afterwards, cold water was brought  in  and

sprinkled  over my back and front chest. This  form

of torture"-



<br><br>Now, the word "torture" is there - "lasted for about 20 minutes." [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> "Soon after, I was handcuffed

and my hands were placed behind me and fastened  to

a  chair.  Thereafter, electric wires were  applied

all over my body including my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



private  parts - in the medical term "glans  penis".

At  this  time, I was blindfolded with a  piece  of

cloth  and I was unable to see the perpetrators  of

this electric shock treatment. The cold torture  as

stated  in  paragraph 4 herein [which  in  fact  is

paragraph 2 as I have just read] was repeated to be

followed by the same electric shock torture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two forms of torture were alternately

perpetrated  on me. I was blindfolded whenever  the

electric shock tortures were applied on me. In all,

I  was  subject to the cold torture twice  and  the

electric  shock torture was applied four  times  on

the  same day and these alternate forms of  torture

lasted for about two hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 18th day of November, 1957, some five to

six  persons entered my room. I was slapped  a  few

times by some of them. I was ordered to take off my

shirt  in  front  of the air-conditioner  and  cold

water  was brought in. It was sprinkled on my  body

and poured on my head. This cold torture lasted for

about  15 minutes. I reported the torture inflicted

on  me  to  the prison doctor when he came  on  his

rounds on the same day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or about the 20th day of November, 1957, my

father came on his weekly visit and I reported  the

aforesaid  tortures to him and told  my  father  to

report this matter to my solicitor. After my father

had  left, I was taken into the interrogation  room

by  a  police officer and was ordered to  stand  in

front  of  the air-conditioner without a shirt  for

about  15 minutes. Then I was taken to my cell.  On

the same day, at about 2 p.m., I was again asked to

come  out from my cell by a police official. I  was

ordered to stand before the air-conditioner.  About

five  persons  were present at this time.  I  stood

before  the fully opened air-conditioner for  about

10  minutes.  I  was told that my former  solicitor

wished  to  interview me. I was taken back  to  the

C.I.D. interview room. There I lodged a  complaint

to my solicitor and also reported the tortures to a

private  medical practitioner who was also  present

in  the C.I.D. interview room at this time. Exhibit

marked `A' is a copy of the medical report made  by

the  private  medical  practitioner.  The  exhibits

marked `B' and `C' are copies of letters sent by my

former  solicitor to the Director of Special Branch

and to the Chief Minister of Singapore."



<br><br>This  is  what  Mr Lim Chin Joo has  filed  in  an

affidavit  in  the presence of the Commissioner  of

Oaths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most agonising and monstrous part of the

allegations,  as  I  have just read  out,  was  the

electric  current applied, amongst other  parts  of

his  body, on his private parts. Is that fair, Sir?

Members can refer to the doctor's report,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



copies  of  which,  as  I  said,  have  been

circulated  to quite a number of Members.  I  would

like  to  read the medical report but some  of  the

medical  terms are not familiar to me but  for  the

information of Members, I will say that the  report

was  made  out  by  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh  (L.M.S.).

International Dispensary Limited, 4-6 Hill  Street,

Singapore,  6, Tel. No. 36550: "Medical  Report  of

Mr  Lim  Chin  Joo, Date, 20.11.57 at  2.40  p.m.,

Place, C.I.D., Complained that he was shocked  with

electric   current - wire  attached   to   battery - on

16.10.57  at  about 10 am. Examination,  amongst  a

number  of items, No. 6-glans penis". This  is  the

medical report to which I have just referred. Is it

not,  Sir, inhuman and most barbaric that this form

of   torture   was  practised  on  a  detainee?   I

understand  from an expert scientist  that  current

treatment  is  more receptive if  applied  after  a

certain degree of coldness. This I believe  is  the

reason  why  Lim  Chin Joo was given  the  electric

shock  treatment after the cold treatment. As  soon

as  practical, this detainee reported, the tortures

inflicted on him to the prison doctor when he  came

on  his  rounds, as I have just read out.  Then  he

complained  again to his father and then  from  his

father  to his lawyer. After his lawyer, a  private

doctor was then summoned. Now in one of the letters

sent  by  Mr  Lim  Chin Joo's  lawyer  dated  27th

November,  1957 addressed to the Director,  Special

Branch,  C.I.D.,  it quotes all  these  things.  It

quotes  that Lim Chin Joo did not wish  to  proceed

with  an  identification parade asked for  earlier.

The  Hon. the Chief Secretary may like to know  why

this   detainee   refused  to  proceed   with   the

identification  parade.  How  could,  Sir,  a   man

identify any person when he was blindfolded  (as  I

just  read  out) at the time when he was  tortured?

There   are  many  other  reasons.  In  the   first

instance, he may still be under police custody  and

is   afraid  that  if  he  really  identifies   the

assailants concerned, he may be subjected  to  more

tortures.  Apart from this, the investigation  into

these  allegations was carried out  by  the  police

officers themselves who are, in fact, an interested

party. Could an interested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



party   carry   out   an  impartial   investigation

especially when their own reputation is  at  stake?

This  again  may be one of the factors.  Again,  it

will  seen, Sir, from paragraph 5 of Mr  Lim  Chin

Joo's  complaint,  that he was blindfolded.  Is  it

possible,  may I stress again, for  a  man  who  is

blindfolded  and  cannot see anything  to  identify anybody?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will be surprised to know that in the

case of Mr Goh Boon Toh, it is entirely different.

I  understand  that he asked for an  identification

parade but in asking for this identification parade

it  was refused by the police. Now, Sir, in view of

this,  you may say in one case that the man refused

to  identify  but  in  this case  it  is  just  the

opposite.   Mr   Goh  Boon  Toh   asked   for   an

identification parade but the police  refused  him.

Would  it serve any purpose, Sir, for a man to  ask

for an identification parade when it is refused?  I

understand  that Tan Bok Teng and  Tan  Juat  Seng,

another two of the detainees, had an identification

parade  and  in  fact  identified  three  of  their

assailants.  What  action has  been  taken  by  the

Government? Nothing at all! So would it  serve  any

purpose of having an identification parade  of  the

police officers themselves when action is not taken

against those identified? Sir, the only way now  to

restore  the  confidence  of  the  people   is   to

ascertain   the   truth  or  otherwise   of   these

allegations through an independent Tribunal.  As  I

said, you cannot say whether they are true or  not.

So  the  vital issue that is facing us  is  whether

they  are true or not and if we want to be  sincere

about wanting to know whether they are true or not,

let  us  throw  it open to a public  Commission  of

Inquiry. When the facts come up, it is then  up  to

that  Commission to say whether they  are  true  or

not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have before us complaints of torture by four

detainees - a barbaric form of torture,  I  may  say.

How  can  every one who is considered an honourable

Member  in  this House ignore such complaints?  All

these  complaints are of a very, very grave nature.

Can we ignore such complaints?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Goh Boon Toh, I understand that at

the  time  when  he was tortured, he was  suffering

from T.B. Whether this allegation again is true  or

not,  I do not know but now when a man is suffering

from  T.B. and is subjected to electric  and  cold

freezing  torture,  is this not barbaric?  Is  this

fair, may I ask the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here a society that is called the Society

for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Are these

detained  people  to  be  treated  far  worse  than

animals? So the policy of the Government as regards

the  Society  for  the  Prevention  of  Cruelty  to

Animals  is just nothing but a window-dressing.  We

might  as  well  close down that society  if  human

beings are treated far worse than animals. We  have

read,  Sir,  of cruelty to dogs in the local  press

when  the  Russians sent a dog into outer space  in

their  Sputnik  II.  It  received  the  widest   of

publicity  and, if my memory serves me right,  Sir,

the President of the Canine Welfare Association who

is  now a City Councillor immediately sent a  cable

to Russia protesting against the cruelty to the dog

concerned.  Is  there no one in Singapore  who  can

champion the cause of human beings at least?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of Goh Boon Toh, he did not

complain  of electric torture because  he  was  not

subjected to it. His complaint was only of the cold

treatment. Again for the information of  those  who

have  not received copies, I will read extracts  of

his  complaint. This is not as long as the previous

one:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are instructed that during interrogation, one

of  the  Special  Branch officials  whom  the  said

detainee  could identify hit him several  times  on

his  head  and  another official placed  his  index

finger  around the region of the throat and pressed

his finger hard for about six to seven minutes.  At

this stage, he could hardly breathe.".

Was  the  police officer trying to choke  and  kill

him?  It is better to kill him outright rather than

to allow him suffer such torture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next day interrogation commenced at about 9

am,  and was conducted by the same officials as the

previous day together with another new officer. One

of  the interrogation officers was alleged to  have

told  the said detainee, "I am going to put you  to talk"-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



which means that he was trying to force it on him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to put you to talk and unless you

talk,  I  will  put  you into  that  freezing  cold

chamber."



<br><br>Is  this  not oppression? Is this not using  force?

What else can we call it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soon after the police officer's threat of a

freezingly  cold  plant he asked  the  detainee  to

embrace the said extremely cold plant. The detainee

was  again  ordered to take off his shirt  but  was

allowed to have his trousers on."



<br><br>Lucky enough!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was bare from his waist upwards. While the

detainee  was  embracing the  cold  plant,  another

officer poured cold water on his back. This  prison

torture in the cold room lasted for about one hour.

While  this  prison operation was in  process,  two

officers  who  were standing on each  side  of  the

detainee pressed their fingers on both sides of his

ribs for some time."



<br><br>This  time  they  were not choking him.  They  were trying to dig between his ribs!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The detainee complained to us that the cold was

humanly  unbearable  and  this  coupled  with   the

continuous pressing on the sides of the  ribs  made

the   detainee  to  lose  consciousness.   He   was

unconscious after such treatment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of the two detainees, Tan Bok

Teng and Tan Juat Seng, their complaints of torture

have  also  aroused the politicians in  the  United

Kingdom, it  is rather surprising how  the  United

Kingdom  came  to  know about  it.  Questions  were

tabled in the House of Commons by Mr Awberry,  who

I  understand is a Member of Parliament and belongs

to   the  Labour  Party,  in  connection  with  the

tortures  experienced by these two detainees.  Such

Members of Parliament, are, in fact, socialists.  I

would  like to quote, Sir, from the Hansard of  the

House of Commons of 30th January, 1958, column 510:





<br><br><div align="center">"SINGAPORE</div>

<div align="center">Detainees (Inquiry)</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Awberry asked the Secretary of State for  the Colonies  under  whose auspices the recent  inquiry

into  the allegations of ill-treatment by Tan  Juat

Seng  and  Tan Bok Teng was held; against whom  the

allegations  were  made; how many members  composed

the committee of inquiry; and how many of them were

members of the police department of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Profumo: The inquiry into the allegations  by

these  detainees that they had been ill-treated  by

members of the Singapore police was ordered by  the

Commissioner   of   Police   [which    means    the

Commissioner  of  Police ordering a  Commission  of

Inquiry  and using his own department with his  own

reputation at stake]. It was conducted by the  head

of the administration section of the special branch

of  the  Singapore  Police, and  its  results  were

considered  by  the  Commissioner  of  Police,  the

Attorney-General,  the  Chief  Minister   and   the

Governor, who all endorsed its conclusion that  the

allegations were not substantiated."



<br><br>How  could  the  Commissioner of  Police  order  an

inquiry within his own department and, what is more

worse, the Special Branch of the police force, when

they  themselves were the persons who arrested  the

detainees?  Are they prepared to give a  report  to

the  Commissioner  of Police or  to  the  House  of

Commons that they committed such tortures?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Awberry: Is the Minister telling us that  the

people who are accused were the people who acted as

judges in this case?"



<br><br>That  is what Mr Awberry asked. Is it not  a  fair

question?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If so, is he aware that not only have we to do

justice  but to show clearly that justice is  being

done,  and that that cannot be done if the  accused

are  the  people who are to act as  judges  in  the case."



<br><br>That  means  the judges are the accused persons  or

the  accused  persons are the judges. What  purpose

does that serve then? [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> As I said, Mr Awberry is a

socialist  and  it  has  not  only  interested  Mr

Awberry  but it has also interested quite a  number

of trade union organisations in the United Kingdom.

A  letter of protest signed by the Chairman of  the

Movement   for   Colonial  Freedom,   London   Area

Council - that  is what we are asking  for,  colonial

freedom - together  with  endorsements  by  19  trade

union organisations in the United Kingdom was  sent

to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Rt.

Hon.  Mr  Alan Lennox-Boyd. Now, Sir, if this  has

not  aroused any interest, why then should 19 trade

union organisations send a letter of protest to the

Secretary  of  State? I will read  that  letter  of

protest if Members will permit me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



It  is  from  the  Movement for  Colonial  Freedom,

London  Area Council, written to the Rt.  Hon.  Mr

Alan  Lennox-Boyd (the Secretary of State  for  the

Colonies),  Great  Smith, S.W.1.,  dated  20th  Feb

ruary, 1958:



<br><br>"Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We protest against the refusal of the Singapore

authorities to hold an inquiry into allegations  of

torture  carried  out by police officials  in  that

Colony. The Secretary of State for the Colonies and

Parliament in the United Kingdom holds the ultimate

responsibility  for  affairs in  Singapore  and  we

therefore  request  you  to initiate  an  impartial

inquiry  into allegations that the police  tortured

two detainees Tan Bok Teng and Tan Juat Seng during

last September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with this request, we would draw

your  attention  to  Article  V  of  the  Universal

Declaration  of Human Rights as laid  down  in  the

Charter of the United Nations which states, `No one

shall  be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman

or degrading treatment or punishment.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further we wish to place on record our whole-hearted opposition to the use of emergency power

whether  in  Singapore  or in  any  other  colonial

territory.  We  request  a  fair  public  trial  or

immediate  release of all detainees and an  end  to

all  oppressive  legislation  such  as  that  which

permits detention and banishment without trial  and

the   suppression   of  trade  unions   and   other

organisations."



<br><br>This letter is supported by 19 union organisations.

It  would take too long for me to read their  names out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if these cases of torture have aroused the

United  Kingdom  Government  and  the  trade  union

movement  in  the  United  Kingdom,  what  has  the

governing  Party here done? The governing Party - the

Labour  Front - claims to be a socialist Party.  What

has  it  done to look into the interests  of  these

four  detainees about their complaints of  torture?

Again, Sir, what have the Liberal-Socialists  done,

or  is  the word "Socialists" only attached to  the

name  of that Party? Why call yourselves socialists

when  you do not have that socialist policy? Again,

Sir,  what  has the leader of the P.A.P. done?  The

P.A.P. is in fact-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He happens to be the lawyer who acted for the persons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Oh, good, we can get better information then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He knows more about it than you do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> P.A.P. is considered a Leftist

Party.  A  Leftist Party, I think, is  a  socialist

Party. I do not know whether that is correct or not

and  if that is so, what has the P.A.P. done? Apart

from  these so-called socialist Parties,  what  has

the trade union movement in Singapore done? Nothing

at  all.  This is a matter which is of  very  grave

concern. Apart from the socialist Parties here, the

trade  union movement which claims to champion  the

cause of workers has also done nothing. I can  only

hope,  Sir, that all the trade unions in  Singapore

together with the so-called socialist Parties  will

rally  round this cause because these are startling

allegations. To those of us who have lived  through

the  four years of Japanese or Kempetai rule,  this

reminds us of similar ill-treatment by the Japanese warlords.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, whether all these

allegations are true or otherwise, I feel that I am

not competent to say so. I am not a lawyer; neither

do  I  know the actual facts of the cases.  What  I

have  now  quoted are all on paper and  from  these

papers,  I make up my case. I consider it  my  duty

that  I  should  table this motion  and  bring  the

matter before this House. Sir, if these allegations

are  untrue, then it is all the more necessary that

Government  should hold this Commission of  Inquiry

forthwith  to  tell  the world and  the  people  of

Singapore that all these allegations are, in  fact,

untrue.  It  is  far  more necessary  if  they  are

untrue. If they are true, then keep quiet. It is no

use,  Sir, just refuting and refuting on paper that

they  are  not  true. As I said,  if  you  are  not

prepared  to hold that Commission of Inquiry,  that

will  clearly indicate that those allegations  are,

to  a  certain extent, true and that  that  is  the

reason  why  you  are  not  prepared  to  hold  the

Commission  of Inquiry. The Commission  of  Inquiry

which  I  am  asking for should be  an  independent

one - not consisting again of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



police  officers  or  Commissioners  of  Police  or

anybody  attached to the Special Branch. Only  when

this  Commission of Inquiry is held and  the  facts

and  report given, will we then be able  to  decide

and  say whether these allegations are true or not.

In  the name of humanity and social justice, I hope

that  all Members in this House will give me  their

fullest support in adopting my motion and whilst  I

ask for the adoption of this motion I would like to

add that the terms of reference be extended so that

such  Inquiry  will also be able to  hear  evidence

from  those  persons  arrested  by  detectives  and

brought to police stations or to the C.I.D. I  have

heard many cases where persons have been brought in

for no reason and assaulted by detectives or police

officers. Again whether this is true or not, I have

not   seen   for  myself  but  there  are  numerous

complaints  and when we do have this Commission  of

Inquiry,  I hope that the terms of reference  would

also include such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise to second the  motion.  The

mover  of  the motion has put the case  clearly  in

every  detail with dates, facts and figures.  I  do

not think that I have more to add except one point.

There  were accusations levelled against the police

force  even  in  this Assembly  that  they  are  an

inefficient lot, but at least in the detention camp

they are doing an excellent job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Member for Queenstown who moved this motion  had  a

considerable  amount to say about the  Preservation

of  Public  Security Ordinance. I do  not  want  to

follow  him  on that but I would only say  that  my

Hon, friend  the Chief Minister has already  given

ample  grounds for the existence of that  Ordinance

and its provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will however, if you will bear with me, Sir,

refer  to  two points regarding which I  think  the

hon. Member was under a mis-apprehension. The first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



was  his reference to the right to detain a  person

after  his arrest for a maximum period of 16  days.

That is correct but that is the right of the police



to  hold  the  man  for up to  16  days  without  a

detention order having been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also stated, Sir, that I had replied to a

Question  yesterday to the effect that no detainees

had  been kept for questioning for a period  longer

than  six  weeks. I am afraid he must have misheard

me  on  that  because I did inform him  that  in  a

number  of  cases,  they had been  detained  for  a

longer  period. In the particular case to which  he

referred,  the  main  reason  why  the  period  was

prolonged  to that extent was because  a  complaint

was made and inquiries had to be conducted into the

complaint before anything further could be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member finished his introductory

speech  by saying that he was not competent to  say

whether  these allegations were true or  false  but

the whole of his speech was based on the assumption

that they were true and the picture he drew was one

which  I  think must have stirred the  emotions  of

everybody  but it has validity only  if  there  are

grounds  for  thinking that these  allegations  are

true  and therefore, Sir, I do submit to the  House

that this motion stands or falls by the question of

whether   or   not  these  allegations   have   any

substance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a full inquiry was conducted into each of the

allegations made in these four cases and I  propose

to  detail  to  hon. Members the results  of  these

investigations but before I do so, I would like  to

make  one or two preliminary observations. Firstly,

Sir,  this  motion  does constitute  a  very  grave

reflection not only on the police but also  on  all

the  other  officers including the Attorney-General

and  the  Chief  Minister who have been  associated

with  accepting or rejecting the results  of  these

investigations. It is therefore a matter  of  great

public importance that this Assembly should address

itself   to  the  subject  of  this  motion   quite

objectively  and  impartially  and  not  allow  its

judgment to be in any way swayed by emotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation I should like to make, Sir, is that these allegations are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



made  against  individual  police  officers,  those

whose duty it has been to question the detainees on

the   dates   when   it  is  alleged   that   these

malpractices took place. Neither in the allegations

nor elsewhere is there any evidence associating any

other  police  officers with the behaviour  alleged

and  any attempt to extend the accusations to  hold

any particular section of the force responsible can

only  be  a matter of inference and I suggest  that

hon.  Members should reflect very carefully  before

considering that any such inference is justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, thirdly, Sir, to refer to the

procedure    followed   in   investigating    these

complaints.  It  has  been suggested  by  the  hon.

Member  that  there is something  improper  and  in

itself  a cause for disquiet that the investigation

into  these complaints has been conducted by police

officers.  This suggestion, Sir, is,  in  my  view,

wholly    misconceived.   Wherever   and   whenever

complaints or allegations are made that a crime has

been  committed, whether the person  accused  is  a

member  of  the  public or a member of  the  police

force,  it is the duty of the police to investigate

the  complaint. That is one of their functions  and

there  is  no other organisation charged with  that

duty.  The  investigating officer takes  statements

from  all the persons concerned and from any others

who   might  have  knowledge  of  the  fact.  These

statements  and  his  report  are,  in  appropriate

cases,  forwarded to the Attorney-General who  then

decides   in  his  capacity  as  Public  Prosecutor

whether  a  charge  should be brought  against  any

person. If the complaint concerns the behaviour  of

a  member  of the police force and it appears  from

the  investigation that there has been a breach  of

discipline, then it is the duty of the Commissioner

to  decide whether disciplinary proceedings  should

be  initiated.  This  is the  procedure  which  was

followed  in  investigating  these  complaints  and

whatever  hon.  Members  may  feel  regarding   the

substance - the   truth   or   falsehood    of    the

complaints - I do ask them to put out of their  minds

any suggestion that there was something abnormal or

sinister about the procedure adopted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in detailing the results of these

investigations,  I  shall  be  referring   to   the

Government  Medical Officer and I  should  like  to

explain   now   that   the   Medical   Officer   is

specifically charged with the duty of seeing  every

detainee who is temporarily confined in the Central

Police  Station every working day. Wherever he  may

be when the Medical Officer makes his rounds, he is

seen  by the Medical Officer. This arrangement  has

been made not only to ensure that the health of the

detainees  is  properly looked after  but  also  to

guard against any malpractices of the type alleged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to deal in detail with the

four  cases  in which these allegations  have  been

made.  Two  of these were brought to the notice  of

the Hon. the Chief Minister by a letter from a firm

of  lawyers dated 25th September last year. In  the

first   case,  it  was  alleged  that  while  being

questioned  on  18th  September - that  was  a   week

previously  - the  detainee had  been  tied  up  and

punched,   that   the  police  officers   concerned

administered   some  tablets  and   that   he   had

complained  of  the assault to the Medical  Officer

when  he  saw  him the following day.  The  Medical

Officer confirmed that the complaint of assault had

been  made  to  him that day and on  examining  the

detainee he had found three minor contusions.  This

finding  had  been reported the  same  day  to  the

Assistant  Superintendent in charge who  questioned

the   detainee   on  how  he  had  acquired   these

contusions  to  which the reply was that  they  had

resulted  from a bout of horseplay with  a  fellow-detainee.  On  26th September, the  day  after  the

lawyer wrote, a private practitioner was brought in

by  the  lawyer to examine both detainees.  In  the

case  of the first detainee, he reported finding  a

few  abrasions on the left forearm and right wrist.

In  the  course of the investigations, a  statement

was  taken from this detainee in which he said that

he had also been assaulted on 22nd August - that was

the previous month - and that he had on that occasion

been  subjected to electric shocks. He was in  fact

examined by the Medical Officer on 23rd August - that

is the day following this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



first  alleged assault - and the Medical Officer  had

found no trace of any injury of any kind and it  is

also  to be noted that neither in his complaint  to

the  Medical Officer on 19th September nor  in  his

complaint  to his lawyer on 23rd September  did  he

make any mention of this alleged electric treatment

unless  the lawyer did not see fit to pass  it  on.

This, Sir, seems a very strange omission. Following

the  lawyer's complaint, a statement was taken from

the  second detainee concerned. In this, he alleged

that  he had been subjected to assault and electric

shock on six occasions. One of these was alleged to

have  been  29th August and he made a complaint  to

the  Medical Officer the following day. The Medical

Officer  examined him and again found no  signs  of

any  injury to support the allegation. When he  was

examined   by  a  private  practitioner   on   26th

September - that   is  about  a   month   later   and

subsequent to the further alleged assault  on  19th

September - the  doctor  reported  that  some   small

healing  scabs were found on various parts  of  his

body. It was alleged in his complaint to his lawyer

that   this  assault  had  taken  place   on   19th

September.  The Medical Officer has testified  that

on  that day he visited this detainee while he  was

being   questioned  and  that  he  noticed  nothing

abnormal. He added in his statement that if  anyone

were  in pain or fear he was sure that he would  be

able to detect it from his expression and would  at

once question him. At an identification parade, the

detainee picked out certain police officers whom he

alleged  had  assaulted him. These were  among  the

officers   who   had  questioned   him   but   they

emphatically denied the allegations of assault.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third case, the detainee alleged that on 16th November, he was made to take his shirt off

and  stand over an air-conditioner while cold water

was  poured down his back. He also alleged that  he

was subjected to electric shock. Two days later, he

complained  to  the  Medical Officer  who  found  a

number of scratches on different parts of his body.

The  Medical  Officer reported the matter  and  the

senior  officer thereupon interviewed the  detainee the same day and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



asked  him  if he had been assaulted  to  which  he

replied,  "No". On 20th November - that is  two  days

later - his lawyer arranged for him to be examined by

a  private  practitioner. The report  made  by  the

latter - and  this is the report to  which  the  hon.

Member referred - stated that tiny linear scab  marks

were visible on a number of parts of his body.  The

following  day, he was examined by two  specialists

at  the Department of Pathology in the presence  of

his  own  private doctor who confirmed the findings

of  the private doctor. They also reported that the

nail  of his left little finger showed an irregular

free  margin  about 1½ millimetres long  while  the

nails on all the other fingers were cut down to the

base.   Their   conclusions  in   regard   to   the

lesions - that is the scab marks - were that they  were

deliberately  inflicted but  that  they  could  not

exclude  the  possibility  either  that  they  were

caused in the manner alleged or that they were self-inflicted.  Two days later, the lawyers wrote  that

they wished to lay a formal complaint and asked for

an  identification parade. Despite  what  the  hon.

Member  said  in  regard to Lim Chin  Joo  and  his

inability to identify the persons responsible,  his

lawyers   were   instructed   to   ask    for    an

identification  parade. This  parade  was  arranged

three  days later. Just before it was to  be  held,

the  detainee said he did not wish to proceed  with

the  matter  and  was not prepared  to  attend  the

parade.  He was then asked whether he would  attend

the  parade in order to assist the police  inquiry.

He  declined  to  do so and the following  day  his

lawyers   wrote  confirming  that  they  had   been

instructed not to proceed with the matter  for  the

time  being  adding that if further  assaults  took

place  he  would wish to proceed on this  complaint

also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint in the fourth case was made in a

letter  from  the  detainee's  lawyers  dated  25th

November.  In  this  it was  alleged  that  on  5th

November  while this detainee was being  questioned

he  had been assaulted and that on 6th November - the

following  day - he was made to stand over  the  air-conditioning plant while cold water was poured down his back and extreme pressure was applied



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



to  his  ribs. It was further alleged in the letter

that  he  lost consciousness and that a doctor  was

called  in  who  gave him four tablets  to  relieve

pain.  In  a  subsequent  statement,  the  detainee

somewhat modified this story by stating that he did

not  lose consciousness. He also stated that it was

immediately after he had had cold water poured down

his back that he was instructed to sit down, to put

on  his shirt and to leave the room. He stated that

he  did  so  and  met the Medical  Officer  in  the

passage  outside. I mention this point specifically

because the Medical Officer has testified that when

he  examined him his skin was absolutely dry and so

were  his  clothes. It is inconceivable  that  they

could have dried off in such a short space of time.

The  Medical  Officer's evidence in  this  case  is

this; that he made his usual rounds on this day and

visited this detainee in the interrogation room. He

did  not  meet him in the passage. He says that  he

saw  nothing abnormal in the room. The detainee was

fully  clothed  and fully conscious  sitting  on  a

chair.  He noticed however symptoms in the detainee

which  pointed to tuberculosis and he  gave  orders

for  him  to  be  brought to his examination  room.

There he examined him alone; no one else was in the

room. The detainee made no complaint of any assault

or  ill-treatment. As a result of his  examination,

the  Medical  Officer ascertained  that  he  had  a

history of tuberculosis and had previously attended

the  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital for  treatment.  The

Medical Officer then sent him to hospital to be  X-rayed but before doing so gave him four sulphatriad

tablets  to protect him against secondary infection

of  the  lungs. This is the origin of the story  of

the  tablets  to relieve pain. The Medical  Officer

also stated that he found no marks on his body such

as  would  have been apparent if his ribs had  been

constricted in the manner alleged. The detainee was

subsequently asked why he made no complaint of ill-treatment  to the Medical Officer at that  time  or

later to the Medical Officer at Changi where he was

transferred two days later. He said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



that  he  was  afraid to complain  to  the  Medical

Officer  at that time because the door of the  room

was  ajar  and  there was a police  officer  within

earshot.  The statement that the door was  open  is

specifically contradicted both by the  officer  who

conducted  him  to  the room  and  by  the  Medical

Officer  who states that he himself shut  the  door

for  the very purpose that the detainee should  not

be  inhibited from talking freely to him. In  reply

to  the  question why he had not complained to  the

Medical  Officer at Changi, the detainee said  that

he  did  make a complaint. This statement is denied

by the Medical Officer concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those, Sir, are the salient facts in the four

cases in which these allegations have been made. In

every   case,   the   police   officers   concerned

categorically deny that any such ill-treatment took

place. I should also add that while they are  being

questioned, constant visits are made to the room by

senior  officers  at irregular intervals  and  they

have  never  observed any treatment of  the  nature

alleged.  These  cases were, as I  have  explained,

very  fully  investigated and the  results  of  the

investigations  were  submitted  to  the  Attorney-General who decided that there were no grounds  for

proceeding   on   the  complaints.   The   question

naturally  poses  itself: if these allegations  are

unfounded, why were they made? The answer, Sir,  is

I  suggest to be found in the activities with which

these persons have been associated. They have every

incentive to try and discredit the police  who  are

striving  to  counter the subversive activities  of

themselves and those working with them.  They  also

have  every incentive to avoid being questioned  on

these  activities  and  to  hinder  the  police  in

carrying  out  their  tasks by bringing  them  into

disrepute.  They had in fact ample  opportunity  to

concert  the  stories  they would  tell  and  those

stories might have carried more weight had  it  not

been  for  the  wise precaution  taken  to  have  a

Medical Officer visiting these detainees daily  and

whose    evidence   has   largely    brought    out

discrepancies in the statements made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, again to appeal to hon. Members

to   consider  this  motion  in  an  objective  and

impartial  spirit unclouded by emotion or prejudice

and  I  do not think I can conclude better than  by

quoting  the  comments made by the Medical  Officer

concerned.  I  may  say that he  is  no  longer  in

Government  service; he is now in private  practice

but  I  have  his  permission  to  quote  from  his

statement. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From my observations of the conditions here, I

would   think  that  the  allegations  are   wholly

unfounded,  malicious  and with  strong  intent  to

damage   the   good  name  of  the  police   force.

Indirectly,  it is an insult to me as a  doctor  in his own rights."



<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was

one  of  the solicitors in the major case cited  by

the  Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng).  In

fact,  I  think I know the whole story better  than

the  Member for Queenstown can ever know  from  the

carefully prepared brief that he read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Birds of the same feather.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, the position briefly is

this. On a certain day in November, the father of a

detainee  came  to  see me at one  o'clock  when  I

returned  during the luncheon hour. He informed  me

that  his  son,  whom  he saw at  11  o'clock  that

morning,  had been assaulted and had complained  to

him  of it. I got in touch with the Director of the

Special  Branch and informed him that I  wished  to

interview   my   client  with  a  private   medical

practitioner whom the father was arranging for.  At

half  past  two  that afternoon, I  interviewed  my

client together with the medical practitioner.  The

report  as the Member for Queenstown read  was  the

report which the medical practitioner gave to me. I

took   a  full  statement  myself  of  the  alleged

assault, and I immediately wrote to the Director of

Special Branch informing him of this, with  a  copy

to the Bar Committee, and another copy to the Chief

Minister. I considered it an extremely grave and  a

very serious charge and one which should be pursued

to the very end. I therefore, on instructions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



asked  for  an identification parade in order  that

five  of  the police officers who could  have  been

identified,  should be identified  and  proceedings

taken   against   them.  Three  days   later,   the

identification parade was arranged. I went round to

the  Central Police Station at half past four,  and

there  I  received instructions that my client  did

not wish to proceed with the identification parade.

I  explained  the  position very  carefully  to  my

client,  including the implications  which  may  be

drawn by a judge, or by any Tribunal, if he refused

to  go  on with the identification parade. It ended

with  written instructions to me which  I  took  to

protect  myself,  to say that he did  not  wish  to

proceed. Subsequently, Sir, I was asked, not in  my

capacity  as  a  lawyer, but in my capacity  as  an

Assemblyman, to move this subject in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the democratic system is open to political

propaganda,  and  is open in some eases  to  abuse.

But,  after my experience in that case, I  had  not

the  slightest  intention  of  being  a  party   to

something  which I did not believe  was  right  and

proper.  I  am  not afraid to tell the  Member  for

Queenstown that, although he may think that he will

get  a lot of political credit out of this - be is  a

very unwise man for many reasons, not least of  all

the fact that in his heart of hearts he knows jolly

well that this is a thoroughly dishonest motion.  I

say  this  openly and publicly, that if I  had  got

those five police officers identified, I would have

prosecuted them to a conviction, and got  them  out

of  the  police force, and have had the  Government

hold  an  inquiry  into the whole  of  the  Special

Branch.  But  I  will not be a party  to  something

which I did not believe was true. When instructions

given  me  were subsequently countermanded  at  the

last  moment,  it  was my duty as an  advocate  and

solicitor, and as an officer of the Court,  not  to

be a party to some smear which I did not believe to

be right and proper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, that is the reason why I did not wish to

bring  this matter up for debate, but I  would  ask

the  Government to consider carefully that although

a Commission could be a platform for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



further  propaganda,  the  Government  should  also

consider that they could clarify this position, and

have  the Inquiry to go into the facts or otherwise

of   the   allegations,  and  clear  the   officers

concerned. There are pros and cons, but on balance,

my  view  is that there is more to be gained  by  a

properly conducted Inquiry - to ascertain the  facts,

not  for  the  purpose of propaganda - than  by  just

throwing out the application for an Inquiry. In  my

submission, an experienced judge would be able, not

only  to ascertain the facts, but also to see  that

there  is  no  character  assassination  of  police

officers  if that is what the Government is  afraid

of-in  the  course  of the Inquiry,  without  proof

being  brought.  The judicial process  is  not  one

which   can  be  easily  perverted  and,   if   the

Government  wishes  to  dismiss  these  allegations

completely, then the proper thing to do would be to

have  this  Inquiry, and have the report tabled  in

this House for subsequent debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I speak from experience in regard to only one

case. I do not know the other three cases, and I am

therefore  not in a position either to  confirm  or

deny the allegations made. The proper tribunal  for

that  should be a judicial one. If the complainants

chose not to bring it before a court, then a quasi-judicial  Tribunal  might  serve  the  purpose   of

completely dispelling any disquiet which  may  have

been   caused   by  the  dissemination   of   these

allegations.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> May it

please  you,  Sir, I, together with my hon. friend

the  Chief  Minister, am, in the eyes of  the  hon.

Member  for  Queenstown,  apparently  one  of   the

accused,  but I am not here to defend  myself.  The

person   who   is  fortunately  quite  beyond   any

criticism is the Hon. the Chief Secretary, who  has

given  the  facts to this House as they  have  been

established  by  the machinery that  is  proper  to

establish   those  facts.  The  hon.   Member   for

Queenstown, in moving this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



motion,  ended by telling us that he does not  know

the  facts  and  that he is not  competent  to  say

whether what he alleges is true or false. The Chief

Secretary  is competent and he has given the  House

the  facts. But I should like to say to the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar a word about the action  he  has

taken.  I  would like to say how much I  appreciate

the  attitude he took. He has quite properly  given

the  lie to, as he says, only one case; but he  has

done  that.  The  Member for  Queenstown  does  not

appear  to  have  made any enquiry  himself  before

putting  before this House a motion that he  admits

may  be true or may be false - he does not know;  he

has  not  enquired.  Apparently  he  has  not  even

bothered  to  find out. Now, having had irrefutable

evidence  that  one  of these four  allegations  is

false  from the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  and

having  heard  the  facts given by  the  completely

disinterested Chief Secretary who was not  even  in

Singapore  or responsible for the police  force  at

the time, there can, to my mind, be no question  of

the  view  this House will take when  it  comes  to

decide what should be done with this motion. But in

case   Members  are  considering  the  very  proper

remarks of the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  about

the  merits of the judicial process, may I just say

that the judicial process is not one that should be

abused  by  being invoked in cases that  are  quite

transparently unworthy of credence. I am  aware  of

the  value  of those processes and I  have  to  act

quasi-judicially in arriving at decisions I make as

Public  Prosecutor.  But I  do  say  that  in  this

case - first,  there  is  clearly  no  call  for  any

enquiry; second, that at this length of time it  is

extremely doubtful whether any useful purpose would

be  served,  particularly as it is  now,  I  think,

obvious   that  whatever  complaints  or   whatever

grievances  these  four  people  may  now  consider

themselves  to be suffering from, it  is  extremely

unlikely  that,  they having had  these  months  to

prepare,  a judicial enquiry would be more  than  a

platform  of  the type that the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar so deprecates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally my third reason for suggesting that no

judicial enquiry is called for is that to have  one when the facts have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



been  so  plainly established would be an abuse  of

the process and quite patently a waste of its time.



<br><br>5.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I am surprised that this

motion  was  filed in the name of  the  Member  for

Queenstown  and not in the name of the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar.  When  the  Member  for  Queenstown

laments in the name of human rights that the Labour

Front  is  quiet, the Liberal-Socialists  are  also

quiet,  the P.A.P. are also quiet, the trade  union

leaders are also quiet, and only he champions it, I

find  that  he  has plunged into the  whole  matter

without seeing exactly where the way leads.  If  it

is publicity that he wants, probably he may have  a

small  amount  of it - but if he is facing  realities

and  acting sanely, then to bring a matter of  this

nature  to  this  Assembly needs real  and  careful investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been given a copy of the complaints

that  he read out at length to this House. In fact,

I  have  not  wanted to initiate any move  at  all,

because  if there is any move that is going  to  be

initiated, it should be the leader of the Party one

of  whose members is under detention. If the leader

of the People's Action Party has found no fault, or

has  found it unnecessary to move a motion of  that

type,  then I think anybody else moving it and  not

knowing  the facts as well as he did would be  just

wasting the time of everybody in this Assembly.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

motion  that has been moved by the hon. Member  for

Queenstown confirms the view which I formed when  I

spoke  on  the Governor's Speech. I said  that  the

subversive  elements  in Singapore  are  now  doing

their  best  to seek new fronts, as the old  fronts

have  been  lost to them, by finding  stooges  from

among   persons  who  are  prepared  to  prostitute

themselves for their own ends; and this, I am sorry

to say, Sir, leads one to think that perhaps what I

said  two  days ago is being proved this afternoon.

The  hon. Member came here saying that he does  not

know the facts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



of  the case, and then he presented them in such  a

way  as  if  he  is  the one and only  champion  in

Singapore of subversive elements. He said that  not

one  organisation - neither the  P.A.P.,  the  Labour

Front,   the  Liberal-Socialists  nor   the   trade

unions - in Singapore has raised a finger in  protest

or has championed this particular cause. I am happy

to  hear, Sir, that in Singapore there are a  large

number of organisations and individuals who can  no

longer be hood-winked by subversive forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was indeed touched by the speech of the hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar. I listened to  him  with

respect and with admiration - his is indeed  a  very

sober and responsible speech. I would have liked to

agree  to  his suggestion that perhaps it might  be

better  in the interests of the Government that  an

enquiry should be held into this, but, as has  been

stated  by  the  Attorney-General, because  of  the

lapse of time, the appointment of such a commission

would  not  help at all but would just  be  playing

into  the hands of these subversive elements, whose

one  and only desire is to make their voices heard.

Let us drown their voices with louder, stronger and

healthier  voices  among the democratic  forces  of

Singapore.  The  Government, Sir,  is  against  the motion.



<br><br>5.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the emotional feeling which the Member for Queenstown brought to

this matter is one for which I have great sympathy.

I  recollect  a case not so very long  ago,  before

this  Government came into power, when a man jumped

from  a window of the interrogation Room and killed

himself. I wrote to all the newspapers and a lot of

other people saying that this was rather a doubtful

procedure  and  ought  to be investigated.  When  I

became a Minister, the matter was still close to my

heart  and I spoke to the then Chief Minister,  Mr

David Marshall, and pressed on him the need that he

should satisfy himself most fully that there was no

fear that torture might be used in interrogating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



detainees.  He shared my views and subsequently  he

told  me  that  he  had been into the  matter  very

thoroughly, by personal visits, by inspections,  by

ascertaining  regulations, by finding  out  exactly

what the procedures were, and he assured me that he

was  absolutely certain that there  was  no  reason

whatsoever to suppose that the sort of method which

the  Member  for Queenstown has brought  before  us

was, in fact, employed or likely to be employed  or

could  be  employed safely without a  certainty  of

detection in a not very long space of time. I  just

mention  this very briefly because I feel that  the

former Chief Minister's views on this sort of thing

are  well known and that he at that time had  fully

assented  to  the  view  that  the  allegations  of

torture  that were made then as well  as  now  were unfounded.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think most Members sitting

in  this  House are aware that I had  practised  27

years  in the courts of this colony and I have  had

my  fair share of criminal practice. In the  course

of  my  practice I never hesitated to  condemn  the

police  when I felt condemnation necessary,  and  I

had  never hesitated to commend the police  when  I

felt   that  commendation  was  due.  I  extend   a

fraternal hand, as a member of the Bar, to the hon.

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar for upholding  the  high

traditions  of the profession which he and  I  have

chosen.  When he realises that any allegation  made

is  dishonest, and the motion which is now  brought

up is dishonest, he has the courage to say so. That

is  the tradition in which we have been brought up.

I  would  never hesitate to act, even as a Minister

today,  if I find malpractices in the police force.

I  would  fight  any  of them, the  Chief  Minister

included,  if  I  felt it necessary.  I  have  gone

through the whole of the papers in this case and  I

am fully satisfied that there is no truth in any of

these  allegations;  furthermore  it  would  be   a

positive  waste  of time to have judicial  officers

sitting in a court of inquiry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad

that the Chief Secretary has given the Government's

view on this issue. Every case has two sides to it.

I  gave my side and he gave his side, it is now  up

to  us  to  decide whether we should or should  not

have a commission of inquiry. It is not up to us to

decide  whether the allegations are true or not.  I

am  rather surprised that this issue has worked  up

the  emotions of the Minister for Health. As I have

emphasised   again   and   again,   whether   these

allegations are true or false, let us leave them in

the hands of the commission of inquiry, and not let

us - 25   elected  representatives,  three   colonial

officials and four nominated Members - decide whether

they are true or not. The facts can only be in  the

hands  of  the  Government and not Members  of  the

Opposition.  So we cannot decide whether  they  are

true or not. It is only the Government who can  say

whether  they  are true or not,  but  it  is  their

story. Let the story of the opposite side come into

the hands of the commission of inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answering the Chief Secretary that when I move

this  motion  it  was  on the assumption  that  the

allegations  are  true, I again  emphasise  that  I

never  assumed that they are true. What I  did  say

was  that  after reading the papers sent to  me.  I

felt it my duty, in the name of humanity and social

justice,  to see that something should be done.  It

is   not  a  question  of  whether  I  believe   or

disbelieve those allegations are true. If they  are

true, then it is bad; and if they are untrue,  then

it  is  far worse because the Government have  just

committed  themselves when they said they  are  not

prepared  to set up this commission of inquiry.  If

it  is  the  Government's story - and they  have  the

complete facts - that the allegations are untrue, why

then   are  they  not  prepared  to  set  up   this

commission  and  hold  an inquiry?  There  must  be

something that is true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary said that the police are the

proper authority to carry out the investigations. I

appreciate  that,  because  the  police  force   is

established  to  carry out investigations  and  not

just to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



sit idle; but the point is this, Sir, that in these

particular  cases  the police  themselves  are  the

interested  party. The Member for Changi  yesterday

or  the  day  before yesterday rightly pointed  out

that  the  Commissioner of  Police  relies  on  his

Assistant  or  Deputy Commissioner of  Police.  The

latter  in  turn  relies on the Superintendents  of

Police   who  rely  on  the  Deputy  or   Assistant

Superintendents  of Police who rely  on  the  Chief

Inspectors who rely on the Staff Sergeants who rely

on  the  privates. Can the Commissioner of  Police,

who  directs the Special Branch, who themselves are

the persons who have detained these people, can  he

or  the  Attorney-General  or  the  Chief  Minister

expect  to have a proper, unbiased and unprejudiced

report?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> The Chief Secretary said that

the investigations were carried out very carefully.

I again appreciate that, but in view of the gravity

of these allegations, are they to be treated in the

normal way as other types of allegations? If so,  I

appreciate  the procedure mentioned  by  the  Chief

Secretary.  These  allegations  have  caused  world

interest.  They  have aroused  the  interest  of  a

Member   of  Parliament.  They  have  aroused   the

interest of trade unions in foreign countries. Such

allegations are very grave. Is the Chief  Secretary

prepared  to  say that the procedure applicable  to

minor offences be adopted in this case? Is that the

proper way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary also admitted that at one time

two detainees identified three police officers, but

these  three police officers denied the allegations

of  torture. Are the Government prepared to  accept

the   denial  of  these  police  officers?  If  the

Government are prepared to do so, why not they then

accept the allegations that they are true? Just the

word of three police officers-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Never from subversive forces; never, not as long as I live.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Well, these three police

officers  were  identified  and  they  denied   the

allegations  of  torture  to  the  Commissioner  of

Police,  and  yet  the Commissioner  of  Police  is

prepared  to accept their word. If the Commissioner

is  prepared to accept their word, it is their word

against  another's. Why not then leave  it  to  the

commission of inquiry, rather than beat  about  the bush?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in one of the medical reports, the Chief

Secretary  said that the medical officer said  that

there  was  a  possibility that the  injuries  were

caused  as  stated  in  the  allegations.  Now  the

medical officer-



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. What I

actually  said was that the two medical specialists

stated  in their report that they could not exclude

the  possibility  of the injuries being  caused  as

alleged or being self-inflicted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Deputy

Speaker.  Now, as the Chief Secretary has admitted,

the   medical   report  could   not   exclude   the

possibility  of one or the other - that the  injuries

might   have  been  caused  as  alleged,  or  self-inflicted,  which means that there is a  doubt.  So the  medical officer himself cannot say one way  or

the  other.  There is a possibility of one  or  the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary again said that at one time

he  was  asked why a complaint was not  lodged - that

refers  to Lim Chin Joo. I think - and Lim  Chin  Joo

said  he had not lodged a complaint because he  was

afraid  of  the presence of a police officer.  That

clearly  indicates what I have said in  my  speech - that whilst a detainee is under the supervision and detention of the police, he is afraid to submit any

complaints,  and the presence of a  police  officer outside his-



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Point of clarification, Sir, The

statement to which the hon. Member is referring and

which I made was in connection with the last case I

dealt with - that was Goh - and he was asked why he had

not complained to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



medical officer when he was alone with him, not  in

the presence of a police officer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not

say  that  he  was  in  the presence  of  a  police

officer.  I said that because a police officer  was

around somewhere -[Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Not here, but in prison, and I

hope  that  the Chief Minister will not  take  this

House  to be a prison when he looked around, taking

all of us as detainees. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind strangers

in  the Gallery that the Speaker, by virtue of  the

powers  conferred  upon him by Standing  Order  75,

rules that strangers in the Gallery are not allowed

to create any disturbance whatsoever? Carry on, Mr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am happy that the Chief

Secretary has asked Members of this House to  treat

this motion with an unbiased mind. I think this  is

a  most reasonable statement - that we should not  be

prejudiced  by  the Government's story  or  by  the

statements or affidavits which have been circulated

to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar said that he

represented  the first detainee and he brought  him

down  for  an identification parade. But  when  the

detainee went to where all the police officers were

assembled   for  an  identification  parade,   this

detainee did not want an identification parade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I think,

when  we are dealing with facts of this nature,  we

should  be careful not only in quoting but also  in

being quoted. I would like to remind the Member for

Queenstown  that what I said was  that  I  did  not

attend  an  identification parade, I was  about  to

attend  an  identification parade when  I  received

instructions to the contrary. The parade was  ready

in the next room, but I never went to the parade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you for the

clarification. I have said earlier in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



my speech that this detainee was blindfolded at the

time  he  was  tortured. Again I gave a  number  of

reasons  why  he  refused to have an identification

parade - fear   of  further  torture   under   police

detention  or confinement - and again the police  are

themselves in fact an interested party. So that  is

the   reason  why  this  detainee  instructed   his

solicitor  that he was prepared to  go  without  an

identification parade. This is not very  important,

Sir,  but the important issue which the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar brought up is that this motion  is  a

dishonest motion. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I  filed

this  motion not for glory, not for gain,  and  not

for publicity. I do not want glory because I do not

need glory. For gain, I am not a lawyer and if I do

take  this  case  up, I will not be  paid.  As  for

publicity,  I know quite a number of newspapers  do

not give me publicity. It is up to the Press not to

give me publicity, but publicity to the torture  of

the  four detainees is more important than personal

publicity. The hon. Member said that he disbelieved

the  facts as contained in the allegations. Whether

he  disbelieves  them  or not,  each  has  his  own

opinion.  But what I am happy to note  is  that  he

believes in one thing - and that is that a commission

of  inquiry  be set up. I am happy that the  Member

for Tanjong Pagar agrees with me on this particular

issue, if not on the whole motion. Sir, he believes

it, but the Government say they are not prepared to

set  up  a commission. Again I may say that  it  is

just  a  refutation  of  the allegations,  and  the

Government are not prepared. The Chief Minister has

a  lot of respect for the Member for Tanjong Pagar.

Why not give him that respect about his belief that

a commission should be set up?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Attorney-General said that before I

brought  this motion to the Assembly I should  have

made  enquiries about the facts, and  that  when  I

ended my speech I confessed or admitted that I  was

not  competent to say whether the allegations  were

false  or true. Sir, to obtain information or  make

enquiries from the Government, I have to go through

a  lot of red tape. As an elected representative of

this Assembly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



I  feel it is my duty, once a case has been brought

to  my  notice, to bring it to the notice  of  this

Assembly, whether the allegations in the  case  are

true or not, and let it decide. Whether I have made

investigations to ascertain if there  is  truth  in

the allegations, I wish to say once again that this

issue  has aroused the interest of foreigners,  and

if  it has done that, why should it not arouse  the

interest  of  the  people of  Singapore  and  their

elected  representatives? The trade union  movement

in   the  United  Kingdom,  as  I  have  said,  has

submitted a very strong protest. If the allegations

are  not  true,  I  doubt whether the  trade  union

movement there would have sent in that protest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon is surprised that the

leader  of the P.A.P. has not filed in this  motion

and  it has now come in the name of the Member  for

Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Quite so! It is! There is no

surprise, Sir. Why should there be surprise? Is  it

necessary that I should belong to a Party, or these

detainees or members of the public should belong to

a  Party, to bring their cases to this Assembly? I,

for one, as an elected representative, do represent

the  people,  irrespective of what  Party  or  what

colour  they  belong to. As long as I have  a  case

which  I  feel should be taken up in  the  name  of

justice, I do so. I act accordingly: I do not  play

party politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister says that there are stooges in

Singapore and that the subversive elements are  now

trying  to find a new front. Sir, does he  classify

any  elected representative or public spirited  man

to  be  a  stooge if he is prepared to represent  a

case to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



Assembly? If so, this is not the only time  that  a

motion  is filed. This is not the only time that  a

Member of this House has represented cases to  this

Assembly and, that being so, those who have brought

cases  or motions to this Assembly are nothing  but

stooges.  Mr  Awberry, a Member of  the  House  of

Commons  and a Member of the British Labour  Party,

asked  a question regarding this case in the House.

Is  he  then a stooge? If we are stooges,  then  he

should  be  classified as a stooge. If  Members  of

this  House are stooges, then Members of the  House

of Commons must also definitely be stooges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I look at it, Sir, after hearing the

Government's  story  and the  speech  made  by  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar, who has definite  facts

about  the  case, there appears to me  to  be  some

doubt  as  to whether the allegations are  true  or

not. In a court of law, the magistrate always gives

the  benefit of the doubt to the accused.  I,  Sir,

representing  the cases, am considered  to  be  the

accused, and I feel that there is some doubt  about

them;  so let us clear that doubt. The doubt  is  a

very big one. Let us set up a commission of inquiry

to clear it up. It is now one word against another.

The  Government  said,  "No,  the  allegations  are

true."  On  the  Opposition  Benches,  one  or  two

Members  have supported me - the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar is supporting me to a small extent; he thinks

the  allegations may or may not be true. So let  us

set  up  this  commission of inquiry.  I  hope  the

Government will change their minds and set it up so

as  to  clear the reputation of the Government  and

the police force.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I move

the motion standing in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the unreasonable and

obstructive attitude of the Singapore Habour  Board

in   refusing   to   accept   and   implement   the

recommendations of the Court of Inquiry set  up  by

the Minister for Labour and Welfare on the 16th day

of  July, 1957, as contained in Sessional Paper No. S 7 of 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 6th of September last year there was

tabled in this House a Sessional Paper setting  out

the  Report of the Court of Inquiry into the  trade

dispute  at the Singapore Harbour Board. The  House

will remember that this Court of inquiry was set up

as  a  consequence of a motion which I moved urging

the  Minister for Labour and Welfare to  set  up  a

commission of inquiry to investigate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



a  go-slow  then in being  at  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board.  It is now seven months  since  the

findings and the recommendations of the Court  were

published,  and it is a matter for  regret  that  I

have  to move this motion to draw the attention  of

the  House to the fact that a quasi-government body

had    chosen    to   flout   the   findings    and

recommendations of the Court of Inquiry  when  they

were not to its liking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to give a short historical

outline  of the beginnings of the dispute before  I

deal  with  the  findings. The House will  remember

that in May and June of last year there was a great

deal of unrest in the Singapore Harbour Board which

was  triggered off when a go-slow was called  as  a

result  of  the  confiscation of the  pass  of  the

General  Secretary of the Singapore  Harbour  Board

Staff  Association. But as was clearly brought  out

at  the Court of Inquiry, the causes of the go-slow

went much deeper than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the hearings of the Court, certain

recommendations were made for an interim settlement

to  hold the position while the Court enquired into

the  facts. It is a matter for regret that on  each

and  every  occasion  the Singapore  Harbour  Board

chose  somehow  or  the other to  circumvent  these

recommendations for an interim settlement. Far from

the position becoming clearer and more resolved, it

has now reached the point today where there is open

victimisation of any worker who is associated  with

the  Union,  that  is the Singapore  Harbour  Board

Staff Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Serangoon indicated that

he  thought the Singapore Harbour Board is  a  very

important  organ  of the Singapore  Government.  He

thought  that it was imperative that the livelihood

of Singapore should be looked after, and I am quite

sure  he will agree with me that it is a matter  of

paramount  importance  that  industrial  peace  and

harmony  should  be maintained between  the  labour

force and the Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after a sitting of about two weeks the Court

of Inquiry made these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



findings - these appear at page 7 of Sessional  Paper No. S 7 of 1957:



<br><br><div align="center">"Industrial Relations</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.-(1) The evidence provided by the parties to

the  dispute  before this Court  showed  that  much

could  have  been achieved towards  minimising  the

conflict  between the two groups if  a  better  and

more  continuous  use had been made  of  the  joint

consultative machinery created under the  Agreement

of  1955.  If the machinery is, for some reason  or

other, clumsy and not capable of lending itself  as

a  pliable  instrument  to smooth  over  industrial

relations, then it is our opinion that it should be

revised. It should not be difficult for the SHB and

the  unions working within the authority, to evolve

a   scheme  similar  to  Joint  Councils   now   so

successfully in operation in the Civil Service  and

the City Council of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the General Secretary's Pass is

undoubtedly  one of those matters that  could  have

been  treated  much  more speedily  had  discussion

taken place in a relatively unclouded atmosphere at

the level of the instrumentality we have mentioned.

As  a  matter  of  fact, the entire  dispute  could

possibly  have  been  encompassed  within  narrower

limits,  had the parties been able to "talk  things

over" as it is possible in the Whitley procedure."



<br><br>And  then  it  goes on to the issue of recognition,

and  these  are specific findings which  the  Court

made.



<br><br><div align="center">"The Issue of Recognition</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) It is because of the disorder in

administration  that  it was difficult  for  us  to

arrive  at a clear-cut finding on the issue related

to the second term of reference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It was quite clear that the seven unions,

namely,  the Singapore Harbour Board Labour  Union,

the  Singapore  Wharf and Ship  Labour  Union,  the

Singapore   Harbour  Board  Stevedore   and   Wharf

Workers'  Union, the Confederation of the Singapore

Chinese   Engineering  Tradesmen,   the   Singapore

Harbour  Board  Engineering  Workmen's  Union,  the

Malay  Seamen's Union of Singapore and the  Harbour

Board Employees Union of Singapore, were not-"



<br><br>and this is my emphasis-



<br><br>"not representative of all daily-rated employees of

the SHB, nor in fact do they represent a majority

or even a sizeable proportion of such group of

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the case of the SHBSA-"



<br><br>that is the Union that was in dispute with the Harbour Board-



<br><br>"the question of whether or not it is

representative of a majority of workers in the SHB,

is more difficult and clouded by the effect of

disorderly administrative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



practices  in  the keeping of books,  accounts  and

other  papers,  and  with  inadequate  routine   of

notification  of  changes,  particularly   on   the

alteration  of the Association's rules  to  include

all employees of the S.H.B."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Court made this recommendation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We would suggest that such evidence be collected

in  the  form  of a secret ballot by members  whose

names  appear on the membership cards of the  SHBWU

and  the SHBSA. The question to be asked should  be

whether  or not each one of these men supports  the

SHBSA.  The ballot could be easily arranged by  the

Ministry   of  Labour  in  co-operation  with   the

Registrar  of  Trade Unions and the  Supervisor  of

Elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I asked a question in this Assembly whether

the  Minister for Labour was going to implement the

recommendation of a secret ballot, and  he  replied

to  me  that  he was investigating the  matter  and

would find out the views of unions in Singapore  on

this   issue   to  determine  recognition   or   no

recognition  for the union. It is  more  than  five

months  since the question was tabled and answered,

and I would like to know whether he has made up his

mind  on  this  recommendation  of  the  Court   of

Inquiry.  That is a big issue, and I  think  it  is

only  fair  for  me  to  put  it  bluntly - it  is  a

political  issue  involving seven or  eight  little

unions in the Singapore Harbour Board some of which

are  known to be connected with some Members of the

Labour Front - like the Assistant Minister for Labour

and  Welfare - some  connected with  other  political

Parties,  and  the  Singapore Harbour  Board  Staff

Association,  of which I am the legal adviser,  and

therefore believed to be connected with the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important that we should try

and  keep  clear in our minds two issues: one,  the

simple  issue of trade union practice and what  the

Government  wishes  to foster; two,  the  political

consequence of implementing any principle or ruling

of trade union practice and procedure. I have tried

very  hard  in the last few months to  arrange,  if

possible,  to get all these little unions  absorbed

into  one federation. Unfortunately it has not been

possible  to  do this and I think we  must  take  a

stand on this question of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



secret  ballot and the recognition of  whether  the

Singapore  Harbour  Board  Staff  Association  does

represent a majority of the workers in the  Harbour

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is more deplorable is that the Singapore

Harbour  Board had chosen to flout certain specific

minor  recommendations. This was  the  finding  and

recommendation  as  regards  the  case  of  the  26

lascars. It said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(iv) We have given a good deal of thought to the

matter of the 26 lascars [who were dismissed]. From

the  evidence given and having regard to the danger

to  life  and  property which arose  when  the  men

stopped work, it is not unreasonable to expect  the

SHB  to  act  as  they did with regard  to  the  26

lascars.  However, we consider that  this  stoppage

was   related  to  the  general  industrial  unrest

prevailing  at  that time and accordingly  we  feel

that the men should be re-employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SHB has stated before us that it considers

itself a good employer. For this reason it did  not

dismiss  the 3 serangs and the other 6 lascars  and

re-employed  another.  We  feel  that   the   Board

following  further this very wise  and  broadminded

attitude, should re-engage the 25 dismissed lascars

still out of work."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not only were these 26 lascars not re-engaged until very much later - and some 12 of them

have   still  not  been  re-engaged - the   Singapore

Harbour  Board also chose to ignore another finding

and  recommendation, that is  in  regard  to  other

personnel who were suspended as a result of the go-slow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(v) There may be a number of former employees of

the  Board  still awaiting reengagement.  They  may

have been dismissed by the Board during the go slow

and  their  place taken by new personnel.  We  feel

that  these men should not be too severely  treated

for  following  an  industrial practice  recognised

where  trade unionism is in operation. The go  slow

was  a  general movement and the men  followed  the

instructions  of  their Union.  They  have  already

suffered  a loss of wages and of overtime benefits.

However,  the  Port is again in full operation  and

for the promotion of improved industrial relations,

we are of the opinion that it is desirable that any

such  men  should  be speedily re-employed  as  the

Board  will find possible. We do not think that  it

would  be  very difficult - at least not as difficult

as it was submitted to us during the proceedings-to

convince  serangs that they should take back  their

former gang members, and to re-engage the remaining

M.E. personnel."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the findings were published, there were

some  several  hundred  workers  still  unemployed.

Throughout   the  whole  of  the  proceedings   the

argument put forward by the Singapore Harbour Board

about  not  being able to absorb these men  rapidly

was  that it would dislocate the new gangs they had

just put up, and that serangs and mandores were not

very keen on getting back into their gangs men  who

had  joined  the go slow, and also because  in  the

meantime  they  had engaged new men. Therefore  the

Court gave them some latitude and time to make  the

necessary  adjustment.  But  far  from  making  the

necessary adjustment, the Board went out of its way

in  not taking back 200 odd men, keeping out the 25

lascars   and  punishing  the  men  whom   it   had

reabsorbed.  I will come back to how  it  practised

this mild form - I would not say "mild", I would  say

it is "oblique" form of punishment. But I think the

Chief Minister will remember that I had seen him on

many   occasions  both  with  and   without   Union

Committee  members, to try and  get  the  Board  to

accept  these men back to work, and he had on  many

occasions given his firm assurance that they  would

be  taken back and that the recommendations of  the

Court of Inquiry would be implemented. In fact, the

House will remember how certain gentlemen, who  are

not  here today, tried to make political issue  out

of the hunger strike called by the 200 men who were

not  taken  back to work. The Chief  Minister  then

said  that  he did not want to succumb to political

blackmail  and refused to do anything  until  after

the  elections. Well, after the elections  he  took

them  back to work; but although some 200 men  were

taken back, the Board has still kept out 12 lascars

and  10 other men who have offered themselves  back

for re-employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is no reason given why this thing has

not been done. The Chief Minister has called up, as

I   understand  it - although  I  have  no   personal

knowledge  of it - he has called up the new  Chairman

of  the  Singapore Harbour Board on  at  least  two

occasions. After



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



one  occasion  he  informed me  that  it  might  be

difficult  to  get the men back to the dockyard - the

12  lascars - because  the Harbour  Board  felt  very

strongly  about the lascars walking out on  a  ship

coming  in.  Mind  you, all  this  must  have  been

carefully  considered by a court of inquiry  and  a

recommendation had been made that they should be re-engaged,  and  in fact more than half  of  the  men

involved in that walk-out had been re-engaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing has been done. At one time it was

believed  that this was because the former Chairman

of  the Harbour Board, one Mr Chrimes, was a  very

obdurate  and obstinate man and not susceptible  to

reason  even from his superiors in the Ministry  of

Commerce and Industry. He has gone gratuitously  on

retirement and a new Chairman has taken his  place.

The  new  Chairman  is  a man  who  has  also  been

connected  with the Harbour Board during the  years

of  Mr  Chrimes'  chairmanship.  Now,  Sir,  quite

briefly what I would like to know from the Minister

for  Labour and Welfare is this: Is he sincere when

he  says, yes, the men will be taken back  and  the

recommendation  of  the Court of  Inquiry  will  be

honoured?  If so, has he not got the power  as  the

head  of  the  Government  to  tell  the  Singapore

Harbour Board what should be done and what is right

and proper?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very simply, as I see it, either the Chief

Minister  is not pressing very hard on the  Harbour

Board,  or the Harbour Board is acting in  defiance

of his wishes. If that is so, I think the remedy is

open in his hands. I stated earlier in this sitting

of  the House that if and when we form a government

we  would  not just complain like the Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry that heads  of  departments

ignore circulars which are given to them that  they

should  give preference to local goods and  so  on.

They  are prejudiced and of course he said he would

like to take action. We would take immediate action

if  our  directives were flouted. Now the Singapore

Harbour   Board   may   be  a  public   corporation

constituted  under  the  Singapore  Harbour   Board

Ordinance, but the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



appointment  of  the  Board of  Directors  and  the

Chairman  is  one which is done by the Governor  in

Council,  and if he does not know how  to  exercise

his  authority,  and  the  Attorney-General  cannot

advise   him   how   to  exercise   his   authority

indirectly, then I am quite prepared to advise  him

how it can be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for various reasons there has not been

direct  industrial action taken as a result of  all

this. We patiently sent delegation after delegation

to  see  the Chief Minister. There was some  little

result  each time. First, two hundred odd men  were

taken  back  after  the elections  when  the  Chief

Minister  took them back. Then one of the  men  was

not  taken back. Contrary to what the Harbour Board

had  promised, they sent one of the men who offered

himself for re-employment for a medical check,  and

they rejected him because they said he did not pass

the   medical   check.  But  it  had  been   agreed

beforehand  that  there would be no  medical  check

because  they  were old men, old  workers  offering

themselves to be re-engaged; they checked this  man

out  and applied pressure. They locked up his house

and  all  his  belongings, S.H.B. quarters.  Again,

representations  were made to the  Chief  Minister;

some  pressure  was put on the Harbour  Board;  the

seizure  of  the  quarters was  cancelled  and  the

quarters  reopened. But the man is  still  not  re-engaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, of course, those men who were not re-engaged had their housing passes confiscated. This

is   the   kind  of  harassing  which  I   consider

contemptible   when   it  comes   from   a   public

corporation.  First,  they took  away  the  housing

passes; then they sent the Harbour Board police  on

rounds  and  they  said,  "Ah,  you  are  on  these

premises   without   a  housing   card   -you   are

trespassing within the meaning of such and  such  a

section of the. Singapore Harbour Board Ordinance."

So  the  matter goes to court. So we went to  court

and  we had the same gentleman, Mr Rhind, who  has

been  investigated  for  corrupt  practices,  whose

activities  were  thoroughly  investigated  by  the

C.P.I.B.,  and  on  whom there was  a  considerable

amount of evidence, to give evidence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



He  agreed  that on his instructions certain  cards

had  been forcibly taken away from a man.  He  also

agreed that two of the men who were prosecuted, and

on  whom  they  were hoping to get a conviction  in

order  to apply the heat on all the other men,  had

been living in those quarters for not less than  10

years.  They were prosecuted for trespass. But  the

magistrate  threw out the case, as was  only  right

and proper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are still 12 lascars and 10 other

labourers  not re-engaged. The Chief Minister  said

he  would try and get the 12 lascars absorbed,  not

into the dockyard, but into some other section. But

meanwhile  the  Singapore  Harbour  Board,   taking

advantage  of the patient attitude, and  what  they

have  interpreted as weakness on the  part  of  the

Union,  have  put  the heat on inside  the  Harbour

Board. So all those men who are known to be members

and supporters of the Singapore Harbour Board Staff

Association get punished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the subtle way in which they do it.

They  used to give these men a minimum of six kangs

a  week. As one kang is one period of eight  hours,

plus  over-time as and when over-time is available,

the  average would be about 12 kangs a  week;  most

probably they give some 12, some 14. Now during the

go slow, the Labour Department, with the active co-operation of some of the union leaders referred  to

in  the Report as those not representing any men at

all,  were able to get a number of new workers into

the   Harbour  Board.  I  do  not  want  to  repeat

allegations   of   corruption.  But,   apart   from

allegations  of how they got the jobs,  the  Board,

far  from  putting these new men into spare  gangs,

casual gangs, as was directed by the Court, and re-engaging the old men, have put all the old men into

casual gangs, and kept the new men in the permanent

gangs. And the new men are getting 12 to 14 kangs a

week  and the old men are getting as little as six,

or even four, kangs a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not only do they try and punish them in that

way,  by  giving them a less number of kangs,  they

give  them kangs which are not full kangs.  If  one

works,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



a  normal  working  day in the morning,  one  works

eight  hours  and gets one full kang, eight  hours'

worth  of  work. If one works over-time, one  works

four  hours,  from seven in the evening  to  11  at

night,  and is paid time-and-a-half- six hours.  So

they  gave these men, who are members of, and loyal

to  the Union, night work paid at six hours instead

of  eight  hours, and count that as one  kang,  cut

down  the number of kangs and thereby some  of  the

members  are getting as little as $15, $16,  $17  a

week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there are two ways out. One, we resolve this

thing in a reasonable way - talk it over and sort it

out. Or, two, we compel the Union once more to take

direct   industrial  action.  I  have   been   very

reluctant to take direct industrial action for many

reasons, and perhaps the Chief Minister, a  man  in

possession of a great deal of the guessing faculty,

will be able to guess at some of the reasons why we

have  avoided taking direct industrial action.  But

the  point is now reached where, unless this matter

is  resolved,  the Union may be compelled  to  take

some  direct industrial action. In that case it  is

not unlikely that the Board in its present frame of

mind,   including  its  new  Chairman,   may   take

retaliatory measures. That leads in turn to further

action  on  the part of the Union and a  full-blown

dispute will be created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there are of course ways and means of

dealing  with such a dispute as the Chief  Minister

well  knows.  One could just smack the whole  thing

down.  But  if  one does that, in this  case  where

there  is  a genuine Union, and indeed,  where  the

issue  is not clouded by any question of subversion

of  any  sort, if one does that, then the whole  of

the  situation in the Singapore Harbour Board,  the

whole of the dock area, will be soured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see any reason why the Singapore Harbour

Board  should  not be made first of all  to  follow

what  the Court of Inquiry has recommended. In fact

the  Chief  Minister will remember that  there  was

some  delay  in  the appointment of  the  Court  of

Inquiry  because  he said there  was  no  point  in

having a court of inquiry unless both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



parties  agreed to accept its findings;  hence  the

delay.  We  agreed  to  accept  the  findings,  the

Singapore  Harbour  Board was not  quite  prepared.

Eventually,  the  Court  of Inquiry  was  appointed

presumably because they thought it over and decided

that  they also had better come into line and throw

it  over to an independent commission of inquiry to

decide how best to settle the dispute. And I say it

is  no  less than a breach of faith on the part  of

the  Singapore  Harbour Board to dishonour  and  to

flout the recommendations and findings of the Court

of Enquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one could say, well, that does not matter.

But  it does matter, because the next time one  has

an  industrial  dispute, be  it  in  the  Singapore

Harbour Board or elsewhere, and if it is sent to  a

court  of  inquiry  and both  parties  have  agreed

beforehand that they will abide by its findings and

recommendations, and if the findings turn out to be

against the union's interests, the union may  jolly

well  say,  "We do not want it." In fact  when  the

City  Council Federation of Labour Unions  did  not

want to accept the recommendations of the Court  of

Inquiry  which  the same Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare  appointed in their dispute,  the  Minister

was  the first to point out that they should accept

the  recommendations of the Court of  Inquiry.  Oh,

yes,  because they sent delegations to see him,  as

Minister  for Labour and Welfare. I, in my capacity

then as the adviser of the Federation, came to know

that  he had advised them that they ought to accept

the  recommendations of the Court of Inquiry. Well,

in  the  case  of  the City Council  Federation  of

Labour  Unions, he was just the Minister for Labour

and Welfare talking to an independent Union; but in

the  case of the Singapore Harbour Board, he is the

Minister  for Labour and Welfare, he  is  also  the

Chief   Minister   heading  this  Government.   His

Minister  for Commerce and Industry is the Minister

in  charge of the Singapore Harbour Board,  and  he

can  very  well see that these recommendations  are

implemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, all I am asking the House to do today is

to  join, first, in condemning the - I will use  very

restrained words, Sir, very mild and I should think

most  unobjectionable  words - all  I  said  was  the

unreasonable  and  obstructive  attitude   of   the

Singapore Harbour Board. I would ask the  House  to

join  me  and  to go further and say that  it  must

accept    and    implement   the    findings    and

recommendations of this Court of Inquiry, in  other

words, Sir, take back the 12 lascars; take back the

10  other  labourers; put the  old  men  back  into

permanent  gangs, and put the new men  into  casual

gangs;  and hold a ballot to decide whether or  not

the  Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association does

or  does  not represent the majority of the workers

in the Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the House is not prepared to do this, if the

Government, for reasons of its own, is not prepared

to  do this, then it will put itself into a morally

indefensible position if at a subsequent  date,  in

trying  to resolve an industrial dispute,  this  is

cited  as an example of how the Government and  its

quasi  Government authority, the Singapore  Harbour

Board,  had  set a model of how not  to  settle  an

industrial dispute.



<br><br>6.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a shame that a public corporation like the

Singapore  Harbour  Board should  set  such  a  bad

example in employer-employee relationships. We  all

agree,   Sir,   that  the  port  of  Singapore   is

Singapore's   rice  bowl.  It  is  important   that

industrial  peace and harmony should prevail.  Here

we have a shameful example of how a semi-government

employer  has  chosen  to flout  the  findings  and

recommendations of a court of inquiry because  they

were  not in favour of the Singapore Harbour  Board

and not to its liking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we allow this to pass unchallenged and let

the Singapore Harbour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



Board  get  away with it, the Government have  only

themselves to blame. And if next time a big  strike

takes  place and a court of inquiry is  set  up  to

solve  the dispute, the union can refuse to  accept

the  findings and the recommendations of the court,

because it is not in the union's favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must condemn the Singapore Harbour Board

for  refusing  to implement the recommendations  of

the  Court  of Inquiry. If after condemnation  they

still refuse to implement them, the Government must

take action against the Singapore Harbour Board and

compel them to do what is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I move to amend the motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out "deplores the unreasonable and

obstructive attitude of the Singapore Harbour Board

in   refusing"  and  insert  "urges  the  Singapore

Harbour Board".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before the coming on the scene of

politicians,  we seldom had strikes. At  that  time

probably  we  heard from ex-Chief Ministers,  Chief

Ministers  and  politicians that the  workers  were

exploited  and  that Singapore was built  on  their

blood  and  sweat.  However,  there  was  one  good

thing - there  was  harmony. At  least  there  was  a

measure  of  trust between employers and employees.

And  I  think  at  that time too, employers  looked

after  their employees and it was an unwritten  law

that it was their duty to look after them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times have changed. Workers must be given a better

deal and indeed they should be given a better deal.

And we have trade unions coming on the scene. If we

have  trade  unions  and  people  who  are  working

members  looking after their own affairs, I believe

that  things  could still go on very  smoothly  and

employer-employee  relationships  could  still   be

good. But when we have people who are not connected

with   unions  coming  in,  sometimes   with   good

intentions for wanting to help employees,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



but more often than not coming in  with  the

idea  of  creating chaos and gaining publicity  for

themselves,  we  then meet with  a  great  deal  of

trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we find that there need not be a great

deal of dispute. It could easily be talked over and

the  matter settled amicably, but when somebody  is

fanning  the fire of hatred and another is infusing

into  the  other  party distrust we  then  get  big

troubles being cooked up, and we come to the  stage

where the employer will not trust the employee  and

the employee will regard the employer as his enemy.

Indeed,  Sir,  it seems that if one  can  down  the

other,  then one has scored a point; then one  will

have  gained something. On the face of it, it  does

look like this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like everybody concerned to know that

such  action can only bring disadvantages  to  both

sides.  I have said in the debate on the Governor's

Speech  that the Singapore Harbour Board is a  very

important  institution in Singapore.  We  depend  a

great  deal on it for our trade and our livelihood.

But  because of its many disputes, because  of  its

many   troubles,  trade  is  shifting   away   from

Singapore. The employer may fight the employee, the

employee  may  fight back, and soon we  have  trade

going  away  to  other lands. I ask the  people  of

Singapore, especially the people concerned,  as  to

whether  they have any advantage when trade  should

dwindle to such a small amount, that no matter  how

great their earnings are per day, they will bring a

very  small  packet home every month.  Or  ask  the

employer,  no matter how much they can squeeze  out

of  the  employee, if there is no  business  to  be

done,  then you find that there will be  no  income

when you tally up the total for the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask, Sir, that employees and employers, for the

good  of  Singapore, for the good of  everybody  in

Singapore,  should try and understand one  another,

should  try  and  see  that there  should  be  less

disputes and more harmonious working.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with many politicians who are interested

parties  coming on the scene, such may not  be  the

case  all the time, and we may have to face a large

number of strikes and labour unrest in future. This

must be avoided. One



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



way  of avoiding such a case would be to appoint  a

court  of inquiry to find out things. And  I  would

say  that  in many cases the best way to  settle  a

dispute  would be not to leave it to  the  employer

and  the  employee,  both thinking  that  they  are

right,  but  to  leave  it to  independent  people,

independent and impartial people who have  no  axes

to  grind. And I think courts of inquiry should  be

established;   arbitration   courts    should    be

established.  And I believe that one  day  we  must

have  compulsory arbitration with a panel of people

agreed  to  by employers and employees  alike,  and

they  will sit to arbitrate. And I would  say  that

whatever  their  decision  should  be,  both  sides

should agree to their decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case where the matter has been brought

up  to a court. The court has set out its findings,

the court has made its recommendations. It consists

of  people trusted by all sides and I think that it

would  be  wrong for any party not  to  accept  the

recommendations of such a court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the Singapore Harbour Board, as a

quasi-Government institution, as a  good  employer,

should  accept  the  decisions  of  the  Court.  I,

however, Sir, made the amendment because I  believe

that  this is the first case that has come to  this

Assembly that recommendations of a court of inquiry

have not been fully accepted. We would like to urge

the  Harbour Board to accept those recommendations.

It will create a good precedent for other employers

and  employees  to  follow if  we  have  courts  of

arbitration  or enquiry appointed at a later  date.

Sir,  I  move  that this House urges the  Singapore

Harbour   Board   to  accept  and   implement   the

recommendations of the Court of Inquiry set  up  by

the  Minister for Labour and Welfare on 16th  July,

1957, as contained in Sessional Paper S 7 of 1957.



<br><br>7.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I second the amendment and reserve the right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House deplores the unreasonable and

in   refusing   to   accept   and   implement   the

recommendations of the Court of Inquiry set  up  by

the Minister for Labour and Welfare on the 16th day

of  July, 1957, as contained in Sessional Paper No. S 7 of 1957."



<br><br>Since which an amendment has been proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out "deplores the unreasonable and

obstructive attitude of the Singapore Harbour Board

in   refusing"  and  insert  "urges  the  Singapore

Harbour Board".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br>7.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Sir, on rising to speak on this amendment, I

would  like  to  say  that the  Government  is  not

against  the  amendment because it only  refers  to

"urging"  the Singapore Harbour Board to  implement

the, according to the wording, recommendations  and

findings of the Court of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems very difficult for me to stand here

as  Minister for Labour and Welfare to speak  on  a

motion in such a way that I do not take sides  with

the employers or the employees. The hon. Member for

Tanjong Pagar and representatives of the Union have

seen  me  many  a time, and I have, too,  seen  the

Harbour Board many a time, and so far what has been

achieved is the re-employment of - I do not know  the

exact number - some 200 people, and only 10 from  the

ordinary labour force and 12 lascars have  not  yet

been  re-employed. This is a small  number  but  my

information is that the 10 labourers were  not  re-employed  because they had not presented themselves

for  re-employment. I do not know whether  that  is

correct or not. I do not wish to take sides  but  I

would assure this House that if this amended motion

is  accepted,  it would assist me as  Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare  to  present  the  case   more

forcibly to the Singapore Harbour Board and I  hope

that  with  the views of this House made  known  to them,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



they  will take due note and re-employ the  persons

who have so far not been re-employed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What about the 12 lascars?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I said all the persons not re-employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, Sir. The Member for Tanjong

Pagar  did  touch  on the question  of  the  secret

ballot. That is not a recommendation of the  Court.

It is a suggestion of the Court - a suggestion that I

have  been considering. I find it difficult due  to

conditions  in  Singapore to agree to  introduce  a

system of secret balloting on recognition. This  is

a system that has been adopted in America at a time

when they had two big organisations - the C.I.O. and

the  A.F. of L. When workers who were not organised

wished  to  be organised, the government  machinery

was set in motion to ascertain from the workers  in

the  factory  their  views as to  which  particular

organisation they would wish to represent them  but

under  the present laws in Singapore any seven  men

can  form  a union and after forming one any  seven

men  can demand a secret ballot and may upset well-established and older established unions. I do  not

think this question of introducing secret balloting

to  ascertain whether a union should be  recognised

or  not  under the present circumstances  would  be

feasible and advisable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I would be loath to miss

the  opportunity to get complete unanimity  on  the

amendment,  but I would very much like to  add  the

following words to the amended motion so as to give

some teeth to it. I was considering that the motion

should be amended to read,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House urges the Government to compel

the  Singapore  Harbour  Board  to  accept  and  to

implement.'.



<br><br>Now,   Sir,  I  see  nothing  wrong  in  compelling

somebody  to do what is right. In fact, it  is  the

duty   of   the  Government  to  see   that   where

commonsense and reasonableness do not prevail, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



compulsion begins. However, I have not been able to

obtain the support of the other Parties to this and

I  am therefore left in a position either to accept

the amendment, or to lose my motion by default.  On

the  balance,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I am  inclined  to

accept  the  amendment  but  on  this  very   clear

understanding, that if by the next sitting of  this

House,  these  findings have not been accepted  and

implemented, then the other Parties in  this  House

will  join me in asking the Government to take more

drastic  action  to  see  that  the  findings   and

recommendations are accepted. I understand from the

leader  of  the  Liberal-Socialist Party  that  his

Party would be very much in favour of that, should,

after   a   reasonable  period  has  elapsed,   the

Singapore  Harbour Board and its new  chairman  and

the  old  Chief  Minister  still  be  in  the  same

position  vis-a-vis  the  Singapore  Harbour  Board

Staff   Association  and  its  12   "un-re-engaged"

lascars and ten workers still suspended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I cannot accept the Hon. the Chief

Minister's view that it is just a suggestion of the

Court of Inquiry that there should be a ballot. The

actual words are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We would suggest that such evidence be collected

in the form of a secret ballot.".



<br><br>But  in the context of the chapter under which this

sentence  appears,  it  is  a  clear  finding   and

recommendation  of  the  Court.   It   says   here,

paragraph  9 -  Industrial  Relations - Administrative

Practices - The Issue of Recognition - and under  "The

Issue  of Recognition", it is stated that it should

be resolved by evidence "collected in the form of a

secret ballot by members whose names appear on  the

membership cards of the SHBWU and the SHBSA."  This

is  not a suggestion, particularly where one of the

members  of that Tribunal represented the  shipping

interests  of Singapore, namely Mr D.  W.  Holder.

This  is a unanimous recommendation. There  was  no

dissenting   voice  even  from   Mr   Holder   who

represented  the  shipping  interests  and  who  is

interested in the Singapore Harbour Board and its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



smooth operation more than any other businessman in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would urge the Hon. the Chief Minister,

before  he commits himself to a statement  of  high

policy  on very short reflection that he is  unable

to  accept this, to re-consider the matter  and  in

particular  to seek the advice of his Trades  Union

Congress  as to whether or not this is  good  trade

union  practice. The Singapore Harbour Board  Staff

Association  has  taken  the  matter  up  with  the

Singapore  Trades  Union Congress  and  the  Trades

Union  Congress, I am quite sure, will be  able  to

assist  and  guide the Hon. the Chief  Minister  in

arriving at the correct decision, namely, that  the

matter  should be resolved by the free will of  the

members. One cannot have eight or nine unions  each

with the minimum number of members (seven). In  the

evidence  of  the  Court of Inquiry,  some  of  the

committee  members themselves were in default  with

their  subscriptions. They are bogus  empty  unions

and the sooner a sense of proportion and reality is

established   in   employer/employee   relationship

between the Singapore Harbour Board and the  union,

the  better  it  is  for the smooth  operation  and

development of the port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out,

be left out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be
