<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>LEGAL AID AND ADVICE ORDINANCE, 1956</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Chief Minister

what  steps, if any, are being taken to bring  the

Legal   Aid  and  Advice  Ordinance,  1956,   into

operation;  which portions thereof it is  intended

to bring into operation first, and when.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   discussions   were   held   with

representatives of the Bar Committee  towards  the

end  of  August  with  a  view  to  clearing  away

difficulties which might prevent the Bar Committee

recommending the profession to give its support to

the  measure.  Since then, other and  more  urgent

matters have been occupying my attention. I  hope,

however, that further progress



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>

will be made in this matter in the near future. In

the meanwhile, I am unable to give the hon. Member

the other information which he seeks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, I would ask the Chief

Minister  what prevents the establishment  now  of

the  Department for Legal Aid and Advice? It takes

time   to   appoint  officials  and  to  have   an

organisation. Why do we not start now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, it is felt that before

we   start  organising  the  Department,  the  co-operation  of the Bar Committee should be  assured

to this Government.

to give the number of arrests between 25th October

and 31st October, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for rioting;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for breaking curfew;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) for other offences.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> (a) 290 persons were arrested for rioting;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 962 for breaking curfew;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 912 under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) 55 for other offences not necessarily

connected with the riots.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



persons  arrested under the Preservation of  Public

Security  Ordinance within the aforementioned  period

who were detained -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for 24 hours or less;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for 48 hours or less;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) for less than 16 days;



<br><br>and  the  number of persons against whom  Detention

Orders  have been made by the Governor  in  Council

between 1st October and 18th November, 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Of the persons arrested under

the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 320 were detained for 24 hours or less;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 2 were detained for more than 24 hours but not more than 48;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 184 were detained for more than 48 hours but less than 16 days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1st October and 18th November, Detention

Orders have been made in respect of 216 persons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Do I understand, Sir, that in the

circumstances  there are 194 still under  detention

whose cases are being considered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> No, Sir. The procedure under the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance  is  that

unless  a Detention Order is made before the expiry

of  the  time during which the police may detain  a

person, he must be released.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, but I understand that 912 were

arrested  under the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance.  Of these, 502 have been released.  That

leaves  us  410  not released. Of these,  Detention

Orders  have been made against 216. That leaves  us

194 unaccounted for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> The question, I take it, Sir, is: Will

I  please account for them? I will try and do that,

Sir. It is quite true that there are a number  who

are  not  covered  by the answers  I  gave  to  the

question  originally put to me. The explanation  of

that  is  this, Sir, that a number of  persons  who

were  originally arrested by the police under their

powers conferred by section 17 (b)  of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



the  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance were

later  found to have been concerned with  incidents

such as curfew breaking and rioting and even arson,

and  they  have  therefore been charged  under  the

ordinary  laws  of the colony. The  explanation  is

that  a  number of persons who were held originally

under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance

are  now  being  charged in the  ordinary  way  for

criminal offences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> One more question, Sir. Of these

194, how many are, in fact, now detained under  the

Banishment Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> The hon. Member is quite right, Sir. I

did  omit to say that there are a comparatively few

who are now held under banishment procedure. I have

not  the figures available, but I think it is about

30.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Thank you.

is  the State or official religion of the Colony of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, there is no State or official religion of the colony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making provisional allocations of funds for

various services for the next five years,

it  has been assumed that by 1961-2, on the  basis

of  In making provisional allocations of funds  for

various  services for the next five years,  it  has

been  assumed  that  by 1961-2,  on  the  basis  of

existing  plans,  expenditure on  defence  services

generally  may  be of the order of  $18  million  a

year.  This  estimate  includes  both  capital  and

recurrent  expenditure. However, as the  plans  for

the  defence  services of Singapore are  now  under

revision,  this estimate must also be  regarded  as

subject  to  revision. It will not be  possible  to

make  a  new estimate until the revised plans  have

been finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to contributions to Commonwealth

defence, the Contribution to Imperial

Defence   Ordinance  (Chapter  64  of  the  Revised

Edition) prescribes that an annual contribution  of

$4  million  will be made to imperial defence  from

the funds of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.

After  the war, when the Settlements of Penang  and

Malacca  became part of the Federation  of  Malaya,

liability for this contribution was apportioned and

Singapore's  share became $2,628,000. It  was  then

agreed  with  Her  Majesty's Government  that  this

contribution   might   be   devoted   to    meeting

expenditure  on the Royal Malayan Navy and  special

expenditure  on  the Malayan Royal Naval  Volunteer

Reserve.   In  the  early  years  after  the   war,

expenditure on these forces did not come up to  the

level  of the defence contribution and the balances

were held in the Royal Malayan Navy Fund for use in

future  when expenditure on the Royal Malayan  Navy

and  the  Malayan  Royal  Naval  Volunteer  Reserve

increased. This expenditure has increased  and  the

Fund has slowly been run down until now in 1956  it

is exhausted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I had hoped

by   the  question  to  elicit  an  indication   of

Government's policy towards defence forces for  the

next  five years, but we have been given  what,  in

fact,  is available now on the papers before us.  I

would   ask   the   Financial   Secretary   whether

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  seems  to me that it is usual for the Financial

Secretary year in and year out to tell us  that  we

must be taxed more and that the future is bleak. In

fact,  such  a  warning was given by the  Financial

Secretary in the Official Report, Vol. 1,  No.  19,

dated  21st November, 1955, at col. 1063  where  he

said  that he was not going to be accused of crying

wolf  once more and that we were going to be  faced

"with the hard reality of actual deficits". Now  we

are coming to the end of 1956 and we know the exact

position, and the position is that we still have  a

surplus.  Invariably there is always a  surplus  in

the  matter  of collection of taxes. This  fact  is

known  by everybody almost every year and in effect

the Financial Secretary admits it. On page 1 of his

Budget speech he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all, it seems likely that revenue collections

will amount to about $217 million compared with the

estimate of $215 million."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, the Financial Secretary admits

that the estimate for tax collection is always low,

whereas the estimate for expenditure will always be

higher than it should be. Why is it so? I think  it

is  just  to  create the impression that additional

taxation is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 2 of his Budget speech in the second paragraph, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...that the working for 1956 will show a small surplus, possibly of the order of $2 or $3 million."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an admission by the Financial Secretary himself, Sir, and it is important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on page 5, in the fourth paragraph, he says:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...actual expenditure has in the past in variably

fallen  short of the estimate. It is  likely  that

this will occur again in 1957."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again on page 6 the same tune is played, and

here he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...it is possible that actual expenditure will

fall considerably short of the estimate."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Budget speech the Financial Secretary

has   drawn   our  attention  to  the   fact   that

expenditure  will not be as high as  has  been  put

forward in the Estimates. It is significant that he

has  drawn our attention to it more than once and,

because  he  is  supposed to be an  expert  on  the

subject,  we  must  believe that  expenditure  will

definitely fall short of the estimate as  presented

by  the  Government. Now here we have a case  where

every year you are going to have the collection  of

revenue  more  than  the actual expenditure  which,

according  to  the estimate put out, will  be  less

than  what is presented to us, and in the end there

will  always be a surplus. This has been  going  on

through  the  years. Every year we  have  had  this

state  of  affairs, and this leads us  to  ask  the

question whether there is any necessity at all  for

further taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, with all the warnings by the

Financial  Secretary that the future is  bleak,  we

must   tighten  our  belts,  we  must   pay   more,

expenditure  is  mounting and all  that,  all  this

tends  to  give the impression to hon.  Members  in

this  House as well as to the public at large  that

we  are  in real need of further taxation when,  in

fact,  from  all that has been said,  there  is  no

necessity at all. Perhaps it is just the  way  with

everybody, just like boys between the ages of 8 and

10,  that it is a habit to hoard some money. It  is

just  an instinct with Government, I think, to want

to  feel the money in its pocket and jingle it  and

say,  "Now, I have the money and if I want to spend

it  on anything extravagant, I can do it. There  is

no  need  to  cut my coat according to  the  cloth.

There  is no need to think of saving on this little

item  or that. The public will pay whenever we  tax

them, because the power is in our hands. So long as

we  have  money, well, it is public money, although

we  may have contributed a little to it in the  way

of  income  tax.  So let us spend  it,  let  us  be

generous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



with  it." If that is the case, Sir, I think it  is

absolutely wrong. We are here as guardians  of  the

people's money. We have to spend it wisely. We must

think  of  every cent that has to be spent.  It  is

because  it is other people's money, the public's

money,  that we should exercise even more  care  in

spending it or even in wanting it. I cite  you  one

case,  Sir.  The Government promised  us  something

last  year during the debate on the Second  Reading

of  the  Appropriation Bill, but I am still looking

forward  to  that promise being kept. I refer  hon.

Members  to  the same Official Report that  I  have

just quoted from, this time at col. 1010, where the

Chief   Minister   (he  is  now  the   Member   for

Cairnhill),  in  reply to a  question  by  my  hon.

Friend  the Member for Tiong Bahru on the  question

of  the  personal emoluments of the civil  service,

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am far from complacent about the expenditures

of  the  Government. We have been seven  months  in

office, Sir, and this sort of axing is not done  in

a day. I certainly intend to pursue methods which I

have  in  mind for greater reduction in expenditure

in the future."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, was a promise by the then Chief

Minister   to   look  into  the   matter   of   the

expenditures  of  the Government.  Today,  Sir,  we

still  have, with the exception of one Member,  the

same   people  sitting  on  the  Government   Front

Benches, and I expect that, because it is a  Labour

Front  Coalition Government, it will carry out  the

same promises that it has made to the people, and I

hope  that regarding this matter it will carry  out

its  promise. According to the Budget,  however,  I

think  the increase is in the region of $98 million

to  $113  million. That is a big jump for  personal

emoluments.  I think the Government in this  matter

did  try and tell the public, "We will try our best

and streamline the Government. We have, in fact, an

Organisation Committee to streamline everything, to

advise  us  on methods, to advise us  on  ways  and

means  of  giving a more efficient service  to  the

public  and at a lesser cost." Yet, with all  these

methods    and   streamlining   experts,    nothing

substantial has been produced. In fact, if we  draw

a  graph on a matter of expenditure of this nature,

we will find that it goes on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



-I  will  say Y is equal to MX plus C, which  is  a

straight  line graph, showing that it is  going  up

all the time. Nothing more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us consider again whether Government

actually needs all this extra money by taxation for

next  year's Budget. During the Second  Reading  we

heard  from the Financial Secretary that the relief

for  income  tax  will be lowered  from  $3,000  to

$2,500 for a single individual, and that this is  a

"must". Sir, I have received news again through the

Press that the Government has waived that reduction

and  has  restored  the floor  for  income  tax  to

$3,000.  This  is  really  commendable - that   the

Government can still take heed of public opinion. I

do  not  quarrel  with granting  relief  to  people

paying  income tax, but one thing which strikes  me

is  this.  Here you have a government  telling  the

people  that we need more money. We must raise  our

money  by income tax and by more tax. We must raise

money  by  taxing  cigarettes, by taxing  on  other

vices  like  sweepstakes and so on.  We  must  have

direct  taxation.  We must have indirect  taxation.

All these are "musts". And after the Government has

said  that  all  these are "musts",  we  find  that

suddenly,  because there is pressure from  outside,

it  is  going to be unpopular, people are going  to

throw mud at the Government more than is necessary,

the  Government  says, "Oh  no,  we  are  going  to

replace  that $500 tax relief. No, we do  not  need

that much money from taxation of that kind. We  can

make up for that. We can still spend our money  and

not  feel  the shortage." Let me put the case  this

way. If the Government needs money and collects  it

by that sort of taxation, and then it withdraws the

proposal  to impose that kind of taxation,  then  I

believe that every time it wants to impose a tax on

something  and  enough  opposition  is  whipped  up

against  it,  I am sure the Government  will  in  a

similar way withdraw and say, "We will withdraw the

taxation - ".



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> We are democrats and not dictators.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Exactly, exactly! So we have

this  sort  of  affair going on  every  time.  The

Government  says it is going to tax something  and

that  it is a "must", but when it comes up against

opposition,  it  withdraws.  So  its  "musts"  are

actually  elastic ones and not like  an  unbending

metal  rod. You cannot twist it, nor can you  bend

it.  In  fact,  I  think  there  is  no  necessity

whatsoever for any taxation. There is no need  for

increased  taxation. You can spend the  amount  of

money  derived from the old tax and that  will  be

more than sufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us look at the proposed taxation

programme of the Government. The first item on the

list  is  income  tax. I would like  to  draw  the

attention  of  the Government to its old  election

pledge -  that it will only tax those who are  most

able  to  bear the burden. It is a very good  idea

but  the point is how to carry it out in practice.

Theory  is one thing, practice is another. If  you

say one thing is good and then you do not practise

it,  then  what will people think about  you?  Not

much, I am afraid!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He is talking!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am talking! In the matter

of  taxation  there are two ways.  One  is  direct

taxation,  by  way  of income tax.  The  other  is

indirect taxation. If we have direct taxation, and

income tax, then we really put the burden on those

who  can best bear it, because in income tax those

who  earn  more will pay more and those  who  earn

less  will  pay less. I think that is the  fairest

way   of  taxation.  In  the  matter  of  indirect

taxation,   you  find  so  many  people   in   the

streets - whether  they are rich or poor - indulge  in

their  little vices and their bad habits  with  no

distinction,  and, in fact, many of  the  rich  do

not.  So,  if  any money is to be drawn  from  the

public,  the  rich man will pay his little  share,

probably in the ratio of one in half a million.  I

am  talking of adults. I do not know, but  it  may

extend  to  young people, and that will even  make

the  share  of  a rich man less. On this  type  of

taxation you tax not only on the bad habits of the

people,  such  as smoking, gambling and  drinking,

but I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



am  afraid  that it will also touch on  the  daily

necessities of everybody. I will come to that soon

enough. So if the Government is going to carry out

its policy and say that tax is going to be imposed

on  those who can best afford it, it must not have

direct   taxation  and  then  indirect   taxation.

Indirect  taxation must be reduced to the absolute

minimum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> No schools, no teachers!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Do not worry about that. We

will  have plenty of them! It is only a matter  of

how you spend your money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Manufacture it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> There is no need to

manufacture  anything of that sort.  On  a  matter

like  this,  it  is just like a  firm  engaging  a

manager. The manager will say, "We will spend this

and  we  will  spend that and we will  gather  our

income  this way and that way." But if at the  end

of the financial year it is found that the manager

is  not going to make his ends meet, not only will

the  shop  have  to  close down  but  the  manager

himself will get the sack. He will be very glad to

supplement  the tax programme of the Labour  Front

Coalition Government if he gets unemployed! Let us

come  back  to  the first item of  taxation - income

tax.  The Government is now proposing to  do  away

with  the  lowering of that $500  relief,  but  it

still  intends to do away with the three per  cent

and  the  four per cent and change these rates  to

five  per  cent.  Sir,  in  this  connection   the

Financial  Secretary stated that a programme  like

this  would  bring in an income  of  roughly  $1.5

million.  This  is  a  small  sum,  but   if   the

Government takes away that $500, as it intends  to

do,  and only changes the rates of three per  cent

and  four per cent to five per cent, then the only

people  who  will be affected will be the  present

income  taxpayers - only  19,000  persons.  It   can

easily be calculated that each person is going  to

pay the Government roughly -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> $15 on chargeable income.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> $15 extra. So $15 multiplied by 19,000 comes up to a very negligible sum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Quarter of a million dollars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Good for one trip to Kuala

Lumpur  or Hongkong or a trip to England to observe

transport! Sir, it is my firm conviction that  such

a  revision of taxation, which brings in no visible

increase,   no  substantial  increase,  should   be

dropped  immediately. In fact, the people  who  are

being  taxed now - the 19,000 people - are paying quite

a large percentage of the revenue of the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> What we need is a more

efficient Income Tax Department to bring  in  those

who  have  not yet been taxed but are  within  that

taxable  range. As far as income tax is  concerned,

Sir, I know that we only grant relief to the income

taxpayer,  his  wife  and  his  children.  Let   us

remember that we are living in the East and in  the

East the set-up of the family is entirely different

from that in the West. In the East the parents  are

considered  as an integral part of the  family,  in

fact,  the most important part of the family.  When

the  children grow up and after they have  obtained

their  education and are able to earn their living,

they  will, by custom and tradition, support  their

parents. In fact, it is their duty to do so.  This,

Sir,  is  one of the best attributes of  those  who

live in the East. The family ties are strong. So we

have  here the case of the taxpayer supporting  his

parents, instead of the father running along to the

Social Welfare Department and saying, "Sir, I  have

no job and my son is not supporting me. I must live

on  the  public dole." The public dole is  $15  per

person.  If you calculate the number of old parents

who  depend  on  the dole, you will find  that  the

money  given  out comes up to a very sizeable  sum.

That sum of money should have come from Government,

but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



it  is  saved  for  the  Government.  Why  is  this

expenditure   saved?  Because   of   this   Chinese

tradition,  that  the son who is  able  to  earn  a

living  should  support his  parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this House, Sir, have declared ourselves to be staunch

supporters  of  the cultures of the East.  We  have

said  that  we  support  Chinese  culture,  Indian

culture  and so on, but we must prove that  we  are

really supporting it by implementing measures which

will convince the public at large that we recognise

that  fact  and that we will do it. The  Government

has  had  troubles with the Chinese school students

who said, "You are destroying Chinese culture", and

they told the Chief Minister, "Chinese culture says

that  we  must  hsueh  hsi" and  the  Minister  for

Education said, "You must respect the teachers  and

honour   your   parents."  Here,   then,   is   the

opportunity for the Government to ram home the fact

to  the  people of Singapore that it  is  going  to

uphold Chinese culture and it is going to amend its

laws  in  accordance with the way of  life  of  the

people  in  the East. If you are talking about  the

West,  then  you  may object to  my  talking  about

people  in  the  East. But let us also  talk  about

England.  Let  us  talk about  America.  These  are

countries that the Government likes. In America and

in  England you still have relief for parents,  and

if  you  look it up, you will find that in  special

cases  they give allowances to such people. So  why

cannot  we  in  Singapore do that? If  we  do  that

faster  and  quicker, it will  be  better  for  us. [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the 3 per cent and 4 per cent rates of

taxation  again,  Sir,  it  is  contrary   to   the

principles  of  the  Labour Front.  The  burden  of

taxation will not be on those who are more able  to

bear  it,  but  it  will be on everybody  who  pays

income  tax;  in  other words, everybody  must  pay

additional tax. Whether it is $15, or $10,  or  $2,

or  $1,  it  is  still taxation. If the  Government

obtains  $1 by income tax, $5 by taxing cigarettes,

$10  by taxing petrol, and so much by another  kind

of  taxation,  you will find that the  poor  worker

will have to pay, not just $5 or $10, but much more

than you think they do. Now it is said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



$2,  $5 or $10 is a very small sum, but let me tell

the Government this - the value of money today is not

what  it  should be. If you compare  the  value  of

money  in 1940 with what it is now, you will  find,

in  all probability, that the value of money now is

only one-fifth of what it was in 1940. I am putting

this  case  not  because you must spend  more,  but

because  I  am going to talk about the  taxpayer  -[Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member will

address  his remarks to the Chair, I think he  will

not be interrupted so frequently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, Sir. The barrage has

started from the opposite Benches, Sir, and  it  is

only  right  that they should receive  a  salvo  in

reply!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was talking about the poor income-tax

payer. We tax on $3,000, but if you think about its

value as compared to 1940 or so, it will roughly be

$600 and that will work out to $50 a month, and $50

a  month  even  in 1940, Sir, would  not  ensure  a

person a good standard of living. This person  will

not  have sufficient for his needs and, because  of

the  set-up in the East, it is not only his parents

that  he  must feed and look after, but once  in  a

while  one  or two unemployed relatives  will  come

running  to him for a little financial help - it  may

be $5 or $10 - and sometimes these unfortunate people

may  have  to  be  given shelter and  lodging,  and

further  he  may  unwillingly have  to  take  in  a

helping  hand. My contention, then, is that  income

tax relief should not only be restored as it is now

to  $3,000,  but  also include further  relief  for

parents.  Everybody recognises that it is the  duty

of  children to honour their parents. It is one  of

the  Commandments in the Bible. So it is  with  the

Muslims   and  the  Indians,  too.   It   is   with

everybody's  belief. Let us show them that  we  are

different from the West where parents can  be  left

out after they have brought us up. The old folks go

to  old-age  homes. They get government dole.  They

get  old-age pensions. As an illustration,  I  know

that the following case can happen in England. If I

am  a friend of the son and I want to go to another

place  where the son's father is staying,  the  son

will send his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



father  a  cheque, say, of £5 and he will  ask  his

father to entertain me on his account. The son will

then tell the father to send him back the bill  for

entertainment  expenses and also to send  back  the

balance  if  there is any remaining. I  have  known

cases like this personally, but in our Chinese set-up,  it is not like this. My father's friend is  my

friend  and  my friend is also my father's  friend,

and  if my father has not enough money to entertain

his friend, it is my duty to give it to him. And if

I cannot afford it but my father can, he will do it

for  me.  When my father brought me up, he gave  me

everything that I had and now it is only  a  return

of his generosity. Nothing else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Sir, the Financial Secretary telling us

that  in the United Kingdom people are being  taxed

much  more - 7½ per cent at the minimum. He  says  we

have  lower  taxation here and we still grumble.  I

will not grumble, Sir, if we follow it even in  the

higher  ranges  of income. But I am  not  going  to

follow little bits here and little bits there  just

to  suit the purpose of the Government. No, Sir,  I

am not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the tax on tobacco. Oh, tobacco is

not  essential! If you do not smoke cigarettes, you

will  not starve and you will not die! Yes, Sir,  I

agree  with  his views. So we increase the  tax  on

cigarettes.  So the poor man in the  street,  after

hearing of the increased tax on cigarettes  by  the

Government,  will  make a resolution  and  say,  "I

shall  not smoke from today on." Other people  will

make  the resolution, "Whereas in the past  I  have

been  smoking ten cigarettes a day. I will now  cut

it down to three."



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Smoke local cigarettes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, whether it is local

cigarettes  or high-class cigarettes, it  comes  to

the  same thing, it is still cigarettes, no  matter

what  it is. And all the resolutions about breaking

off  the  habit  of  smoking  cigarettes  will   be

forgotten in a week's time, and so the poor  worker

will  come  back again to the original position  of

smoking  as much as he did before and he  will  not

change  his brand of cigarettes either, because  he

is addicted to that, Sir. Then what happens?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Support local industry!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Money is again taken from the

working  masses. I am not prepared to quarrel  with

higher  taxation on cigarettes, not like the P.A.P.

The  Government can carry on taxing  cigarettes.  I

will  not also say that I am going to criticise  it

severely,  but  there is one aspect of  the  matter

which I think the Government should know and should

study very carefully, and it is this. The poor  man

will  now  have  to pay more for his  tobacco.  His

source of income is only from his employer; and  if

he  has to pay more, it means he will have less for

his family; and if he is going to have less for the

family, he is not going to be contented. He is  not

going  to sit down and say, "Well, son, we are  not

going  to  have  fish  today.  Let  us  have  dried

prawns." So, somehow or other, he will have to take

it  out  from  his  employer. The  consequences  of

increasing  taxation, so that the poor people  will

have  to  pay more, will be that they will have  to

demand  higher  wages; and if  they  demand  higher

wages,   then  there  will  be  higher   costs   of

production and sooner or later you may not be  able

to  compete with manufactures from other countries.

Support your local industry when probably you  will

be  manufacturing just sufficient  for  your  local

consumption  and  will not be able  to  export - that

will be a sorry state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at the tax on driving licences,

Sir. It  is  again a very small  sum.  Who  cannot

afford  an extra $3 a year? It works out to exactly

25  cents a month, so said the Financial Secretary.

An  extra few dollars for petrol; another extra few

dollars  for  tobacco; and with the  spiralling  of

prices and inflation and so on, again it hurts  the

workers.  Again the burden of tax is not placed  on

those who can bear it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> On the tuan besars then?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Oh, yes, you will usually

find that the tuan besar sits in his motor-car  and

a  syce,  whose pay is roughly $100 a  month,  will

drive it. How many tuan besars will worry about $3?

If  the  Government ever says that they are worried

over this $3, then tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



them.  But  I affirm that the increase  of  driving

licence  fees  is  a  taxation which  is  aimed  at

getting money not from those who can afford it  but

from  the  general masses. It will hurt them  to  a

greater or lesser degree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, we heard that there would be an

increase  of only five cents per gallon on  petrol.

That  would not hurt. Five cents would not  matter.

Everybody could afford to pay an extra five  cents.

Then  this year we are told that there will  be  an

increase of seven cents per gallon on petrol.  Sir,

I  find it very tiring to hear that whatever  other

people  do,  we  must do. Whether it  is  right  or

wrong, let us do it. Why? Because somebody else has

done  it.  Sir, my argument is this: last year  the

increase  on  petrol was five cents a gallon;  this

year  it  is seven cents; next year it  may  be  20

cents; another year it may be 40 cents; and  so  on

we  keep on adding, and each time we are told it is

only  a small increase. Sir, as an example, let  us

take  a  piece of cake. If we keep, on cutting  off

small  pieces,  there must come a time  when  there

will be no more cake left. If the tax on petrol  is

increased,  but  we  have a good  transport  system

whereby everybody can get a bus easily, then I will

not quarrel with that, but our transport system  is

horrible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Hear, hear! [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, one day I was waiting at

Finlayson Green for an omnibus, and do you know how

long  I  had  to  wait for that Singapore  Traction

Company  omnibus?  One hour to  be  exact - half-past

four   until   half-past  five  in   the   evening. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, as an Assemblyman it

does not prohibit me from taking an omnibus, or for

that  matter any kind of transport. In  fact,  Sir,

every Assemblyman here should try and live the life

of  a  simple worker so that he can understand  the

conditions  under which the worker lives.  What  is

the  use  of  talking in the Assembly  that  he  is

working in the interests of the worker



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



when  he does not know how a worker lives? Now that

is  the  state of affairs prevailing. There  is  no

good   transport  system.  Therefore,  small   cars

costing  $3,000 or $4,000 each, with a  consumption

of  50 miles a gallon or so, are an essential  part

of  the  transport  system, and although  they  are

private transport in that they carry the owners  or

the  owners'  friends, still  they  assist  in  the

transport system. Sir, if these small private  cars

were   to  break  down  and  thereby  prevent   the

transport of children to school, imagine the  chaos

that  would take place. I think it did happen once.

Even with the use of lorries, how many hours do you

think  it  will take to bring the children  to  and

from  their  schools?  Sir, the  increased  tax  on

petrol  will definitely affect transport.  In  this

case,  it will, of course, affect the middle  class

of  people,  those who own small cars for  a  small

family.  But  to  those who are in  the  very  high

income group, whether petrol is going to cost $2 or

$3  or  $5  or  $10  a gallon, it does  not  matter

because money comes in easily and they have  enough

to  eat, to entertain their friends and also enough

to spare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there is the tax on gin and rum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Poor man!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I hear the words "poor

man", but I say this - those who increase taxation of

this kind are only aiming to protect those who  can

afford to pay more taxes.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Who drinks gin?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It does not matter, Sir,

whether  it  is  gin or rum or whether  it  is  the

purchase  of  a  sweepstake ticket. The  buying  of

sweepstake tickets is indulged in not by  the  rich

mostly  but by the poor who hope one day to  win  a

lottery and then be in a position to live in a  big

house  and have nothing to worry about. Of  course,

if we tax more from this bracket of people, then we

need to tax less from the higher income group. That

aim, Sir, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



contrary  to the principles of the Labour Front.  I

am only telling you, Sir, what the Labour Front has

promised us and what it should carry out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Join the Labour Front.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> God forbid, Sir! I will not

join  the Labour Front. In fact, I wish they  might

join  me so that we can have cleaner air and a more

efficient system of running business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next taxation is on cars - ten per cent on

every  car. Whether that car is going to  cost  you

$3,000  or $7,000 or $10,000 or $20,000, it is  ten

per  cent tax. I do not quarrel with that. I do not

say that car tax is wrong. In fact, I think car tax

is  quite  right, but I just want you to  think  in

this  fashion.  We have many people  who  are  just

earning  an  income of $400 or $500  a  month,  and

because of the present transport difficulties, they

save up to buy a car. I ask you, Sir, how long will

it  take  a  middle-class wage-earner  to  save  up

$4,000 to buy a car? It takes a lot of time. If the

tax  is  increased another ten per cent,  it  means

another  ten  per  cent of the time  to  save  that

money. What is about to be within his reach is  now

a  little  further away. Let us  then  see  how  it

affects  the  people  who are  going  to  buy  cars

costing  $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000. They will  go

to  the salesroom and tell the manager to show them

the  best cars. "$11,000? Oh, just send me the  car

and  I will sign a cheque for it." There is no such

need  for saving. The money is there ready. Whether

the  increased tax is ten per cent or  fifteen  per

cent,  it does not affect them very much. It  would

have  been saner and more acceptable to the  public

if such taxation were done on a sliding scale, like

that  of income tax. You put a tax of five per cent

on  a  car costing. $4,000 c.i.f.; ten per cent  on

one that costs $6,000 or $7,000 c.i.f.; 15 per cent

on  one that costs $8,000 or so; and 25 per cent or

30  per  cent  on one ranging between  $10,000  and

$20,000 c.i.f. Taxation on such a scale would  have

been  fairer  and more acceptable;  something  that

would  go along with Government's declared  policy.

How often must I remind them of their policy, Sir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cap it all, Sir, the Government say that they

must  have luxury tax. If it is expected  that  the

people  of Singapore will say, "Yes, we will  agree

with luxury tax, because it will not affect us,"  I

think the people will be badly misled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> How do you know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Past events, Sir, have made

me wise. The first item that comes into our head as

a  luxury  will  be an air-conditioning  set.  Yes,

everybody  will echo that. Then the next item  will

be something that will not evoke many "yeses".



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, not from people who earn

about  $13,000 a month audited income! Then  we  go

along    to   the   next   item   on   the   luxury

list - jewellery.  Oh,  yes,  diamond  earrings   and

bangles are luxuries. The poor worker goes  into  a

goldsmith's shop and asks, "That gold bangle that I

am  about  to buy, and that little gold  ring,  are

they  luxury items?" The definition of the law says

it is so and you have to pay tax -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Many more "noes" will come in

this  direction. When you start to define "luxury",

you will not know where to stop.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> I will not stop you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Where will a greedy

government  stop?  Probably it will  say  the  same

thing as the Federation Government - we need all that

taxation. I hope, Sir, we are not going  to  be  as

lavish  as  all that - to copy on a matter of  higher

taxation  but  not  on  a matter  of  more  liberal

socialist  schemes. I think these additional  taxes

are  just  nonsensical. They are just not necessary

and  they  are  contrary to  the  Government's  own

principles, and if it were wise enough,  it  should

drop each and every one of them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this talk on income tax, Sir, it is

important that we find out where all the money that

the  Government has taxed will go to.  Needless  to

say,   over  40  per  cent  will  go  to   personal

emoluments, and we are still looking forward to the

Government  to  streamline  its  service  with  its

methods advisers and all sorts of advisers in order

to   have  increased  efficiency  at  lesser  cost.

Further,  a  lot  of money will go  into  what  the

Financial  Secretary has said  at  page  2  of  his

Budget  speech - change  of  ideas  and  plans.   The

relevant part reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In some cases, sites have proved more unstable

than  was  originally thought and extensive  piling

and  preparation has been required. In some  cases,

changes in plan have caused delays."



<br><br>Let  us see the change of plans again, Sir, on page

9  of  his Budget speech as compared with  what  he

said  at col. 1064 of the Official Report, Vol.  1,

No. 19 dated 21st November, 1955, where he said, on

district hospitals:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been explained that we have changed our

plan and that we are now going to Kallang...".



<br><br>On  page  9  of his speech this year the  Financial

Secretary says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A start is to be made with the new District

Hospital which it has now been decided to  site  at

Tanah Merah Kechil."



<br><br>How  many  changes are we going  to  have?  Is  the

Government going to change its plans every now  and

then  when  every  change will  involve  a  further

expenditure  of  money,  sometimes  a  few  hundred

thousand  dollars  and  sometimes  a  few   million

dollars?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Savings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Savings! Everytime there is a

change  of plans, there is an additional unforeseen

expenditure. If Government cannot make up its mind,

then  I say that it is government inefficiency  and

government shortsightedness. When Government wishes

to build a hospital, it visualises one that will be

grand   and   beautiful  and  equipped  with   air-

conditioning  plants, rest rooms  for  doctors  and

nurses, and rooms for V.I.P. visitors who might  be

going round the hospital; and so we have a hospital

built at a cost of millions of dollars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



During  previous debates I have pointed out to  the

Government  that a hospital is built  primarily  to

heal  people,  and if you build cheap hospitals  on

the  model of the old Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  they

will  still cure, they will still heal people,  and

people will still flock to them to be treated. This

is  the  case where, if you build a cheap hospital,

it   will  not  give  the  particular  V.I.P. the

opportunity  of  declaring it  open  in  a  flowery

speech. Other reasons have been given. One is  that

space  is  limited  and  therefore  we  must  build

upwards. I tell you, Sir, there is plenty of  space

and  land.  There is still cheap land going  around

and  Government can acquire it if it  acts  quickly

enough,  and will not be short-sighted  until  the

price  has gone up further. Of course, we now  have

the  Land  Acquisition  Ordinance  to  protect  the

Government   and  since  we  have   that   measure,

Government  should exercise it and save  the  money

that  is contributed by the public. The Government,

Sir,  I  say it again, should try and make  up  its

mind  on everything, so that there need not be  any

change of plans or any change of ideas. I say  this

because  Government expects the  people  with  whom

they are dealing not to change their plans and  not

to  change  their  ideas. If a certain  institution

comes  along  to  the  Government  and  submits  an

estimate  of  a  plan  it has  in  mind  and  tells

Government  that it wishes the plan to  be  carried

out  in  a certain fashion and asks for a grant  of

$10,000,  the Government, after studying  the  plan

and  changing  it and slashing the  estimate,  will

say, "All right, the plan is now acceptable and  we

will  give you $8,000." But in the case of  members

of  the  public, they cannot however  change  their

plans  and change their ideas, because if they  do,

then  those  plans  will go through  only  after  a

matter  of  ten  more years. Of course,  being  the

Government, it has the privilege of being  able  to

change  its  plans  and its ideas  whenever  it  is

suitable. But I say to Government, try and  set  an

example to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further money, Sir, is going to be poured into

the  Singapore Improvement Trust in the  matter  of

loans, and some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



of  the  loans,  we have been told,  Sir,  will  be

changed  in that reference to them will not  appear

in  the Estimates. I am no accountant and so  I  do

not know much about that. I am only talking from  a

layman's point of view. However, I find myself in a

difficult  position trying to reconcile  the  large

sum  of money that has been given to an institution

which  is putting up buildings the rental for which

is   far   higher  than  that  charged  by  private

builders.  I  know  of  private  builders  building

houses along main thoroughfares renting out at  $70

per  flat  and $120 for the ground floor where  the

tenant  can  do  business. I know of S.I.T. houses

along Boon Keng Road which are rented out at $96  a

flat -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> $110.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> $110, and in Upper Pickering

Street, for shop houses -



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> $450.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> $450! Here you have a case,

Sir,  where the S.I.T. is not able to compete  with

the  private  builder in building  shophouses  or

flats  at  a cheaper rate and we are pouring  money

into it - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Never mind, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> We do mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Let us come to the cheaper

houses,  Sir.  Let us say that we will  admit  that

there  are  houses  that rake  in  $450  per  month

rental,  but  let  us take the  cheaper  ones.  The

cheapest houses that the S.I.T. can produce are the

Queenstown houses where people draw lots  for  them

at  $7,000  each.  $7,000,  and  that  is  with   a

government loan, but $7,000 is still too  high  for

the  Government to produce such a type of house.  I

know of private builders who give far greater value

for $7,000 because the tenant will be able to get a

bigger  piece of land and a bigger house. In  fact,

if I can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



be  excused  for  advertising, my hon.  Friend  the

Member  for  Paya  Lebar (Mr  Lim  Koon  Teck)  is

prepared  to build such houses at a lower cost  and

still is able to make a profit. He will be able  to

build  them  without  having  to  have  a  planning

office, a manager, and a big car park, and  so  on.

All these are additions that contribute to the high

cost of S.I.T. buildings. Do away with all that. Do

not  make  the organisation too top heavy  and  the

stage  will be reached where the S.I.T. can  build

houses  that are comparable with those produced  by

private builders. This is not just criticism,  Sir.

I am pointing out facts. If the Government is wise,

it  should  take note of such facts and investigate

them. Only then will it be justified in putting  up

loans and spending more of the people's money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the assessment that is levied on

people who own houses. Middle-class people do  find

it  difficult to build their own houses. They  have

no  money,  so  they  go along to  the  co-operative

societies  and ask for a loan to buy a house.  They

then  move  into  their house which  is  mortgaged.

There  is a housing shortage and Government  should

encourage people to own their own houses. If it  is

to  do this, it must offer some sort of inducement.

Sir, I will talk about Serangoon Garden Estate.  In

that  place  they are going to raise  the  rate  of

assessment to round about $750. I know  of  a  case

where the rent is assessed at $250 a month, and  20

per  cent of that is $50 a month assessment.  If  a

person who owns such a house is going to pay $50 on

assessment  alone,  then I think  he  would  rather

prefer to live in a cubicle, and let the Government

solve  its  own housing problem. But  I  am  afraid

Government will not be able to solve it because its

costs  will  be  too  high.  I  believe  that   the

assessment  rate  for people who own  and  live  in

their  own  houses should be as low as possible.  I

know  that  the Government, in reply to this,  will

say,  "We  are  not  levying such  heavy  taxes  on

everybody, but we are only levying them  on  people

who  rent  out their houses." But I say, Sir,  that

the  tax that Government levies even on people  who

live in their own houses is still too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



high.  This  is one way, and a very  good  way,  of

discouraging people from owning houses and one  way

of justifying how Government can spend more money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us look into another big item in the

Estimates.  Although it is important to know  where

the  money  has gone to, I think the more important

thing is where the money should go into but did not

get  into  the Estimates. We are now going  to  see

where the Government has omitted the very important

things. On page 5, paragraph 2 of his Budget speech

the Financial Secretary says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be noted that no provision is made for

the cost of Malayanisation ...".



<br><br>Sir,  I  thought  that  Malayanisation  is  a  very

important  point in the government  programme.  Why

has it not got into the Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Read further.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Are we to believe, Sir, that

there  will be no Malayanisation? Are we  going  to

believe that the speed is going to be slowed  down?

Of  course,  there was a rumour - but it was  only  a

rumour - that  $20 million was going to be  spent  on

Malayanisation, but so long as I do not see  it  in

the  Budget, then I know that the idea is still  in

the  formulation stage, and if it is in this stage,

the  Government, we know, has already shown us that

it  is  always  able to change its  plans  and  its

ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at another item: no provision for

the nationalisation of transport. Last year we were

treated to a very good debate on transport and  the

Minister  for Communications and Works stated  that

it  was  socialist policy to nationalise transport,

but  in  order  to  do it, we  must  not  move  too

quickly.  Of course, there has been another  change

of  plans  and ideas by the Labour Front  Coalition

Government.    "Yes,    socialism    believes    in

nationalisation of transport, but for us we can  be

slow about it, we cannot take it too seriously when

it comes to practice. Let us go slow on that." This

year when the Minister for Communications and Works

spent some of the public's money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



and  took a trip to the United Kingdom to study the

transport  system of London, that gave me  a  great

deal  of  encouragement and I said, "Soon  we  will

have a transport system comparable with the best in

the  world." Of course, when we have that hope,  we

must  have figures to support that hope. So I  look

through the Budget Estimates from the beginning  to

the end, searching diligently under every head, but

I  find  no  provision for the  nationalisation  of

transport.  When,  Sir,  will  nationalisation   of

transport come into being? Is there going to  be  a

delay? I suppose it will be implemented when we -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Have you read the White Paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> White Paper or no White

Paper, Sir, the most important thing is whether  it

gets into this Budget. If it does not get into  the

Budget,  it is still in the realm of ideas.  It  is

not even going to be a bit realistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another provision, Sir, which has been

left  out, probably after serious thought, and that

is:  by next year we shall have in Singapore a  few

District Councils and a City Council with  a  mayor

freely  elected. I put it to you, Sir,  this  is  a

step  forward  in  our constitutional  development.

This is the right direction where we should go.  We

should first establish our local councils and  then

we  will  be  able to tell the world  that  we  can

manage our own local affairs. Give us the whole  of

Singapore and we will be able to manage it as well.

But, Sir, there is no provision in this Budget. Are

we  going to have our local councils or are we not?

It  looks  as though we are not going to  have  our

local  councils.  It  looks  as  though  the   City

Council,  whose life the Government has  prolonged,

first, for one year -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> To our regret.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - and then for two years, is

now going to prolong it for another year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> To our greater regret.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We will talk about that, Sir,

when we come to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



debate  on  that  Bill and then the Government  can

have  its  say. But whatever it is, I protest  that

there  is  no  provision made for local  government

expenditures.  We still have the old  Rural  Board.

Sir, this is a case of the greatest importance  and

it  does  point out that in all probability  it  is

because  the Government is occupied with  something

else - what  it  is, I do not know,  maybe  something

airy - and has forgotten the most important thing.  I

say, if this is the case, it is inefficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look again, Sir, into another item. It is

one  that  has  been  provided  but  insufficiently

provided.  I  am looking through only  one  or  two

items,  I am not looking through the whole  lot.  I

just  pick them out at random. Probably by scrutiny

I  can  pick out more. I am now on education. There

is   a  disparity  in  the  treatment  afforded  to

Government  schools  and  that  offered  to   aided

schools.  Where  Government schools are  concerned,

everything is being paid for. In the case of  aided

schools,  there is a scheme whereby it is a  dollar

for  a dollar contribution. Here then, Sir, we have

two  categories of schools - Government  schools  and

aided schools. Regarding aided schools, the parents

of  the students, who have already been taxed, must

be  further taxed by contributions to the  schools,

so  that  they  can progress. As for  the  teaching

staff,  I will not say much about them and  I  will

declare my interest, because I am a teacher myself!

On  the  other hand, we have the Government schools

where  everything  necessary  is  provided  for  by

Government.  There  is  a  scheme  of  service  for

everybody  and  so they are all  happy.  I  do  not

grudge  that. But what I am thinking  of  is  this:

control  comes from right at the top.  Palmer  Road

controls  every school. One directive  from  Palmer

Road  and all schools will obey that directive.  It

looks to me as if there is too much centralisation.

It  looks  to  me as if the Government schools  are

going to train students who will probably behave in

exactly the same way if a certain external stimulus

is  applied; but as my hon. Friend the Minister for

Communications and Works has once said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



we  are  living in a democracy and we do  not  want

everybody to be thinking in the same vein. Each one

must  have his own will. I think the time has  come

for  Singapore to adopt an education  policy  which

will  not  be  too  centralised, that  each  school

should  be governed by a Board of Governors - whether

it  is Government, or Government-aided - and all  the

schools are under one central organisation. I would

ask the Government not to be afraid of this because

we  already  have an example in the  Federation  of

Malaya,  and  if we do that, it will  be  one  step

forward towards democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I heard the Hon. the Chief Secretary

mention  just  now  the  Chinese  High  School.  Of

course, that has been a pet subject for quite  some

time  for  many Members in this House. Some  people

take a great liking to it, while others do not. But

let  me  explain to the Government, Sir - I  am  only

trying  to  be helpful - the attitude of the  Chinese

school  students, and if the Government will listen

carefully  to  what  I have  to  say,  it  will  be

benefited and probably we will not have  any  more

rioting.  The  Government has  announced  that  all

schools  will be treated alike. All Chinese schools

will be given full grant in aid. Yes, Sir, that  is

indeed  a  very good step forward. That  is  indeed

commendable;  but so far as I can gather  from  the

schools, from the students, from the teachers,  and

from  the  Press, they do not know  the  conditions

attached  to such grants in aid. I told  them  that

the  grant in aid system would be the same  as  for

English  schools, but they said that they  had  not

been officially notified. "We just do not know what

the  scheme  is," they told me. Will the Government

not tell the Chinese people, "If you have grant  in

aid,  these  are the conditions."? Put them  up  in

black  and white and I think that will dispel their

fears. That is my first comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second comment is on the question of salary

schemes for these Chinese schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps I should remind hon.

Members  that  this is the Second  Reading  of  the

Appropriation  Bill  and  the  debate   should   be

confined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



to  the general principles of Government policy and

administration as indicated by the Bill.  What  the

hon.  Member is saying perhaps could best  be  said

when  we  come  to  the  Head  "Education"  in  the

Committee of Supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  thought that unless we brought up some  specific

points   the  Government  might  not  be  able   to

understand what we were driving at.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> We do not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It is because everytime we

say something, the Government will come back at  us

and  say, "Give us a concrete example." So in  this

instance   I  am  trying  to  give  some   concrete

examples. But I am glad, Sir, of your guidance  and

I shall romp along faster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of education, Sir, there is another

missing item - that of secondary schools. We  do  not

have enough secondary schools, and if Government is

going  to produce more technicians and more  people

who  will  come and help do the work that Singapore

needs, then the answer lies only in the creation of

more  secondary schools. It will at least help  the

students to feel a bit safer when they are in  Std. V.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on education, Sir, we have a paragraph

in  His  Excellency the Governor's Address  to  the

effect  that the Government will assist the Nanyang

University. How, and in what form will it come?  Is

it  in  money?  Is  it  in the matter  of  securing

facilities  and  so on? We have not heard  anything

mentioned  in  the Estimates or in the  Address.  I

think  the  public has the right to know  what  the

attitude of the Government is on this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the most important section of my

queries,  Sir,  and that concerns the  Ministry  of

Commerce  and  Industry. On page 3  of  his  Budget

speech  the Financial Secretary has treated  us  to

the idea that the Government has thought about "the

expanding economy of Singapore". On page  11  there

is  also  a reference to Singapore being  "a  great

communications  and  trading  centre",  with   "its

manufacturing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



activities".  But,  Sir,  although  the  Government

talks about the expanding economy of Singapore, yet

the policy that has been adopted so far is one that

is not going to make the trade and industry of this

country   expand   but  contract.   The   Financial

Secretary, on the one hand, tries to point  out  to

the  people  that  the financial  position  of  the

colony  is  sound  and  that  occurs  a  number  of

times - on pages 3, 7, 10 - but I will not quote  them.

To  say  it  so many times I think he is trying  to

convince  himself.  I  hope  it  is  true,  because

anything that is true need be said only once. Then,

on  the  other  hand, he says that  the  future  of

Singapore  is  bleak and that we must  expect  more

taxation, and taxation will climb up and up and up.

This,  I  think, is contrary to the principles  and

the  policy  laid down by the Ministry of  Commerce

and  Industry  which is trying to  say  to  foreign

investors,  "Do  not  be afraid.  Come  right  into

Singapore  and  you  will make  huge  profits.  The

future  is  bright. Everything is going to  be  all

right. We are not going to increase company tax. We

are  going  to  assist small-scale industries."  In

Singapore  the  one most important thing  that  has

always  been in my mind is that whatever  Singapore

manufactures   cannot   be   competitive   in   the

Federation. I am now made to understand that  there

is  a  tax barrier set up at Johore Bahru and  that

anything, whether it is manufactured in Hongkong or

Great Britain or Australia or Singapore, if it ever

gets through that barrier, must pay tax. And if  it

must  pay  tax,  it  will  mean  higher  costs   to

consumers  in  the Federation. It  will  mean  that

manufacturing   concerns   will   not   remain   in

Singapore. It is natural that they will  remove  to

Kuala  Lumpur and sooner or later, Sir,  what  will

happen? Will Singapore be a great industrial colony

like  Hongkong or will it be reduced to just a port

of  call and a communications centre? If nothing is

done in this direction, then I share the opinion of

the   Financial  Secretary  that  the   future   of

Singapore  will be bleak. We must create conditions

that  will be bright for investment. We must create

stable conditions and a sense of security, and then

investors  will  come to Singapore.  It  is  not  a

matter of tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



or  super  tax or non-resident tax that will  chase

people away. Sir, the Government will admit that it

has  invested the money of Singapore in the  London

market,  and I have been told times without  number

that London is about the most heavily taxed country

in  the  world  and yet we have our money  invested

there,  as  if we must not do this and we  must  do

that.  What are required to attract investment  are

stable  conditions, no fluctuations in  the  market

and no rapid wage rises (because the cost of living

is  not  rising rapidly). There must be a sense  of

security.  If  we  do not have money  upsets,  then

investors  will  come. There  is,  of  course,  one

heartening bit of news which I must not leave  out,

and that is, the Government thinks that it is going

to  assist small-scale industries by voting the sum

of  $1 million. We want to know what the Government

is  going  to do with that $1 million.  How  is  it

going  to  be handled? How will the people affected

be  benefited? Will the loans out of  that  sum  of

money  be firmly controlled and yet elastic  enough

so that they will be paid back? For this, the plans

should be made public. People will wish to know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more comment about commerce and industry. The

Government, I feel, should take the opportunity  to

have discussions with the Federation Government  to

see  that goods manufactured in Singapore  are  not

subjected to tax, and if that is not possible, then

there  must  at least be some sort of  Commonwealth

preferential rate.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> There is a rate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> And further to that

Commonwealth preferential rate, there should  be  a

neighbourly preferential rate, which will  be  much

better! Then it might help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come along to the question of

unemployment  and under-employment. Nobody  whether

inside  this House or outside will deny that  there

is   a   great  deal  of  unemployment  and  under-employment,  and if we have both, we are  going  to

face  a  great  consequences  arising  out  of  the

situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



Crime  is going to mount. Social benefits  will  be

sure  to  mount. All this can only be prevented  if

the  Government will think harder and do  its  work

properly, create more industries, encourage  people

into  putting money into this country  and  so  on;

otherwise,  I  am  afraid,  Sir,  the   future   of

Singapore will be bleak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Have you any ideas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We have, but we will only

show  you  when we are in a position to  put  up  a

Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I come to the end of my speech, I

know  that the Government will say to me (and I  am

anticipating it), "The Member for Serangoon says he

wants  no more taxation. All this taxation must  be

removed. But, on the other hand, he shouts  at  the

top  of  his voice that we must have all the social

services increased. But where do we find the money?

Probably  the  hon. Member is talking  through  his

hat!"  But  I  have  this  to  say,  Sir. In   the

management of money, the most important thing is to

cut  down  unnecessary  expenditure.  I  will  just

mention  one item - it will be good enough. There  is

going  to be a large P.W.D. building coming up.  It

will cost a few million dollars, say, in the region

of  $7 million, and the Government is going to  pay

the  architect 7½ per cent on that. Work that  out

and  see  how much that 7½ per cent comes to.  Why

cannot Government table a Bill which will lay  down

a  sliding  scale  of fees for architects?  If  you

build  a house for $1,000, you get $75. But if  you

build  a  house  for 1,000 times that  $1,000,  you

should not get $75 times 1,000; and if the building

is  going to cost $7 million, and working it out on

this  percentage, I think it is a bit too  much  to

ask  people to pay. If, however, you can engage  an

architect  to work on a salary scale  of  $1,000  a

month flat, you will probably have him working  for

quite  a  number  of  years,  in  fact.  Now  after

disposing   of   this   expenditure,    which    is

unnecessary,     I     will     mention     another

item - inefficiency in gathering  taxes  on  the  old

basis. I understand there are departments which say

they cannot collect all the taxes they are supposed

to  collect. They report that such and such an area

has still so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



many  years of arrears of taxes to be collected.  I

am referring to the Land Office. Here we have over-expenditure  and inefficiency in collecting  taxes,

with  the result that there is a lack of money  and

this  Assembly  is  being asked to  approve  a  new

taxation  scheme. I say all this is not  necessary,

and, of course, it is ridiculous to tell me that in

Singapore  there  are only 19,000  people  who  are

paying  tax. There must be many more. Step  up  the

efficiency of that department and then we will come

to  the  stage where we can manage our own  affairs

without unduly increasing taxes.



<br><br>11.52 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  a debate which promises to be of  mammoth

length, I will endeavour to be brief. Although  the

Budget   introduced  by  the  Hon. the   Financial

Secretary  is  one  of  the most  stringent  in  my

experience, I personally doubt that the outlook  is

quite  as  gloomy  as  he suggests.  The  Financial

Secretary in his speech said that there is always a

tendency to estimate revenue conservatively, and he

might well have added to over-estimate expenditure.

This  point  has been elaborated by the Member  for

Serangoon  who  also pointed out  that  year  after

year,  when  it  comes to the  final  balance,  the

actual position is far better than anticipated. But

I  think  there  might  be a danger  here  of  this

Assembly and the public as a whole falling into the

error  of  thinking  that  additional  taxation  is

unnecessary and that Government's fiscal policy  is

ultra-conservative.  The Member for  Serangoon,  for

instance,   did  not  mention  that  the  Financial

Secretary had pointed out that under-expenditure is

frequently  deferred  expenditure  and   that   the

colony's  development plans are estimated  to  cost

$310  million over the next six years. He said that

the  graph  of expenditure is rising in a  straight

line  through the origin, but he omitted to mention

that  the graph of revenue is unfortunately rapidly

levelling  out. On practically every  page  of  the

Estimates we read "increase due to so and so",  and

it seems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



to me, Sir, that the chances of the word "decrease"

being   substituted   for  "increase"   in   future

estimates are practically zero. On the other  hand,

the   colony's   position  is,  as  the   Financial

Secretary  has  said on three occasions,  sound.  I

would go further. I would say that a situation that

reveals net liquid assets of $130 million is a most

satisfactory state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heartily welcome the changes in accounting

methods   described  by  the  Hon. the   Financial

Secretary in his speech, especially the removal  of

the  long-term unrealizable loans from  the  Assets

side  of  the  Statement of Assets and Liabilities,

and the reduction of the General Revenue Balance to

$70  million following the transfer of the  balance

of the colony's liquid resources to a reconstituted

Development Fund. I think that will be regarded  by

all accountants and business men as a very sensible

way  of drawing up the colony's Statement of Assets

and Liabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also greatly interested, Sir, as I presume

all hon. Members were, in the Financial Secretary's

remarks  on  the conclusions reached by Sir  Sydney

Caine  in  his  assessment of the  colony's  future

development  requirements, which, financially,  are

of  a magnitude that is truly staggering. Yet,  Sir

Sydney Caine considers that the funds can be raised

provided  that certain conditions be  met.  Of  the

four  suggested means essential to  the  growth  of

Singapore, the most difficult of attainment, to  my

mind,  Sir,  is  the fourth item mentioned  by  Sir

Sydney Caine. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Local capital resources are mobilised to the

full,  a  suitable  climate and  opportunities  for

investment are created, and the general  public  is

made  to  realise  the  necessity  of  saving   and

investment in Government loans in order  to  obtain

the services which it wants."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this can be done, Sir, but it certainly

involves  a more realistic attitude by the  general

public to these matters than we have hitherto seen,

and  their co-operation is essential if "a  suitable

climate   and  opportunities  for  investment   and

saving" are to be created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement by the Hon. the Minister for

Commerce   and  Industry  prior  to  the  Financial

Secretary's speech on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



Appropriation  Bill is particularly  apposite,  and

what  he has said has been warmly welcomed  by  the

business community of Singapore. It is also  vital,

Sir,  that  the general public should  be  made  to

realise  the  necessity for saving and  investment,

and  particularly in Government loans; and  here  I

hope  we  shall  see some change of heart,  because

only  by a change of heart can this be realised.  I

do  not  think  that Government can  offer  further

financial  inducements  in order  that  the  public

should be attracted to investment in local loans. I

should also like to mention, Sir, that when  I  say

"the general public", I mean the general public.  I

do  not,  for instance, mean banks who,  when  they

take  up large blocks of colony loans and municipal

loans  at  the  time  they are  issued,  are  doing

nothing to solve the problems of inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to refer to the first of

Sir Sydney Caine's recommendations, namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government revenue is increased by stages over

the  next three years, including 1957, to yield  at

least  an  additional  $50 million  by  1959,  thus

allowing  a  more  substantial  contribution   from

revenue to development than is made at present."



<br><br>This is indeed a formidable task and will certainly

involve  the  belt  tightening that  the  Financial

Secretary  referred  to in his  speech,  and  I  am

wondering  if the untapped potential  to  which  he

referred   is  as  great  as  has  been  suggested.

Nevertheless - and I say this as an Independent and I

am not making this a Party speech - in devising means

by which revenue can be increased by $20 million in 1957, I think Government is to be congratulated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Sir, to comment briefly on some of

the  proposed  measures for increased taxation.  It

would  not  be seemly for me to state  that  nobody

would  suffer hardship by a reduction  in  personal

relief  from  $3,000 to $2,500, but I  should  have

thought  that,  in  view  of  the  fact  that   the

Financial Secretary said the average amount  to  be

paid would be a dollar per head per mensem no  one

would suffer extreme hardship as has been suggested

in  the  Press.  I  should really  have  been  more

interested,  Sir,  to  find  out  whether,  as  the

Financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



Secretary himself suggested, the collection of such

a  small  tax  was  economically  justifiable.  The

increases  in  the higher bracket are rational  and

indeed  overdue, and will not have  the  effect  of

causing those affected too much in the way of  belt

adjustment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leaving company tax where it is, Government

has  shown,  I think, a full understanding  of  the

local  situation and the need for encouragement  of

foreign   investment.   In   my   speech   on   the

Appropriation Bill in this Assembly  last  year,  I

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...it is only natural that one should feel

relieved  that  the  Budget  proposals  contain  no

provision for increase of income tax, but  that  is

merely  a brief respite, as the Financial Secretary

has been at pains to make clear."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee

Kuan Yew), whom I regret to see is not in the House

at the moment, came to speak, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Hon. Mr Sutherland...could not conceal his

relief that he was not made to pay what was his due

and fair share of the taxation of this country."



<br><br>Well,  that  is nonsense. Sir, I am  happy  to  say

that,  as  far  as  I  am  concerned,  I  am  in  a

sufficiently  low  bracket as to  be  comparatively

unaffected by the proposed increase; but  then,  as

now, I was really talking about company tax, and  I

might  add  that the corporation that I serve  pays

the  42½  per cent, which the Financial  Secretary

mentioned,  on its income in Singapore,  as  it  is

incorporated in the United Kingdom. So,  therefore,

there is no question that my remarks are influenced

by any personal feelings of relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, too, I said in this Assembly that I

saw  no  reason why cigarettes should have  escaped

increased  taxation, and I personally am glad  that

the  Government has had the courage  to  raise  the

taxes on tobacco and is able thus to anticipate  an

increase  of revenue of $9½ million from this,  in

my  opinion, very legitimate source of taxation. It

need  not  be feared that the anticipated  increase

will  not  be  realised.  The  fantastic  taxes  on

tobacco  in  the United Kingdom have had absolutely

no effect on the habits of smokers who usually only

renounce the habit following a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



coronary  thrombosis  or a solemn  warning  by  the

doctor that they give it up or else...!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad, Sir, that gin too was pulled into the

net.  I  am  also on record as having expressed  my

views  on  that  last year. In this  connection,  I

would like to read one paragraph from the Financial

Secretary's speech which is full of humour as  well

as gin:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the rates of duty on other liquors were

raised  in  November of last year, no  action  was

taken  in respect of rum and gin. There has been  a

tendency  for the consumption of gin in  particular

to  decrease  over the previous year  or  two.  The

taste  for  gin is fairly specialised. In Singapore

at  least  it  is  not a potential  substitute  for

whisky  or  brandy.  There appeared  to  be  little

danger  of any marked switch from whisky or  brandy

to  gin  as a result of the difference in rates  of

duty.  On  the  other hand, there  was  a  possible

danger - although  not  a  very  grave  one - that  an

increase in duty might result in a further decrease

in consumption of gin."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows, Sir, or should know, that whisky

is  an aristocrat and gin a parvenu, and if such an

analogy  is  unacceptable to a Socialist government

or  to the Royal Navy, I cannot help it; but I hope

that  any further taxation on these two life-savers

will be levied without any discrimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in driving licence fees and the

additional tax on petrol are unlikely to cause  any

great  hardship, and the raising of the stamp  duty

on  cheques  is  a  comparatively painless  way  of

raising another $300,000. I was interested to  hear

the  Member for Serangoon suggest that it  did  not

matter to the tuan besar who sat in the back of his

car, but the poor syce had to pay his $3 additional

licensing   fee.   I  should  have   thought   that

practically  every tuan besar paid the  licence  of

his syce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ten per cent initial registration fee on all

motor-cars  registered  for  the  first   time   in

Singapore - well, Sir, that certainly does bring cars

of  Commonwealth  registration virtually  into  the

petroleum-liquor-tobacco class and I have no  doubt

it will affect the lower middle income group, but I

think it is a blow which they will just be able  to

stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would say that, in my

opinion,  this  is  a  good  Budget.  Certainly  it

follows the principle, as far



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



as  direct  taxation is concerned, of  putting  the

burden on the shoulders of those best able to  bear

it. It is, in fact, in the best colonial tradition;

by that I mean something the reverse of derogatory.

I   mean   that   it  is  farsighted,  sympathetic,

fairminded  and  shows  due regard  for  the  sound

principles of finance. Only on that basis, Sir, can

we  build a solid house of state, whatever flag  it

may fly on its flagstaff.



<br><br>12.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I find

myself  in  the  extraordinary  position  of  being

compelled to agree to a large extent with the  hon.

Member  who has just sat down. I would like to  say

that  I  consider  today  to  be  a  good  day  for

democracy and for socialist principles. I think the

Government may well be congratulated, Sir,  on  the

courage,  wisdom and the spirit of democracy  which

it  has shown in listening to the reasonable appeal

of  the  people  of  Singapore  and  restoring  the

personal  allowance on income tax and the  duty  on

locally manufactured cigarettes, both of which  hit

the small man, in their original form.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a suggestion that the

Government conceded these two matters because of  a

threat to its existence arising from a split in the

Labour Front. I should like to say that this  is  a

complete and malicious falsehood The Labour  Front,

through  its  Central Committee and the secretaries

of  the branches at special meetings convened, made

it  clear  to the Government that if the Government

could not make concessions because of the need  for

co-operation with the Federation, the Labour  Front,

both  in  the  Assembly and outside  the  Assembly,

would  continue to give its unswerving  loyalty  to

the  Government. Sir, the Labour Front  believe  in

the  need  for  cooperation with the Federation  on

economic  matters, and co-operation  does  not  mean

getting our own way all the time. It means give and

take; and if sometimes the people of Singapore have

to sacrifice their own way in order to maintain the

spirit of co-operation with the Federation,  we  of

the Labour Front believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



that  the  people  of Singapore  will  accept  such

sacrifice  with good grace. I would add, Sir,  that

we  are  today  happy that such  sacrifice  is  not

necessary  for  the small income groups  who  would

have been affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are happy to note the close personal

relationship  of  friendship  and  mutual   respect

between  the Chief Minister and the Chief  Minister

of  the  Federation  which is contributing  to  the

mutual  welfare of both territories. We say to  the

Chief  Minister,  "Well done! By these  concessions

which  you  have  made  in  co-operation  with   the

Federation, you have been able to meet  the  wishes

of  the  people and have infused new  life  in  our

concept of democracy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of family allowance on

income  tax,  the  leader of the Liberal-Socialists

made much of the Asian approach as though that were

his  personal baby and his exclusive property.  The

Labour  Front has always solidly stood  behind  the

general  wish of the people of Singapore  that  the

approach to personal allowance on income tax should

be  an  Asian approach and not a European approach.

But surely, Sir, the House must by now be conscious

of  the manifold submerged difficulties in the  way

of  income  tax modifications, and I do  say,  Sir,

that  we should be fair to the Government and  give

it the time necessary to meet these difficulties in

its honest efforts to meet the wishes of the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as one who expects to be affected, I welcome

the  increased  tax on higher incomes,  and  I  say

this, Sir: there is plenty of room for expansion in

respect of taxation on excessive incomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of company tax, I have studied

the reasons given by the Financial Secretary and  I

must  say I am not satisfied. I concede, Sir,  that

special inducement must be given to foreign capital

in   order  to  encourage  its  activity  in   this

territory;  but  only  foreign  capital  should  be

encouraged  which  is making a  reasonable  profit.

When  foreign  capital skins our  people  and  when

foreign capital makes excessive profits, then  that

is no longer a healthy contribution to our economic

life. Tomorrow,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



Sir, I hope to receive from the Financial Secretary

information  in answer to a question on  the  Order

Paper  as  to  the  number of companies  which  are

making  more  than  ten per cent  profit  on  their

capital,  and I think this House will be in  for  a

real shock. I say to the Financial Secretary, as  a

citizen,  I  regret that he has  not  seen  fit  to

indicate to us the results of his researches on the

possibility of an excess profits tax, and I do urge

the  Government to consider the introduction of  an

excess profits tax at an early date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the tax on motor vehicles. It is a step

in  the right direction, although I must confess  I

find  myself  in  considerable  sympathy  with  the

Member  for  Serangoon when  he  says,  "How  about

higher  taxes for more expensive cars?" I am  quite

sure  the  Financial Secretary  will  welcome  that

suggestion  and that it will have the consideration

it  merits.  I would like to say, Sir,  that  apart

from  the  question  of revenue and  the  socialist

principles  affecting this tax, if the  Income  Tax

Department is not adequate for its responsibilities

in  obtaining payments of income tax due, then this

tax at least will, in indirect fashion, get some of

the money of which this country is being cheated. I

welcome the tax for one special reason, Sir. It can

have a salutary effect if the buyer is made to  pay

this ten per cent tax on landed cost direct to  the

Treasury.  He  will then know how  little  his  car

costs and how much profit the motor-car monopoly  is

making.  I  ask  the Government to  make  stringent

regulations  for payment of this tax by  the  buyer

and  by  no  other person. I think the  defenceless

people of Singapore should know the extent to which

they are being skinned by this car combine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point about this tax to which

I  think I would like to draw the attention of  the

House.   The   Government  quite  rightly   exclude

omnibuses from the tax, because they are  a  public

service.   I   do  not  know  whether  taxis   were

unintentionally omitted, but it seems to  me,  Sir,

that  taxis are a public service and, in so far  as

my  information goes, taxi owners are neither  rich

nor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



do they make excessive profits, and I would ask the

Government  to  consider excluding taxis  and  cars

which are intended to be used as taxis for a period

exceeding three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that I warmly welcome

the action of the Government in leaving the tax  on

locally   manufactured  cigarettes   untouched.   I

believe  the Member for Serangoon must have  either

ignored the Government Gazette which indicated that

the  Government  had  reduced  or  had  waived  its

intended increase of taxation on that item, or else

perhaps  he  does not quite follow the language  of

Government  Gazettes. I would not blame  him.  Sir,

the  position  now  truly is  this:  the  Financial

Secretary, in moving the Second Reading, said  that

those  who  cannot afford the cigarettes can  smoke

cheaper  cigarettes.  As  the  proposal  originally

stood, there were no cheaper cigarettes. The prices

of  all  cigarettes were increased, but  today  the

locally manufactured cigarettes remain at the  same

price  as before and they will be far cheaper  than

the  imported cigarettes. Therefore, the  poor  man

and  the  lower income group can continue to  enjoy

the  friendliness of tobacco without having to make

any sacrifices and, in addition, Sir, we are giving

a  real direct impetus to local industry. I welcome

the increase of tax on imported cigarettes and pipe

tobacco.   Those   who  will  not   support   local

industries,  Sir, should be made to  pay  more  for

their imported cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional tax on petrol has been made much

of  by the Member for Serangoon. It is his duty  as

leader  of the majority Party of the Opposition  to

labour  himself  in  seeking  to  find  grounds  of

discontent and he finds them in the tax on  petrol.

Sir, that tax should not harm anybody at all. I say

"should not", but, in fact, I agree with the Member

for  Serangoon that in one instance of which I have

heard,  it has been made the excuse by unscrupulous

capital to exploit the poor. I understand that  the

owners  of lorries which carry vegetables to market

have  increased their charges from 30 cents a picul

to  40  cents  a picul. Sir, a lorry,  I  am  told,

carries 96 piculs on two voyages for one gallon. So

they receive $9.60 extra for every seven cents they

pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



the Government. And they blame the Government!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side, Sir, I am not at all

satisfied or happy about the expenditure on defence

services.  I welcome the expenditure on  the  local

forces.  I  would  like  to  hear  when  our  first

battalion will be operative. I would also  like  to

know  whether there is being prepared a plan for  a

second  battalion. But I would  like  to  draw  the

attention  of  this  House to that  extraordinarily

expensive toy, the Royal Malayan Navy. It has  been

freely admitted, Sir, that this organisation is  in

no  way  related to or utilised for the welfare  of

Singapore  and it is costing a fantastic packet.  I

had  hoped, Sir, that the Financial Secretary would

have taken advantage of the question which I put to

him, and indicated the policy of Government for the

next  five  years  in connection  with  these  very

expensive  items on our income. I shall  raise  the

matter  again under the appropriate heading in  the

Committee  of  Supply and I trust  that  the  Chief

Secretary  will  be  in a position  to  give  us  a

satisfactory  understanding of this expenditure  to

which  we  are committed of $15 million,  allegedly

for  four  mine-sweepers, and more than $4  million

annually recurrent expenditure on the Royal Malayan

Navy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I come to the Legal Aid and Advice

Ordinance. Let me say, as a citizen and a Member of

this  House, how deeply I regret to see that  there

is  no  provision whatsoever for the implementation

of  the  Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance  which  has

been  the law of this country for five and  a  half

months. It is right that the people of this country

should  obey  the law. It is also the duty  of  the

Government  to  apply the law. The  Legal  Aid  and

Advice  Ordinance  is  a truly  socialist  measure,

welcomed on all sides in this, at that time, not so

very  friendly House. There was not one  dissenting

voice. It was welcomed by the entire population. It

was  moved by the Hon. the Minister for Labour  and

Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock), and, in moving  it,  he

quoted that cynical remark -"The Courts of law, like

the  Ritz  Hotel,  are open to the  rich  and  poor

alike!" Where is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



change?  Has  there been any change that  in  these

five  and  a  half months nothing but  a  desultory

conversation or two have taken place to  apply  the

law  of this country, approved fully by this  House

and  by  the people? The bogey of the Bar Committee

has  been put up. I say "bogey", Sir, because I  do

not  think  it  is  fair to the  Bar  Committee  to

suggest    that   it   seeks   to   obstruct    the

implementation of this very necessary  measure  for

the  welfare of the people of Singapore.  What  the

Bar  Committee is interested in are regulations  in

respect  of the relation of members of the  Bar  to

the  department when they are employed. But the Bar

Committee  has never said, "You cannot establish  a

Department  of Legal Aid and Advice. You  must  not

appoint  a  Director.  You  must  not  appoint   an

Assistant Director. You must not have an office." I

am deeply perturbed by the seeming loss of interest

of  the  Government in this very necessary  measure

for  the welfare of the people of Singapore  and  I

shall revert to it under its appropriate heading in

the Committee of Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also must say, Sir, that I note with regret the

lack  of  provision for a dynamic approach  to  the

problem of enhancing the economic position  of  the

Malays  in  this  territory,  and  the  absence  of

provision for acquiring kampongs and providing  for

their  rehabilitation. A great deal of good can  be

done  in that direction at far less cost than  four

useless toy minesweepers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other subject on which I would

like to touch. I do it with some diffidence. It  is

the  question  of  a change in accountancy  methods

proposed    by   the   Financial   Secretary    and

enthusiastically  supported by  a  banker  of  some

experience. I therefore tread with some  diffidence

in  this territory, and I admit quite frankly  that

all  that  I know of accountancy I learned  in  the

Singapore Y.M.C.A. School of Commerce! But  I  must

say, Sir, that it goes contrary to the concepts  of

honest  book-keeping  that we  should  spirit  away

mortgages  from the balance sheet, that  we  should

treat loans with security, loans on building, loans

on land, as current expenditure. Sir, all of us not

only in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



House  but outside it have the highest respect  for

the  absolute integrity of the Financial Secretary,

but I would ask whether, in fact, there is any real

need  for  it. He suggests that it is necessary  in

the name of tidiness. Sir, I do not care how untidy

it is if I can see my money. I would rather not see

it  spirited away. Sir, if the Financial  Secretary

wants  to  play the magician, I would  ask  him  to

produce  rabbits out of his hat and  not  make  our

money  disappear through his hat! I do like to  see

where  my  money  is,  and if it  is  necessary  to

separate liquid from illiquid assets, Sir,  let  us

authorise  him  to put, in inch-high  letters,  the

word  "Illiquid" on the assets side of the  balance

sheet;  but do not spirit away our loans which  are

valuable, which can be transferred and sold,  which

have  monetary value. Do not let us  hide  them  in

some  corner  of these highly complicated  accounts

which  really, let us confess, very few of  us  can

understand.  Sir, my attitude toward  all  this  is

merely a feeling of discomfort, but if it is really

considered necessary, I will go along with it;  but

I  would plead that in that event, at the bottom of

the  balance sheet, away in a corner if  necessary,

we  should have a note that we have illiquid assets

of  $126  million - and it is not a sum to be sneezed

at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to join Mr

Sutherland - for   once!   - in   congratulating   the

Government in all sincerity on a Budget which today

is in a form of which we can be proud.

<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it  appears  to  me  that  the  Labour  Front

Coalition  Government is slowly being  absorbed  by

the  colonialism  they set out to conquer  about  a

year and a half ago. The Government is ostensibly a

Socialist  Government. We heard  a  great  deal  of

Socialism   during  those  happy  days   when   the

gentlemen opposite were wooing the voters but  that

was  a  long time ago, Sir. Since then,  they  have

been  successfully  brainwashed by  their  colonial

backseat drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, Sir, is proof that the Labour Front

has  been  purged of all Socialist deviations.  Not

only  is  this  Budget purged  of  every  tinge  of

Socialism  but  it  is  utterly  shameless  in  its

concern  for great business and colonial interests.

With  the  Labour Front Government as a front,  the

colonial  backseat drivers had tried  to  soak  the

poor  while  leaving  the rich  untouched.  I  said

"tried",  Sir,  because since the announcements  of

the  Budget,  there  has been  some  panicky  back-

tracking.  It  may  be  because  the  Labour  Front

Coalition Government was particularly impressed  by

the    Liberal-Socialists.   Even   the    Liberal-

Socialists, Sir, felt that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



Budget was an attempt to balance the budget at  the

expense  of  the lower income workers.  Surely  the

Government could have told the backseat drivers  to

produce  a  Budget  which looked like  a  Socialist

Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Who were the backseat drivers?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Ask yourself. The fact

that  the blunder over the lower income groups  has

been  put  right  does  not make  this  Budget  any

better.  In  fact, the protests over the  injustice

done  to  the  low  wage  earner  have  only  drawn

attention to the fact that this is still  a  Budget

designed  to  aid  and  comfort  big  business  and

colonial interests. This is certainly not a  Budget

expected  of a Party which claims to be  Socialist,

Nationalist or champion of the Welfare  State.  The

only  kind of welfare that this Budget will further

is  capitalist  welfare  and,  in  particular,  the

foreign capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget was designed to meet a specific

problem  and  that  was  the  $37  million  deficit

expected in 1957. This deficit was to be met by the

increase  in  income  tax  by  lowering  the  basic

personal  allowance which would have hit  hard  the

lower income group but the higher income group  was

let  off very lightly, indeed so lightly that  even

the  Liberal-Socialists  felt  happy  and  jubilant

enough to take up the cudgels on behalf of the poor

wage earner. For a Socialist Government, Sir, - and I

hope I am not unduly embarrassing the Government by

assuming  that  it still believes in  its  election

pledges - taxation  is  one  way  of  bringing  about

greater  equality of income and Malaya is a country

where  inequality of income prevails. This was  the

necessary outcome of a colonial economy. There  has

been no proper survey of distribution of income but

a  survey of urban incomes and housing made not  so

long ago suggests that the gap between the rich and

poor  is considerable. A colonial government  could,

of  course,  afford  to maintain  this  inequality.

People  do not expect anything better of a colonial

government but people do expect something better of

the Labour Front Coalition Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more glaring instance of partiality to

vested interests in the Budget was that company tax

was  left  untouched.  This  leniency  came  as   a

pleasant surprise to the big companies who had been

expecting  increased rates. A few days  before  the

tax  rates were disclosed, the Straits Times in its

editorial of November 6 speculated on how  the  $37

million deficit would be met. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two Malayan Governments are agreed that

income  tax rates should be raised, and it must  be

assumed that the company rate will be increased  as

well as the top brackets of individual income tax."



<br><br>The Straits Times is no Socialist paper. It assumed

that  the  Labour  Front Coalition  Government  was

Socialist. The Straits Times was wrong for once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point to be considered is how the money

obtained   by  taxation  is  going  to  be   spent.

Government can spend its money on expanding welfare

services like education, hospitals, and so  on,  or

by  lavish  expenditure on itself. One  reason  why

people  are  resentful of taxation is because  they

are  convinced  that  most of  the  money  goes  on

conspicuous  consumption by the  bureaucracy.  They

read  about sumptuous houses for senior members  of

the   bureaucracy;  they  read  about  expatriation

allowances;   they  read  about  the   $5   million

Polytechnic suddenly costing $11,500,000. When  the

Government builds schools or hospitals, the cost of

buildings suggests that they are made not of bricks

but   of  marble.  Is  it  any  surprise  that  our

bureaucracy  is  one  of  the  most  expensive   in

relation  to our income? In fact, the ordinary  man

is keenly aware that he gets relatively little from

the Government by way of services in return for the

large  sum of money he spends on the upkeep of  the

bureaucracy  on  emoluments, expatriation  pay  and

travelling allowances. That was to be expected of a

colonial government whose main function was to have

just a Government to make this country a profitable

dollar earner. An alien bureaucracy saw no harm  in

making it an expensive bureaucracy as well but that

is  not good enough for an elected government which

must set its standards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



of  living in relation to economic conditions here.

This  Budget,  unfortunately, is no different  from

the  colonial  Budget of the  past.  It  keeps  the

bureaucracy happy; it keeps the colonial  investors

happy. It is also based on the assumption that this

country must be firmly tied to the apron string  of

colonialism  and that it can, for the  time  being,

forget all about Socialist principles.



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  supporting  the Member for Serangoon  (Mr  Lim

Choon  Mong) that year in and year out we are faced

with  a  Budget  of imaginative figures  showing  a

deficit,  I  will draw hon. Members'  attention  to

pages 9 and 13 of the Draft Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 9 is the summary of revenue collected

from 1946 to 1955 and on page 13 is the summary  of

expenditure  incurred from 1946 to 1955.  Comparing

the  figures on these two sheets, I find that every

year  there is a surplus instead of a deficit  with

the exception of 1954. That is why I say that these

are  really  imaginative figures - just pure  figures

and no facts at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we were presented with a deficit of

$15.2  million  in  the Budget and  it  was  really

surprising  to  hear  from the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary  in  his speech that we are expecting  on

actual  working  figures a surplus  of  between  $2

million and $3 million. Is it not contradictory  to

present  a  Budget with a deficit of $15.2  million

when, instead of that actual deficit, there will be

a surplus of $2 million to $3 million? We are again

given  a  Budget with a deficit of $37 million  and

with  revotes  it amounts to about $39  million.  I

will  quote,  Sir,  what  the  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary had to say about this deficit on  page  5

of his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position therefore is that, against an

estimate  of revenue of $217 million,  we  have  an

estimate of expenditure of $254 million, and we are

faced with an estimated deficit of $37 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubtful if the position is quite as

serious as would appear from these figures. As hon.

Members  are  aware, ever' allowing for  unforeseen

calls on public funds which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



have arisen during the course of the year - some  of

them substantial - actual expenditure has in the past

invariably  fallen  short of the  estimate.  It  is

likely that this will occur again in 1957."



<br><br>From  what I make out of these paragraphs, it would

appear  that  there is going to be a surplus  again

for  1957.  Then why, Sir, put us in a position  so

that we will have to approve a deficit Budget every

year?  Is  this  an excuse for the Government  that

there is no alternative but to increase taxation in

order  to cover this deficit? If not, then why  not

be more realistic and tell us the actual figures of

the  Budget? We are placed in such a position  year

after  year by the Government telling us  that  the

Government is on the verge of bankruptcy  and  that

unless  we  find some ways and means  to  find  the

money  we may have to go bankrupt. I think that  if

we  are faced year after year with a deficit figure

which shows the sorrowful state or affairs of this

island,  there  is no use for us  sitting  here  to

approve  Budgets unless the picture is put  clearly

before  us.  I would have expected that the  Labour

Front  Coalition Government would  give  us  actual

facts rather than mislead us. By misleading us,  we

get nowhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now apart from these imaginative figures, there

are also indications of extravagance in the Budget.

I  would  refer  to page 33 of the Draft  Estimates

under Head 2, item 10 (1)  "City Services". You will

find  that  the cost of City Services for  Criminal

District  and  Magistrates' Courts  is  $27,600  as

compared  to $3,600 for this year. As I go  down  I

find that the reason given is "Increase due to air-conditioning  of  the  Courts".  The  increase   of

$24,000  a  year works out to $2,000  a  month  for

electricity  alone and I wonder how  the  Hon. the

Financial Secretary got this figure. I am sure that

the  eight Courts will not be able to consume about

12,000  units  a  month,  which  is  a  substantial

figure.  The maximum that I could get is  1,000  or

2,000  units a month but I wonder how  he  got  the

figure of 12,000 units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer next to page 53 of the Draft

Estimates  under  Head  8,  item  12  "Telephones".

$12,000 is provided for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



the   Chief  Secretary's  Ministry  for  telephones

alone! This $12,000 is only for his office and  not

the  departments  under his control.  Each  of  the

departments  under his control has a separate  vote

for  such expenditure and this $12,000 is only  for

the  Empress Place building. I wonder how  many  of

the  officers have direct lines there! I will  give

you figures, Sir. All the telephones provided to 24

departments under his Ministry amount to  $179,820.

Over  $100,000 just for telephones for a  Ministry!

You  can  imagine what will be the figure for  nine

Ministries!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this imaginative Budget, it looks to

me  that  this  Assembly is becoming  a  charitable

society. We are providing grant after grant to  all

charitable organisations and in quoting this,  Sir,

I   must   say  that  I  am  not  actually  against

contributing  money to the charitable  organisation

which  benefit the public at large but I am against

the  principle of converting this Assembly  into  a

benevolent  organisation. I will give  you  figures

for this, Sir:

</pre>

<br><br>I wonder what that is for!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we going to grant money to such

organisations? I am not against all  of  them.  The

Member  for  Cairnhill  (Mr  Marshall)  said  "Not

enough!" I agree that it is not enough for some  of

them  but look at "Grant to Young Women's Christian

Association, $125,000". Why forget the Young  Men's

Christian Association and why give it to the  women

only?  It  is  surprising that no Member  of  this

Assembly  is a woman and, although all the  Members

here  belong to the male sex, we are not  providing

money  for  the Young Men's Christian  Association!

And  again  there  is the Chinese  Christian  Young

Men's Association. If they come to us, are we going

to  grant them such funds, Sir? I think we have  to

be more careful about all this money, and the total

for   all   these   grants  is  $768,480 - just   for

Charitable  Allowances alone, Sir!  This  figure  I

have mentioned does  not include family planning at

all  because  it comes under "Treasury"  and  is  a

different  grant.  So apart from this  figure,  you

will  realise  that  there  are  grants  for  other

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the question of taxation, Sir. As

a  matter  of  fact, taxation may be good  for  the

State  but we must at times think of the  poor.  On

the question of income tax, I am very glad that the

Government has realised its folly and is  going  to

withdraw



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



the reduction of the $500 personal relief. But I am

not  at  all  happy  about  that  yet  because  the

percentage of income tax that is going to be levied

on  the poorer classes is to be increased. Why  not

increase  on  the higher level rather than  on  the

lower  level?  The Member for Cairnhill  said  this

morning  that the Labour Front Coalition Government

is  fully aware that income tax is to be framed  on

the  Asian way of life. I am rather surprised  that

the  present Ordinance is framed or copied from the

Western way of life. It is entirely different:  how

an  Asian lives and how a Westerner lives.  In  the

Western way of life, as soon as a son gets married,

the  relationship with his parents is just cut off.

He goes on his own -



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - and has a separate family.

He  is not considered a member of the family of the

father.  He  is  considered a  separate  family  by

himself  and  he  has  no more relations  with  nor

responsibilities  to the parents who  have  brought

him  up to the age to get married. But in the Asian

way  of  life, Sir, we look after our  parents  far

more  than our wives. To a Westerner, a wife  comes

first.  Everywhere the wife goes, the husband  must

follow  and  respect  her wishes  and  parents  are

ignored,  but  to an Asian, Sir, the  parents  come

first,   the  wife  comes  second,  and  then   the

children.  Unless you have your parents,  you  will

not  be  existing in this world. So you  must  help

your  parents. The Income Tax Ordinance  should  be

framed  in such a way as to suit the Asian  way  of

life. Now if you have parents who cannot earn money

or  make a living, and apart from aged parents, you

have  your  younger brothers and  sisters  who  are

dependent on their parents, who is then to  support

them?  Is  it not your responsibility as a  son  as

well  as  a  brother to the other  members  of  the

family to support the whole family?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the reduction of $500 from the

personal  relief, as it stands today, the allowance

of $3,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



is  inadequate  to meet the cost  of  living  of  a

worker.   The   $3,000  provided   as   relief   is

insufficient for a worker to exist, and  to  reduce

the  $3,000 to $2,500 is really cutting his throat.

I   would  have  expected  that  the  Labour  Front

Coalition  Government, as Labourites or  Socialists

who care more for the workers, would have increased

that  amount to $5,000 because, unless you  have  a

relief of $5,000, it is impossible to live. In  the

case  of  a  married person, add another $3,000  as

relief, making $8,000 relief. It was fortunate that

the  Hon. the Chief Minister went to Kuala  Lumpur

and  got  the  Chief Minister of the Federation  to

have  this  withdrawn,  or else  I  am  afraid  the

workers  will never be able to exist  at  all,  and

only the Ministers will live then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I heard this morning is from one of

the  Ministers  on  the  Government  Benches,  that

workers should not possess cars or cannot afford to

have  cars. I wonder why? Is it that Ministers only

can have motor cars -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> They say that they are working.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - and workers cannot have

motor cars? Is it in the difference of cars that we

possess? A Minister can have a $20,000 car, but for

a  worker,  I think he can have a $2,000 or  $3,000

motor car - a small car - and the car itself  is  not  a

luxury. Every time the question of a car comes  up,

it  is  said, "Oh, it is a luxury. A worker  should

not have it." But, Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Chief

Minister  realise  that  owning  a  car   is   more

economical  than  travelling in  public  transport?

Just take an instance, Sir: an ordinary worker  may

have  to  travel 20 miles a day, and if  he  is  to

travel those 20 miles by taxi, which costs 40 cents

per  mile, it will come to $8 a day. Can  a  worker

afford $8 a day for transport alone? But if he  has

a  small  car  with a consumption  of  50  miles  a

gallon, as the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim  Choon

Mong)  said, it will cost him less than  a  dollar,

which is ten per cent of the actual expenditure  on

transport. Is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



it not a necessity? He has to go to work, he has to

come home from work, he has to send his children to

school, he has to send his wife to the market -  and

all  those  20 miles just for ten per cent  of  the

actual  money  that he has got to spend  on  public

transport. Why should the workers not have cars? It

is  absurd!  I am sure that quite a number  of  the

Members   on  the  opposite  Benches  were  workers

before.  Today  they  are Ministers  and  Assistant

Ministers. Oh, then they can have a car!  But  some

of  them  were  workers before and  they  had  cars

before they came into this Assembly House. Why  did

they  have  cars then? Why not follow the principle

of  having  no cars at all? I hope, Sir,  that  the

Government will realise this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of cigarettes, smoking is not a

vice nor is it a luxury. It is a habit. I would say

that  it  is  a necessity as well as a  habit,  and

because it is a habit, you cannot get out of it. As

a  necessity then, you must have it, but as a habit

it is just as bad because it is essential. You must

smoke. As a non-smoker myself, I do not care if the

Government  increases the tax  on  cigarettes,  but

what  about  the people who smoke? It is  not  just

because I do not smoke that I will not bother about

the  increase of tax on cigarettes. A few cents  on

cigarettes, a few cents on petrol, a few  cents  on

this and a few cents on that a day will not make  a

few  cents.  It  will amount to a few  dollars  and

apart  from  those few dollars, the  Government  is

going to tax again on those few dollars. How can  a

worker exist? It is impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really hope that the Government will be more

careful  in  presenting the Budget figures  and  in

proposing  to  increase taxation. I would  not  say

that I am against all taxation, but I say, "Be more

reasonable and realistic."



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

considering   the  Estimates  for  1957   and   the

Government's taxation policy, one must be guided by

a  certain number of basic criteria. First of  all,

nothing must be done to endanger the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



position of Singapore as one of the greatest  trade

and communication centres in the world because,  if

we  lose that position, we condemn ourselves  to  a

slow and painful death. Secondly, the standards  of

administration  must be maintained at  the  highest

pitch  of  efficiency because, unless the  services

provided by the Government departments in charge of

trade and communications are of the best standard,

commercial concerns and the world's travellers will

go  elsewhere. Thirdly, Singapore must engender  an

atmosphere  of confidence and stability which  has,

in  fact, been considerably shaken during the  last

18  months. Fourthly, if extra taxation  is  to  be

justified,  it  must be applied to productive  ends

which  create  employment as  well  as  to  finance

social  services and,  fifthly,  taxation   which

encourages the inflationary spiral of wages chasing

prices  and which reduces the purchasing  power  of

people  defeats its own ends. Lastly,  and  here  I

come  back to the first point because of  the  need

for  maintaining Singapore's position as  a trade

and    communication   centre,   a   much    closer

understanding  and relationship must be  cultivated

with  the Federation Government, and I congratulate

the Hon. the Chief Minister on what he has done  in

recent weeks in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far then do the Estimates and the proposed

increased  taxes square with the criteria  which  I

have mentioned? Let me first turn to the Luxury Tax

Bill  which has been laid before this House.  This,

at  first  sight, seems to be a reckless plunge  by

the Government into a new taxation policy which may

well  be  disastrous for this country. Any taxation

which destroys or endangers Singapore's status as a

free port and further weakens our entrepot position

will  be  suicidal and I am by no  means  convinced

that  this Bill will avert this danger. Sir,  I  do

not  wish  to  go into great details on  this  Bill

today in view of the fact that it can be debated on

the Second Reading tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome the Government's second thoughts

on  Personal Allowances. It is true that this wise

decision  means that several thousand  people  will

now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



escape  this income tax, and it is also  true  that

all income tax payers will benefit to a greater  or

lesser  degree, but what must not be  forgotten  is

that  the rate at the bottom of the scale is  still

to be raised from 3 per cent to 5 per cent and this

will mean hardship for an unfortunate minority.  We

have  just  emerged from a period  of  strikes  for

better conditions, of negotiations between employer

and  employee  for  higher  wages,  of  legislation

laying down a better deal for the working man,  and

shortly the clerks and shop assistants, and now the

Government has been on the point of stepping in and

saying,  "We  are entitled to a share of  what  you

have  won." Could anything be better calculated  to

upset   confidence  and  to  make   the   task   of

responsible trade union leaders more difficult? The

Labour  Front in its manifesto promised the  people

of  this  country  the right to  economic  security

including  State  support for the  aged,  sick  and

unemployed.  They  have not so  far  provided  that

support  in  their one and a half years in  office,

and  I  do not altogether blame them for that,  but

what  we  are not still happy about is the increase

in  tax on this lower income group, that is to say,

on  those  who  are  carrying  proportionately  the

largest  burden in making contributions from  their

own   small  salaries  to  their  aged,  sick   and

unemployed relatives. Not only is there  no  relief

for those under obligation by long custom to assist

their parents but there is an increase in the rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the changes which have been made which

we naturally welcome, we ask this Government to let

us  know the following figures during the course of

this  debate:  firstly, the  expected  decrease  in

revenue  resulting from the decision to  leave  the

Personal  Allowances unchanged and,  secondly,  the

expected  increase in revenue to  be  derived  from

raising the rate from three to five per cent in the

new  circumstances. I doubt very much  whether  the

latter is really worth collecting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has surprised me is the fact that the

estimate  of  revenue from income tax  in  1957  is

exactly  the same as in 1956, namely, $65  million,

leaving  aside  the $4 or $5 million  which  it  is

hoped to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



raise through the new increases. Now the House will

remember  that in March of this year, we  gave  the

Government  very  wide powers so that  "the  battle

against tax evaders could be effectively waged", to

use the Hon. the Financial Secretary's own words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall), speaking

in  full  responsibility as the Chief  Minister  at

that time, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it is generally recognised that the

country  is  not getting even 50 per  cent  of  the

income tax to which it is entitled."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we have added to our staff three experts from

the   British  Board  of  Inland  Revenue  in   the

detection of evaders. They are there now  and  they

are  set for this campaign to get back some of  the

dreadful loss which we have suffered....".



<br><br>Sir,  if  these three gentlemen had  been  set  for

their  campaign after being armed with  new  powers

approved  by  this  House,  then  we  would  expect

results  by 1957. We do not expect them to  recover

the 50 per cent which the hon. Member said existed

but we would expect them to increase the income tax

returns  by an appreciable extent. Sir, I  consider

that  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary owes  us  a

very  full  explanation as to why the  wide  powers

given  to the Government had not been justified  by

results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point about income tax is this. About

$2,300,000 was the amount of tax realised  in  1955

from  roughly  1,800 non-resident  individuals.  On

what is this tax assessed? Is it assessed only  on

dividends  paid  by limited companies  or  does  it

include  income  from  rents  and,  more  important

still,  from  dividends from private companies  or

partnerships? I should like to know whether we  are

collecting  all  that  we should  from  non-resident

individuals who are taking money from this  country

and putting nothing back into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the imposition of the tax on the

registration  of  cars as far as  a  small  car  is

concerned  does  not  have  our  support.  If   the

Government had taken active and energetic steps  to

re-organise   the  public  transport   system   for

efficient islandwide services, such a tax could be

understood. But the only thing that the  Government

has done towards carrying out its election promises

is to set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



up  a Bus Licensing Authority which spends its time

turning  down  bus routes and thus encouraging  the

pirate taxi or expecting people to walk. I have  no

objection  to  the expensive car  being  taxed  and

taxed  even  more  heavily than is proposed.  There

seems  to  be no justification for large limousines

which  take  up far too much space on  our  crowded

roads  and  in the public car parks, and which  are

not  really necessary for getting about from  place

to place in the limited mileage of this island, but

I   have   every  objection  to  putting  a   small

inexpensive car even a dollar further  out  of  the

reach of a man who wants to buy it. Such a car  has

become  a  necessary precaution for the family  man

when the public transport system is inefficient and

when  it  breaks down through strikes  unexpectedly

two  or  three  times a year. It is  not  merely  a

matter  of  getting oneself to work but of  getting

one's  children to school and a small cheap car  is

the  most economical way of doing this. This  would

also  help  the taxi-driver of whom the Member  for

Cairnhill made mention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am well aware that the retort from

the  hon. Members opposite will be that you  cannot

have social services unless you pay for them and to

pay   for  them,  you  must  get  more  money  from

taxation. But you can also get the money  you  want

by  economies in expenditure and by more efficiency

in  the  collection of revenue and I would like  in

this respect to make a few practical suggestions. I

have  already  referred  to  the  failure  of   the

Government to combat tax evasion and I now refer to

what I can only call the scandal of the failure  of

the  Land  Office  to collect rents  on  Government

properties and of the failure of the Rural Board to

collect  rates. With your permission, Sir,  let  me

quote from the Report of the Director of Audit  for

the year 1955, paragraph 22 (iii) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Class IV: Rents on Government Property.- Arrears

of  Quit  Rents  amounted  to  $116,174  at  31st

December,   1955,  and  arrears  of   Rents   for

Reverted  Houses to $104,623. Both these  amounts

are  somewhat greater than the amounts at the end

of the previous year...".



<br><br>Now,  it  might be thought that these  are  arrears

which can be collected in due



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



course  but I beg to doubt it. Paragraph 20 on  the

same subject reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...None of the control accounts could be balanced

at   31st  December,  1955,  and  a  recent   audit

examination of the records was abandoned  owing  to

difficulty in tracing the entries...".



<br><br>Turning  to  paragraph 22 (v)  headed  "Rural  Board

Revenue", we read this cryptic entry:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As in previous years no return has been rendered

to  show the arrears of rates which are known to be

considerable..."



<br><br>Here  is obviously a considerable loss in the Rural

Board   revenue  and  an  unknown  loss  which   by

implication  amounts to hundreds  of  thousands  of

dollars.  Had the revenue been properly  collected,

the  Government would have been able to reduce  the

grant to the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as extravagance is concerned, Sir, I will

content myself with a few major items. The first is

the Paya Lebar Terminal Building which is estimated

to  cost no less than $7,150,000. Now while I agree

that   a  first-class  building  is  necessary   if

Singapore  is to develop as a great air centre  and

while I agree that the present Terminal Building is

not ideal, this does seem to me planning on far too

grandiose a scale. I believe that the plans include

the building of a hotel. Why spend public money and

the  P.W.D.'s  time  on  a project  that  could  be

undertaken  by  private  enterprise,  and  is   the

Government,  in  any case, so sure  that  Singapore

will  remain a night-stopping place with the faster

air  services of the future? It seems  to  me  that

this  figure  of over $7 million needs considerable

explanation and examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another large item is for the new District

Hospital  regarding  which we  fail  to  understand

Government's  policy.  Last year,  we  queried  the

figure  of  $3,200,000 for this hospital.  We  were

assured that there was no extravagance. This  year,

we  are  asked to approve the figure of  $6,500,000

for   the  same  hospital.  Quite  apart  from  the

doubling of the estimate, the Ministry has  delayed

a  year  in  under-taking this project.  Prices  of

steel and other building materials have now gone up

by  15  to  20 per cent and the delay has cost  the

taxpayer hundreds of thousands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



of  dollars. Why has the figure of $3,200,000 which

was adequate a year ago become inadequate today? If

you  must  spend  $6½ million, why  not  build  two

hospitals in two places and serve more people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third large item, Sir, is $5 million to be

spent  on new Government Offices. What is  it  all

for?  Does this not imply another vast increase  in

the  cost of administration? We are being asked  to

approve  the commencement of work on three projects

amounting  to  nearly $20 million.  Unless  we  are

given satisfactory explanations regarding the  need

for  this  expenditure and the manner in which  the

estimates were made, we have every right not merely

to  vote  against these items individually  but  to

vote against this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now turn to another aspect of Government

policy. Millions of dollars are to be spent on  our

education  and  health services. We do  not  grudge

this if the money is spent carefully and wisely and

every  dollar  is accounted for, but much  of  this

money   will  nevertheless  be  wasted  if,  having

produced  well-educated and  healthy  citizens,  we

cannot  provide  them with employment.  Money  must

also  be provided for productive purposes. While  I

am  glad to see that extra money is being given  to

our  veterinary  services  to  expand,  which  will

assist  in the development of local pig and poultry

industries, I deplore the fact that there is little

money  being allotted to fisheries. The  Government

spends  less than $700,000 a year on the Department

of Fisheries and no fund whatever has been allotted

in the Development Estimates to this most important

industry. I shall have more to say on this  in  the

Committee of Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish now to refer to the progress to be made in

the  establishment of our new Singapore  Battalion.

The  Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall) told  this

House last April when he was still Chief Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is now a concerted effort being made to

produce  an operational battalion by April 1957.  I

am told that it can be done."



<br><br>I  regret  to say, Sir, that, at that time,  I  was

sceptical as to whether it could be done but now  I

am sceptical as to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



whether the Government intends to do it even by the

end  of 1957. The only items of expenditure on  the

Singapore  Battalion as I can find in the  Estimate

are $1 million for pay and allowance, 1 million for

equipment and $½ million for administration. I do

not believe that you can equip and train an officer

and  pay a battalion of 800 men on $2 million and  I

should  like  to  know  what  the  policy  of   the

Government  is  in this matter. What is  absolutely

clear is that there has been no concerted effort and

that  there has been a change in policy  since  the

Marshall  Government was in power. In any case,  it

is  clear  from the recent riots, and as I  pointed

out in this House last April, that on battalion  is

not enough if we are to look after our own internal

security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point: I have searched the Estimates in

vain  for  details  of the Central  Provident  Fund

account  in  which sums amounting to  millions  per

month  must be accumulated. How are these  millions

invested? What returns are being obtained on  their

investment  and to what use are they being  put  to

improve our financial position? I hope the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary will explain how these  funds

are invested and the Government's intentions for the

utilisation of these funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, I must return to the Government's

taxation policy. It is an old axiom but a very true

one  that it is better to sell two articles  at  75

cents each than one article at a dollar. It is  all

the  more  true  of the small close  community  of

traders  which comprises this island of  Singapore.

We  live  or  die by trade: not only  the  entrepot

trade with our neighbours, but also the trade which

we  practise  on ourselves. If we are to  live  and

prosper,  we  must not forget that axiom.  We  must

increase  the  purchasing power of the  people;  we

must sell more goods more cheaply. The greater  the

flow  of trade, not only the more revenue will flow

into the Government coffers but the higher will  be

the  general standard of living and the less  money

will  be used for social services because the lower

income groups will be able, to some extent, to look

after themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am prepared to agree that income tax

could  be raised still further than is contemplated

on   the  highest  income  brackets  without  undue

hardship  to  the  individual,  nevertheless,   the

proper principle is not so much to attempt to bring

the  rich man down to the level of the poor man  as

to  raise the income and standard of living of  the

poor closer to that of the rich. In other words, in

a  community  solely dependent on  trade,  we  must

level up and not level down. That is the policy  of

expansion by which we can survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial and economic policy of the

Government  tends  in the other direction  even  if

their   second  thoughts  have,  to  some   extent,

redeemed  them  but it will lower the  standard  of

living,  decrease  the  purchasing  power  of   the

people, reduce sales of goods and increase the need

for   social   services.  That  is  a   policy   of

contraction  which  can  lead  us  to   ruin.   The

industrial and commercial position of this  country

has  none  backward  in the  last  18  months,  not

forward,  and this Budget his done insufficient  to

reverse  this  movement.  The  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary  has stated that the future  is  somewhat

bleak. It is his financial policy which makes it so

and  it  is  because  we believe  in  a  policy  of

expansion  and  not of contraction that  we  regard

this Bill with misgivings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is said that coming  events  cast

their  shadows before and if we continue  to  spend

more  than  12  times more than we earn,  financial

bankruptcy and ruin will soon be staring us in  the

face.  What has this Government done to stop  their

prodigality in public expenditure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am surprised to know that more than two-thirds of public expenditure consist of personal

emoluments  and  yet we are being asked  to  create

another  1,727  posts for next year.  Is  this  not

utterly crazy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well-known, Sir, that in preparing their

Budgets,  Financial Secretaries who are members  of

the Colonial Service are wont to enter in provision

for services which the existing capacity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



of Government departments simply cannot provide. Is

this Budget which is claimed to be presented by  an elected   Government  any  different?  While   this Government has been in power, expenditure has  been estimated  to  increase from $197 million  to  $254 million  and  revenue  from $208  million  to  $217 million.  Is  prodigality  the  service  which  the

elected   Government  gives  to   the   people   of

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is claimed that the people of Singapore

are not tax-minded and do not like to pay taxes.  I

do  not think it right that the people of Singapore

should  be  called upon to encourage the Government

in  its  prodigality. If the Government wishes  the

people to make sacrifices, let it first set a  good

example  by  reducing considerably  the  amount  of

public  expenditure  on  personal  emoluments   and

surely  everybody including Ministers and Assistant

Ministers -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Postmen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> - should do a fair day's work

for  a fair day's pay. I know of not a single Party

anywhere  in  this world where most of its  elected

members  are Ministers and Assistant Ministers.  We

may  be  called upon very soon to meet a  very  big

bill  on account of Malayanisation. How are  we  to

meet   this   bill  if  expenditure   on   personal

emoluments is mounting? Is it not the very  purpose

of  Malayanisation  to reduce  the  expenditure  on

personal emoluments and to get local officers to do

cheaper  the  work  for  which  we  have   to   pay

expatriate officers more to do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the duty of the Government to take

decisive  steps to reduce expenditure  on  personal

emoluments  and not make Malayanisation  an  excuse

for further prodigality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is reasonable that more taxes should be

imposed to pay for the expansion of social services

but  it  is  absolutely unreasonable that  most  of

these  taxes should be spent on salaries.  Let  the

burden of taxation fall upon the shoulders of those

best  able to bear it but let us also be sure  that

the money which is collected in taxes is spent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



wisely for the benefit of the people and not

squandered away in salaries.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before I speak on this debate, I must give my  hand

to  the  Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon  Eng)

who  pointed  out  that  the increase  of  personal

relief   allowance   must  include   the   parents'

allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that we Asians live in a way

rather  different from that of the Western  people,

and  I am sure that the drafting of the Income  Tax

Ordinance  must have been placed in  the  hands  of

Western people. I wish to inform this House that it

is  high time for us to realise that, if we want to

fight  for  political independence,  we  must  also

fight  for  ideological independence. Therefore,  I

support  the Member for Queenstown in pressing  the

Government to consider the possibility of  amending

the  Income  Tax  Ordinance so  that  the  personal

relief allowance must include the parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, up to now we have heard a number of speeches

delivered by both sides. It is not surprising  that

one  side  attacks the Government Budget  as  being

colonial, imaginative or impractical. Sir, I wonder

why  no  Member on the Government side has  pointed

out  that  it  is ideally socialistic in  that  the

allocation of expenditure for the main services  of

Government,  namely,  Education  and  Health,  will

amount to 40 per cent of the total revenue. I think

the   Government  should  point  that  it  is  the

intention  of the Labour Front Coalition Government

to  take  such steps for a Socialist State as  they

have  promised us. But, unfortunately, many of  our

Members feel that they must play at party politics,

which  is  a bad habit in this House, and therefore

when  they say something, they always remember that

they  belong to such and such a Party and that they

must  stand  for  the Party and  that  stand  is  a

political  stand. Therefore, in this debate,  I  am

sure  that we, and by "we" I include the Strangers'

Gallery, are not surprised at so much rubbish being

talked about. Some Members boast and say, "That  is

my Party stand. I am the man with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



political stand and that is my stand." Sir, I think

it  is  high time that this is checked.  The  issue

that  is  facing us in this House  is  not  one  of

socialist, capitalist or progressive ideas  but  an

independent movement, and unity of strength must be

shown.  So  why  waste our time and  our  lungs  on

reflecting whether or not to believe that charge by

the  Member for Sembawang (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)

that this is a colonial Budget? It is true that  on

our  memorandum  letterheads, you can  see  printed

"Colony  of Singapore". We are still the Colony  of

Singapore. So why do we not face the fact  that  we

are  now  in the transitional period from a  colony

moving towards an independent State? Therefore when

we  study the Budget and go through a debate on it,

we  must  face  the fact that we are not  satisfied

with our colony status and that we are now fighting

towards  an independent State. That Budget produced

by  the  elected Ministers under colonial influence

can  provide 40 per cent of the revenue for welfare

services is, I think, unreasonable; especially when

we  compare the draft estimates of expenditure  for 1957 and 1956 - the $254 million for 1957 as compared

with  the $231 million for 1956 - and find that there

is  an  increase  of  $23 million.  From  this  $23

million, we find $11 million has been provided  for

the  improvement of the education system  and  $2.7

million  for  the  improvement of the  medical  and

health  services. So, based on this figure, if  one

wants  to  demand more schools, more hospital  beds

and  a  joyride over the Merdeka Bridge, is it  any

wonder  that  one  might find the  Bridge  suddenly

rising  over the Kallang River? To have  all  these

things, you have to have solid money. What we  must

consider    is    that   we   are   the    people's

representatives  and that we should  give  a  clear

picture   of  the  current  state  of  affairs   in

Singapore to our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the fact that multi-lingualism has

not yet been introduced into this House, I wish  to

quote  an  old Chinese saying, and a few  Ministers

may  understand  it. It is a very  simple  economic

theory  that  has  existed for  many  thousands  of

years.  The  saying is Chi liu kai kung.  It  means

that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



must  try  to  open  up more streams  so  that  the

outflow of water can be restricted. In other words,

we must make more money and spend less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when faced with increases for social

services,   Government  usually   says,   "Increase

taxation."   Unfortunately,   the   Labour    Front

Coalition  Government will make a great mistake  if

they  reduce the personal allowance from $3,000  to

$2,500  because  it  will affect the  contributions

which  people can really afford making towards  the

revenue   of   this  country.  I   am   sure   that

Government's  failure to increase company  tax  was

merely  based on the statement of certain  business

and financial experts who say, "If you increase the

company  tax,  you  will  stop  attracting  foreign

capital  or local investment." Sir, I am sure  that

is wrong. A few days back I had a chance to talk to

the  only banker who is a nominated Member in  this

House (Mr Sutherland). I asked him to confirm  how

much  local  capital surplus is available  in  this

country. He gave me an estimate - not official - of at

least $100 million which is lying idle in the local

banks  of  Singapore and the Federation. I  said  I

wondered why the Government could not find ways and

means  of  encouraging all this  local  capital  to

invest  in  this country and the answer  from  this

banker which surprised me was, "No, unless you  can

change  the  people's minds. Even Government  bonds

have had a weak response." So I think the Ministers

should  bear  in  mind the fact  that  we  have  no

shortage of local capital and that there is no need

for us to try to induce foreign investments. We can

afford to stand on our own and the only thing  that

we  should do is to bring our economy in line  with

political  stability. You can secure  economic  and

political stability even if the company tax goes up

to 50 per cent. Maybe I am wrong but I do not think

so,  judging  from  how  the  Ford  Motor  Company,

despite  the heavy taxation in the United  Kingdom,

insisted  on  opening  their branch  and  factories

there, and how the Austin Motor Works also tried to

open  a  factory  or offices in the  United  States

despite the heavy company tax in that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



particular  country.  Therefore,  based   on   this

theory, I think that the elected Government  should

not be misled into thinking that, by increasing the

company tax, we would merely stop local investment.

It  is  not true. The reason why the market  is  so

dull  and  investors are scared is not due  to  the

high  company tax but because of our political  and

economic   instability.  Therefore  the  Government

should   go  all  out  to  increase  our   national

enterprises  and engage in the development  of  our

local industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I wonder why we cannot develop our

fishing industry. I met an economic expert  from  a

foreign country and he said he wondered why such an

island  like Singapore is still importing fish.  He

said  it  was a terrible mistake for the Government

not  to train the fishing industry in the best  and

most ideal methods. I wish to point this out to the

elected Government, that we must not only think  of

getting more money from taxation directly,  but  we

must  also think of indirectly promoting trade  and

commerce by encouraging our national enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to speak on the means of economising

on   expenditure.  We  can  try  to  cut  down   on

unnecessary   expenditure,   for   example   family

planning   and   certain  donations   to   imperial

institutions,  and  we must take  note  of  a  very

important   point:   that   every   year   personal

emoluments  are increasing. Look at  the  following

figures.   This   year  personal  emoluments   have

increased  by $15 million. The figure for  personal

emoluments for 1956 was $98 million, and  for  1957

we  have  to  spend about $113 million. Of  course,

this  is due to the yearly increments, but I  think

we  can  still  have the opportunity  of  examining

whether there is any surplus service which  is  not

required in any department and try to save as  much

as we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While touching on development projects for health

and  education, I wish to point out to the Minister

for  Health  that  we  require more  hospitals  and

clinics,  but  we  do  not require  such  luxurious

hospitals as the Kandang Kerbau Hospital. It is too

expensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



for  we  poor Singaporeans to enjoy. We  want  more

hospital  beds  and we want more clinics  scattered

around the rural areas, but definitely we must  not

be  too  taken  up  with our  luxuries  by  wanting

everything  first-class  in  the  world - first-class

hospitals, X-ray equipment, and everything of  the

best. Our wants must be based on our pocket and our

national  revenue.  We  do not  have  rich  natural

resources like other countries. We have to rely  on

trade  and  commerce. A businessman's  income - I  am

sure many Members will know - is always uncertain.  I

take  this  opportunity to  say  that  in  drafting

Budgets  in  the future any expenditure  should  be

considered  from  the most economic  and  practical

point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spend many, many millions of dollars for

further development of schools, but I want to point

out  that  we want more schools rather  than  multi-storeyed  schools,  and to  spend  at  least  about

$200,000  to  build a school. We face a politically

critical   situation   now.  The   improvement   of

education is very essential, especially the Chinese

education system. We have to spend a lot  of  money

on  the  development of education. I wonder whether

the Minister for Education can give me an answer as

to  how many of the proposed schools to be built in

the  coming year are going to be Chinese or  Malay.

If  the policy is based on the old system that  all

schools  envisaged  to  be built  will  be  English

schools, then I am sure it will lack the support of

all  circles.  Sir,  I want to point  out  that  we

should  try  to  build  more schools  economically,

scattered  around the rural areas. I  have  visited

one  which  was built by the Member for Paya  Lebar

(Mr  Lim  Koon  Teck) and I have  been  given  the

figure  of  one class-room costing roughly  $3,000.

This school is called the Tai Teow School and it is

located in Lorong Tai Seng. To my taste, it is most

suitable  as  a primary school for the rural  areas

which are in much need of such schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government can take the advice of the

old  Chinese  saying to open up  more  streams  and

thereby restrict



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



the outflow of water, then I am sure everybody will

support the Budget.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that many

Members of the Opposition, when the debate on  this

Bill  is over this evening, will go home and  relax

and  pat  themselves on the back  having  in  their

minds  thoroughly  satisfied themselves  that  they

have  faithfully  carried out  the  duties  of  the

Opposition.  But, Sir, if they turn the  finger  of

conscience and search their hearts, they will  have

to  admit that they have not carried out the duties

that a responsible Opposition should carry out. Let

them admit that they have tried to find holes in  a

Budget where none existed.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Why none?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Because I say so. So, Sir,

not  having the force of logic on their side,  they

make  up  for  the  lack of logic by  dramatic  and

appropriate  gestures  of  their  hands,  looks  of

horror  on  their  faces when they  talk  of  a  $3

increase in driving licence fees and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong),

Sir, with undue adroitness on his part, managed  to

put   forward  a  thesis  that  luxuries  are  also

necessities. It depends on how one looks at  things

in  life.  In  certain conditions of life,  certain

luxuries do become necessities, I admit, but to say

that  workers  and labourers need radios  and  that

they  need motor cars or that motor cars and radios

are  necessities to them is stretching  the  thesis

too  far.  The  hon. Member started  off  with  the

contention   that  actual  experience   has   shown

invariably that surpluses occur in tax collections.

May  I point out to him, Sir, that if he refers  to

the  figures  of the 1956 Estimates, he  will  find

that  the  income tax collection estimate for  1956

was $65 million but the revised estimate is now $60

million? There is already a deficit of $5 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Inefficiency!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Whatever it may be! Then he

goes  on  to plead that there is no real  need  for

increasing  taxes. Sir, he wants the Government  to

cut  its  financial  Estimates extremely  fine.  He

wants us to go to a dangerous level. He wants us to

show  exactly how much we will be able to spend  in

the  coming year and not to increase taxes  because

he  thinks  that  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the

increased   expenditure  resulting  from  increased

social  services which we are pledged to carry  out

as a Socialist Government. But, Sir, may I draw his

attention  to the fact that, even after  all  these

increased  taxes as proposed by my hon. Friend  the

Financial Secretary, they will only rope in another

$20  million, leaving still a deficit of about  $17

million; and that the margin of $17 million should

probably  be  covered  by increased  collection  in

taxes  over  what is anticipated, and by  a  lesser

amount being spent under various Heads, though they

need not necessarily be savings but they can always

be  votes that are not expended this year and which

have  to he revoted next year? But that $17 million

is   a  margin  for  that  purpose,  otherwise  the

taxation proposals could have been more drastic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member went on to plead for the

poor  workers who will be affected by the  increase

in  the  price  of cigarettes due to the  increased

duty  on  cigarettes, and so on. But he  failed  to

make  the  point that if the poor people could  not

afford  the  extra  five  cents  on  a  packet   of

cigarettes, they could switch on to smoking locally-made   cigarettes  on  which  the  Government   now

proposes that the tax should not be increased.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Change of cigarettes will affect the throat.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It will affect. Sir, what I

am  perturbed about is that if there is a wholesale

change  of  the smoking habit, it will  affect  the

revenue  very  badly  and if that  happens,  it  is

possible  that the Government will have  to  review

the   exemption  from  increased  taxation  it  has

granted   on  the  tobacco  that  goes   into   the

manufacture of local cigarettes. But the worker has

the chance of smoking cheaper cigarettes now if  he

goes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



and smokes locally-manufactured cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member went on to say that the

Government changes its plans very often - I think  he

was  referring to the District Hospital  which  was

proposed to be built at Kallang and which is now to

be  built at Tanah Merah. The hon. Member would, of

course, prefer that the Government should stick  by

what it has said even if it realises that a mistake

has  been  made. Does he prefer that the Government

act that way? But he might come round and then tell

Government, "You made a mistake. You realised  that

there  was  a mistake. Why did you not change  your

plan?" Of course, he would change according to  the

scene at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on with a lot of talk about the high

rents that the S.I.T. charges the poor dwellers who

cannot  afford them. I, Sir, was one who had always

been  against  these high rents of the  S.I.T. but

then  whom  did I come up against, Sir? I  came  up

against  Members  of his Party in  the  S.I.T. who

justified  these high rents and when  I asked  the

S.I.T. authorities, "Why do you charge $400 or $450

for  a  shop?", they answered, "We have  to  get  a

profit  out of the shops in order to subsidise  the

dwelling houses." That is the excuse they  gave  to

me. But I suggest, Sir, that he can more profitably

talk  with certain Members of his Party who are  on

the Board of the S.I.T.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Government controls it. The Ministry of Housing.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Then he dwells at length on

the  economic position of Singapore and on what  my

hon.  Friend the Financial Secretary has said about

Singapore  being  a great trading  centre,  and  so

forth. He bemoans the fact that The Federation  are

imposing a tariff barrier on Singapore. I too. Sir,

bemoan  that  fact.  In  the past,  the  Federation

Government   taxes  have  been   irksome   to   our

industries,  but  now, frankly, I am  disturbed.  I

have not been sleeping over it, Sir. My predecessor

the  Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall) and myself

have been feeling disturbed about it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



even in the past but I am feeling more so now -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> What are you doing now?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, what am I doing flow? I

am coming to that. We have, Sir, raised this matter

very  often with the Federation Government  but  so

far there has been no agreement reached and I think

that  I warned this House a month or two back  that

economics   in  the  present-day  world   in   many

countries  are dictated by politics. They  are  not

purely dictated by economic reasoning but they  are

dictated by political reasoning and therefore, Sir,

I think that the solution is not one of an economic

approach but rather of a political approach. If  we

can  once get the political situation clarified and

settled, we might find that this difficulty will be

done   away   with.   Sir,  the   Liberal-Socialist

Party - some  members of which belonged  to  the  Progressive  Party - have not done anything in the  past

to   help   this  situation  towards  a   political

settlement.  In fact, some of them  have  made  the

situation worse and I quote, Sir - memories are short

sometimes   but  sometimes  every  thing   is   not

forgotten - from  the  Singapore  Standard  of   18th

September, 1951:



<br><div align="center">"'UNITY' CALL-COLONY INDIGNANT. `WHAT? FEDERATION SHOULD JOIN US INSTEAD'</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call of Dato Thuraisingham, Federation Member

for  Education, that Singapore should be a part  of

Independent Malaya met with varied reaction in  the

Colony yesterday, ranging from complete endorsement

to  the  indignant  remark, `The Federation  should

join Singapore.'"



<br><br>Then I quote Mr John Laycock, a leading member  of

the    then   Progressive   Party,   now   defunct,

fortunately:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Legislative Councillor. Mr John Laycock said.

'There  is  no  question of Singapore  joining  the

Federation now....'"and so on.



<br><br>Mr  Soh Ghee Soon, another leading member  of  the

Progressive Party, now defunct, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can never agree that Singapore should join the

Federation.  I  consider  Singapore  to   be   more

politically advanced than the Federation."



<br><br>Now,  of course, they are more politically advanced

than us. Dato C. J. Paglar -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



I  am sorry to mention his name, Sir; he is no more

with us - said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore should remain as it is. Just as

Hongkong  is  to  China, Singapore will  serve  the

Federation well."



<br><br>Wishful thinking, Sir! My contention is this,  Sir,

I  still  firmly believe that the solution  of  the

economic   problem  between  the   Federation   and

Singapore  is a political one and not  an  economic

one.  That holds true for many other countries with

whom  we  are  doing  trade.  But  I  will  not  be

surprised, Sir, that if this sort of tariff barrier

does persist, some of our factories will have to go

to  the  Federation  and we cannot  help  that;  no

government in Singapore can help that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member did talk on trade and that the

Singapore    Government   should   create    stable

conditions  and a sense of security.  Sir,  we  are

doing all that we can to attract foreign capital to

set  up  industries. I outlined at the last sitting

of  this  House  the programme that Government  had

planned  for  the  expansion and  encouragement  of

industries. Beyond that, I think it is  a  question

of  political  stability as the Member  for  Changi

(Mr  Lim Cher Kheng) has pointed out and as I have

said  at  the last sitting. The events of the  last

month's  riots  and the events that  have  gone  on

before  during the last one and a half  years,  not

only the so-called political agitation but also the

so-called  trade  union agitation  led  by  certain

people with political motives, have done great harm

to Singapore's good name and to the confidence that

Singapore  would  otherwise have  enjoyed  by  many

foreign capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the question of the Industrial

Promotions Board. What will the Government do  with

the  $1  million?  How will it be controlled?  What

will  be the policy? Will it be flexible or  rigid?

Why does not the Government announce the scheme? If

the  hon. Member has a little bit of patience,  the

Bill  will be coming before the House very shortly.

It  is  now in draft form and, with a few finishing

touches,  it  should be ready very shortly.  But  I

will  say  this, Sir, that it will be  a  statutory

Board, and the Board will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



have  the  funds  allocated  to  it.  It  will   be

responsible for giving out the loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes the Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng) who asked, "Why not

tell us the real position? Why tell us that you are

financially  sound and yet tax us more  and  more?"

Sir,  no  matter how far we can produce a Financial

Secretary  who may be a wizard or who  may  have  a

gift of seeing into the future, no human being  can

tell  what  the future will exactly  be  like  and,

normally,   estimates  are  prepared   on   certain

background  performances and  expectations  of  the

future.  Sir,  you cannot expect any government  or

any Financial Secretary to do better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown claimed that the House

was  told  that we were on the verge of bankruptcy.

That  is  not so, Sir. At no stage was  this  House

told  that  we were on the verge of bankruptcy.  In

fact,  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary  gave  an

assurance in his speech that the financial position

was sound. There is no question of bankruptcy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a long lament on giving grants to

charitable  organisations.  Sir,  some   of   these

charitable organisations do a lot of good  for  the

people  and save Government a lot of money  by  the

amount  of relief work that they do which otherwise

would  fall on the shoulders of Government and  the

taxpayer because of direct grants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to the tax on petrol and the

increased  registration fee for cars. He said  that

if  a  worker travelled by taxi, it would  be  very

expensive and that he would have to pay about $8 on

taxi  fares.  Have hon. Members ever heard  of  any

country in which a worker travels by taxi? I do not

know what the definition of "worker" is now in  the

minds   of  the  Opposition  Members  but,  as   is

recognised even in this Colony, our Provident  Fund

Ordinance  provides a limit of $200 a month  income

beyond  which  a  worker is made to contribute.  It

recognises the fact then that with an income of  up

to  $200 a month a man is supposed to come into the

very low income group. The S.I.T.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



also - on which the Liberal-Socialist Party had a lot

to  say - put  a  limit of $200 for the lower  income

group  to qualify for the very cheap rental houses.

Sir,  it is generally recognised that a person with

an income of up to $200 a month is taken as one who

is  in  a  low income group. Beyond that, it  is  a

matter of degrees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) said

that we should develop fisheries. We are doing  so,

Sir,  but  to develop fisheries, it does take  time

and  it  is not as easy as just casting a  net  and

getting  a ton of fish out of the water.  It  is  a

phased  programme which takes a number of years  to

produce  results.  We  have  the  Fishery  Research

Station here which is not only for Singapore but is

a regional Station.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Where are the results?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I will come to that. That

station,   Sir,  has  a  long-term  programme   for

research  and,  so  far, I think  it  has  been  in

existence  for  four years. It has done  a  bit  of

research   but  it  has  not  shown  any  immediate

results.  I am now directing my attention  so  that

this  station  should change its programme  to  one

that  will  show a more immediate result  and  that

matter  is receiving attention but beyond that  the

granting of three licences for joint fisheries with

the Japanese should bring in more fish. I think the

Japanese  fishing-boats will be coming in in December

under those three licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, after all the lament by the Member for

Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) over driving licence

fees,  and so on, I think he has not taken heed  of

what  happened  in  the City Council  at  the  last

Budget meeting. The leader of the Liberal-Socialist

Party  at  the  last  Budget meeting  in  the  City

Council declared that there is no poor man and that

even  a market stall-holder is a capitalist.  Then,

Sir,  in the City Council, they raised the hawkers'

licence  fees from $1 per year to $12 at first  and

subsequently to $48 per year -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Shame!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> - and that, Sir, is not

hitting  the  poor man. They say that  they  cannot

possibly  afford  to pay $3 more  for  the  driving

licence. They are poor men but the hawker  is  not;

he is a capitalist and he can afford to pay from $1

up to $48 a year. That is their logic, not ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the luxury tax, Sir, it is an

equitable  tax.  It  is a tax  that  any  Socialist

government would be happy to introduce.  It  is  in

line  with Socialistic principles. It is a tax that

will hit the man who can afford to pay. If a person

is  rich  and can afford luxuries, let him pay  for

them. On the grouses that the Opposition have  made

not  to  tax the poor, I do not see why they should

have  a grouse on the Luxury Tax Bill because  this

tax  is  designed and aimed at the rich and not  at

the poor. But one deserving argument was raised  by

the  Member  for  Tanglin (Mr John  Ede)  that  it

should  be  seen  that  the  free  port  status  of

Singapore is not endangered as a result of this tax

and  I think the Hon. the Financial Secretary  will

be  glad  to  assure him that before  any  item  is

placed as coming within the orbit of the Luxury Tax

Bill,  we  will examine it very carefully  and  see

what  effects  it will have on the entrepot  trade.

Every  care will be taken to see that the  entrepot

trade  does  not  suffer as a result  of  any  item

coming into the Luxury Tax Bill.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is very alarming that our expenditure should go

up  sky-high year by year. When we look at page  13

of  the Estimates which shows the expenditure  from

April  1946 to 1955, the period between April  1946

and  1947 was generally the reoccupation period but

after  that period, the expenditure rose  from  $74

million  in  1948 to $197 million in 1955  and  the

present estimated expenditure for 1957 is shown  as

$254  million. At this rate, the Colony  is  surely

drifting to bankruptcy. I do emphasise that this is

so  and  the reason is this. This is a small island

of  about  224  square  miles,  part  of  which  is

occupied by the Services. It has no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



natural   resources   of  its   own,   unlike   the

Federation. The only resource is its entrepot trade

and  if  the  principle of the  free  trade  policy

maintained  up  till  now is jeopardised,  I  think

Singapore will be nothing but a strategic island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our revenues have been derived so far from

taxes  on  tobacco,  alcohol,  petrol  and  through

income tax. With the exception of income tax, other

taxes  are  going  up  and  up,  which  is  causing

hardship to all, especially the poor. Now may I ask

some  questions,  Sir, and  I  hope  the  Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  will reply.  Where  does  the

money  from  the  revenue go to? Am  I  correct  in

saying  that 55 to 60 per cent of the revenue  goes

towards administration costs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, Singapore is a very small

island.  In  the  pre-war days,  we  had  one  High

Commissioner  for  Singapore  and  the  Federation.

Today we have a Governor, the Chief Minister, eight

Ministers and four Assistant Ministers. Do we  need

so  many  people  when  this island  was  governed,

though   in   the   colonial  way,   by   Permanent

Secretaries who are still in the administration and

drawing  the same salaries? This has added  to  the

expenditure  of  the  Colony - their  high  salaries,

allowances, entertainment allowances,  and  so  on.

Sir, when a country is going to achieve its freedom

the  people  of the country willingly  should  come

forward to serve the country and accept service  at

the lowest salaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> They take what they can get.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> That is not so in every place

and  as  we are well advanced, we can come  forward

and  show  our patriotism. Of course, I  must  give

credit  to  two or three Members on the  Government

side  who  had much more income than what they  now

earn.  There is no doubt about it; they  have  made

sacrifices. But for what is it after all? They  are

holding positions of honour and they must serve the

country but if they feel that they cannot sacrifice

their former lucrative jobs then they can carry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



on  with  those  jobs and not accept their  present

posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said before, what is the use of doing

away  with  expatriates when  you  cannot  get  the

administration costs reduced? They have to run  two

homes,  educate their children abroad, and  so  on,

which is not so with our local people. I do not say

that  they should not live comfortably.  I  do  say

that they should and they must have a decent income

but  this  must be according to the needs  of  this

country  and not England or even India  or  Ceylon;

expatriates come from many places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Luxury Tax Bill - whatever name you may

call it - means more or less a duty on imported goods

and  it  will  be a departure from the  free  trade

policy. I will dwell on this subject when this Bill

comes up, possibly tomorrow, for Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the higher the taxation, the more wages will

have to be paid and the cost of production will  go

up.  We have no hinterland to serve. If there is  a

hinterland, you have to pay duties like  any  other

country; I am not criticising the Federation.  They

have their own policies. But what will a factory in

Singapore do if the cost of its manufactured  goods

is  put up making them uncompetitive in price  with

imported  goods? Johore is only 16 miles from  here

and  you  can set up a factory there. What is  then

the remedy for us? The only remedy is to bring down

the cost of living, cut down expenditure and expend

what you can afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, details on the various Heads will be

discussed  at the Committee stage but I would  like

to  touch  on  the Department of Broadcasting.  The

motion  of Malayanisation moved by me in  1952  was

passed  and  the Department still remains  full  of

expatriates.      I      understand - subject      to

correction - that there is only one local man  acting

in  an  executive post. That can also be  discussed

later. Why should the Department of Broadcasting be

a  Government  department? Why  should  it  not  be

commercialised or why should it not be changed to a

corporation  and made to run on a profitable  basis

as it is done in other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



countries?  The  argument from the Government  side

has  been that Government should have some  control

over  this  department. Of course, any  corporation

can be controlled by making a condition: Government

can  appoint  a nominee on the Board. This  can  be

easily done. As far as propaganda is concerned, any

government  in  power  would  like  to  have   such

machinery but at whose cost?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no provision has been made for the abolition

terms  of expatriates. How many millions of dollars

will  be required? There is also no provision  made

for the nationalisation of transport. I hope it can

be  pointed out to me whether a provision has  been

made and, if so, how much? We will require at least

four  or five battalions and how much provision  is

made  for  them? Where is this money to come  from?

Higher  taxation?  At what rate and  on  what?  The

money is not going to fall down from heaven, is  it

the   intention  of  the  Government  to   mortgage

Singapore  even before merdeka comes?  Certainly  I

would not like that to happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, remarks have been made about contributions

to  various  charitable organisations.  This  is  a

State  without  an official religion  as  has  been

quoted  today and I will dwell on this  subject  at

the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, stress has been laid on the import of

foreign  capital. If a man pays a dollar per  share

as  investment he takes away 15 to 200 per cent  in

dividends yet that $1 still remains even  after  he

has, benefited so much!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, alcohol can easily be taxed more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I will personally be affected, I have

no  objection  to  a little higher  companies  tax.

There is nothing wrong in that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that the Labour Front is a Socialist

Party.  I  hope  the Labour Front  understands  the

meaning  of Socialism. If they understand,  I  hope

they  practise  it.  I was told  that  some  peopie

should    only   smoke   locally-made   cigarettes.

Socialism mean that everyone should have  an  equal

chance to enjoy everything created in this world



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



and  not  to have two different levels in life  for

poor  and rich people but here I see that with  the

Labour Front, Socialism is something different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would suggest to the Hon.

the   Financial  Secretary,  whose  task  is   very

difficult,  to  try and reduce expenditure  on  the

various  items and that if he does so,  there  will

not  be a deficit but possibly a surplus and  there

may be no need for higher taxation.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, it is rather a

thin House and I do not propose to take up too much

time,  but  there are a few points I think  I  must

make. I want to deal with certain matters of policy

in  my Ministry but I think I ought to deal, first,

with  a certain economic aspect of the whole Budget

and  the  whole Singapore situation. We  have  been

having  a  lot  of very interesting comments  about

details in the Estimates: whether you make a  grant

to  the  Automobile Association, and so  on - I  will

have  a  word about that - but what we have  not  had

really,   as  I  can  see,  is  anybody  from   the

Opposition attempting to give an overall picture of

the future economy of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary did quote

from Sir Sydney Caine's memorandum some very useful

points  which  have  not been  touched  on  by  the

Opposition and, on the contrary, the general  theme

of  the Opposition may be summarised in the remarks

of  the leader of the Liberal-Socialist Party  who,

apart  from saying that the Government was creating

an  impression that taxation was necessary and then

saying   that  there  was  no  need  for  increased

taxation,  finally said that all  additional  taxes

were  unnecessary  and that the  Government  should

drop  each  and every one of them. The  Member  for

Queenstown  (Mr Lee Choon Eng) said  the  same,  I

think.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I stand up with some timidity, but unashamed,

Mr  Speaker,  as  an advocate of  higher  taxation

because  this  country of Singapore must  get  more

capital  investment.  We need therefore  to  create

savings  and form capital on a national scale.  The

need arises from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



fact that in Singapore one and one do not make two,

but  one and one make 3.9, that is, if one and  one

are a man and a woman, the average household is 3.9

people, if  you  like  to transform  that  into  a

demographic projection, it means that you  have  an

annual increase of four per cent in your population

and  that  this  is perhaps the highest  population

increase  in the world. It beats Puerto Rico.  This

increase  in  the  population  is  an  increase  in

dependants  rather than an increase  in  productive

workers.  You  can take a look at the  1955  Annual

Report  which  gives  you a nice  tabulated  figure

diagram   showing  the  population   structure   of

Singapore  with  its  enormous  mass  of   infants,

tapering up to the workers and at the very top, the

old.  By  a little simple arithmetic and guesswork,

you  can  project  that forward,  without  being  a

mathematician, into a reasonable guess as  to  what

the  future population will be. We may have another

quarter of a million people on this island  in  the

next  five years but of that quarter of a  million,

only  50,000 or 60,000 will be an addition  to  the

working  force  and the rest - about 200,000  or  so,

give or take a few thousands - will be an addition to

the  dependants,  the children and  the  aged.  The

effect  of  that - if you like to  break  it  down - is

roughly that one worker in Singapore has to provide

for  the needs not only of himself but also of  two

dependants; and as the population goes  five,  ten,

fifteen, twenty years forward, that situation  will

go  on  and the number of dependants will  increase

relatively  to  the  number  of  workers.  In   the

lifetime  of  this Assembly - some  Members  of  this

Assembly  and not the body as a whole - we  may  have

three million persons trying to live on this island

and that will be very largely a consuming and not a

producing population. If you increase the number of

people  who  are eating out of the rice  bowl,  Mr

Speaker,  then the amount that each one  gets  will

decrease. The only answer to this increasing number

of  dependants in this increasing population is  to

make  the  rice  bowl bigger; in  other  words,  to

increase  our  total national production,  and  you

cannot  increase total national production  without

investing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



capital  in  the  equipment  which  you  need   for

production. If we go on as we are, we are condemned

to  a  fall in the standard of living and no  pious

hopes  and  no suggestion that we do  not  tax  the

drivers  of  motor  cars  are  going  to  make  any

difference to that. There will not be enough to  go

round unless we invest very considerably. If we are

going  to improve the standard of living,  we  must

invest  at  a  still higher rate, for  productivity

depends  partly on equipment and partly  on  skill,

and  both  these are matters in which you  have  to

have  investment  on a national scale  if  you  are

going to meet national needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this idea of investment in mind, the Labour

Front  put  in, as the first item in its  four-year

programme, a detailed survey of the national wealth

in  order that planning could go forward. I am  not

proposing, Mr Speaker, to take up the time of this

House  with  a  lot of arguments  about  the  gross

national  product,  the net  national  income,  the

ratio  of investment to production, and the  annual

net  capital  formation, but we can,  I  think,  be

satisfied  with the simple statement that  we  have

got to have a very large investment and that it  is

going to be very difficult to get enough capital to

invest.  I hope it will not be too long before  far

more  competent persons than myself in the economic

advisory  unit do produce something  which  can  be

made public so that the brains of this Assembly can

really  study  this  problem of getting  sufficient

capital  investment over the next few years.  I  am

content, Sir, to say that we must invest and I have

just  remarked  that investment means,  of  course,

- one   Member   of   this  Assembly   referred   to

"investing"  in  gambling -  in  things  which   are

productive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also assess priorities within our

investment  programme  so  as  to  get   the   most

productive  use of the capital. Certain  items  are

obvious.   If   we   are   going   to    keep    up

technologically,   we  must  have   education   and

schools.  If  we  are going to  have  a  reasonable

number  of  hours of work per worker  in  a  year's

work,  we  have to keep the people fit and healthy;

we  have to have health services. As housing  is  a

basic preventive health measure, we have to provide

as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



far  as  we can decent standards of housing.  Those

are not to be thought of as welfare services in the

sense that you pity people and say, "Of course,  he

has  not got an education." They are vital  to  the

economic  future of the country. It is very  proper

and right that they should be regarded as "welfare"

in  the sense that they do provide for welfare  but

they  are  not  charitable needs based  on  pitying

people. They are vital because you need the  people

to  build the country and you have to have  a  fit,

healthy, trained and skilled population to meet our

needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another field of investment covers the services

provided  publicly for communications,  for  trade,

commerce  and  industry;  our  sea  port,  airport,

telecommunications,  postal,  water  supply,  power

stations,  drainage  and  all  the  rest  of  these

obvious things. The points I have mentioned so  far

have been traditionally left in the field of public

investment. They come out in the Estimates  and  in

the Development programme and you can see what they

are, but they only account for 50 or 60 per cent of

the  total  capital  investment  in  a  place  like

Singapore.  Most  of the studies of  this  kind  of

thing  are  related to other types of  economy  but

commerce and industry are traditionally left to the

private  sector  of investments. How  far  that  is

necessary, I do not know. It appears to  me  to  be

necessary  at present that a considerable  area  of

the  economy should be left to the private  sector,

but  there is already continuous pressure  in  this

Assembly from the Opposition for the Government  to

start   interfering  with  commerce  and  industry,

assisting  them,  subsidising  them,  strengthening

them and providing them with funds, and so on,  and

I  think  that is probably not only a right  policy

from  the socialist point of view but also a  neces

sary policy from any practical point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if we are going to get this capital for

investment, we have to ask, "Where?" We can  either

get it from our own resources or we can get it from

overseas.  If we are not going to have heavy  rates

of taxation, increasingly heavy rates, then we have

got  to  go overseas for that money. We can  go  to

Great Britain or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



America  and  ask, "Will you give us a  grant?  In

other  words, give us a handout. We have  no  money

and we need money. Give us foreign exchange so that

we  can  import  the  equipment  we  want  for  our

factories or communication centres, or whatever  it

is."  We  may or we may not get the grants we  need

but  we shall be competing for them against a great

many  other under-developed countries many of which

may  well  appear  to be more fruitful  fields  for

investment. It is the same with loans. Whether they

are  low  interest or whether they bear the  normal

economic interest, there again, we can try and  get

them  but  we have to compete with a lot  of  other

people who are looking for them as well. If  we  go

to  the  British  Government or go  to  the  United

Nations  and  try to get money out of  them,  there

will be a queue of other people and we have to take

our  place in the queue. We will take what  we  can

get and when we get it, it may not be a "no-strings

attached" grant or loan. It may well have some sort

of  strings attached. We can also try to get  money

from  overseas  by raising loans  in  the  ordinary

commercial  loan market or, of course, we  may  get

money by tempting the investor to come here and set

up  his  factory and put his personal money or  the

company's  money  into  development  here.  In  the

interest  of  brevity, I will  not  read  from  the

remarks of Professor Paish, Professor of Economics,

London  University,  (with  special  reference   to

Business Statistics, I think). Anyhow, he is a  man

of  some  weight in the economic world.  He  thinks

that  it  is  going to be exceedingly  hard  for  a

country  like Singapore to get any money  from  the

private investment field, whether by raising a loan

or  by  getting direct investment, and  he  remarks

that the further the country advances towards self-

government - that  is,  a hitherto  dependent  Colony

advances  towards self-government - the  smaller  the

chances  of  getting  any money  from  the  private

investor. I do not know if we need to take quite so

dismal  a  view  as  Professor  Paish  takes,   but

certainly   we   have  got  to  reckon   that   our

expectations of capital from overseas are going to

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



limited  and it is right, to some extent,  that  we

should  desire to limit them because if you  depend

for  your  finance on overseas borrowing,  you  are

mortgaging your country to the people who have lent

you  money. It has a colonial aspect, an aspect  of

economic subjection which is not very desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, therefore, that it is necessary and

important, if we are going to have merdeka, for  it

to  be economic as well as political merdeka; if it

is  going to be fruitful and prosperous, we  should

raise  our  own  money in Singapore  from  our  own

resources.  It means devoting more of the  national

income  to  investment and less to consumption.  In

the  U.S.S.R., I believe that investment  has  been

running  since  1928 at about 25 per  cent  of  the

gross national income. The U.S.A. runs at about  15

per  cent. Here I would not like to say. I am  told

that  it may be 10 or 12 per cent and that  if  our

population can be stabilised, we may be able to get

by  on  our  present rates of replacing depreciated

capital  and  providing new  capital  for  expanded

development; but with our population expanding,  we

cannot hope to provide for them unless we very much

increase  or  perhaps double our  present  rate  of

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remark, in passing, that when we come to

the  stirring  debate on family planning,  which  I

expect  will be an annual feature, I hope that  the

anti-family planners will take note of  my  remarks

about  population and investment  and  will  refute

them in order to justify their opposition to family

planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to have savings in Singapore, we

must get them in one of three ways. You can let the

capitalist  make  profits at  the  expense  of  his

workers and then, in his own judgment, he puts  the

profits  into  new investments where he  thinks  he

will  make  further profits. Or the Government  may

tax  his profits and income and luxury consumption,

and  the Government may put its tax money into  new

investments. Or the third way is that the  ordinary

man  may be thrifty and consumes less than he might

in  order to invest. I cannot see any other way  of

getting money from our own resources.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we say, "We must tax the rich. Do not tax the

poor  but tax the rich", it means nothing. All  you

mean  is  that  you are using the  rich  as  a  tax

collector for you. Instead of paying out the  money

in  wages to his workers, he accumulates it for you

and  you take it from him; he remains unpopular and

the Government hides behind his back. Well, that is

fair  enough. In a transitional stage,  that  is  a

necessary process. You cannot abolish the fact of a

capitalist organisation at once. You can  only  tax

and  gradually  transform  it.  But  you  have   to

recognise  that  if  you  are  going  to  use   the

capitalist to collect your revenue for you and then

you  tax him; or if he is organising the profitable

enterprises   for  you  and  then   this   Assembly

legislates itself into a position of having a claim

to  a large or small part of his profits; then  you

have  got  to  leave enough to keep him interested.

You can tax him as high as you can provided he does

not  say, "Well, I am not going to bother with this

work for you anymore. I am not getting enough pay.

I  will  pack  up. I will sell the company  and  go

elsewhere." But he will when he does not  think  he

is getting enough. We do not want to bring industry

to  a  standstill by an excessive tax  on  profits.

What  we  have,  in effect, been doing  since  this

Government came into office is to ensure by  policy

and  by  legislation that a greater portion of  the

national  income is distributed to the  workers  in

the form of wages. That is the effect of the Labour

Bill,   and   the   Clerks  and   Shop   Assistants

legislation. It is also a general result of the way

things  have  been  going. As you  distribute  that

proportion  of the national income in  wages,  Sir,

you increase the amount which will definitely go to

consumption  and which will not go  to  investment.

Now   that  policy  of  distributing  more  of  the

national  income was a right and necessary  policy.

Two  or three years ago, one person in four of  the

population was living on less than a dollar a  day,

or  a family of four on less than a hundred dollars

a month. That redistribution of national income was

necessary to lift part of the burden



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



of  intolerable poverty which had been  imposed  on

that  very large part of the population in the past

but    redistribution   through   wages   is   very

inequitable. Two men work on the same standard  job

and receive the same standard rate of pay; one is a

bachelor  and  the  other has  a  household  of  11

people. They have the same pay and if you treat  it

as  a  matter  of contribution to production,  that

standard rate of pay is fair enough. If you look at

it  from  the point of view of necessity, obviously

the  man  who has 11 people to provide for  is  not

going  to  get enough, and a bachelor will probably

have too much. If we are going to get nearer to  an

equitable  distribution of the national income,  in

my  view,  we have to supplement wage increases  on

the  one hand by social security schemes and on the

other hand by improved taxation techniques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree that where a man has a lot of

dependants, you have to make some provision for him

so  that  the dependants are looked after. A  great

deal  is  said  about the Asians maintaining  their

parents;  as  far as I know, so do  the  people  in

England whose parents are in need and any person in

the world will maintain his parents if they are  in

need.  It is perfectly true that in the absence  of

social security, the people in Singapore do have to

carry  a  great many more dependants and much  more

burden  than they would if we could get the  social

security  structure  in; but where  a  man  has  no

dependants - I think I am right in saying that  about

ten per cent of the working population in Singapore

has  no  dependants - and he sends his money  perhaps

overseas  to  Europe and China, you ought  to  take

another look at it. It is all very well if a man is

a  Malayan living here and makes his home here:  by

all means, let him support his dependants here, but

if  he  is  just a bird of passage whose  heart  is

elsewhere, why should he export our wealth  to  his

mother country? However, that is another issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we do need to construct our taxation

system  so  as  to  bring the real distribution  of

wealth  nearer to equity and nearer to  sanity.  We

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



also  got  to accept the principle of differentials

and  that you cannot equalise all incomes. You will

not get the people to do the work unless there is a

higher rate of pay for an engineer than for a clerk

and  if  you  make the rates of pay the  same,  the

people will say, "We are not going to bother to  be

engineers;   we  may  as  well  be   clerks   since

everything is easy." You have further got to accept

that an experienced engineer is worth more than  an

inexperienced one. The aim is not to extinguish the

differentials  but to make sure that  nobody  falls

below a minimum standard of living. But if you once

accept  the  principle of differentials in  income,

you  have  to  accept  also  that  there  will   be

differentials in the burden of taxation in one  way

or another. It is only a matter of the distribution

of  the  national income: how much can each  person

get  out  of  it - whether you  give  him  a  hundred

dollars and then tax him ten dollars or whether you

give  him  ninety dollars and do not take  any  tax

from  him?  It is really a book entry,  but  if  we

cannot get the money by voluntary savings, which is

more comfortable or less painful, and if it has got

to  be taken, it must be taken in tax. We must  get

it somehow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made these remarks, Mr Speaker, Sir,

because I felt, to a considerable extent, that  the

Members  of  the  Opposition were  launching  their

attack  in the wrong direction. They were grumbling

about  the fact that it is not easy to say  whether

we  are  going  to have a deficit  or  not  on  the

Estimates because you cannot perhaps clear  a  site

and therefore you cannot build a large hospital  or

a school - that kind of problem. I think that is fair

enough  but I think that they would have been  more

constructive if they had approached us on the other

aspect,  and  said that we were not spending  money

fast  enough -  not throwing money  away - because  we

were  not  getting enough capital  investment  into

this  country in the public sector. I do not  think

that  they can sustain that attack because  we  are

doing  as  good  a  job  as could  be  done  in  my

judgment; but at least it would have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



been the right line of attack for them to take, and

not  to  go  round and say that all  proposals  for

further  taxation  are  nonsensical.  It  shows   a

complete lack of appreciation of the situation. You

have  got  to  look ahead if you are  going  to  be

seriously running a country in this world today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, with relief, I abandon my

notes   on  economic  problems,  which  I  am   not

particularly fitted to deal with, and will turn  to

some  other aspects. Perhaps I might take, firstly,

the newspaper report by the well known Mr Tan Lark

Sye.  This is a translation or a summary and  I  do

not know that it necessarily represents him rightly

or not; but this is what is given in the summary:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Local banks and other savings organisations are

keeping  deposits  from local people  totalling  at

least  $300 to $500 million, if not $1,000 million.

By  investing $1 million in a factory at least  300

persons   will   have  employment.  Local   capital

therefore is sufficient to run hundreds of or  even

one thousand factories. But why don't they invest?"



<br><br>The  answer, of course, is that if they have  their

capital   in   a   savings  bank   or   a   savings

organisation, it is invested because that  is  what

the  bank exists for. I am sure that Mr Sutherland

does  not  lock up all the dollar holdings  in  his

bank.  The  whole purpose of a bank is to  canalise

savings  and  to  invest them. But the  point  that

probably Mr Tan Lark Sye was approaching but could

not  grasp is that you have in this country a  very

large volume of hoarding, partly by the people  who

buy these gold bangles - I forget which Member of the

Opposition referred to the difficulty of  the  poor

worker  who wants to buy a bangle. I should  advise

him  not to buy it: I should advise him to  make  a

post   office  savings  or  some  other   form   of

investment  because  the gold bangle  will  not  be

productive of goods and quite possibly it  will  be

stolen.  If  he  invests his money  and  gets  some

interest  on it, he will contribute to the  welfare

of  the  country. That is one thing which could  be

done  and  I think that what Members of this  House

who  can  persuade anybody should do is to get  the

people to mobilise their hoardings and put them  to

work. Apart from the jewellery and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



that  sort of thing, there are also people who keep

dollar notes, and quite large sums locked up  in  a

tin  box  in a cubicle. These sometimes get  stolen

and  go back into circulation. From a social  point

of  view, that is a very good thing but, of course,

it  is  not  very good for the person hoarding  the

money.  If  the  people  would  get  their  hoarded

savings into circulation, we would get on faster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I pass on to some of the attacks made on the

Government. The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon

Mong)  pictured  the Government as saying  that  we

have  no need to try and save, that the people will

find  the money for us and that we do not  have  to

economise  and  he suggested that we were  building

lavishly  and  wasting  our  money  on  "frightful"

structures and that kind of thing. We had the  same

sort  of line from the Member for Sembawang  (Inche

Ahmad  Bin  Ibrahim) - as usual the  People's  Action

Party   follows   the  general  Liberal   Socialist

line - who suggested that our schools cost as much as

if  they  were  built  of marble.  The  Member  for

Ponggol-Tampenis  (Mr Goh Chew Chua)  referred  to

the prodigality of our Government's spending. Well,

I am not going to deal with that in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see a lot of points put down for reducing by

ten  dollars for this or that. No doubt,  we  shall

get these details in the Committee of Supply. But I

am  going  to make a few general remarks about  the

cost of Government buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I do welcome attempts by the

Opposition  to  show us where we are  building  too

lavishly,  if  we are, in fact, doing  so.  We  are

extremely  conscious of the need  for  economy  and

austerity  and  we  have  set  up  special  working

parties on schools and medical buildings to try and

get  the cost down. We have given increased  powers

and  extended  the Public Works Standing  Committee

for  the  same  purpose and  we  have  set  up  the

Advisory Panel on Public Buildings, again  for  the

same   purpose,   and  we  have  included   on   it

representatives of private architects. So  we  have

tried  to provide a structure to produce economical

and efficient building. If we are not succeeding, I

shall be glad to know, so that we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



get  our  buildings  still more economical;  but  I

cannot  accept, unless good reasons  can  be  given

which  have  never been given yet,  the  suggestion

that we are squandering money on buildings made  of

marble  and all that sort of thing. It is just  not

so,  as  far  as  I can judge. It is  difficult  to

compare the Public Works Department buildings  with

the  sort  of  buildings that are done  by  private

enterprise.  There  is only one authority  you  can

compare  with, and that is the S.I.T. In fact,  the

S.I.T. and the Public Works Department do very much

the same work. As far as costs go, those two public

organisations  do match up very closely,  which  is

significant; but when you try and compare our costs

with  the  private sector, it turns  out  to  be  a

matter of etiquette for architects and builders not

to disclose for public comparison what the costs of

their plans are. So I have not got reliable figures

and  am not able to say, "Well, here is a plan  for

25 flats built by private enterprise and here is  a

plan for 25 flats built by the P.W.D. Let us have a

look  at  them and see what the different items  in

the  specification were, see what the costing  was,

see  what  the tenders were and see what the  final

building  cost  was." Apparently,  you  cannot  get

these  figures,  but if Members of  the  Opposition

were to feel that those figures ought to be brought

out,  I  suggest  that  they  take  it  up  in  the

Estimates  Committee. Mr Speaker will be directing

them  and they will have the function of suggesting

where economies can be made consistent with policy.

I  think  it might be a very useful thing  if  they

could   get  some  experts  in  and,  without   any

partiality, try to get a genuine assessment of  the

building industry, because the building industry is

having  a  rather difficult time now and, in  fact,

contractors  are tending to drop out  of  business.

One  or two have gone bankrupt; tenders are falling

off and prices are rising. It might be a good thing

to have a look at the causes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy therefore to make effective

comparisons with the private sector but we can make

comparisons   with   primary   schools   in   other

countries.  We  have  now got our  standard  three-storeyed primary school down to a cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



of  $350 per pupil. That takes in the playing field

and  ancillary  services as well as a  big  school.

That  is the average cost, of course, as one school

can  be  more  costly to construct because  of  the

site.  On the old plan, the cost was $430 per pupil

and  in  that  saving of $80 we have  absorbed  the

current  increase in prices. That is the figure  at

present:  $350  per pupil for the  school  complete

with  its  playing field and all services.  In  the

United Kingdom, for the rather low average type  of

primary school, the cost is $1,190 per pupil, which

is  approximately three times more.  Similarly,  in

Singapore, our secondary schools work out  at  $704

per  pupil whilst, in the United Kingdom, they come

out  at  $2,394.  The  United Kingdom  builds  very

lavishly.  Somewhere here I have a  letter  from  a

friend  which came this morning. It has nothing  to

do  with building cost, but it mentions that  small

children go direct to their own cloakroom from  the

classroom. They have pegs put up at the height of a

child;  the  water closets have special  seats  and

their  hand-basins are special low  ones  with  hot

water  laid on; each child has his own towel marked

with  his own symbols - cat or dog or flower, and  so

on.  The  classroom  has the cloakroom  next  door.

Well,  that is a lovely school but we cannot afford

it  in  Singapore  and they do build  at  a  higher

standard in Britain, and provide more amenities. Of

course,  we do not have to provide heating and  our

wages costs form a smaller part of total costs than

they  do  in the United Kingdom; but, nevertheless,

it is very creditable indeed that our school prices

should be relatively so low and if hon. Members can

show  us  any  way  of getting  them  down  further

without  improper  sacrifices of quality,  I  shall

personally  be  highly delighted. I  might  mention

prefabricated aluminium schools made in the  U.S.A.

or  in  the  U.K., and sold in South  Africa - or  in

Britain   for   that   matter.  A   single-storeyed

prefabricated aluminium school costs more than  the

single three-storey P.W.D. standard schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Deliberately left here -->Hon. Members heard talk about medical costs as

well.  They are not so easy to compare. It  is  not

easy  to  control either, for that matter,  because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



doctor will say, "You must have this. If not, it is

not  healthy."  It is difficult  to  argue  with  a

doctor  but  I can give you one set of  figures  on

this.  The probationer nurses hostel was originally

entered, I think, at $880,000 and when the detailed

designing  was  done,  that  brought  it  down   to

$770,000  and  the  actual cost  achieved  (through

economy in finishes primarily) was $680,000,  which

was a saving of $90,000. Well, that is the sort  of

approach  which  I  have been  trying  to  make  to

buildings - to  try  and get the cost  down,  but  we

should  not bring the cost down, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

to  the extent that we put up the maintenance cost.

You can put in very cheap bricks in the wall but if

they  are too cheap, perhaps they will crumble away

and  fall  down. I have seen bricks which  you  can

pick  up and crumble in your fingers as though they

were a piece of earth and I saw them going into the

walls   of  a  building.  The  building  is   still

standing. I do not know how long it will stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will draw attention to the P.W.D. Report of

1955  which  shows the capital value of  Government

buildings   as   nearly  $221   million   and   the

maintenance costs, expressed as a percentage of the

capital  value, for permanent buildings is .99  per

cent,  for semi-permanent buildings 1.79 per  cent,

and  for  temporary buildings 3.79 per cent.  Those

are  low maintenance costs, I think; but if you  do

not  keep  your standards high, you will  get  very

heavy  maintenance costs as soon as  the  buildings

cease  to be new and get some hard wear. That  will

run    up    your   recurrent   expenditure    very

considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would like to remark that

we  had some very warm and emphatic praise for  the

private builders from the Member for Serangoon (Mr

Lim  Choon Mong) and I welcome the efforts  of  the

private   builders.  They  are  building   a   very

significant section of the housing accommodation in

Singapore but I cannot agree that the standards  to

which   they   build  are  fully   acceptable   for

Government buildings. I will not disclose the  name

of the complainant here but it is an association of

residents  in  one  of the building  estates.  They

wrote  to  me early in September. They addressed  a

letter  to the agency which is running their estate

and building it and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



they  have  not had a reply yet from the agency  to

their  complaints  and  now they  write  again  two

months later to bring up the same matter again. Let

me  just read a few complaints from the list  which

they make:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drive from the car porch to the road is thin

tarmac  and not 3" cement on well rammed hard  core

as  specified (in other words, you have a skin laid

over  the  ordinary earth and as soon as  you  have

driven  your car over the new drive, it cracks  and

you will find yourself driving through mud);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drains cracked and improper fall (in other words,

the  drain  is not so constructed as to  allow  the

water to run away properly);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concrete slabs badly chipped, cracked and do not

fit squarely on drains;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding door in lounge/terrace badly warped

sagging and split;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rendering on cement flat roof badly cracked.

Rendering should turn up 6" on adjoining walls;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First two courses of roofing tiles are not wired

as per specification;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roof timbers stained and unpainted;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facia boards cracked and damaged; or too near to

edge of tiles;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garden not levelled and land slide of banks:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fencing not securely fixed;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaks in roofs and/or flat roofs;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walls cracked;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaster cracks;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceilings in halls, bedrooms, bathrooms, and/or

kitchen sagging, badly stained;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concrete floors need repair;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cement skirting round house cracked;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part roofing timber and insulating bounds require

replacement;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathroom floors uneven and causing water to

collect;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathroom tiling and plastering badly chipped;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cisterns in bathrooms need repair;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long baths cracked;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linen cupboard door, shelves, cement rendering

inside cupboard require attention;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosaic tiles broken down;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specified brass door hinges not provided;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal sink instead of glazed porcelain sink;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows out of alignment; etc.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is my hon.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It occurs to me that the building

and  that we should not bring, our public buildings

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also had some remarks about the omission of

the  transport take-over costs from the  Estimates.

It  is  with regret that once more I appear  in  my

capacity  as  a  schoolmaster  in  this  Assembly - a

schoolmaster who has lost his notes.  But  if  hon.

Members will read the White Papers which are  drawn

up  and published, they will find that we published

Sessional  Paper No. Cmd. 48 of 1956  dealing  with

the unification of the omni-bus services. Paragraph

10 of it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is of course of the utmost importance to the

large  number  of  persons  who  will  be  affected

directly  or indirectly by the Government's  policy

of  unifying the passenger transport system that as

clear an indication as possible should be given  of

the  target  dates for the various  stages  in  the

implementation of that policy. It is expected  that

the  adviser  will  require  a  year  in  which  to

complete  his  reports  and that  consideration  of

these and preparations for putting them into effect

will  require a further six months. The  assumption

by  a  unified  undertaking of  responsibility  for

operating  any bus services will not  therefore  be

possible before the middle of 1958.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think it is fair enough for the

Opposition to say, "Too late", but it is  not  fair

for  them to say, "You should have put for the 1957

Estimates  what is going to be spent in 1958."  Nor

do  I think it is well advised of them to say,  "We

will  put  down in public the figure we propose  to

pay  before  we  have  completed  the  process   of

negotiation."  Either it will be too  high  and  we

shall be throwing away our money or it will be  too

low  and  we  shall  be  accused  of  cheating  the

capitalists.  However, the Opposition have  brought

it upon themselves. They must do their homework and

that is all I can say about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take a few other points as quickly as I

can.  We  had  a  question  about  the  Paya  Lebar

Terminal Building's cost being high and whether  it

includes  a hotel or does not include a  hotel.  It

will   include  necessarily  a  few  bedrooms   for

emergencies for sick people brought from planes  or

cases  like  that.  You  may  have  somebody  whose

passport is not valid or a person who has  been  in

contact   with   a  suspect  may  need   a   health

certificate and he may have to be kept  within  the

sanitary cordon. You have to keep him there and you

have to provide a few overnight rooms for that sort

of special accommodation; but nothing in the nature

of  a  hotel  is contemplated. I would remark  that

although   the  cost  of  the  permanent   Terminal

Building is considerable, the revenue even  on  the

present  temporary building is good. It is  running

at  about  33 per cent of the all-in cost  for  the

Singapore  Civil  Aviation  headquarters  for   the

airport  and  for the Regional Air Traffic  Control

Centre.  If you take the direct cost of the airport

only, it is running at about 80 per cent revenue as

compared  to cost and that is within 18  months  of

its opening. In other parts of the world, the ratio

of  the cost to revenue ranges from 10 per cent  to

36  per cent so that though we are not right up  at

the  top,  we are very near the top for  the  whole

world. The concentration of figures is about 30 per

cent.  That  is the median point, I think,  in  the

line; we are above the median point. I hope that we

shall  improve on those figures and I would  remark

that in the trip to Britain which I had to take  in

an aeroplane - which I regard as a most uncomfortable

way  of travelling, if I may say so - I thought  that

the  airports through which I had to pass - when  you

get  down  for two hours or an hour and a  half  or

perhaps  longer  in going in and out  of  them - were

depressing places. I am sure that it is worth while

to  have  a  really good airport in Singapore.  You

will  get  people staying overnight bringing  money

into  the  place  and you will get your  air  lines

coming   here   instead  of  going  to  alternative

airports  because  it  is an attractive  place.  We

ought to make things



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



attractive for the passengers so that I think  that

there  is a good case for giving Singapore a really

good  airport,  partly because you  will  get  more

revenue out of it and partly because it will be  an

attraction to the travelling public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also had a number of references to personal

emoluments: suggestions that we ought  to  cut  the

civil  service - I  am not quite sure  whether  these

advocates of economy wanted to cut the salaries  of

civil  servants  or to reduce the number  of  civil

servants. I doubt if they seriously think that they

could  do either unless they want to get a  general

acceptance  of  a  cut in the  life  of  the  whole

economy.  But I would like to stress that,  in  the

departments  of  the  Ministry  for  which   I   am

responsible,   we  are  providing   essential   and

expanding services for Singapore and I hope that we

shall  not have any nonsense about cutting personal

emoluments in things like the postal services where

the mail handled increased from 57 million items in

1949 to 92 million items this year. We are not  far

off from having doubled the number of items handled

in  the course of the year but we are very far from

having doubled the staff and, in the same way,  the

savings  bank which is handled by the  Post  Office

has  also, I think, about doubled the number of its

subscribers. These postal services are, of  course,

showing  their usual satisfactory rates of  profit,

and  for the Telecommunications Department as well,

the  revenue is expanding on the basis of providing

services  which  are needed by the people  of  this

city. Both the Press and commerce and industry need

these   services.   They   get   them   from    the

Telecommunications  Department  and  they  pay  for

them.  The  revenue which was under $5  million  in 1956 is expected to approach $6 million in 1957. In 1953,  it was just over $3 million. The revenue  of

the Telecommunications Department is expanding very

significantly  in  relation  to  the  services   it

performs, which are valued and wanted by the people

of  Singapore.  In  the Civil Aviation  Department,

again, I find our passenger traffic has expanded by

about  25 per cent since the new airport was opened

and, compared with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



normal  world  average expansion of about  15  per

cent per annum in passengers, we are well ahead of

the rest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point I might mention very briefly.

The  Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall) expressed

concern  about taxi-owners having to pay  the  new

registration   fee  on  their   taxis.   He   will

appreciate  that the details of this  impost  were

worked out whilst I was away but we are having  it

looked  into in the Ministry. The machinery  is  a

little  complex between the Finance  Ministry,  my

Ministry, and the Registrar of Vehicles and  there

are  other  hands  that have to go  into  the  pie

before we can work out the recipe.



<br><br>5.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, there are one or two points  raised

by  the Opposition concerning my Ministry to which

I think I should reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon this morning drew the

attention  of  this Assembly to  the  question  of

rents  of Trust houses. He says that in Boon  Keng

Road, the S.I.T. houses are being let out at  $110

each  a  month, whereas the same type of  premises

built  by private enterprise are being let out  at

$75 each per month. The fact is that there are  no

S.I.T. houses which are being let out at $110, but

they  are rented out at two rates - at $89  and  $99

respectively, but inclusive of services the  rents

are  $96  and  $105  respectively.  The  rents  of

postwar  houses  can  and  do  differ  since  they

reflect the year in which they were built and  the

building costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then come to the question of car shelters for

S.I.T. officers. Here again, I am afraid that  the

Member  was  wrong  because car shelters  for  the

S.I.T. were  meant for the employees employed  by

the    Singapore   Improvement   Trust   and   are

apportioned  between both the European  and  Asian

staff  and between both junior and senior officers

on  a  basis of first come, first served. So there

is  no  question of discrimination. In  any  case,

this is a legacy from the Progressive Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which was raised by two

Members   of  the  Opposition:  the  question   of

collection  of  arrears  of  rents  on   Temporary

Occupation  Licences due to the gross inefficiency

of  the Rural Board and the Land Office. It is not

an  evil  of  this Government since it  came  into

being.  There  have  been  arrears  of  rents   on

Temporary Occupation Licences from prewar days and

it  is an evil which the Rural Board and the  Land

Office are trying to eradicate. It is not easy  to

solve  the  problems of arrears of  rents  due  to

Government  on Temporary Occupation  Licences,  as

any landlord in Singapore can tell you.



<br><br>5.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, the year 1957

will  be  yet  another stage in the  economic  and

social development of Singapore in the history  of

the  elected Government. Sir, the experience which

the  Government  has  gained during  the  past  18

months  has been well used in the planning of  the 1957  Estimates.  Being the  Member  for  a  rural

constituency, Sir, I believe that these  Estimates

show  a  brighter future for the rural population.

There  are  very  many items  like  bus  shelters,

footpaths, roads in resettlements, the development

of  playing  fields,  public markets,  standpipes,

etc.,  which  are all included in the  Budget  for 1957. I feel that, with the implementation of  all

these  services  in  1957, the rural  people  will

really feel that the money allotted to these works

is  well  spent. Although this may not be adequate

to  meet  their  requirements, I feel,  with  some

justification, that a great many more improvements

will  be taking place in 1957 than in 1956.  There

will be some other matters which might affect  the

economic development of the rural population and I

am   sure  the  Government  will  look  into  them

carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one question raised about the salaries

paid  to  the staff of the Government, Sir,  by  a

Member of the Opposition. I feel sure that  it  is

very  difficult for anybody to reduce the existing

salaries  in  order  to show  a  decrease  in  the

expenditure in the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member of the Opposition, Sir, also referred

to Ministers who own cars, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



he said that only Ministers were allowed to possess

cars. He also said that a certain Minister had told

him that if he was not a Member of the Assembly, he

would not be able to possess a car. Sir, I wish  to

answer  this Member by saying that a car  is  being

used by me not as a luxury, but just as a means  of

expediting my work as a Member of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also feel that there is justification for

allotting    adequate    money    for    charitable

organisations. A Member of the Opposition said that

all  these  contributions were not very  essential.

Sir, I have seen many projects which have been paid

for   by   the   public  through  these   voluntary

charitable organisations. In Singapore, too,  these

organisations  play a great part in helping  people

by  various  means. I feel that  it  is  right  and

proper  for any government to give adequate aid  to

voluntary charitable organisations which would help

people to a very large extent generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that these Estimates will go a long

way towards the provision of more amenities for the

people in 1957.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

colleagues have replied to almost all the questions

raised by the Members of the Opposition. There  is,

however, one matter which I would like to speak on,

and that is about the Income Tax Ordinance. As hon.

Members   know,   the  Income  Tax   Ordinance   is

administered  on  a  pan-Malayan  basis,  and   any

proposed changes in the rates of tax must have  the

agreement  of  both Governments. In view  of  this,

there  have been prior discussions between the  two

Governments  and  it  was after such  consultations

that a compromise was reached, and both Governments

submitted  the  proposed changes simultaneously  to

their two Legislatures on 7th November. Since then,

strong  opposition has been expressed in the Press,

and  also  in  letters to the  Government  by  many

members  of  the  public, including  the  Singapore

Trades Union Congress, to the proposed reduction in

the  personal  allowance  from  $3,000  to  $2,500.

Criticism was also expressed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



during  the  debate  in the Federation  Legislative

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this strong opposition served to confirm the

view  that this Government had that such a proposed

reduction would not meet with general approval, but

before  this  proposal could be withdrawn,  it  was

necessary  for  this Government to reach  agreement

with  our Federation friends. I therefore  flew  to

Kuala  Lumpur  on  the morning of  Wednesday,  14th

November,  and had discussions with the  Federation

Chief  Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. The Federation

Legislative  Council, Sir, had however  passed  the

Second  Reading of the Appropriation Bill  on  13th

November, and I was therefore confronted with  this

difficulty.  My friend Tunku Abdul  Rahman  lent  a

very sympathetic and understanding ear to the views

which  I  expressed to him. I explained  that  this

Government  felt  that it should  not  impose  this

proposed  reduction against such strong  opposition

but  that  if his Government should feel  that,  as

their  Appropriation Bill had  already  passed  its

Second  Reading, it should therefore not  make  any

changes.  I said that this Government was  prepared

to stand by the compromise reached with them. Tunku

Abdul  Rahman told me that he would have to consult

his  colleagues and that he would give his  support

to   my   representations.  The  result  of   these

discussions,  Sir, is now known  to  hon.  Members.

Once  again,  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman  has  shown  his

friendly  attitude to Singapore and my  colleagues.

and  I  greatly appreciate this. In the short space

of   less   than  one  month, he  has  given   two

outstanding  instances of his great friendship  for

Singapore  and we look forward to a happier  and  a

closer   relationship  with  our  friends  in   the

Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Amen!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The Opposition, Sir, touched

on the question of motor cars. They wish to have  a

graduated  scale. Here again, Sir, we had  to  have

agreement with the Federation Government  in  order

to impose this tax. It was felt by both Governments

that  a  graduated  scale would  not  be  of  great

advantage unless it was the intention to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



drive  away large cars from the roads. The  tax  of

ten  per cent on all cars was, we felt, a fair  one

to  those who could not afford big cars. Of course,

they pay a smaller amount in tax, and those who buy

nice big cars pay a larger amount.



<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart) rose-</b>

<b></b>

<b><br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b></b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In reply. Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate

has  been  long  and very interesting  and  I  find

myself in the happy position of having had most  of

the  questions asked by the Opposition answered for

me  by  my  colleagues. I may  perhaps  be  allowed

however  to  deal  with one or two  which  I  think

remain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, one or two Members of the

Opposition  have questioned the need for  increased

taxation.  The argument is based on the fact  that,

in  the  past, estimated deficits have been  turned

into  surpluses  and, indeed,  the  estimate  of  a

deficit which I myself made last year has, in fact,

been  turned  into a very small surplus.  I  would,

however,  draw attention to the fact that,  whereas

in  the past, surpluses have been very substantial,

the  surplus  in 1956 has been reduced  to  a  very

small amount indeed. I would also draw attention to

the  fact that estimated expenditure is now  higher

than  it  has ever been before. All this  estimated

expenditure will have to be met sooner or later.  I

do  think,  however, on the basis of experience  of

previous  years, that there  will  be  savings  on

personal emoluments and there may perhaps be  small

savings  on  Other Charges Annually  Recurrent  and

there  certainly will be a small number of  revotes

in  Other  Charges  Special Expenditure.  In  these

circumstances, I think that something of the  order

of  $17 to $18 million of the estimated deficit  of

$37  million  will be underspent  but  there  will

remain  the hard core of something of the order  of

$18 million to be met by increased taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members have stressed the necessity for

economies   in  Government  expenditure.   I   must

emphasise that it is the intention of Government to

practise stringent economy and to effect savings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



wherever  they can be made. This process  has  been

started  and  is continuing. The greatest  possible

control   was   exercised  at  the  time   of   the

preparation  of the Budget, and the expenditure  of

Government  departments  has  been  reduced  to   a

minimum. I think hon. Members will have noted  from

the  Schedules which have been presented this  year

that  the  amount of applications for supplementary

votes has been very considerably reduced this  year

by  comparison with other years. Hon. Members  will

also  note  in the Estimates that in  the  case  of

Other  Charges Annually Recurrent, apart  from  the

very  substantial  increase  in  education  and  in

pensions, the increase in the estimated expenditure

of other departments is comparatively small. Again,

Special Expenditure has been drastically reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention has been drawn by Members of the

Opposition  to  the  fact that personal  emoluments

have  increased by $13 million in the coming  year.

This is not surprising, Sir. The medical and health

and  education services are expanding very  rapidly

indeed  and, as will be seen from the list  of  new

appointments   given   in  the   memorandum   which

accompanied the Estimates, over 70 per cent of  the

new  appointments are in the Medical  or  Education

Departments.  In the case of all other departments,

new  posts have been reduced to an absolute minimum

and  have only been allowed where they are required

for  the efficient discharge of Government business

or  where  they  will  result  in  an  increase  of

revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention has also been drawn to the very high

percentage which personal emoluments bear to  other

Government expenditure. I myself do not  find  this

very  surprising. Government does provide  services

for the public and services can only be provided by

servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to taxation, Sir, my colleague the

Chief  Minister has explained the circumstances  in

which  the  personal reliefs were restored  to  the

previous  level. I will not touch upon  the  matter

further  except to say that - I speak as an official

rather  than  as  a Minister - at the  present  time,

19,000 people in Singapore out of a total of 1.2



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



million pay income tax and this position cannot  be

expected  to  last for very long. More people  will

have  to  be  made  subject  to  tax  and  personal

allowances will have to be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members on the other side of the House  have

suggested  that the raising of the rate of  tax  on

the  first  two slabs of taxable income will  cause

hardship: in short, that the raising of the rate of

tax  from  three  per cent on  the  first  slab  of

taxable  income, and four per cent  on  the  second

slab  to  five per cent will cause hardship.  This,

Sir,  I  cannot believe, and I should like to  take

this  opportunity  to  quote figures  to  show  the

increase  in  tax resulting from these changes.  I

speak now, Sir, of chargeable income, that is,  the

amount of income which is subject to tax after  all

allowances  have been subtracted. On  a  chargeable

income of $200, the old rate of tax was $6 and  the

new  rate  of tax is $10. Therefore, an  individual

who has an income of $3,200 will pay $10 instead of

$6. On a chargeable income of $500, the old rate of

tax  was $15, and the new rate of tax will be  $25.

On a chargeable income of $700, the old rate of tax

was  $23  and  the new rate of tax  is  $35.  On  a

chargeable income of $1,000, the old rate  of  tax

was $35 and the new rate of tax is $50. Thereafter,

right up the scale, the result of these changes  of

rates  on the first two slabs of taxable income  is

$15.  I  cannot  believe that these increases  will

cause hardship to anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) asked what the

yield  from this particular change in the  rate  of

tax  would  be. I regret that I have  not  got  the

figures with me but, speaking from memory, I  think

it  will  be of the order of $250,000 but  that  is

subject  to  correction. It  has  been  asked  what

justification there was for imposing this  rate  of

tax  which might cause hardship when the yield  was

so low. I did draw attention in my Budget speech to

the fact that the low rate of tax at the bottom  of

the scale was perhaps uneconomic. This increase  in

the  rate may render it economic. I think that  the

amendments to the rates of tax on the higher groups

of chargeable income have the general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



support  of  the  House and I agree  that,  without

causing  hardship, these rates could very  well  be

increased,  and I hope that both Governments  will,

in the future, see their way to increase the rates.

At  the same time, in all fairness to the taxpayers

in  the  higher income groups, I should  point  out

that on the basis of 1955 figures, 19,000 taxpayers

in  Singapore paid $22 million worth of tax.  There

are,  out  of these 19,000 taxpayers, approximately

1,200  people who have chargeable income of $30,000

or  more,  that is, six per cent of all  taxpayers.

This six per cent paid almost $16 million or 68 per

cent of the tax coming from individuals. So I think

hon. Members will agree that, while the rate of tax

on   these   incomes  might  be  increased,   these

taxpayers  do  already  make  a  not  unsubstantial

contribution to the welfare of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to company tax, as my friend and

colleague  the Chief Minister said, it  is  a  pan-Malayan matter and the desirability or otherwise of

increasing the rate of company tax was discussed at

great  length with our colleagues in Kuala  Lumpur,

and  the  Members of both Governments came  to  the

conclusion  that it would be inappropriate  at  the

present  time to increase the rate of company  tax.

The  reason for this decision I gave in  my  Budget

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend the Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall)

asked  whether the question of excess  profits  tax

had  been considered and I can assure him that this

question  and  other  similar  proposals  such   as

surtax, were considered but it was decided that  it

would  not  be appropriate at the present  time  to

impose such taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing to the question of tobacco, hon. Members

are  now aware that the rate of tax on what I  call

the   Rhodesian  type  tobacco  imported  for   the

manufacture  of  local machine made cigarettes  has

been reduced to pre-Budget levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also draw the attention of hon. Members

to  the  fact  that, as a result of representations

from   the   local  manufacturers  of  cigars   and

cheroots, the rate of tax on leaf tobacco  will  be

restored in the near future to pre-Budget levels.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and colleague the Chief Minister has

explained that we did consider the question of  tax

on  a  sliding scale on motorcars but  in  the  end

decided that a flat rate would be better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there are many further points

that  I  should touch on, Sir. The question of  the

luxury  tax  will be debated fully  in  the  Second

Reading of the Bill tomorrow. I would however  like

to take this opportunity to say that the Government

is fully seized of the necessity for preserving the

entrepot   trade  and  doing  nothing  which   will

jeopardise  that  trade  and,  at  the  same  time,

jeopardise the prosperity of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) suggested that,

before we increase rates of income tax, it would be

better to stop evasion of tax at present rates.  He

questioned whether the team of investigators  which

had  been  built up had achieved the objects  which

were  intended.  The  question of  examination  and

investigation of evasion started seriously  in  the

middle  of 1954 and I am sure hon. Members will  be

gratified  to  know  that the  investigation  team,

starting off as one man with subordinate assistants

and increasing in 1955 to two men and this year  to

three   men,   has  achieved  the   collection   of

approximately $5 million worth of tax  which  would

otherwise have been lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend the Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall)

questioned  the desirability of charging  long-term

loans  to the Singapore Improvement Trust and other

bodies  to expenditure. The reasons why we  propose

to  follow  this  course were given  in  my  Budget

speech and I do not think that I need repeat  them.

Hon.  Members,  of course, are aware that  although

these  loans  are withdrawn from the  Statement  of

Assets  and Liabilities, they appear in Appendix  F

of   the   Estimates.  The  Member  for   Cairnhill

suggested,  however, that a note might be  made  at

the foot of the Statement of Assets and Liabilities

drawing attention to the fact that these loans were

shown in another place in the Estimates and I  must

say  that that was my original intention. I  regret

that this note was not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



made  in the copy of the draft Estimates now before

you but it will be made in the final copy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) asked certain

questions  about the Central Provident Fund  and  I

suggest  that  he  direct  his  enquiries  to   the

Chairman of the Provident Fund Board. The Provident

Fund  Board  is  a statutory corporation  which  is

entirely  independent of Government.  At  the  same

time,  however,  I  must say  that  the  Board  has

contributed largely to local loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member, Sir, I think it was the Member for

Serangoon  (Mr Lim Choon Mong), made reference  to

renting S.I.T. flats at $100 a month. I should like

to make it clear that out of the 11,000 flats owned

by the S.I.T., approximately 300 bear rents of over

$90.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, concludes the remarks that I wish to

make  on  today's debate and I now beg to move  the

Second Reading of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Division. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Clear the lobbies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee of Supply, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Wednesday, the 21st , Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Government allotting five

days for the Committee of Supply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> We are allotting five days, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In accordance with Standing Order

69(4) ,  I have allotted the time - on the basis  that

there  will be five allotted days - to be  given  for

each  head of expenditure in the Schedules  to  the

Bill and for the clauses of the Bill. These will be

circularised  and will also appear in the  Official

Report.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In allotting the time I have, of course, taken

into consideration the indications given to me by

Members at the conference of the 16th of November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time available, however, will not be

sufficient to meet in full the requirements of

Honourable Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had, therefore, to curtail such

requirements and consequently Honourable Members

will, no doubt, be as brief as possible in their

speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following are the times allotted -
