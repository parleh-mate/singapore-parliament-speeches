<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>MALAYAN STUDENT UNIT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Secretary (i)

what  is  the  object  of the  newly-formed  Malayan

Student   Unit  in  England;  (ii)  who   made   the

appointment  of Mr W. C. S. Corrie as head  of  the

Unit; and (iii) what are his duties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (in the absence of Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Question No. 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. D. Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. D. Higham:</b> The answer to the first part of

the  question is that the Unit is not, as suggested,

a  new  organisation. It was formed in 1953 to  take

over   the  responsibilities  of  the  Director   of

Colonial Scholars in the Colonial Office in  respect

of students from Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, Mr

Corrie was appointed by the Governments of Singapore

and  the Federation of Malaya to take charge of  the

Unit   temporarily,   pending  a   more   definitive

appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of the Unit include responsibility for

placing students in centres of higher education, the

administration  of  scholarships,  arrangements  for

passages, reception, accommodation and welfare,  the

administration of the amenities fund, administrative

duties   in  connection  with  all  ranks   of   the

Federation  and  Singapore military forces  and  the

Royal  Malayan Navy attending courses in the  United

Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Sir, could the Chief Secretary

inform  us  whether the Government of the Federation

of  Malaya had consulted the Government of Singapore

at the time Mr W. C. S. Corrie was appointed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INCOME FIGURES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Financial Secretary

how  many  people in Singapore for the years  1950  to

1954  had incomes of between $1,500 and $2,500, $2,500

and  $5,000, $5,000 and $10,000, $10,000 and  $30,000,

$30,000 and $50,000, and of more than $50,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (in the absence of Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Question No. 2.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> I regret that the information

required  is  not available in the precise  form  in

which  it  is sought. On the other hand, the  Income

Tax  Department Statistical Abstracts for the  years

1950  to  1954 give detailed information  about  the

number  of taxpayers in the various assessed  income

groups  which correspond closely to those  specified

in  the  question.  Reference is  invited  to  these

Abstracts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 4 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $369,070 for Head 4 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 5 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Chairman, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $2,760 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 3 (2), Principal Assistant

Secretary, Grade E, on page 27 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the post of Principal Assistant

Secretary,  Grade  E,  is  a  standard  one  in  the

service.  My  information is that the appointment

in  the  Commissioner-General's Office  is  confined

solely  to Europeans, and the present holder of  the

office is a European.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I refer the Government to page 121, sub-head 1 (4) where there is an example of such a

post - "Principal Assistant Secretary to  Ministry  of

Commerce  and Industry" - which is an upper  timescale

post?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer the Government also to page 216, sub-head

1  (2) "Principal Assistant Commissioner for Labour,

Class II" - an upper timescale post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these officers are taken to the Commissioner-General's Office on transfer from the Singapore

Government    Establishment    and    the    Malayan

Establishment.  There is no reason, particularly  in

view  of  the desire of the Government to  keep  all

government   expenditure,   whether   on    personal

emoluments or other unnecessary expenditure, to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



barest  minimum,  for this post to be  upgraded.  No

explanation  has been given why it  has  been  found

necessary   to   make   this  particular   Principal

Assistant  Secretaryship  a  superscale  appointment

when  all  other  Principal Assistant Secretaryships

are  timescale  appointments. If one  looks  at  the

number  of  senior  officers in  that  Division, - one

Assistant Commissioner - General for Colonial Affairs,

Grade D, one Principal Assistant Secretary, Grade E,

one  Assistant  Secretary, Grade  U,  one  Assistant

Secretary,  Class II, and two Assistant Secretaries,

Class  III - we  find there are six officers,  and  of

these,  three  superscale appointments  are  sought.

These  are  the Assistant Commissioner-General,  the

Principal  Assistant  Secretary  and  the  Assistant

Secretary, Grade G. Mr Chairman, Sir, I do not know

whether  you will permit me, whilst we  are  on  the

same  Head, to make a reference to the next item  to

which I propose to move an amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you can comment on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The arguments, Sir, are more or

less the same. There is no reason why this Assistant

Secretaryship  should be boosted  from  a  timescale

post  to  a superscale post. I would like  first  to

hear  what the Government has to say before  I  make

further remarks on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. D. Higham(Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The   Chief  Secretary  (Mr  J.  D.  Higham):</b>  Mr

Chairman, Sir, if all the rabbits that the  magician

from  Tanjong Pagar produces out of his hat  are  as

thin as this one, then there will not be even enough

meat to make a good rabbit pie. There is no question

of  an  upgrading of these posts. I agree  that  the

tide   of  Principal  Assistant  Secretary  is  used

somewhat  loosely  in  the  service.  It  does   not

necessarily  indicate posts of  the  same  grade  or

importance.  There  are  other  Principal  Assistant

Secretary jobs in the service, including one that is

held  by  a  local  officer, that carry  superscale

rank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two particular posts in the Commissioner-General's Office are a backlog



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



of  Ritsonisation. The Legislative Council  approved

the   Ritsonisation  of  all  superscale  posts   in

Government   in  1954.  These  two  posts   in   the

Commissioner-General's Office alone were left out of

consideration, because it was necessary for both the

Malayan  and  Borneo  Governments  concerned  to  be

consulted   and   their  agreement   obtained.   The

Singapore  Government's  interest  in  these  posts,

financially, is only to the extent of 22  per  cent.

It took some little time to get the Ritsonisation of

these two posts agreed. By the time it was done, the

Legislative Council had ceased to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit here that there has been an error in

that   the   sanction  of  this  Assembly   to   the

Ritsonisation of these posts was not  sought  at  an

earlier  time.  Had it been sought,  I  should  have

asked  you,  Mr Chairman, to consider  ruling  this

motion out of order under Standing Order 33 (1)  (b)

in that it would affect the emoluments already drawn

by  an  existing officer. As it is, I can  only  say

that  there is no question of upgrading.  In  fact,

the  total  pay that would have been paid had  these

posts been substantively occupied would have been no

greater.  In  certain circumstances, it  might  even

have been less than under the pre-Ritson regime. The

posts  have, in fact, not been substantively  filled

because  the whole organisation of the Commissioner-General has been in a state of some uncertainty  for

several  years  past and it was felt that  it  would

have  been improper to appoint substantive  officers

to  these  superscale posts - posts that  have  always

been  superscale - and then find that  they  were  no

longer   required   in   the  Commissioner-General's

Office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am happy to

hear  from the Chief Secretary that he is very  keen

to  rule out any discussion on the question  of  pay

for European officers by invoking Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think that is a fair

remark.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I was just

drawing  a  reasonable inference from the remark  by

the Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



Secretary that he wished this question had  received

the approval of the previous Legislative Council, in

which  case  he had hoped that no further discussion

would  be  permissible under Standing Order  33  (1)

(b).



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are, as hon. Members know,

bound  not only by Standing Orders but also  by  the

Order  in Council. Standing Order 33 (1) (b),  which

has been referred to, repeats, in fact, the Order in

Council, section 60 (3), and no matter how much hon.

Members dislike the Order in Council, we must  still

consider  that we cannot debate any matter which  is

ultra vires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Standing Order 33 (1) merely says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except with the recommendation or consent of the

Governor  signified thereto, the Assembly shall  not

proceed - ".



<br><br>in the relevant paragraph (b) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"upon any bill or motion, which, in the opinion

of the Speaker or the Attorney-General, would

affect any alteration in the salary, allowances or

conditions of service... of any public officer..."



<br><br>That,  I  think, is the Standing Order to which  the

Chief  Secretary has referred but, in fact, it  does

not  arise  in  this case. It might arise  in  other

cases, I do not know, but the point is that a motion

can  be  made but it cannot be proceeded with  under

our     constitution    without    the    Governor's

recommendation or consent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you will, Mr Chairman, Sir. I

am  glad the House has been reminded this morning of

the limitations under which this Assembly operates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the Chief Secretary has

explained  to  us that this was the backlog  of  the

Ritson  revision and that, in fact,  the  amount  to

which the Singapore Government is committed is  only

22  per cent. But he has not explained to us why  it

has  been thought necessary to upgrade the Principal

Assistant  Secretary to Grade E  and  the  Assistant

Secretary to Grade U.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Chief Secretary has admitted

before  the Malayanisation Commission that there  is

no person in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>

Malaya  who  can  do a proper job analysis,  to  put

these  various  jobs in their proper categories  and

give them their proper values. Up to now all we have

had  from the Chief Secretary is an explanation that

this  was the backlog of a revision which might have

been made much earlier and he was sorry that it  was

not made earlier. But he has not given us any reason

why,  in  the  opinion of the Government,  they  are

prepared  to  support to the extent of 22  per  cent

this upgrading of two posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> As I have said before, and as I repeat

now, there has been no upgrading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $3,120 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  sub-head  3 (3),  Assistant  Secretary,

Grade G, on page 27 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little I wish to add at the moment

to  what has been said with respect to the Principal

Assistant Secretary. The Chief Secretary denies that

there  has been an upgrading, but I think he  cannot

deny  that  in the Remarks column those scales  have

been shown as being pushed up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> I would only comment on the last remark

of  the  hon. and learned Member for Tanjong  Pagar

that  the scales may appear to have been pushed  up,

but the total emoluments proposed have not, in fact,

been  increased.  This is pure  Ritsonisation  which

means consolidation of a proportion of the old  cost

of  living  allowance into the basic rates  of  pay.

Lest  there  should be any further  misapprehension,

may  I remind you, Sir, that this consolidation was,

on  balance, a greater benefit to the local  officer

than to the

expatriate?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $554,030 for Head 5 ordered to stand

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal is that Head 6: Legislature should be

increased  by $22,845, and it is based on the  First

Report  of  the  Select Committee  on  the  Assembly

Staff.  I  hope  that  this will  be  considered  an

uncontroversial  measure  since  it   concerns   the

service of this House as a whole, and is not a party

matter at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, the proposal is to increase the staff of

this   Assembly  by  one  Assistant  Reporter,   one

stenographer,  one General Clerical  Service  clerk,

two  typists  and one office boy with, to  make  for

good  measure,  a couple of typewriters  that  these

people can work on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you will see, Sir, from the Report of the

Select  Committee, which was tabled  as  Legislative

Assembly Paper No. 16, the present Assembly has been

served up to now by a staff in some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



respects   less   in  strength   than   the   former

Legislative  Council. There can be no question  that

the  business  of  this House has increased  and  is

going to increase still further, and I hope it  will

be agreed that these modest increases are thoroughly

necessary. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the increase is because the

Government proposes to put up the number  of  Senior

Auditors from one to two. In the Estimates for 1955,

on  page  34,  there was provision  for  one  Senior

Auditor and two Auditors. Now it is sought to create

two  Senior Auditors and two Auditors. Mr Chairman,

Sir, if one looks at the 1955 Establishment List, on

page  16, one finds these posts, which were  allowed

in  1954,  set out as follows: Upper timescale,  one

appointment,   Senior   Auditor;   timescale,    two

appointments,  two  Auditors,  one  filled   by   an

expatriate, the other vacant. In other words,  there

is  one Senior Auditor, the appointment being filled

by an expatriate; two timescale posts, one filled by

an expatriate, the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



vacant.  The  scale below that is a Div.  II  scale,

filled  by  a  local  man, who is  Senior  Assistant

Auditor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the Financial Secretary himself sent

out  a circular recently to all heads of departments

in  which he set out the view of the Government that

there   should  be  an  absolute  economy   in   new

appointments.  The  Financial  Secretary,   in   his

circular of the 2nd of December, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heads of departments are requested to re-examine

their  draft estimates in order to determine whether

Estimates of Revenue cannot safely be increased  and

Estimates  of Expenditure substantially reduced.  In

this connection it is appreciated that Estimates  of

Expenditure  have been prepared with  the  need  for

economy  clearly  in  view  and  have  already  been

scrutinised in the Treasury. On the other  hand,  it

would be appreciated that the position, as disclosed

by   the  Draft  Estimates,  gives  cause  for  much

concern. The co-operation of heads of departments in

an  effort  to  close  the  gap  is  most  earnestly

sought."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, in a special reference to Personal Emoluments, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heads of departments are requested to examine

all  proposals for new appointments with a  view  to

determining whether they are, in fact, essential for

the   efficient   discharge  of  the   business   of

Government  in  1956, and to withdraw any  proposals

which  do  not strictly conform to this requirement.

Again  the  provision entered against  any  post  or

category of posts should be examined with great care

in  order  to  determine whether  the  total  amount

entered will, in fact, be spent..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we have here an attempt to

boost  up the number of Senior Auditors from one  to

two  and to maintain the number of Auditors  at  two

with no proportionate increase in the staff they are

supposed   to   supervise.  There  is  no   increase

anywhere.  It  is not shown in these Estimates.  The

natural  result of the creation of one more post  of

Senior  Auditor means that the expatriate holder  of

the post of Auditor will go up automatically because

he is the next person awaiting promotion. Then there

will  be two vacancies in auditorship which  may  be

filled by local men or may be filled by expatriates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commonly known in the Civil Service amongst

local  officers that this is a game  of  snakes  and

ladders. One boosts up a post there and pushes an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



expatriate  up there. Then one brings  in  a  local

officer here. That is Malayanisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not the slightest need for creating one

more post of Senior Auditor. There is no increase in

the work to be done by Senior Auditors, and the only

justification advanced by the Financial Secretary is

that  it  will really not cost us very much  because

the  extra money will be made up by external  audit,

since  this man will be going round auditing Harbour

Board   accounts   and  all  other   semi-government

accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition feels very strongly that this

question must be considered not only in the light of

the  policy  of  the Chief Minister  to  reduce  all

increases in emoluments to the minimum, but also  in

the   light  of  the  sabotage  of  the  policy   of

Malayanisation to which the Government is committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, the Audit

Department  is  perhaps one of  the  most  important

departments of Government. In so far as  it  fulfils

the  same function for the Government as a  firm  of

private accountants fulfils for companies registered

under  the  Companies Act, it  is  the  watchdog  of

Government expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as the expenditure of Government has

increased  over the years - Members of the  Opposition

have  drawn attention to it - so has the need for  the

Audit Department to expand. Again, the activities of

Government departments have also increased: so  have

the  activities  of  the City Council,  the  Harbour

Board,  and  the Singapore Improvement Trust  (whose

books  are also audited by the Department of  Audit)

increased;  and in future, of course, we  will  have

the  task  of  auditing  the books  of  the  Central

Provident Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the increase in Government expenditure alone

over  the past five years, hon. Members can  see  to

what  extent  the work of the Audit  Department  has

increased.  During  that period  the  books  of  the

various  departments  have  increased  in  size  and

number. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



work  of  outside  audit has increased.  The  junior

staff  has  been increased, but the senior directing

staff  has not increased, with the result that  now,

in  the Audit Department, there is not the necessary

degree of supervision and control of audit which  is

required  if  a  job is to be done efficiently.  The

amount  of  supervision which  must  necessarily  be

given by qualified and experienced officers has been

lacking. Senior officers have not been able to  give

the   necessary  amount  of  time  to  train  junior

officers,  nor have they been able to give  time  to

considering  how  their methods of audit  should  be

changed or modified or amended in the light  of  new

accounting  methods which have been introduced,  not

only  in Government but in those other bodies  whose

accounts  we audit. For example, in the Central  Pay

Office  we  have  introduced mechanical  accounting;

similarly in the other bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $555,260 for Head 10 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the House will recall that, at the time when the

Chief  Minister was considering how much he could safely

take  as  his  own personal emolument, we  the  People's

Action Party exhorted him, in fact, invited him and  his

Ministers to take a realistic view of the matter and not

to  play to the gallery, or to fear the ungenerosity  of

the Opposition. The Chief Minister on that occasion,  in

an outburst of humility in considering what is right and

proper for the Ministers and the Chief Minister of  this

territory,  strenuously put forward  his  new  Socialist

point  of  view that Ministers should live a  life  less

exalted than their previous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



colonial administrators who had, in his opinion, set

a completely false standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I make any comment on the sum of

$10,000,  I  want  to  make it clear  to  the  Chief

Minister that we do not, in the least, question  his

integrity on how the $10,000 will be spent. What  we

do  question is this hypocrisy in saying "We do  not

want to take $5,000. We will only take $3,500 - "



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. The word "hypocrisy"

has been ruled out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I apologise

for the use of that word, but that word stares us in

the face so often in the 200 odd pages of the Budget

Estimates.  I  intend  to  indicate  to  the   Chief

Minister that it is much more reasonable to say,  "I

am  drawing  a  salary of $5,000 a month  and  I  am

living up to that standard." To break it up -  and  I

do  not  blame  the Chief Minister and  his  elected

Ministers   for  this - is  to  follow  the   colonial

tradition. They have been accustomed to come  before

this  House  and, on being asked, "How much  is  the

Chief Secretary being paid?", would reply, "Turn  it

up and see what it is." To find out whether it is  a

reasonable  and modest sum for a man in his  exalted

position of life, one has to turn up and find  these

items  spread  over  many pages - "Expatriation  pay";

"upkeep  of  house"; "upkeep of garden";  "transport

expenses"; etc. And our elected Ministers are  being

made, perhaps unwillingly, perhaps unconsciously, to

fit into the scheme of things. Already they are down

for  a  very  modest $150 as transport expenses  and

down  for  entertainment expenses  of  one  sort  or

another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Prime Minister of Great Britain had

difficulty over his own personal emolument, he  went

before the House and put matters fairly and squarely

before  it. There was a debate on it; the thing  was

properly  thrashed out - how the Prime Minister  of  a

large Empire conducts himself - rebates were made  and

concessions given. We have now a matter that  should

have been raised at the time when the Ministers came

forward  before this House for their salaries.  They

should not, after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



having  got  their salary, decide  that  it  is  not

enough  after  all, and then sneak in  entertainment

expenses  ranging from $10,000 to $2,000; and  sneak

in  transport  expenses. Sir, the next Budget  might

well show that some further unforeseen stresses  and

strains  on the modest emoluments of Ministers  have

made themselves felt, and further additions may well

be  attempted in this manner. Our criticism is  that

the  Chief Minister did not come forward frankly and

fairly  and  say  that  he, as  Chief  Minister,  is

getting a sum of $3,500 a month, $500 as a Member of

the   Assembly,  tax  free,  $10,000  a   year   for

entertainment expenses, $150 for his transport,  and

so on. He should not come to the House for a vote to

increase,  piecemeal, the number of  perquisites  of

his office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  rise  to support this amendment, although it  has

also been put in by me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add just one or two points to what

has  been  said. We do not say that Chief  Ministers

must not entertain. We do understand that there must

be  a certain amount of entertainment, but we must

always remember that whenever a Budget is presented,

especially this Budget when you say that the deficit

is  real, then there must be some economy.  Now,  if

there  are  going to be economies, we will  have  to

refer  back to previous years to find out  how  such

expenditures came in. Previously I believe the Chief

Secretary was carrying on all such work - all the work

of  the  Ministries rolled into one - and we  do  find

that  expenditure in that direction was not as  much

as  it  is  estimated today. Now that it  is  spread

among  many Ministries, I think the expenditure  for

each Minister should not be much more than what  was

previously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that catches our attention is that

in  the  past  few  months we have witnessed  a  few

functions  which  cost Government  to  the  tune  of

$4,000  in  one  case.  Now, if  functions  of  this

nature,  thrown open, shall we say, to Mr. and  Mrs.

Singapore, should be conducted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



on  such a large scale, we could ask, "Where will  it

stop?"  Inviting 50 people per elected representative

was  the  number asked for by the Chief Minister.  He

could  easily  have  asked for even  more,  and  then

expenditure would probably rise further.  I  consider

it  lavish  from all points of view and,  because  of

that, we do propose a cut.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> If it

please  you, Sir, I am so happy to see an example  so

blatant  of the intellectual integrity of the P.A.P.,

as  indicated in today's debate. This House, Sir, has

not  so short a memory that it forgets that on Monday

morning  the  leader  of the  P.A.P.,  the  hon. and

learned  Member for Tanjong Pagar, in castigating  me

for  a sterile speech, blamed me for taking seriously

the  petty objection of petty politicians in  respect

of  the entertainment allowance. What was "the  petty

objection  of petty politicians" is the objection  of

the P.A.P. today, and that is the position we are at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has, Sir, suggested that this entertainment

allowance should be part of our salary. That  is,  in

fact,  what was suggested officially, and in fairness

to  the  officials  there was no  question  of  their

putting it in this fashion. It was the desire of  the

elected   Ministers  who  wanted  no  part   of   the

entertainment  allowance as  part  of  their  salary,

because  when you have an entertainment allowance  as

part of your salary - as is the case, Sir, with respect

to  the President of the City Council there is always

a  charge that you under-spend and that you profit by

that  allowance. I did not think it was fair,  either

to  us  or to the public, that we should have a fixed

entertainment allowance as part of our  salary  which

we  could  not  be certain of spending  precisely.  I

thought  it was only fair to this Assembly that  this

allowance  should  not only be entirely  outside  our

salary,  but that this Assembly, through its  Finance

Committee, should have the right to examine in detail

our  expenditure and to challenge it.  The  Financial

Secretary, as the watchdog of our Treasury,  Sir,  on

one  occasion did, I think, challenge the $10  for  a

basket of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



orchids  which  I  sent  to the  wife  of  the  Prime

Minister of Pakistan! He is entitled to do that and I

do  not  complain. It may well be beneath my dignity,

Sir, and  it  may  well be beneath  the  dignity  of

Ministers to submit themselves to this procedure. You

yourself, Sir, I think, have pointed this out  in  so

far  as your Office is concerned, when it came  to  a

question of allocating $4,800 entertainment allowance

for  the  Speaker.  But the Chief  Minister  and  his

elected colleagues are in a different position.  They

are  subject to the malice and the abuse of political

manoeuvres   and  they  can  be  and  are  constantly

misrepresented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as is possible, Sir, we not only want to be

honest, but we want to be patently honest so that our

conduct  would be under the constant supervision  not

only   of  this  Assembly  but  also  of  its  Select

Committee.  There was no question of any sneaking  of

expenses. I know, Sir, that there are some people  so

evil  that  it  is difficult for them to  think  that

others  can be honest. There is a proverb which  says

honi  soit qui mal y pense. There are some so steeped

in  deception that they are quite incapable  even  of

understanding honesty. It is natural. It is the  very

breath  of  their  lives. But  I  would  remind  hon.

Members  that at each and every one of my  functions,

they were invited, most of them, and that in each and

every  case this Assembly, prior to this Budget,  has

been asked for its approval. There has never been any

question  of trying to sneak in extra money  for  the

Ministers. It has been suggested, Sir, that there  is

hypocrisy  on our part, and humility, false humility,

in  seeking  a  low  salary. You have  attended  many

functions,  Sir, and with respect to those  who  gave

them  and to those functions which I gave, more often

than not they are a dreadful bore, and I do not think

that any person can really suggest that it is a great

perquisite  to  be  able  to  give  or  attend  these

functions and that they are to be considered as  part

of a man's emoluments, particularly when he does not

touch the money at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have tried, with all my heart, to bring a

new   concept  of  expenditure  into  the  Government

service. It is no easy thing to change a tradition of

many  decades that is deeply imbued and that is  part

of  the  very way they live. The idea of  having  the

modest salaries we sought was to give an example, but

however  humble we may be in seeking to live our  own

individual lives and the charge which we wish to make

upon  the  public finance for our own  existence,  we

must,  when  considering our duties in giving  public

functions, also consider the dignity of Singapore  as

a  country. Our receptions to our foreign guests must

be  compatible with the dignity of Singapore  and  in

this   connection  the  Member  for  Serangoon,   who

complains  when 4,000 people attended a function  for

Malcolm  MacDonald  at a cost of  $4,400,  does  not,

through  his own Party in the City Council,  complain

when  $8,700 was spent for the the same occasion  for

the same man - more than twice. That is the logic, Sir,

of  the Progressive Party. Now we know to what depths

political  manoeuvres  and  political  jealousy   can

descend.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I want to speak on this

subject, and I have got many other subjects to  speak

on.  It is rather surprising that so much should have

been  spent by the Chief Minister and other Ministers

on entertainment, transport and what not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have since the post-war period been in the

B.M.A. Council, the Advisory Council, the Legislative

Council  and  the Legislative Assembly. I  have  seen

functions and functions. They were held by  the  head

of   this  State  at  that  time - His  Excellency  the

Governor.  He  is still doing that  now.  We  do  not

grudge  a  reasonable amount to be paid to the  Chief

Minister  for his entertainment, but since  the  last

six   or  seven  months  we  have  had  nothing   but

entertainment  parties  and  dinners,  and  at  whose

expense?  We, the taxpayers' expense. Why should  the

Government  spend so much money? After all,  what  is

Singapore?  It  is a small city compared  with  other

countries of the world. It is at the crossroads. Many

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



pass through it, foreign guests pass through it,  but

it  does  not mean that each and every one should  be

entertained at our cost and at that exorbitant rate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I was getting

alarmed  when  the  Member  for  Telok  Ayer  started

speaking  on the subject. One should always  remember

that, after all, this is not an attack on the way  in

which  a particular Chief Minister chooses to conduct

his  office, but more an attack, in the  case  of  my

Party, on the form in which this item of $10,000  has

been brought forward. It has never been suggested  by

us  that $10,000 is too much. It is our view that the

Chief   Minister  of  Singapore  should,   as   Chief

Minister, live and act like one. After all,  even  in

the  most  puritan of Communist countries,  when  the

Foreign  Minister  of the Chinese  People's  Republic

goes  to  Geneva and throws a reception, it  is - I  am

told  by  those who have attended such a  reception - a

most   sumptuous  occasion,  as  befits  the  Foreign

Minister of a great Republic. And as befits the Chief

Minister of Singapore, a great island, all man-made - [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it depresses me to see the Chief Minister

feeling  somewhat  unnerved by the  thought  that  he

should,   in  fact,  deport  himself  as  the   Chief

Minister. The point he sought to make is that we said

on Monday that this was a trivial matter, yet we come

today to debate this as a matter of great importance.

On  Monday we said it was trivial. Today we say it is

trivial. The only question we have raised is the form

in which it was brought forward. What we do challenge

is the fact that, whilst on the one hand he had said,

"We are going to be modest in our living" - and we were

led  to assume that that included both their personal

and  their  official lives - on the  other  hand,  long

before  Budget Day we were presented with  dribs  and

drabs of entertainment expenditure, everyone of  them

for   a   special  occasion.  The  Rt.  Hon.  Malcolm

MacDonald going away - the greatest man that ever lived

in  Malaya;  Sir John Nicoll going away - the  greatest

Governor that ever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



came  here.  Our whole lives get wrapped  around  the

comings  and goings of great people from the Colonial

Office.  I do not know what to make of all  this.  No

doubt  more great people will come and go. But, after

all,  Chief  Ministers  stay  on  forever,  and  they

should,  in  my  view, be given every opportunity  to

represent the people in a proper way and to act in  a

manner befitting the dignity of that office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> There are one or two points I should like

to  mention,  Sir. There has always  been  a  central

entertainment  vote  which is under  my  control  and

which is augmented from time to time as the needs  of

the  entertainment  of Government have  demanded  it.

What  has  happened now is that that  vote  has  been

split  up  amongst the Chief Minister and  the  other

Ministers. It is not personal entertainment votes but

purely departmental votes for entertainment that have

been  created. The expenditure from these votes  will

have to be accounted for in the same way as any other

votes  of Government - telephones, telegrams - any  other

vote  that  you can think of. It will be  subject  to

audit,  and  it  will  be  subject  to  the  detailed

examination,  I  presume,  of  the  Public   Accounts

Department.  I  merely  want  to  make   that   quite

clear - that  these are not personal  votes,  they  are

merely   Government  departmental  votes  which   are

subject  to all the control that any vote is  subject

to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I

am  very  sorry  indeed  that this  question  of  the

Ministers'  expenses has descended into such  abusive

arguments and I am afraid that the Chief Minister  is

partially  to  be blamed because he  started  with  a

torrent of abuse at the first Monday sitting. He  has

been  accusing  the  Progressive Party  for  all  the

entertainment  expenditure  incurred  by   the   City

Council,  and  today he asks why we should  challenge

the  expenditure of $4,000 when the City  Council  on

the  same  sort  of entertainment spent  double  that

amount.  Has  he ever considered that the Progressive

Party  have only seven Councillors out of a total  of

27? How can he say that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



City  Council is a Progressive Council? In  the  same

way  the Progressive Party had been abused throughout

the  elections because we had a few more  Members  in

the  Legislative Council than other Parties. All  the

Government's faults had been heaped upon us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that has been forgotten is that this

expenditure on public functions was sanctioned by the

full  meeting of the City Council, whereas  in  these

particular cases they were done on the responsibility

of  the Minister or the Council of Ministers.  We  on

this  side  of the House surely are entitled  to  ask

questions on every item in this Budget without  being

abused?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You have got to take a risk!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> To my mind that is the very

function  of this Budget sitting for which one  whole

week  has been allocated, and if we do not understand

the  items as they are presented to us, surely we are

entitled  to raise questions and have them  discussed

in  a  calm manner, whether they should be left as  a

full   sum  or  they  should  be  reduced,   and   if

satisfactory replies are given, we would withdraw our

amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Miracle, miracle!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I am getting tired of these

interruptions and abuses in this Assembly and that is

one of the reasons why I am now working for a change. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. Let us stick to the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I am not used to being

interrupted  and I find it very hard to  continue  my

train of thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that this Budget has been prepared

in  the  old  way and in the old days it used  to  be

passed,  I  understand, in a few hours. I  was  never

present  then and I do not really know what happened;

but  here, as elected representatives of the  people,

we owe them a duty to look through every item



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



in  the Budget and we would welcome more explanations

in the Remarks column.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member speaking on

entertainment expenses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Well, I have been absolutely

misled  by all these interruptions! I think  we  have

made  a  very proper amendment for a full  discussion

and  I  now ask this Assembly to have all these items

discussed in a friendly way.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I am afraid the

Members  who  have supported the amendment  have  not

been  able  to make out a case. The first point  that

comes  to my mind is this: some of the speakers  have

expressed the view that they would like the amount to

be  reduced, whilst other Members have expressed  the

view  that they do not mind about the amount  put  in

the  Estimate, but they differ on the manner in which

this  has  appeared in the Budget and the  timing  of

this  attempt  to seek the approval of the  Assembly.

May  I  say  this, Sir? Although I am  still  in  the

Opposition,  I feel the Opposition should  contribute

to a very healthy debate. What we have heard just now

has become a very unhealthy debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that an entertainment allowance for anyone

in  the  Assembly,  whether he is a  Minister  or  an

Assemblyman,  should  not be  added  to  his  salary,

because  his salary is paid as a result of  the  work

that  he does. The entertainment allowance, which  is

not  always static, should be quite separate from the

salary. On these grounds, therefore, I feel that this

item  of  entertainment allowance  appearing  in  the

Estimates is very fair indeed. This happens not  only

in Singapore but throughout the whole world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago the Indian National Congress decided

that their Ministers should accept only Rupees 500 as

salary. Well, had they no entertainment allowance  at

all?  They had. Did they make an attempt to  add  the

entertainment allowance to their salary and then say.

"We are only receiving so much and,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



well,  we  will be able to please the public."?  They

never did that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel, Sir, that we must respect the honest

attitude of the Government in a situation like  this.

They have come here in an honest way saying that they

do  not  like to receive more salary. They  have  now

come  here with the suggestion that they should  have

some  entertainment allowance. To my  mind,  Sir,  it

would  appear to be very fair. I trust the Opposition

will not degenerate in this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. The time has elapsed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> But I have only just started!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I cannot help that. The time allotted

for Head 11 was 30 minutes. It has elapsed, and under

Standing Order 69 (4), it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There shall be allotted a maximum of five days for

discussion  of  the Estimates and  the  Bill  in  the

Committee  of Supply. The Speaker or in  his  absence

the  Deputy Speaker shall allot the time to be  given

for  each head of expenditure in the schedules to the

Bill  and for the clauses of the Bill. If in the case

of any head or clause the end of the allotted time is

reached before the head or clause is disposed of, the

Chairman  shall put forthwith any questions necessary

to dispose of that head or clause."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, will you

permit me to move a suspension of the Standing  Order

to enable the hon. Member to speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, I do not think it is a proper

thing  to  do in these matters. I did try to indicate

to  hon. Members that they should keep their  eye  on

the  clock  and  have  some consideration  for  other

Members who may want to speak on the same item, but I

cannot  control any hon. Members who take up all  the

allotted  time.  I am bound by Standing  Orders,  and

until  they  are  amended,  I  have  to  apply   them

strictly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $184,120 for Head 11 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 12 -



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Chairman, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $2,400 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (32), Entertainment Allowance,

on page 49 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Point of order, Sir. Mr Chairman,

Sir, I feel it right that I should take this  point

of  order  now. My reference to the point  of  order

arises  out of the provisions of Standing  Order  33

(1)  (b)  which was referred to earlier this morning

and  which, of course, reproduces substantially  the

provisions  of  Section  60  (3)  of  the  Order  in

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should preface the point which I am

making,  Sir,  by enquiring whether the  consent  or

recommendation of the Governor has been obtained  in

respect  of  this  motion.  I  say  "enquire",  Sir,

because  it  relates  to an entertainment  allowance

which  is paid to the Chief Secretary. It is not  in

the  nature of an expense account and is part of the

allowances   paid  to  him.  My  point   of   order,

therefore,  arises, Sir, out of  the  provisions  of

Standing Order 33 (1) (b).



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your point being, Mr Butterfield,

that  these entertainment allowances come under  the

meaning  of  "allowances" in Standing Order  33  (1) (b)?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> It is within the description of

"allowances" in that Standing Order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This, I think, hon. Members, is an

instance where perhaps an Estimates Committee  would

have  been  very  useful because  in  the  Estimates

itself   it   is   not  quite  clear   whether   the

entertainment  allowance is paid to the  officer  as

part of his allowances or emoluments. Under Standing

Order  33  (1), the Assembly cannot proceed  with  a

motion  of  this nature - and in my opinion  it  is  a

motion    of   this   nature -  except   with    the

recommendation or consent of the Governor  signified

thereto.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



Therefore, unless the Member for Tiong Bahru has the

recommendation or consent of the Governor signified,

the motion cannot be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you rising on a point of order,

Mr Lee Kuan Yew?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on a point of

order, is it submitted that wherever and whenever in

these   Estimates  any  subject  pertaining  to   an

existing emolument or allowance of a public  officer

is concerned, all debate is barred?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Except with the recommendation -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Except with the recommendation

of the Governor. If that were so, Mr Chairman, Sir,

there would be no purpose in having this debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I did indicate to hon. Members that

Standing Order 33 (1) (b) is a repetition of Section

60 (3) of the Order in Council, and I am just taking

a common sense interpretation of that Standing Order

which I think I had better read again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except with the recommendation or consent of the

Governor  signified thereto, the Assembly shall  not

proceed... upon any bill or motion, which, in the

opinion  of  the  Speaker or  the  Attorney-General,

would   affect   any  alteration  in   the   salary,

allowances  or conditions of service... of  any

public officer..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My duty is merely to interpret it, and if I am

shown  that my interpretation is wrong, I shall,  of

course,  allow a debate, but at the moment it  seems

to  me  that  this  motion, in  fact,  offends  that

Standing Order and the Order in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order, Mr Thomas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Point of order, Sir. As I read this,

Mr Chairman, I take it to mean a particular officer

whom  you  can  pin-point and say  "this  particular

man";  and not a class of officers such as executive

engineers or order clerks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Oh, yes. That is quite clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee Choon Eng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of order, Sir. We

have  just  allowed  Head  10  this  morning  to  be

debated,  and I am very surprised that you now  give

another  ruling  on the question of  allowances.  On

Head 10, Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew)  raised the question of  salary  for  the

Auditors  and this also comes within the  provisions

of Standing Order 33 (1) (b).



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid the hon. Member has not

quite  understood the position. When we  dealt  with

Head  10, that was in respect of an amendment  to  a

post that was proposed to be created. In fact, there

was  an increase of one post; in other words,  there

was no individual appointed to that post. Therefore,

the  point  really  was that  the  approval  of  the

Assembly  should  be obtained for  the  post  to  be

created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular case, we have a public officer

within  the  meaning of Standing Order  33  (1)  (b)

whose  salary, allowances or conditions  of  service

are  being attacked. There is a distinction and that

distinction must be borne in mind where there is, in

fact,  a  public  officer who is drawing  a  certain

salary, with  certain perquisites attached  to  his

office.  I am therefore quite powerless because  the

Standing  Order  says you cannot  proceed  with  the

motion, and so does the Order in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Nair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Point of order, Sir. If His Excellency

the  Governor's approval is required, it should have

been  indicated  somewhere in  the  motion.  In  the

absence  of  that, cannot the hon. Member  seek  the

approval  of the Governor? I suggest, Sir, that  the

sitting be suspended and the hon. Member be given an

opportunity  to consult the Governor  and  seek  his

approval.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Excellent! Excellent!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Save the colonial constitution!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> This is the Rendel

Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. On that point also,

of course, Mr Nair, Standing Order 33 (2) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compliance with paragraph (1) of this Order - "



<br><br>that  is,  the  recommendation  or  consent  of  the

Governor must be signified thereto -



<br><br>"shall  be  signified to the Assembly by a  Minister

and shall be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings."



<br><br>But,  of  course,  that does not  prevent  any  hon.

Member   from  approaching  the  Governor  and   the

Governor then contacting a Minister and the Minister

signifying  to  the  Assembly his recommendation  or

consent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised, however, I must always assume

that  hon. Members know their Standing Orders. I  do

not  know  whether the Member for  Tiong  Bahru  did

consider Standing Order 33 (1) (b) when he filed his

amendment, and it is only when a point of order  was

raised  that  I intervened; but if the  hon.  Member

had,  in fact, considered that Standing Order,  then

perhaps he will let us know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would

like  to  suggest for your consideration  that  hon.

although they are assumed to know the regulations, I

for  one  must  confess that I was not conscious  of

this  at the time it was discussed and our attention

was  not  specifically drawn to it - I am  quite  sure

inadvertently - so, in the circumstances, Sir,  may  I

move - [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you please keep quiet?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please, order. Yes, Mr Chief

Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In the circumstances, Sir, I do

move that we adjourn till 2.30 p.m, in order to give

hon.  Members an opportunity to contact the Governor

so that we could have a proper debate and continue

as scheduled.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we cannot adjourn until

after  12  noon,  so  I think the  best  way  is  to

postpone  consideration of this item until after  12

o'clock and then the sitting can be suspended  until

<br><br>2.30 p.m. Mr John Ede.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in respect

of  sub-head 1 (57), Hotel Allowance, on page 50  of

the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point in moving the amendment is to draw

attention   to   the  fact  that  this   item - "Hotel

Allowance" - remains unaltered from 1955 at $300,000.

It  is well known that large sums of money have been

spent   during   the  course   of   this   year   on

accommodation for Government officers, and a further

sum - in  my opinion, rather too large a sum - has  been

allocated for further building in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the whole point of building flats and houses

for  Government officers is to reduce year by  year,

so   I  understand  it,  and  finally  abolish  this

unproductive allocation of hotel allowances. I would

add  further that this is not the one and only  item

of  its kind in the Estimates, but it repeats itself

under  various  heads, in some  instances  the  1956

allocation showing an increase over that  for  1955.

Sir,  I submit that this item - hotel allowance - should

be  going  down  and it is not going  down,  and  we

should  like  to  know whether there  are  good  and

adequate reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> The answer to the question posed by

the Member for Tanglin, Mr Chairman, is simple. The

expenditure  on these admittedly unproductive  hotel

allowances,  which are paid in general  to  overseas

officers  for living the sort of life  they  do  not

like to live in hotels when they could be living  in

houses with their families, has decreased from 1953,

when it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



$593,000,  to  1954, when it was $331,000,  and  the

estimated  expenditure this year is $300,000,  which

is  the  amount entered in the Estimates  for  1956.

With  the increased number of houses, there will  be

less occasion to pay these hotel allowances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Chief Secretary inform

us  how many civil servants between them spend  this

estimated  $300,000?  I  am  sorry  that  the  Chief

Secretary  did  not see the point on  which  I  seek

information.  I  wanted to know, Mr Chairman,  Sir,

how  many  people there will be altogether to  spend

this $300,000?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> The number in the last record that I

have shows that 232 officers with their families did

it in 1954.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Further information arising out

of  that - how many of the 232 are expatriates and how

many are local?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> I should think the great majority are

expatriates. There may have been some local officers

returning from training and scholarship courses  and

they have had to be accommodated in hotels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make this point in fairness - that

these  hotel allowances are not paid for  very  long

periods.  They  are,  of  course,  only  paid  until

accommodation becomes vacant and as more houses  are

available, the period that these officers  spend  in

hotels decreases.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Can my hon. Friend indicate whether there

is  likely to be a decrease in the amount  spent  in

1956?  He has indicated that it is going down,  but,

nevertheless, the amount allocated for 1956  remains

the same in the Estimates as for 1955. May I have an

assurance  that  there is likely to  be  a  decrease

which  one  would  assume with the increase  in  the

number   of   houses  being  built  for   Government

officers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> It was felt prudent to put the

estimated  amount  required at $300,000.  When  that

estimate  was prepared, of course, the amount  spent

this year was not known. We now think it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



will  be  about $300,000. It was felt reasonable  to

put  that  amount in the 1956 Estimates. We  do,  of

course,  hope  that less than that  amount  will  be

spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the only new quarters for officers that are

going  to  come  into service next year  is  another

block  at Leonie Hill flats, and provided that comes

into service at a reasonably early time, this should

assist in alleviating this admittedly unsatisfactory

hotel allowance system which nobody likes.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, with the assurance given by my hon.

Friend, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Have I the assent of the Assembly

that this amendment be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> My attention has been drawn to

another  Standing Order on which I could act,  since

it  is  now  past half-past eleven. It  is  Standing Order 7 (5):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any sitting may be suspended at any time by the

Speaker for a period not exceeding three hours",



<br><br>so  that I could suspend the sitting now until  2.30

p.m, to  enable hon. Members to consider the  point

raised just before the last amendment was moved. Has

the  Attorney-General traced any  other  item  which

perhaps  would  be  met  with  the  same  objection?

[Interruption.] Hon. Members must realise that  this

is a matter beyond their control, beyond my control,

and beyond everybody else's control unless and until

the  constitution  is changed. The constitution  has

its  limitations,  and however unpalatable  to  hon.

Members that constitution might be, I am here not to

act  ultra vires, and I do not think it will be fair

for  hon.  Members to act ultra vires. That  is  the

position we are faced with and we are now trying  to

get  round  something which perhaps could easily  be

got round in the proper way.

like me to indicate what those are?

<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> The next one, Sir, is under Head

19.  It  is  a motion, I think, in the name  of  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) - Head 19,

sub-head  1  (5) and sub-head 1 (6), Superintendents

of  Police and Deputy Superintendents. With respect,

Sir,  it would appear, on the face of it, that  that

motion comes within the provisions of Section 60 (4)

of the Singapore Colony Order in Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that the same as Standing Order

33(1) (c)?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> I think that is so, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Because I think hon. Members have

got their Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> May I pass on, Sir, to the other

matters?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Perhaps I could refer to them all

together because substantially the same point arises

from each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 32, sub-head 1 (3); Head 48, sub-head 1 (3);

Head 60, sub-head 1 (3) - I think that is a motion  in

the  name  of  the Member for Tanjong Pagar - and  the

objection,  as I understand it, would be in  respect

of  only one of those posts. I will come to what the

matter is in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



moment.  Head 61, sub-head 1 (33) and Head 63,  sub-head 1 (3).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with respect to those, Sir, it would appear,

by reference to Command Papers Nos. 1 and 5 of 1955,

that  the provisions of Standing Order 31 (3)  would

apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, it would appear that, having

regard  to  the  fact that those matters  have  been

before the Assembly on the occasion when the Command

Papers  in question were dealt with, Standing  Order

33  (1)  would apply. I hope, Sir, that I have  said

enough  to give both you, Sir, and the Assembly  the

assistance which is now required.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are, in fact, two points, I

think,  which have been raised. One is an  objection

under Standing Order 31 (3) which, of course, is  an

objection which when taken at the proper time  could

be met easily. The other, which has a real obstacle,

is  under  Standing  Order 33  (1),  and  the  items

referred  to,  for the benefit of hon.  Members  who

have  not  heard  Mr Butterfield enunciating  them,

are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 19: Police - there are two amendments by

Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 32 - the first amendment under that head

is in the name of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 48 - the amendment is in the name of Mr

Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 60 - the second amendment is in the name

of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 61 - the last amendment is in the name of

Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 63 - the amendment is in the name of Mr

Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we suspend until 2.30 p.m. in order

to get that point cleared.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.  Page  81, in the Order of the Day,  under  the

Head:  Treasury. May I have an indication  from  the

Attorney-General  if  the  Governor's   consent   is

necessary in respect of my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



motion to reduce by $5,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of Entertainment Expenses for the Financial

Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That has not been indicated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, is that item similar to

Head 12 on page 80 of the Order Paper, the motion in

the name of Mr William Tan?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The one on which the point of order

was raised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> To my mind, there is a distinction,

Mr   Lim  Choon  Mong.  Here  is  an  entertainment

allowance  which  is part of the  emoluments  of  an

officer. The other one referred to by the Member for

Queenstown is entertainment expenses, which  is,  in

fact,  a  fund on which an officer can draw to  meet

actual  expenses.  It  does not  form  part  of  his

emoluments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Another point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Not a point of order. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clarification, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Clarification of what I have

already  said.  I have inadvertently overlooked  two

other  matters in respect of which notice  has  been

given, two  matters which would  attract  the  same

points  of order. It is Head 61 - both motions  stand

in  the  name of the Member for Tanjong  Pagar.  The

first  motion - Public Works - sub-head 1  (2)  on  page

244.  The next one is sub-head 1 (18). Mr Chairman,

I  very  much regret having to address you again  on

this  subject.  I  am now instructed  that  the  two

matters to which I have referred a moment ago should

not  be referred to. They are not within any of  the

Standing Orders on which points of order might  have

arisen. These two motions stand in the name  of  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew).



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is Head 61. The first motion

stands in the name of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. The other

motion also stands in his name.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now propose to suspend the sitting until 2.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 12 -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will call the amendment by Mr

William Tan first, which is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $2,400 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (32), Entertainment Allowance,

on page 49 of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I was informed

by the Hon. the Chief Secretary that permission has

not been granted by His Excellency the Governor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Shame!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor's consent or recommendation not

having been signified, the amendment was not

proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in respect

of sub-head 8, Passages and Miscellaneous Travelling

Expenses, on page 53 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I was afraid that the Hon. the

Attorney-General  (Mr Butterfield)  might  consider

this   another  aspect  of  the  pay  of  expatriate

officers which is beyond the reach of this Assembly.

But  I think he will agree with me that, in the form

in  which  it has been lumped together - Passages  and

Miscellaneous   Travelling  Expenses - we   can   take

objection to it on perfectly constitutional grounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Butterfield:</b> Sir, I have no objection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, Mr Chairman, Sir, I

cannot understand what this enormous sum really

stands for. One can guess that "Passages" means

passages for expatriate officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



flying  to  and  fro  between  Singapore  and  their

homeland, but "Miscellaneous Travelling Expenses" is

somewhat of a mystery to the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1955 Estimates on page 137 under Head

28 - Miscellaneous  Services  there  was  a   sum   of

$1,135,000 approved for four sub-items:



<pre>

 (1) Accidents involving Government Vehicles     $5,000



(I do not know if that includes third party damages).



 (2) Commissions and Conferences                $40,000



 (3) Passages                                  $750,000



(Presumably for expatriates).



 (4) Miscellaneous Travelling Expenses         $340,000

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is astonishing is that we are being asked to

vote  this  enormous sum, about $500,000  more  than

what  was  voted  last  year, as  a  complete  blank

cheque. No one has any control over how this sum  is

to  be  spent.  One would imagine  that  if  anybody

wanted  to  go to conferences in Lagos, or Barbados,

or  Canberra, or Quebec, he could, if he were a good

friend  of  the  Government and the Hon. the  Chief

Secretary, get a sum allocated out of this  enormous

$1,600,000. We do not know what it is about. We have

no control over it and we are not going to vote it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I support the amendment. A

blank sum without any breakdown of the cost! How can

one know what it is for and how are we going to vote

for  it?  I  would like to know, Sir, for  how  many

persons  this  sum is provided? How many  wives  are

included in that sum?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And children!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> And how many children? Out of

this number, how many are Europeans and how many are

non-Europeans?  There is no breakdown  to  guide  us

there.  This  sum  of $1,600,000  on  "Passages  and

Miscellaneous Travelling Expenses", Sir, I think  is

mostly  for  the expatriates. It is high  time  that

those  who  can  go be replaced with local  men.  We

ought to give them abolition terms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> I think it was the learned Member for

Tanjong  Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) who  enquired  how

many  officers were involved in this riot of festive

travel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, the Member for Telok Ayer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> I am sorry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was interested in the hotels!



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> Possibly I can reply to the Member for

Telok  Ayer. The answer is approximately 200 a year.

I  cannot  give him an exact figure at  present  but

that  is the approximate figure. I think it  is  not

very far wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the current year, $1,120,000 has been spent

on   passages  for  expatriate  officers  and  their

families  under the conditions of service  on  which

they  came to this country. $130,000 has been  spent

on  a  new  scheme which was introduced in  1954 - the

Annual Leave Scheme - whereby certain senior officers,

heads  and deputy heads of departments in  the  main

were  allowed  to  go  home  annually,  taking   air

passages  instead of the normal sea  passages.  That

was a scheme introduced in Government's interest  in

order  to keep key men in their posts without having

these  very  long leaves - six months and  more - during

which there was a lack of continuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Annual Leave Scheme, an officer does, in

fact, take less time but he takes it oftener and  he

flies.  So  he forfeits not only some of the  normal

leave  that  he would earn under the ordinary  leave

regulations  which, for an officer over  35,  is,  I

think, five days per month for each year served plus

a  voyage  leave either by sea or by air, but  under

the Annual Leave Scheme, he gets air passage and,  I

think,  six weeks' leave a year. So he loses out  on

the  total  amount of leave that he gets,  but  some

officers  prefer  to  take it that  way  and  it  is

certainly  very much in the interests of  Government

if  officers  do take it that way, although  it  may

become more expensive in that air passages are  more

expensive   if  they  are  taken  oftener.   Locally

domiciled  Division  I  officers  with  ten   years'

service are eligible to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



take leave abroad with free passages for themselves

and their wives once during their service. Very few

have availed themselves of this privilege during 1955 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Good for them!



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> - but the number will increase as more

locally domiciled officers are appointed to Division I.  $25,000  has  been spent on officers  travelling

overseas to attend conferences or courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may wish to know that the terms on which

overseas  officers  are  eligible  for  leave   are,

generally speaking, that young officers are eligible

after between three and four years' resident service

here.  Officers of over ten years' service  or  over

the  age  of 35 years are eligible for leave between

two and three years of resident service and normally

after  two and a half years. Officers with  over  20

years'  service or over 50 years of age are eligible

for  leave  after between two and  two  and  a  half

years.  The wives are, of course, eligible  to  take

leave with officers and children under ten years  in

the  case of Division I officers and under 16  years

in the case of Division II officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, could the

Hon. the  Chief Secretary give us an indication  of

what   proportion  of  basic  pay   would   be   the

allowances,  the  expatriation  pay  to   expatriate

officers,  and  leave passages  given  to  them?  An

expatriate  officer is listed in  the  Establishment

list  as, receiving a certain scale of pay. Then  we

get  these odd items in odd places of the Estimates:

he  gets  expatriation allowance, he gets leave,  he

gets passages to and fro. All these things must be a

considerable proportion of their basic pay, which is

the  same  as that of the local officer.  Could  the

Hon. the Financial Secretary or the Hon. the  Chief

Secretary  give us an estimate of what is the  total

amount  paid  to expatriate officers  as  basic  pay

compared to the total amount expended on  them  as

leave  passages,  expatriation  pay  and  all  other

special allowances -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. Does this arise on

aimed  at  "Passages  and  Miscellaneous  Travelling

Expenses". Would you enlarge on them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I put it in the form to

which  you  would take no objection,  Mr  Chairman,

privileges for expatriate officers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> I am afraid I do not quite follow the

question posed by the Member for Tanjong Pagar but I

would  say  this:  that  we  do  not  keep  separate

accounts of the pay, allowances and passages paid to

expatriate  officers and local  officers.  We  treat

them as a common service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in respect

of  sub-head 19, Diagnostic Survey Team, on page  54

of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sum in the Estimates of $65,820 against

this  item.  If  my memory serves  me  correctly,  I

believe, Sir, the Master Plan, which was to  be  the

achievement  of  this Team, was completed  nearly  a

year  ago  and is due to be published some  time  in

January  next year. I seek information whether  this

Team  is  to  be kept on. It seems to me that  their

work  is completed and I would like to know why they

should be kept if it is necessary to do so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> What is known, Sir, as a Diagnostic

Survey  Team  was  brought out to Singapore  by  the

Singapore Government, I think, early in 1952 to take

charge  of  the task of drawing up the Master  Plan.

The  conditions  under which they  were  brought  to

Singapore  were that Government would be responsible

for their pay, passages and leave salaries, and they

worked on that basis until the end of 1954. By  that

time,  the Master Plan was largely completed.  There

were certain other details



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



which  had to be completed at a later date  but  the

work  had  largely been done. By that time, however,

the  Singapore Improvement Trust had come to realise

that   they  would  require  the  services  of   the

Diagnostic Survey Team for an indefinite period.  It

was   therefore  decided  that  their  salaries  and

passages would then become the responsibility of the

Singapore Improvement Trust with effect from the 1st

of  January, 1955. There was, however, a  continuing

liability  on  Government to pay the leave  pay  and

passages  of the officers on the Team carried  prior

to  the  end of 1954, and the bulk of this provision

in the Estimates now is for an outstanding liability

up to the end of 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two other matters outstanding - the

question  of the cost of publication of  the  Master

Plan  and the cost of holding inquiries into matters

arising  out of the Master Plan. How these  expenses

will  be  apportioned, I cannot yet say. The  latest

suggestion  is  that Government will be  responsible

for the cost of publishing the Master Plan. That has

been  included in the Estimates. It may  however  be

necessary, as a result of further proposals, for the

Singapore Improvement Trust to bear the cost of  the

Master Plan, and for Government to bear the cost  of

publication  and the cost of holding inquiries  into

the Master Plan. The provision in the Estimates this

year is for the arrears of leave pay and passages of

the  officers on the Team up to the end of 1954  and

for the cost of publishing the Plan this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am

satisfied  with the information and I beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I suggested to the

Government   sometime  in  1954  that  the   Chinese

Secretariat  should be part of the Chief Secretary's

Office.  I  am wondering whether the Hon. the  Chief

Secretary is in a position to say whether any action

has been taken in regard to this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> The Chinese Secretariat is part of the

Chief Secretary's Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, at that time I suggested that this

Department  should no longer be called  the  Chinese

Secretariat because I pointed out that in April 1955

we would have a government elected by the people and

if  we  were  to  say that this Department  was  the

Chinese  Secretariat, then there would automatically

be some question as to whether we should not require

an  Indian  Secretariat and a Malay  Secretariat.  I

rather  think that the designation of the Department

should at least be removed and the Department called

a branch of the Chief Secretary's Office and not, as

at present, designated as the Chinese Secretariat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> The point raised by my hon. Friend has

a   considerable   amount  of  sympathy   from   the

Government.  We can see the logic of that  argument.

It is rather illogical to have a Chinese Secretariat

in  a  Colony that consists very largely of Chinese.

My  hon. Friend can rest assured that this point  is

very much in the mind of Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, since the

Member for Seletar sits on my side of the House,  it

may  be  assumed that we support him in this attempt

to  bamboozle the public. We believe it is better to

call  a  spade  a  spade.  If  it  is,  in  fact,  a

Secretariat  that  looks  especially  into   Chinese

affairs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



for  reasons  of good government or bad  government,

then   let   us  continue  to  call  it  a   Chinese

Secretariat and we will, know where we all stand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, if this is a veto, then I would say

that   this   is  the  beginning  of  racialism   in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That, Mr Chairman, Sir, is the

most  astonishing suggestion we have ever heard from

the lips of the Member for Seletar! If the Chinese

Secretariat was introduced at all, it was introduced

by  a  colonial government many years ago. The  fact

that he now proposes to call it by another name does

not make it cease to be what it always has been.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, although it is a fact that a good

amount  of  the  work  done in  this  Department  is

translation  of  Chinese into  English,  that  could

conveniently  be  taken over by a  department  which

would be attached to another Ministry, and not as  a

Chinese department specifically -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have three minutes to speak, Mr

Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, this vote

that  we are asked to pass is one which, as the Hon.

the  Attorney-General has been keen  to  remind  the

House,  lies  within  the  reserved  powers  of  the

Governor.  If  we  cannot challenge  any  particular

vote,   then  what  is  the  point  of  having   any

discussion on it?

to it?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. The Standing Order we

have  been referring to this morning does not  place

out  of  order any motion in connection with any  of

these  matters. The motion only becomes out of order

if  the Governor's recommendation or consent is  not

signified.  That  is all. The motion  itself  is  in

order  up  to  that point, but there is  nothing  to

prevent  hon. Members from criticising  any  of  the

items in the Defence Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Chairman,

Sir. Since we are allowed to say for a few minutes

what we think of the Defence services -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Only two minutes left, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Two minutes, Mr Chairman, Sir.

May  we  place on record our view that any realistic

appraisal of the defence position in Malaya has  got

to  be  viewed  in  the context of an  international

situation?  It  is absurd to think  in  terms  of  a

defence service for Malaya itself. But in so far  as

it  is  possible,  we  exhort  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister to influence the Governor in these matters,

either  by  threats of resignation or otherwise,  to

cut  down  as much as he possibly can any  of  these

items  which  cannot  possibly  contribute  to   the

welfare of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $3,043,960 for Head 21 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in the

Prisons  Service,  and incidentally  in  the  Police

Service  too,  there  is  a considerable  number  of

expatriate officers in both the first and the second

Divisions  of  the Service, and amongst  them,  they

share,  according to my computations of the  various

items,  half  a million dollars in expatriation  pay

per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Chairman, Sir, we have always been

reminded  in  the  past of the shortcomings  of  the

local population. One can only assume that the  view

of  the  Government is that the local people  cannot

even  look after their own people when they  are  in

gaol,   that  they  cannot  gaol  their  own  people

properly. It is my fervent hope that the  Hon. the

Chief Minister and his colleagues do not share  that

lack  of  confidence in themselves and their fellow-Malayans.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, even a hen

needs a few days to lay an egg. A woman needs a  few

months  to  give birth to a child. You do  not  give

birth  to a new state in seven months. Hon.  Members

opposite are fully conscious surely of the existence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



of a Malayanisation Commission in which most Parties

are  represented and which is doing, I hope, a  good

job.  I  think, Sir, that we are all looking forward

very  much  to  a  report from this Commission  and,

arising  from that report, I trust there will  be  a

complete  re-orientation of the  position  to  which

hon.  Members are taking repeated objection. I  have

sympathy naturally with the position as indicated by

hon.  Members  on the opposite side, but  they  must

appreciate,  Sir, that one cannot build  Rome  in  a

day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Far be it from me to be

facetious, Mr Chairman, Sir, but the Hon. the Chief

Minister  has indicated that a hen takes  a  certain

number  of days to lay an egg and one takes a number

of  months  to  do something else. But before  those

processes  produce any result, I am told by  medical

authorities that there must be an act of conception.

I  am  very anxious to know whether it has, in fact,

taken place.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $645,730 for Head 22 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on some

previous  occasion I had opportunity  to  compliment

the  officers of the Public Relations Department  on

the most diligent manner in which they perform their

duties  towards  the Government, and  in  particular

towards the Hon. the Chief Minister. I would  exhort

them  to  emulate, if they cannot surpass,  the  not

inept   method   of   dissemination   of   political

propaganda and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



philosophy of which we have had some evidence in the

past few days from the activities of representatives

of the Malayan Communist Party. Mr Chairman, Sir, I

would   recommend  very  strongly  that  our  Public

Relations  officers take a leaf from the manuals  of

those  who  are engaged in disseminating  a  counter

philosophy.  Perhaps they would do much better  than

they have done up to now.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I wish to refer

briefly  to the subject of the tourist industry.  It

is gratifying, Sir, that the Government has set up a

working  party  to  consider the organisation  of  a

centralised Tourist Bureau of some kind,  but  under

this Head the sum of $10,000 only has been set aside

for  tourist  promotion in 1956 which  is  a  wholly

inadequate  amount  if  the idea  of  a  centralised

Tourist  Bureau  is  to  be  turned  into  practical

achievement in the immediate future. It seems to  me

that,  without adding to the total vote  under  this

Head,  it  should be possible to cut out  or  reduce

other  items  which  are  of  minor  importance  and

increase  the amount available for tourist  industry

promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider further that the City Council, which

stands  to  benefit  from  an  increase  in  tourist

traffic,  should  also  be called  upon  to  make  a

contribution.   If   we  are   to   sell   Singapore

successfully  to the outside world, the  Government,

and the City Council for that matter, should not  be

niggardly  in  its  contribution  to  this   tourist

promotion.  Either  we  should  go  all  out  in   a

comprehensive  tourist promotion  policy  and  spend

money  to  bring back money, or we should leave  the

matter to individual agencies and other concerns.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, just on a

point  of  etiquette of the House. Is it not  proper

that a Member who speaks on a subject should declare

his interest, if he has any, on a particular topic?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that respect, I think hon.

Members  will  probably be aware that that  specific

question does not arise until the point of voting is

reached.  If a Member, in fact, has an interest,  it

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



left entirely to the Member himself to decide in his

own conscience whether he should refer to it or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I would just like to clarify that I

was talking entirely in the interests of Singapore.

If the Member for Tanjong Pagar likes to make

inferences of that sort, I have nothing to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I make no

inferences but the facts sometimes need to be

explained in order that the right inferences may be

drawn from them.

R. Jumabhoy and Mr Lee Choon Eng -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $5,000 the sum to be allotted in respect of sub-head 7, Entertainment Expenses, on page 108 of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have another amendment, Mr R.

Jumabhoy,  and connected to that is an amendment  by

Mr Lee Choon Eng.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move the

amendment  standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $5,000

the  sum  to  be allotted in respect of sub-head  7,

Entertainment   Expenses,  on  page   108   of   the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in previous Legislatures, if I remember

correctly, commerce and industry was under that Head

and  at that time, such Entertainment Expenses  were

necessary,  but commerce and industry is a  separate

department  now.  I  do not see  how  the  Hon. the

Financial Secretary requires $5,000 when his job  is

to count figures and adjust finances. On that basis,

I  would  like to move the amendment that it  should

not be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like

to  support the motion moved by the Member for Telok

Ayer.  When this Assembly met last Monday,  we  were

told  by  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary  that

entertainment  allowances to elected  Ministers  are

absolutely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



necessary  in  order that they could maintain  their

public  relations with those who visit this  country

and public or business enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really amazed to find that as an official

Member  of  the  Government, the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary  himself voted the sum of $5,000  for  his

own   Ministry  because  he  prepared  that   Budget

himself. This vote of $5,000 is public money and  is

rather  a  contrast  to the speeches  he  made  last

Monday.  He was then in favour of elected  Ministers

having  entertainment allowances. But why should  an

official Member of the Government be allowed to vote

the  same sum of money for public entertainment?  It

is  rather  a  contrast. At the same  time,  let  us

compare his figure of $5,000 with that of an elected

Minister  of only $2,000. Why is it that an  elected

Minister  is  only allowed $2,000  and  an  official

Member $5,000? This is rather absurd. We are here to

guard  public  funds  and if  we  do  not  guard  it

properly, I am afraid we will be accused of  showing

a  lack of responsibility. I am strongly opposed  to

this $5,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I bend under this virulent attack, Sir!

As  I have explained earlier today, there has always

been  a  central Secretariat vote for entertainment.

It  has  been  $10,000; it has been supplemented  as

occasion required. When the present Government  came

into  power, it was decided, as a temporary measure,

that  Ministers who had to entertain would  continue

to  draw  upon this vote. This arrangement  has  not

worked  very  satisfactorily. Having considered  the

matter  purely from the point of view of a  Treasury

official,  I thought that the best means of  dealing

with  this  problem in the future would be  to  give

Ministers votes in their own Departments which  they

could  control  themselves  and,  in  the  end,   be

answerable to the Audit and to the Assembly for  the

expenditure  arising from them. At  the  same  time,

however,  I  realised that it would be necessary  to

maintain the remnants of the central vote under  the

Treasury control so that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



demands of other departments for entertainment could

be  met.  For example, as has happened in the  past,

the  cost  of entertaining visiting naval personnel,

school  children on certain occasions, and provision

for other matters of a similar nature. These demands

on  the  public purse do arise throughout  the  year

and, for that reason, I maintain under my control in

the  Treasury  this small vote of  $5,000.  I  would

assure my friend the Member for Telok Ayer and  also

the  Member for Queenstown that it is not a personal

vote.  It is purely a central Secretariat vote which

is under my control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I fully appreciate that

the  money  is  there and will  only  be  used  when

necessary,  but  the provision is  there  and  if  a

provision is made, any Minister could just make  use

of that money because it has been allotted and voted

for. If the Hon. the Financial Secretary is going  to

reserve  this vote for other Ministries, I  am  very

happy about it and I hope that he will make it clear

in  future  cases that it is a reserved  vote  or  a

reserved  fund for other Ministries which  may  find

their votes inadequate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I hope that my personal integrity is not

being impugned by the Member for Queenstown. I  have

tried  to  make it clear that this vote is under  my

control  for official purposes and will be  used  as

the demands of the Government require. I cannot make

the  position  clearer and I  hope  the  Member  now

understands.   I  will  not  use   this   vote   for

entertaining my friends.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Nor your enemies, I hope!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Well, of course, if I could provide

hemlock from the vote, perhaps I would!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on the

assurance  of  the Hon. the Financial  Secretary,  I

would like to withdraw this amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 28 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $8,840 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (3), Accountants, Scale A, on

page 109 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, in the Remarks column of the

Estimates in respect of this item, we find this

note:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scale A increase two (one approved in 1955) and

Scale B decrease one."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, if we turn to page 200 of the 1955 Estimates, sub-head 1, item (3), we find

"Accountants,  Scale A, four"  and  in  the  Remarks

column  "Scale B - decrease one." Sir, I do not  quite

understand how this is. If there were five  Scale  A

Accountants last year, how could it be said that  an

increase to 6 Scale A Accountants is an increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



of two? I do not see any extra one being approved in

the  1955  Estimates. What I do see,  Mr  Chairman,

Sir, in the Singapore Establishment List at page 74,

is  four  Accountants  approved  in  1954 - "Timescale

appointments,  Accountants, Scale  A  (Qualified)" - four  expatriates listed. But it has in the head note

"5  appointments". As I see the 1955 Estimates,  the

approval  was  for  four Scale  A  Accountants.  The

appointments  are  five. But the  actual  number  of

names   listed   under  that  particular   Scale   A

appointment is four.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then one gets "Timescale appointments,

Accountants, Scale B" one appointment, but two names

under it. Now, that is an irregularity which may  be

purely typographical, or could be explained away one

way  or another. But what cannot be explained  away.

Mr   Chairman,  Sir,  is  this:  there   are   four

Accountants  now  on  Scale A - all  are  expatriates.

There  are  two  Accountants  now  on  Scale  B - both

expatriates.  The  difference between  Scale  A  and

Scale  B  is that Scale A is for qualified  men  and

Scale  B  is for underqualified men. There  are  no

local  men in Scale B who could possibly be promoted

to  Scale A. If this vote is to increase the  number

of  Scale A appointments from four to six, then  the

only  reasonable inference one can draw from  it  is

that  the  two underqualified Scale B men would  be

boosted  up  into  Scale A appointments  which  were

meant  for qualified men. I would like to  hear  the

Hon. the Financial Secretary on that point before  I

make any further remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> May I borrow your 1955 Establishment

List?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I should be delighted to let you

have it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, in the 1955 Estimates on page 200,

there were, in fact, four Accountants, Scale A,  and

one Accountant, Scale B. Hitherto, there had been  2

Accountants, Scale B, but one post was struck off in

framing the 1955 Estimates. Does that make the point

clear?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should explain what is the difference

between  Scale A and Scale B.  Scale A is for  fully

qualified  Accountants.  Until  very  recently,   it

covered  the three main qualifications - the Scottish

Chartered    Accountant,   the   English   Chartered

Accountant   and   the   Society   of   Incorporated

Accountants.  Very  recently, the qualification  has

been  widened and extended to bring in the Certified

Accountant,  the man who could obtain qualifications

in Singapore, I think, by correspondence. So Scale A

is  now  for  qualified Accountants embracing  these

four main categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scale B is for the underqualified Accountant.

Until  very  recently we did have two  officers  who

were  underqualified Accountants but they have  now

been    transferred   from   the    Department    to

Administrative appointments. We have now, therefore,

no underqualified Accountants in the Department but

we  do  require qualified Accountants and, from  now

on,  the  only  people  taken into  the  Accountant-General's  Department in Division I  will  be  fully

qualified Accountants -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Expatriate or local?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I shall deal with that point later. I

should  say,  at  this stage, that when  we  approve

appointments  in the Treasury for inclusion  in  the

Estimates,  we do not pay any attention  to  whether

the  appointments  are  to be filled  by  expatriate

officers or local officers. All we want are properly

qualified  officers.  What  has  happened   to   the

Estimates  this year is that there is no longer  any

underqualified  Accountant in  the  Department.  We

have  upgraded  one  post  from  underqualified  to

qualified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the point raised by my friend the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar, we have  advertised  at

considerable  length for the past year  for  locally

domiciled  officers to join the Accountant-General's

Department,    but   without   any    success.    An

advertisement has appeared in the papers during  the

last three weeks for two vacancies in the Accountant-General's Department with the qualification extended

to include Certified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



Accountants.  I hope that I have made  the  position

clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Arising out of that explanation,

Sir,  may  I  enquire when these two underqualified

Accountants  were  moved over from  the  Accountant-General's    Department   to   the    Administrative

appointments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I cannot tell the exact date. I know the

names  of the officers. I need not mention  them  in

the  Assembly and my friend the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  also  knows the names of the  officers  since

they appear in the Establishment List. They are  now

both serving in the Defence Branch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Hon. the

Financial Secretary has not explained how it is that

although  four Scale A Accountants were approved  in

1954  for  1955, yet in the 1955 Establishment  five

appointments are listed, but with only four  holders

and   no  vacancy  marked.  And  in  Scale   B   one

appointment  was approved in 1954 for  1955.  It  is

correctly denoted in the Establishment List  as  one

appointment,  but two officers are  listed.  Who  is

paying whom and out of what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> A leave reserve appointment was

created - I forgot to mention that, Sir - I think in one

Command Paper earlier on in 1955, as a result of the

split-up of the Malayan Establishment Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Tanjong Pagar, I think the answer is that the salary

of the underqualified man, although there was not a

post   for  him,  would  be  paid  from  the  salary

allocated for the fully qualified post. That is  the

normal practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, could the Hon.

the  Financial Secretary explain how it is  that  if

there  was  one  leave  reserve appointment  created

since  the  1955 Estimates were passed, it  has  not

been put down?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. The time has elapsed.

I  hope that hon. Members do realise the value of an

Estimates Committee because all these details  could

be enquired into by it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman. Sir, the Hon. the

Financial Secretary referred to the organisation  of

the Income Tax collecting branch when he spoke about

the  impracticability of having a different rate  of

can  explain to us how the tax is collected and  why

it  would  not be possible to collect on a different

rate  of  tax  in Singapore if ever  it  were  found

necessary to have a different rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 32 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lee Kuan Yew -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $600 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (3), Deputy Secretary to

Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Grade E, on page 121 of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in view of

Standing Orders which stand in the way of this

motion being debated, I will not move.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $5,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 2 (5), Transport and Travelling,

on page 122 of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment and the one which

follows,  I  do  so  because  when  funds  are   not

plentiful,  economy begins at home. We  consider  it

ill   advised   to   allocate  generous   travelling

allowances to Ministers and their staff when so many

more  important items of expenditure have had to  be

erased  through lack of funds. I must confess myself

to  be  a  little puzzled because of  the  disparity

between   the  travelling  allowances  in  different

departments.   For  example,  in  the   Income   Tax

Department,  which has a staff of over 250  persons,

there  is a travelling allowance of $1,300;  in  the

Statistics  Department, for a staff of  over  80,  a

travelling  allowance  of  $1,500;  while   in   the

Ministry  of Commerce and Industry, with a staff  of

43, there is this allowance of $5,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I might be of assistance, Mr

Chairman,  Sir. The expenditure for  this  year,  in

respect  of  this item, $6,830, arises from  various

sub-heads: air and rail fares; travel to Bangkok  in

respect  of the Rice Advisory Committee;  travel  to

Kuala  Lumpur  in respect of consultation  with  the

Ministry of Economic Affairs; and all these come out

of this vote. There is no question of the Minister's

transport being involved there. It is a common  pool

for  transport on official business by  officers  of

the  Ministry. It also includes, Sir, the  officers'

monthly  mileage.  As  you  are  aware,  Sir,  their

emoluments include pay in respect of monthly mileage

on  behalf  of the department, and it also  includes

bus fares and various items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in answer to our request for economy,

the   sum   allocated  this  year  was  $6,830.   My

department responded with this reduction  of  $1,830

which,  to my mind, was a good reduction and  to  me

was  acceptable. But I would like to assure the hon.

Member  that it is not the question of an allocation

being  made  and therefore has to be spent.  In  the

case  of the entertainment allowance which was  made

in  respect  of  this year in connection  with  this

Ministry,   far   less   was   spent   because   the

entertainment  allowance mostly came  out  from  the

Chief Minister's vote, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



that  is  the  position  as regards  the  travelling

allowances. It is a question of payment of rail, air

and monthly mileage costs of the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation of my hon. Friend, I wish to with draw this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Have I the assent of the Assembly

that this amendment be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move an

amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $2,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  sub-head 4, Entertainment Expenses,  on

page 122 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I need not add to

what  has  already been said on this subject  during

this  Committee of Supply except to say this. We  do

feel  that entertainment expenses for Ministers  are

not   entirely  an  essential  and  could  form   an

unfortunate  precedent. We hope that the  Government

will  agree to accept this amendment, and the others

which  I  think will follow, as an earnest of  their

desire to eliminate all extravagance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, this is no new vote. It was first

created  in  1951  at  the  request  of  the   then

Secretary  for  Economic Affairs  because  he  felt

that,  in  his  capacity as Secretary for  Economic

Affairs,  he  did  have to do a certain  amount  of

entertainment  of people in commerce  and  industry

and   people  passing  through  Singapore  in  that

connection,  and  the  Finance  Committee  of   the

Legislative Council had no hesitation in  approving

him  a personal allowance of $200 a month - $2,400  a

year.  That  vote was converted last  year  into  a

departmental entertainment vote, and  it  has  been

reduced  in 1956 by a further $400 a year to  bring

it  into line with the other Ministry votes. If one

can say that entertainment is more important in one

Ministry  than in another, I think it could  fairly

be  said  that  entertainment in the  Commerce  and

Industry Ministry, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



the Member for Tanglin will well appreciate, is more

important than perhaps in any other Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to inform hon. Members of this House

that,  in  view  of  the Government's  intention  to

curtail unnecessary expenditure, I feel there is  no

justification for liberal entertainment expenses for

the  Hon. the Minister for Local Government,  Lands

and Housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  in view of the lengthy debate we have had this

morning over similar items for various Ministries, I

do  not  think I can contribute much further to  the

debate on the Question before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in drawing

up  any  Estimates,  especially about  entertainment

expenses,  I  think that the most  sensible  way  of

doing  it would be to base it on what we have  spent

this  year, say, from April until November,  and  if

you  put it on that basis, we will probably be  able

to arrive at a figure that will be more acceptable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I remember correctly, Sir, the Hon. the

Minister for Education has informed me in one of his

saner  moments that up to date he has spent probably

$240 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on a point of

order.  Is  the Member entitled to impute  that  the

Minister for Education has insane moments?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. I must confess that I

did  not  take it in that sense. I thought the  hon.

Member  was perhaps speaking with his tongue in  his

cheek.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I said saner but I probably

meant sane, but if I had done anything, I would like

to apologise for that. I did not mean it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a matter of fact, the Minister for

Education  has said that his entertainment allowance

comes  to  $240 - which he has arrived at by logging.

So,  when  I see this item of entertainment expenses

put at $2,000, I think it is on the high side and I

think the amendment deserves support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I profoundly

disagree  with  the  proposal  by  the  Member   for

Serangoon  that  one should base  the  entertainment

allowance on the figure for April to November. After

all, the Member for Serangoon must remember that  it

takes some time for a Minister to warm his seat  and

to get his entertainment really going!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, an

entertainment allowance is necessary as far  as  His

Excellency the Governor or the Minister for Commerce

and Industry is concerned, for our trade depends  on

his  Ministry;  but I do not see how  the  Hon. the

Minister  for  Local Government, Lands  and  Housing

should  require such a big amount for entertainment,

and for whom. I cannot understand it at all. Has  he

to  receive  foreign visitors or diplomats  on  this

subject so that he has got to entertain?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  think I should clarify one or  two  points.

This sum of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



$2,000  is  not the entertainment allowance  of  the

Minister himself. In other words, the Minister  does

not  get  a cent out of this. All that the  Minister

does with the allowance is this. Invariably you  get

Ministers  coming from the Federation of  Malaya  or

from  Indonesia - and on one occasion I had  Ministers

coming from South America - so it falls upon me, as  a

Minister   of   the  Government  of  Singapore,   to

entertain  the visitors. When it comes  to  that,  I

naturally have to go to my good friend the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary and tell him that I have  spent

so  much  on entertainment and he is good enough  to

see  to the payment. This happens all the time.  The

last occasion when I had to entertain was during the

visit  of  the  Chief Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya, Tengku Abdul Rahman. In other words, Sir, it

does  not  necessarily mean that  the  Minister  for

Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  should  not

entertain  simply  because  he  happens  to  be  the

Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again I should also explain that the sum of

$2,000  is  vested in the Treasury. I  am  not  paid

monthly  at so much and so much. There is  therefore

no point at all in putting in this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I would like just to ask

this.  Some of the Members on the Government Benches

say  that  the  Hon. the Financial  Secretary  goes

through everything which is submitted to him and  it

is  up to him whether to pass it or not to pass  it.

Now,  my  enquiry is this, Sir. If the  six  elected

Ministers  and the official Ministers  decide  among

themselves to demand a certain amount of money, will

the Hon. the Financial Secretary -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> We Ministers do

not demand, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is hardly a point of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I will say, if the elected and

official  Ministers ask or request, can the Hon. the

Financial Secretary say no to them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It seems to me, Sir, that I am going over

the  same  course many times. I did try  to  explain

earlier that hitherto we have had a central vote and

it  was agreed, when the Government came into power,

that,  as a temporary measure and until we  saw  how

things worked, Ministers who had to entertain  would

call  upon  the central vote; but after I  had  seen

that  working  for  some  months,  I  came  to   the

conclusion that it was inappropriate that Ministers

should  have  to seek authority from  me  for  their

entertainment. They should be answerable not to  the

Financial  Secretary who, after  all,  is  merely  a

colleague,  but to the Legislature. So  I  therefore

decided - it is my decision and not the Ministers;  no

Minister  asked me, I made the decision off  my  own

bat - that it would be much better if, in the  future,

each  Minister had an entertainment vote of his  own

which  he  could spend as he thought  desirable  and

necessary  in  the  interest of Government,  and  in

respect  of which expenditure he would be answerable

to   the   Assembly  through  the  Public   Accounts

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, therefore, I, of my own

volition  and  not at the request of  any  Minister,

entered  in  the  Estimates $10,000  for  the  Chief

Minister  and $2,000 for each Minister.  As  I  have

said  many  times,  the  Ministers  will  have  full

responsibility   for   these   votes.    They    are

departmental  votes under their  Ministry  and  they

will  be accountable for the expenditure which  they

authorise  out of it. I fixed the sum of  $2,000  in

each  case  because  I  thought  that  a  reasonable

figure, having regard to the possible charges  which

they  might have to meet and having regard  also  to

the  inadvisability  of  coming  frequently  to  the

Assembly for small votes to supplement a very  minor

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would not grudge

this amount. At the rate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



other Ministers are getting, I should think that

the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing

should  receive  $3,000 because  he  has  got  three

departments to manage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $168,100 for Head 44 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 45 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,477,990 for Head 45 ordered

to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 46 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,046,870 for Head 46 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, just a matter of enquiry.

Are there any local officers being trained for these

jobs or are they all expatriates in the top jobs?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. Moment of

interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I beg to report that the Committee

of  Supply  have made progress in the  Appropriation

Bill and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tomorrow it will be.
