<div align="center"><b>(Assistance measures in servicing mortgage loans)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether his Ministry will consider allowing  lessees

of  Housing  and  Development Board flats to  restructure  their

loans  when  they  encounter financial difficulties  during  the

current financial crisis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (i) how many households are affected by the increase

in  the  interest rates of Housing and Development  Board  (HDB)

housing  loans and (ii) what measures will the HDB undertake  to

alleviate the increased burden of these households.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a) what can a Housing and Development Board  (HDB)

flat  owner do if he is retrenched and is unable to service  his

housing loan or stick to the original repayment scheme; and  (b)

what assistance the HDB will offer to such home owners.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir,  since Questions 1, 2 and 3 are related, can  I

have your permission to take them together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> HDB adjusted the interest rates for its

housing loans on 1st July 1998.  The public rate was raised from

3.58%  to 4.39% in line with the upward revision of CPF interest

rate.   The  market rate was also increased by 1%  from  between

5.25% and 5.75%, to between 6.25% and 6.75%.  While the interest

rate   adjustments   affected  some  440,000   households   with

outstanding  mortgage loans, the increase in  the  monthly  loan

instalment was $40 or less for 60% of the households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has in place various financial assistance measures to

help  lessees  who have difficulties in servicing their  monthly

mortgage loan instalments.  These measures are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Allow lessee to pay the mortgage loan arrears by

instalments within a reasonable period;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Allow lessee to reschedule the mortgage loan repayment

period up to the maximum repayment period that they are eligible

for;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Allow lessee to defer payment of loan instalments for

an  initial period of six months.  The deferment may be extended

for another six months, if necessary;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Allow lessee to convert the loan scheme to an easy

repayment scheme.  Under this scheme, the monthly instalment for

the  first  five  years  is set at 75%  of  the  normal  monthly

instalment.  The monthly instalment will then be recomputed from

the sixth year to the end

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>

of  the  repayment period based on the outstanding loan  at  the

beginning of the sixth year; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Advise lessee to include a working family member as a joint

owner if the latter meets the eligibility conditions.  This will

enable the family to use the CPF monies of the new lessee to pay

for the arrears.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the

Minister whether the HDB will levy any administrative charge for

those who need to restructure their loans?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If the loans are rescheduled, then the

whole loan is recomputed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the  prevailing  difficult economic situation,  may  I  ask  the

Minister  if  he  would  ask the HDB to consider  deferring  the

collection  of the principal element in the payment and  require

the  house  owner to only pay for the interest element,  in  the

case of families facing financial hardship?  In other words,  of

all  the  alternatives that the Minister has proposed just  now,

can I ask that this alternative be also considered?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The five measures which I outlined

earlier  have been very effective.  Very few HDB mortgage  cases

require  us to repossess the flats.  As of today, the percentage

of  arrears  of  mortgage loan instalments  has  increased  only

slightly from 1.9% in May to 2.1% in June.  So the situation  is

still  very  much  under control and HDB takes  a  very  helpful

approach to the mortgage loans.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I  ask the Minister that if, in spite  of  all  these

schemes  that the HDB has, the flat owner is unable to meet  his

payments, how much time does the HDB allow before it decides  to

repossess  the apartment under the powers given in  the  Housing

and Development Act?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Under one of the schemes which I have

outlined earlier,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>

we  first give them an initial period of six months and then, if

they  still face difficulties, we give them a further period  of

six months.  And we work very actively with them to see how they

could  reschedule  the  loans, how they  can  make  use  of  the

ballooning  scheme,  how  they  can  include  additional  family

members  to help pay for the loan.  So our experience,  both  in

the  1985/1986  recession, as well as all these years,  is  that

servicing the mortgage loans for HDB flat is never really a  big

problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister said that very few apartments

have  been  repossessed.  Could he tell us how  many  apartments

were repossessed?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do not have the exact number. But if

my memory serves me, probably five or seven last year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Further to the

question  by  Mr Jeyaretnam, would the Minister tell  the  House

what is the percentage of increase compared to last year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I said earlier, the percentage of

loan arrears has gone up by a very small percentage compared  to

nearly  half  a million mortgage loans that we administer.   HDB

takes  a  very  positive and helpful attitude towards  all  home

owners.   It is our objective to let them keep their  flat,  own

their  flat,  and we try our best to help each case  that  comes

before us to reschedule and to make the payments, to stretch  it

over  a longer time.  The number of cases where we actually take

back the flats is very few.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask the Minister, if a flat owner is willing to downgrade, would

the HDB help him?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> This is part of the various measures

which  HDB  has.   If a family has over-extended  themselves  by

buying  a  bigger flat than they could really afford, especially

with  this  economic downturn, and it is quite clear  that  they

cannot continue to service the loan, HDB would help them to sell

off  their flat if they are eligible to sell it off, and  buy  a

smaller flat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, eviction notices are

fearful  messages  to receive, especially to  a  person  who  is

already  down  in the dumps, enveloped by a sense of  gloom  and

helplessness.   Will  the Minister ask  the  HDB  to  thoroughly

investigate  each  case  to assess its  merits  before  eviction

notices  are  issued?   Now is the time when  understanding  and

compassion  are  appropriate.   Households  will  be   extremely

grateful  to  the Board for their support to help them  overcome

their  difficulties.   I have no qualms with  the  Board  taking

harsh actions against those who try to abuse the system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If a family falls behind in its loan

repayments,  HDB will have to serve the necessary notice.   This

is the first warning to them, and then they come forward, and we

work  together.  By deferring serving the eviction notice, I  do

not  think  you  are helping the family adjust  to  its  present

circumstances.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether HDB is

prepared  to  allow a working member in the family,  who  is  an

existing  HDB  lessee, to be included as a  member  to  pay  the

mortgage instalments?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The HDB's policy on this is very clear.

You are only allowed to own one HDB property.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister what is the position

as regards those who are just paying rents as distinct from loan

instalments?  What is the policy as regards them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Our rental tenants belong to the lower

income  group  and therefore HDB takes an even more  sympathetic

approach towards these families.  Our rental arrears are  higher

than  the  loan instalment arrears because these  are  from  the

lower   income   families.   But  we   do   not   evict   people

unnecessarily.  We take great pains to let them stay in the  HDB

flats  and, unless it is absolutely necessary, we do  not  evict

our rental tenants.

<div align="center"><b>SHORTLISTED HDB FLAT APPLICANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Retention of original queue position for downgraders)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will

consider  allowing HDB flat applicants who have been shortlisted

and wish to downgrade, due to the current economic slowdown,  to

retain their original queue position.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under HDB's prevailing

policy, flat applicants under the Registration for Flats  System

may  switch  to  a  smaller flat type  if  they  have  not  been

shortlisted to select their flats.  However, this is subject  to

meeting the eligibility criteria and a 3-month setback in  their

registration numbers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For applicants who have already been shortlisted to select

their  flats, HDB does not normally allow changes to be made  to

the flat-type and zone applied.  However, in view of the current

economic  downturn, HDB will consider such applicants'  requests

to  downgrade to purchase a smaller flat type, on a case-by-case

basis.  Their registration numbers will similarly be set back by

three months.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  what  is  the  breakdown  in  terms  of  gender,  age,

industry,  types of courses and amount of benefits received,  of

employees  who  have  benefited from  the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme; and if the subsidy does not cover the full amount  of

the training programme, what options an interested party has  in

order to obtain funding to cover the difference.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  whether  there  are  plans  for  skills  redevelopment

programmes  to  be offered to workers who have  been  retrenched

and,  if so, what kind of training will be offered for what kind

of jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Questions 5 and 6 are on a similar subject.   May  I  have

your permission to take both Questions together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is working

closely   with  the  NTUC  and  the  SNEF  (Singapore   National

Employers'  Federation)  to  promote  the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme  (SRP).  This  programme is designed  to  enhance  the

employability of the local workforce by encouraging employers to

send their workers for skills upgrading and retraining.  The aim

is  to  equip the under-educated and lower-skilled workers  with

certifiable  skills to enable them to remain employable  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 4,176 workers who have so far benefited from the

programme,  70% have Secondary Two education or  less.   46%  of

these  workers are above the age of 40, with another 39% between

the ages of 30 and 39.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 80% of the employees who have benefited from the

Skills   Redevelopment  Programme  are  from  the  manufacturing

sector,  as this was the first to be adversely affected  by  the

economic  downturn.   About  70% of  the  SRP  participants  are

females,  since  there  are  more  women  in  the  manufacturing

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A requirement of the Skills Redevelopment Programme is that

the  courses offered must lead to national certification.   This

protects  the  worker and ensures recognition of skills  by  the

employer.   The  types  of courses offered  include  preparatory

courses   such   as  language  and  numeracy,   Certificate   of

Competency, National Technical Certificates (NTC) levels  2  and

3, and other certificate courses offered by the polytechnics and

the  ITE.  These skills are required by jobs in various sectors,

including manufacturing and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current estimate of benefits granted is about $16.7

million, or about $4,000 per worker.  This is based on a funding

mechanism that subsidises up to 80% of the course fees,  and  up

to 70% of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>

worker's  absentee payroll.  The employer is asked  to  co-share

the  cost of the training, since he is the immediate beneficiary

of a better-skilled worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers who have been or are about to be retrenched are, in

fact,  already  a  group that is being targeted  for  retraining

under  the  SRP  for  employment in new and high  growth  areas.

These   include  the  wafer  fabrication  and  process  chemical

industries.  The NTUC and my Ministry are working with  agencies

such  as  the  EDB, STB, TDB and PSB to get these industries  to

recruit  the  retrenched workers to meet their  manpower  needs.

The  SRP  will provide such recruits with the necessary training

for their new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry is also working with the Ministry of

Trade  and  Industry, the NTUC and other economic  agencies  and

industry  bodies  to expand the spectrum of certifiable  courses

under  the  SRP in areas relevant to the needs of each industry.

We  will  provide  a wider range of training to meet  employers'

needs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Would the Minister

elaborate on whether there has been an increased willingness  on

the part of workers to go for retraining in view of the economic

uncertainty and downturn?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> When the SRP was launched in December

1996,  as  a  pilot project, this was in fact one  of  the  main

concerns.  Will our workers be sufficiently motivated  and  will

they  be  sufficiently  interested in taking  advantage  of  the

training opportunities offered under the SRP?  The other concern

was  of  course whether employers will support such a programme.

As  the  economic  crisis  unfolds and as  workers  become  more

concerned  and worried about job security, we found  a  matching

increase  in interest to undergo retraining and skills upgrading

by   the   workers  themselves.   So  we  find   that   workers,

particularly those who are low-skilled and with lower education,

as  can  be seen from the figures that I gave earlier  on,  were

very   amenable  to  undergo  retraining  and  skills  upgrading

courses.   Fortunately, over the same period, we  also  found  a

greater interest on the part of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>

employers to participate in these programmes because they  would

be able to minimise the need to retrench workers and, instead of

laying  off workers, they can send workers for skills  upgrading

or  retraining under the SRP, and Government will  come  in  and

assist them with up to 70% grant on the absentee payroll.  So it

is a win-win situation for workers, employers and the Government

too.

<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

(i)  whether  the search for Mr Phey Yew Kok has been  abandoned

and  (ii) what success the police have had to secure the  return

of  the man reported to be hiding in Macau after the suicide  of

the late Mr Teh Cheang Wan.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, any effort

in  tracking  down  Phey Yew Kok is now very much  dependent  on

available  intelligence on his exact whereabouts. Without  this,

no  specific effort can be mounted.  Meanwhile, he is  still  on

the  wanted  list  of all Interpol member countries.  Also,  the

warrant of arrest against him is still in force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question on securing the return of "the man

hiding  in  Macau after the suicide of the late  Mr  Teh  Cheang

Wan",  can  Mr Jeyaretnam give me the name of the person  he  is

referring to so that I can answer the question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If the Minister had read the Hansard in

1987,  he would have seen that the then Prime Minister  did  not

reveal  the identity, but was simply saying the man had run  off

to  Macau and was hiding and they were trying to get him.  So  I

am afraid I cannot give the identity.  The CPIB must know.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I would like to assure Mr

Jeyaretnam that I have read the Hansard.  I wanted to make  sure

because the tenor of his question suggests that this person  was

implicated in Mr Teh's death.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is what the then Prime Minister said.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> In that case, I know who he is

referring to.  That would be Ho Yau Koon from whom Mr Teh Cheang

Wan  allegedly received gratification for assisting Ho to buy  a

piece of land.  Ho Yau Koon passed away in Hong Kong in 1987.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Considering that this man Phey Yew Kok has

been out of the country for more than 20 years, and we hear  the

Minister saying that the Police has still not been able to  find

where  he  is,  are  we to understand that the  Police  are  now

abandoning  the  search because I cannot see any  purpose?   The

second question is: are the Police aware or do they know if  the

wife  of  Mr Phey Yew Kok regularly takes trips out of Singapore

or not?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as to the first question, I

have  stated  just now that he is still on the  wanted  list  of

Interpol.  The case is therefore still alive.  As to the  second

question, because the case is alive, it would not be prudent  to

divulge information on the operation procedures of the CPIB.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I know the answer to a simple question

and,  that  is, do the Police know that the wife goes  regularly

out of Singapore or not?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think I have answered

that question.

<div align="center"><b>INTERIM FINANCIAL SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community   Development   how  his   Ministry   publicises   and

administers  the Interim Financial Scheme which was  set  up  to

help  destitute  families; and since  its  formation,  how  many

Singaporeans have applied for assistance from the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community

Development  (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Minister  for  Community

Development):  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Interim Financial Assistance

Scheme  was  implemented in September  1996  in  response  to  a

recommendation of the Inter-Ministry Committee on  Dysfunctional

Families, Juvenile Delinquency and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

Drug  Abuse.   The  Scheme, as the name  implies,  is  meant  to

provide  interim financial aid to destitute and needy applicants

of the Public Assistance (PA) allowance while their applications

are being processed by the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an applicant for Public Assistance is assessed to have

immediate  difficulties  in  meeting  his/her  daily  needs  and

requires  assistance  while  waiting  for  the  outcome  of  the

application,  the  Ministry  will  provide  immediate  financial

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, 41 cases have been assisted under the Scheme. The

total  amount  disbursed was about $11,000.  (The quantum  given

will depend on the applicant's family size and is pegged at  90%

of the Public Assistance rates when it is approved.)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is an interim arrangement for those who

already  applied for the Public Assistance Scheme, there  is  no

need  to  publicise  it.   Applicants of the  Public  Assistance

scheme  who  have  been assessed as needing immediate  financial

assistance  are automatically given the allowance  without  they

having to apply for it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Manpower whether

his Ministry will consider allowing Singaporeans to use part  of

their Central Provident Fund savings (capped at $2,000 per year)

for education or skills upgrading purposes.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron</b>

<b>Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, I would like to

inform the House that the main objectives of CPF savings are for

housing,  medical  and  old age needs.   CPF  savings  are  also

allowed  to  be used for selected purposes, including  full-time

studies  in approved institutions of higher learning, which  are

the  2  local  universities and 4 polytechnics.   Sir,  the  CPF

Education Scheme is a loan scheme and it is an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>

exception  made  for  full-time students because  they  have  no

income and are likely to have more difficulty paying for tuition

fees with their own savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, workers who need to upgrade their skills today have

many  opportunities  to  do  so  with  the  support  from  their

employers,  the  Skills Development Fund (SDF)  and  the  Skills

Redevelopment  Programme (SRP).  Training and upgrading  courses

organised by employers  for their workers are funded by  SDF  up

to  80% of the course fees.   Sir, for employers who send  their

workers to enhance their employability and to be certified under

the  SRP, they are also eligible to claim for subsidy up to  70%

of  their absentee payroll, apart from the 80% subsidy from  the

SDF  on  course  fees.   For individuals who  take  up  training

courses to upgrade themselves through their unions or the  self-help  groups,  they could also enjoy the training grant  of  80%

from the SDF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage workers to undergo training and retraining,

the  Government has also given a tax relief of up to  $2,000  of

course fees for individuals pursuing courses on their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am therefore of the view that it is not necessary to

use  individual's CPF savings for education and skills upgrading

courses.   CPF savings should be reserved to meet their housing,

medical and old age needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, while I understand that

CPF  savings  are allowed to be used for tertiary  education  by

students?

<div align="center"><b>SILKAIR CRASH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Report of investigation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for

Communications if he will say how far the investigation into the

SilkAir crash has proceeded and when a report may be expected.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the crash of flight MI185 took place in  December

1997.   In  February  this  year, I updated  the  House  on  the

progress of the investigation into the crash.  I also made known

the  various tasks that would be undertaken by the investigation

team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation team is headed by Indonesia and supported

by  experts  from Singapore and the US.  This is  in  accordance

with  international laws which stipulate that the  investigation

of aircraft accidents should be under the charge of the State in

which  the accident occurred and supported by the State  of  the

airline  operator  and  the State of the aircraft  manufacturer.

The team is also assisted by experts from Australia, which has a

mutual  agreement with Indonesia for investigation  of  aircraft

accidents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigation into the crash is still very much in

progress.  Since I last updated the House, the team has examined

the  recovered wreckage pieces.  A partial reconstruction of the

aircraft  tail  section  has been completed  and  the  team  has

carried out tests in flight simulators.  Investigations into air

traffic   services,   meteorology,   maintenance   records   and

operations  have  also  been completed. The  team  is  currently

looking  into  further analysis of certain aircraft  system  and

flight  control  parts and components and the human  performance

aspects  of  the  accident.  All the information extracted  from

these investigation activities will be carefully studied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation team fully understands the importance of

keeping  the next-of-kin and the public informed of the progress

and  findings  of  the  investigation.  As  the  leader  of  the

investigation,  Indonesia is the authority for  the  release  of

such  information.  No information can be released by any  other

party  without  the  approval  of  the  lead  country  in   this

investigation,  ie,  Indonesia. In March  this  year,  Professor

Oetarjo  Diran,  Chairman  of the Indonesian  Aircraft  Accident

Investigation  Commission  (AAIC) and Investigator-In-Charge  of

the  investigation, was in Singapore to report on the status  of

the investigation.  Last month, Professor Diran

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>

wrote a letter to the press to update the public and next-of-kin

on the investigation.  The team will continue to update the next-of-kin and the public when there are significant developments or

findings, and when the investigation is completed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations of air crashes are very painstaking and

laborious.   The  complete investigation of  the  ValueJet  DC-9

accident in Florida, USA in May 1996 took 16 months.  The  China

Airlines  A300  incident in Nagoya, Japan  in  April  1994  took

almost 27 months.  Others took even longer.  In the case of  the

United  Airlines B737 crash in Colorado Springs, USA,  in  March

1991, seven years ago, investigation is still on-going.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the SilkAir case, the investigation is made difficult by

the extent of damage of the aircraft and the lack of useful data

from the black boxes.  At this point in time, the team is unable

to  predict  when  investigations into  the  accident  would  be

completed.  They have, however, informed me that it is  unlikely

to  be  completed within the next six months.  Nonetheless,  the

team of 70 experts is putting in maximum effort to do a thorough

and   objective   investigation.   All  parties  concerned   are

determined  to  find  out the cause or  causes  of  this  tragic

accident.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I just ask the Minister whether he is

satisfied  for  himself  that  the  Indonesian  authorities  are

exerting all efforts to find out the cause of the accident?   Or

has it been superseded by the recent events in Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is in constant

touch  with  the  investigation  team,  which  is  led  by   the

Indonesians  but  active participation comes from  Singapore  as

well  as the NTSB of the United States.  I would like to  assure

the  House  that  the  investigation led by  Indonesia  is  very

professionally  done.   It is still very  active.   The  current

troubles  in  Indonesia  are  not affecting  the  investigation.

Prof.  Diran,  who is the leader in charge of the  investigation

has been misquoted in the press as saying that the investigation

has been completed and he has come out to clarify the situation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>

I  believe that he will be issuing further statements to  update

the public on the progress of the investigation in due course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister give an

assurance to the House that when the report is completed he will

present  the  report to the House or perhaps make a  Ministerial

Statement in due course?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the investigation report will be

issued  by the Indonesian authorities.  As to the modalities  of

presenting the investigation report, I will have to discuss with

the authorities concerned.  But, definitely, I will endeavour to

at  least  make  a statement in this House when  the  report  is

finally published.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  whether SilkAir has paid compensation to the relatives

of the air crash victims?  If not, why is that so?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I believe that the lawyers of SilkAir and

the  lawyers  of the next-of-kin of the deceased are  in  touch.

SilkAir has made provisions for advance compensation to the next-of-kin up to an amount of $20,000.  This was to help in some  of

the  expenses  incurred.  However, not all the next-of-kin  have

taken  up  that offer.  Nevertheless, I believe that discussions

are ongoing with the rest of the next-of-kin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would

like to ask the Minister about recent disturbing reports in  the

Wall Street Journal suggesting that suicide could be one of  the

causes  of  the  crash.  I would like to ask  the  Minister  how

credible  is this report and are there investigations  to  study

the possibility of this being one of the reasons?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question is out of order. A question

should not be asked confirming whether a press report is correct

or not.

<div align="center"><b>FORFEITURE OF SECURITY BONDS OF EMPLOYERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF FOREIGN DOMESTIC MAIDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower how

many  employers  of foreign domestic maids have  their  security

bonds  forfeited or withheld since January 1998, and  of  these,

how  many  of  the  maids went missing  while  in  the  care  of

employment  agencies,  and whether his  Ministry  will  consider

amending legislation to hold the employment agencies liable  for

those maids who went missing while in their custody.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (for the Minister for</b>

<b>Manpower):</b> Sir, during the first six months of this year, the

security bonds of 79 employers of foreign domestic workers  were

forfeited because their workers have absconded.  This is a small

proportion of more than 100,000 foreign domestic workers who are

currently  working in Singapore.  Most of the  foreign  domestic

workers  had run away from their employers' homes.   There  were

very  few reports of foreign domestic workers running away while

under the care of the employment agents.  As such, I do not have

the number of such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers whose foreign domestic workers have absconded

are  given one month from the date of cancellation of  the  work

permit  to  locate and repatriate the worker, failing which  the

security deposit will be forfeited.  However, we allow employers

up to six months to locate or help to locate the missing workers

and a refund of the forfeited money will be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of foreign domestic workers going missing while

in  the  care of the employment agencies, I would like to remind

employers  that they are ultimately responsible for  the  worker

the  day  she  comes into Singapore.  The employer cannot  shift

this responsibility to an employment agent.  It is therefore not

necessary  to  amend the legislation to hold  employment  agents

liable  for  foreign domestic workers who go  missing  while  in

their care.  However, my Ministry will consider such factors  in

appeals by employers for refund of the security deposits.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of

State to reconsider the request.  When an employer applies for a

maid through an agency, the agency basically brings the maid  in

from  whatever  country and they make an  arrangement  with  the

employer  and  assures the employer that  if  the  maid  is  not

satisfactory,  the  employer can  send  the  maid  back  to  the

employment agency and some arrangement will be made  to  send  a

new  maid to the employer.  Under these circumstances,  I  think

there is an understanding between the employer and the agency to

send  the maid back to the agency if she is unsatisfactory.   If

this  is  the case, is it not right for the maid agency to  take

responsibility  for the security of the maid  while  she  is  in

their  custody?  And if the maid were to go missing during  this

period  of  time, does the Ministry not consider it  appropriate

that the responsibility should lie with the agency?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, are you making a speech?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> I am sorry. I just want to say this. Will

the Ministry reconsider its decision?  The Ministry can help  in

resolving the issue of helplessness of the employer?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, I have mentioned that the

employer  is ultimately responsible for the worker the  day  she

comes  into  Singapore.  He employs the worker and therefore  he

should  be  responsible for the worker.  However, we  will  take

this  into consideration when appeals are made by employers  for

refund  of  security deposits when the maid goes  missing  under

these  circumstances.  But I repeat again that the  employer  is

responsible for the worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, the employer applies for transfers. While

they  wait  for  the transfer, the foreign domestic  worker  can

still be under the care of the employer.  So the employer should

be responsible.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to ask the Minister

of  State  whether  it  is  fair for the  employer  to  be  held

responsible  when the maid is in the custody of  the  employment

agency.  The agency would say, "Yes, I will take back

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>

the  maid  and find you a new one."  In this case, the  employer

would  say to the maid agency, "I have already passed back  this

maid  to  you and she is under your custody."  In this instance,

would the Ministry consider passing legislation to hold the maid

agency  responsible?   Because  to  say  that  the  employer  is

responsible,  I think it is not fair.  The indifference  of  the

maid agency could really frustrate the employer.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, as I have mentioned, the

employer  brings  the  maid  into Singapore  and  he  should  be

responsible  for the maid.  When the maid is given back  to  the

employment agency while they wait for certain things to be done,

I  think  the  employer must recognise that  he  still  has  the

responsibility  for  the  maid.  The employer  can  come  to  an

arrangement  with  the employment agency.   That  is  a  private

arrangement.   But  when  the  employer  brings  the  maid  into

Singapore, our position is that he should be responsible for the

maid.  And if the maid goes missing, then he has to abide by the

terms of the security deposit.

<div align="center"><b>INTRODUCTION OF EURO CURRENCY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact on Singapore economy)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry whether the introduction of a single Euro currency  and

the  eventual formation of a single market in Europe  will  have

any  implications  for,  and  impact,  direct  or  indirect,  on

investments,  trade  flows  and  inflation  for  the   Singapore

economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  European Union is a significant  trade  and

investment partner for Singapore.  As a bloc, it was  our  third

largest  export  market last year, accounting  for  14%  of  our

exports.   It  was  the second largest investor  into  Singapore

(accounting  for about 20 % of our total inward investment)  and

our  third largest investment destination abroad (accounting for

about 12 % of total investment abroad).

.     The  introduction of the Euro with the target of  monetary

union by 2002 is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



fundamental  shift.  There are still considerable  uncertainties

surrounding the final shape of the European Monetary Union (EMU)

and  its  effects on EU growth and trade patterns.  Our  current

assessment of the impact on Singapore is therefore tentative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a single currency per se should not affect

the  volume,  direction and composition of trade and  investment

flows  significantly.  While a single currency eliminates cross-border  transaction costs and could lead to increase  in  intra-EU(15) trade at the expense of trade with the rest of the world,

there  is  no historical evidence that this will necessarily  be

the outcome.  For example, the Single European Market was formed

in  1993  and  yet,  over the period 1990-96, the  trade  growth

between EU (15) and Asia at 9.1 % per annum was faster than  the

intra-EU (15) trade growth of 3.6 % per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a longer-term perspective, it is widely expected that

Europe   would  benefit  from  higher  efficiency   and   market

orientation as a result of the EMU.  A stronger EU is likely  to

increase  imports  from  Asia and the rest  of  the  world.   To

qualify for entry into the EMU, according to the criteria of the

Maastricht  Treaty of 1991, member countries had to  keep  their

inflation  rates  low,  at not more than 1.5  percentage  points

above the average inflation rate of the three countries with the

lowest  inflation  rates.   Monetary policy  under  the  EMU  is

expected  to maintain this price stability and help  keep  price

increases at bay.  Given the high import content of our economy,

this development should have a small positive effect on imported

inflation for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, what is the Minister's assessment of

the potential use of the Euro as a reserve currency?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I think this question is better

answered by MAS or the Finance Ministry.  My own expectation  is

that it will be significant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on 28th June 1991,

Singapore  signed a water agreement with Indonesia.  It  enables

Singapore  to  develop water resources in the Riau  Province  of

Indonesia and draw up to 1,000 million gallons per day of  water

for  100  years.   PUB has identified Pulau  Bintan  and  Sungei

Kampar as possible sources of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement provides viable supplementary or alternative

sources  of  water for our long-term needs.  Its  implementation

will  be  carried out at the appropriate time, after  evaluating

the various options, including desalination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is a strategic resource and Singaporeans should be

regularly reminded to conserve water.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Our current consumption is about 280

million  gallons per day.  So 1,000 million gallons per  day  is

last meeting, there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>

has  been not much progress.  But we are still hopeful  that  at

some stage we will be able to come to an agreement.  Because  we

are interested to buy water and if they do not sell the water to

us,  it  just goes to waste. So it is really a commercial  deal.

It is a single buyer, single seller, kind of situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> What is the cost of buying

water  from the Riau Islands compared to that from Malaysia  and

desalination?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Water from Bintan is expected to be

competitive and it is probably cheaper than desalination.  Water

from  Kampar is likely to be expensive because it is a long  way

away and we have to put in a very expensive pipeline.  But as  I

have mentioned in my answer, these sources are viable.  It is  a

matter of deciding which are the alternatives we want to adopt.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, bearing in mind the problem we

have  with  Malaysia  pertaining to the CIQ  matter,  would  the

Minister  envisage  any  problem  with  our  negotiations   with

Malaysia and will the Minister tell us whether there is going to

be a deadline in terms of finalising the negotiations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I suppose the current state of

relations  must affect the negotiations.  The CIQ is one  issue.

But  we should try and keep the issues separate.  We need water.

The  first  Agreement which allows us to draw up to  90  million

gallons  of water per day is expiring in the year 2011.   So  we

are  still very keen to buy water. As I said, if we do  not  buy

the water from them, it will just be discharged into the sea and

it  is  of no value to them.  So I hope it will be seen  in  the

light  that  it  is  of  mutual interest to  come  to  an  early

agreement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

how  much  and  how  long it would take to build  the  necessary

infrastructure  to  bring  water  from  the  Riau   Islands   to

Singapore.  Secondly, could the Minister tell the House when  we

are  likely to expect the first drop of water to come  from  the

Riau Islands?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> It is likely to take a few years to build

the  pipeline from Bintan, the reservoir and so on.    Also,  we

have  to agree on the terms, for example, how to keep the  water

clean,  how much to pay for the resettlement and so forth.   But

it is well within the time frame.  We do not need the first drop

until 2011.  So we still have another 13 years.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I would like to ask the Minister whether,

in  the  light  of the current difficulties with  Malaysia,  the

Government   would   consider   accelerating   its   plans   for

desalination.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, we continue to proceed with our plans

for  the first desalination plant of 30 mgd, based on the multi-stage flash evaporation process.  So those plans are in hand and

we are in the process of preparing for that. We will work within

the time frame where necessary. There is no need for us to hurry

and  do it just because of the problems.  Because when we  bring

in  the plant, we must operate it.  So we have this window  when

we  must  put in the plant, and our plans are well in hand.   We

are proceeding as we have announced previously.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister if there is a problem in

getting  fresh catchment areas in the Riau Islands  due  to  the

uncontrolled dense population there?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, the problem could be more in Bintan

because  it is a small island.  If a lot of immigrants come  in,

it  could  affect the reservoir area.  But the  Kampar  area  is

enormous. So we think there should be no problem there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Minister assure this House that

even  in  2011,  when  the first Water Agreement  with  Malaysia

expires, Singapore would not face the problem of water supply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I can assure the House that that would

be  the  case.  As I have mentioned, our plans are well in  hand

for us to put up the first desalination plant.  So it is just  a

matter  of putting in the money.  The technology is proven.   It

has  been  done in so many other countries.  So long as  we  are

able  to  pay and buy the energy and pay for the plant,  we  can

have the water.

<div align="center"><b>IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will

appoint   a  committee  to  study  the  economic  situation   in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is  no  need to establish another separate  committee  to

study the economic situation in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry and the other economic

agencies  are  closely monitoring the economic situation.   They

rely on regular meetings with businessmen, surveys of companies,

and   statistics  on  trade  and  industrial  production.   This

combination  of  on-the-ground feedback and  timely,  hard  data

enables  the  Government  to keep close  tabs  on  the  economic

situation  and the problems faced by businesses and Singaporeans

during this difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is already established a Committee on

Singapore's  Competitiveness (CSC), chaired by the Minister  for

Trade  and Industry, and comprising private sector members  from

all  the  economic  sectors. The CSC was  originally  tasked  to

assess  and make recommendations to sustain Singapore's economic

competitiveness  in  the medium to long  term.   But  since  the

regional crisis began, the CSC has broadened its scope  of  work

to  cover  the  impact  of  the crisis  on  Singapore,  and  the

immediate measures needed to sustain the Singapore economy.  The

Government took into account the CSC's inputs when it formulated

the economic measures in the FY1998 Budget and more recently  in

the off-Budget package.

<div align="center"><b>JUVENILE DELINQUENCY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs (a) whether juvenile delinquency is a serious or growing

problem  in Singapore; (b) what are the trends in recent  years;

and  (c)  whether  there are particular juvenile  problems  that

require  the  attention of families, Government and  society  in

general.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the number of juvenile

offenders arrested rose steadily from 1,205 in 1990 to 2,574  in

1995  before falling to 2,110 in 1996.  Last year, the situation

stabilised,  with  the  number  of juvenile  offenders  arrested

rising only slightly by 37 to 2,147.     In the first six months

of  this year, 1,028 juvenile offenders were arrested, which was

a slight 1.5% increase over the corresponding period last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile delinquents commit mainly property-related

offences   such  as  shoplifting  and  theft,  and  gang-related

offences  such as rioting and unlawful assembly.   The  increase

in  the total number of juvenile offenders in 1997 and the first

six  months of 1998 is mainly due to more juveniles arrested for

shoplifting and other property-related offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile delinquency is a multi-faceted problem. The

reasons why a juvenile turns to crime are diverse and complex in

nature.    Studies  on  juvenile problems have  shown  that  the

reasons  for juvenile delinquency include ineffective parenting,

parental  neglect,  boredom, undesirable peer influence,  greed,

the  desire to do the unconventional, or a combination of  these

factors.   We have not detected specific juvenile problems  that

need to be urgently addressed so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only with more information can Government, families and the

society  in  general  be  able  to  target  specific  groups  of

juveniles  that  need assistance most.   This  is  being  looked

into.     MCD is chairing an Inter-Agency Work Group, which  has

been  set  up to develop a centralised inter-agency database  on

juvenile  pre-delinquents and delinquents.  This  database  will

facilitate  the monitoring of juvenile delinquency trends.    It

will  also  help to highlight specific juvenile  problems.    In

addition,  the Inter-Ministry Committee on Juvenile  Delinquency

(IMJD)  has  also commissioned a study on juvenile  delinquency,

which is expected to be completed by year-end.   This study will

also provide further insights on why juveniles turn delinquent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> There seems to be a worrying

trend towards a more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>

violent   behaviour  amongst  our  youths,  such   as   rioting,

gangsterism and street fights.  I would like to ask the Minister

how  serious  is  this, and whether we are  meting  more  severe

punishments towards these offenders.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The courts have taken a tough

stand,  particularly  against this area of  teens  fighting  and

rioting.   As  I  have indicated in my speech,  the  problem  of

rioting  has  been there for some time.  It was  contained  last

year.  In fact, in the first six months of this year, as I  have

indicated,  the  total number of offenders has  been  about  the

same,  but  the number of offenders caught for shop-lifting  and

other  property-related offences has gone up much more.  So  the

early indications in the first six months of this year are quite

positive.  The other matter is that when we talk about  juvenile

delinquency, we are talking about the under-16s.  Of course,  we

know  that  youths above 16s also fight.  They are  the  youths.

What  we  have to look at is a more composite picture.  So  IMJD

will do that, and not just address the problem from the juvenile

delinquents' point of view, but even those above 16.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> The Minister of State cited figures for

juvenile  offenders.  In the Minister of State's assessment,  is

this merely the tip of the iceberg?  In other words, is there an

increase  in  terms of youth joining youth gangs?  Is  there  an

increase  in ill-discipline in schools, for instance?   To  what

extent are these figures on juvenile offenders which give us  no

cause  for  concern  really  just something  which  may  not  be

indicative of a general trend as a whole?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Youths go through phases in their

lives.  At a certain age, when they are probably in secondary 1,

secondary  2,  secondary  3,  I  think  they  are  looking   for

excitement.  They are very easily influenced by peers.  So  what

is  important,  as  I have said in my answer, is  the  parenting

effect.   The  key  point  which  we  would  have  to  emphasise

continually  and work with the CDCs and other VWOs  is  to  help

parents  understand  what their teens are  going  through.   The

important thing is that whilst the teens undergo

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>

through  this  phase, which I think all teens will  go  through,

they  should  not fall beyond the abyss.  They  may  do  naughty

things but they should not do anything which is so serious  that

will lend them in jail or put them in violation of the law.   As

I  have  said  in  my  answer, it is  a  multi-faceted  problem.

Fighting  is  something  that  has  emerged,  but  it  has  been

contained.   I  would  say that we must continue  to  press  on,

bringing everybody on board to tackle the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current waiting list, the average waiting time for

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in view of the economic downturn, the Government

should  rally  the  support  of the entire  nation  to  minimise

unemployment   in   the  short  term  and  strengthen   economic

competitiveness and social cohesion for the long  term  so  that

Singapore  will  emerge  from this  regional  crisis  even  more

competitive and resilient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my address I may touch on issues related to various

organisations  which I am associated with.    I  would  like  to

begin  by declaring my interests,  as a Deputy Secretary-General

of  NTUC, the Chairman of the National Computer Board,  a  Board

Member  of  the  EDB  and  PSB, and a Member  of  Singapore  21,

Manpower 21, and the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1992 when I was working with the EDB, we presented

the  economic strategy of Singapore to the Chairman and  CEO  of

one  of  the world's largest corporations.  We were there trying

to  get  him  to invest more in Singapore.  At the  end  of  our

presentation, this Chairman, who had just taken over the running

of  the  corporation  and   gone through  a  major  exercise  of

downsizing  and  retrenchment,  commented  that  he   was   very

impressed by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>

economic  strategy of Singapore.  He said  the way  we  ran  our

economy  in Singapore was very much like the way he ran his  big

corporation,  a  global  operation.   We  thanked  him  for  his

compliment  and  pointed  out to  him  that  there  is  one  big

difference  between  running a big  corporation  and  running  a

national economy.  We pointed out to him that in the case  of  a

corporation, when business is not doing well, when  the  company

needs  to  restructure to remain competitive, you can  downsize,

you can retrench to be lean and trim again.  But in the case  of

a  national  economy, a country cannot just simply retrench  and

downsize the country, the workforce, because at the end  of  the

day we still have to find jobs for every Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this precisely is the challenge facing us

today.   For  the last 30-over years, in the process of  nation-building,  we have been very conscious about the need to  create

more  than  just a competitive economy.  Because we realise  and

understand that at the end of the day, the long-term survival of

Singapore rests not just with a competitive economy but equally,

if  not more importantly, on a cohesive society and a strong and

resilient  nation.  In fact, if you look back the  last  20-over

years,  since  the  mid-70s,  the  standard  of  living  of  all

Singaporeans   has  improved  tremendously   because   of   full

employment.   As a result, there is no widening of  income  gap,

there  is no widening of social gap, standard of living, and  so

on.  What  we  have today is both a competitive  economy  and  a

cohesive society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, full employment in Singapore is likely to come to

an  end this year.  If you look at the economy today, for  every

Singaporean who is still having a job, I assume  we have  to  be

at  least 1% to 2% more productive  than last year, so  that  we

can still keep our job.  And yet at the same time, the workforce

is  growing,  because every year we have 40,000 to 50,000  young

Singaporeans joining the workforce, maybe 10,000 to 15,000 older

Singaporeans  retiring from the workforce.  So there  is  a  net

growth in the workforce

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>

of  about  1 1/2% to 2%.  In other words, the economy will have  to

grow by  about 3% to 4% every year, in order that everyone of us

who  is  having a job can continue to keep the  job, and at  the

same  time  to  create enough jobs for the new entrants  to  the

workforce.  So we need to have 3% to 4% growth a year.   But  we

are  not going to see 3% to 4% growth this year, and not  likely

next year.  The Government has projected that GDP this year will

grow  at  maybe  between 0.5% and 1.5%.  That will  be  about  2

percentage points or so less than the 3% to 4% needed to sustain

the present level of employment.  Therefore, it is possible that

unemployment rates in Singapore may reach as high as  4%  before

the  end of the year.  And if slow growth were to continue  into

next  year,  then by the end of next year, if we do run  into  a

recession, unemployment may even reach 5% to 7%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I want to highlight here is this. Looking at

the nation, we can talk about unemployment of 4%, 5%, and so on.

But  the  workers, who are unemployed, to them  unemployment  is

100%  when you do not have a job.  It is for this reason that  I

felt   it  is very important that the entire nation, whether  we

are  Government,  unionists or employers, all  Singaporeans,  we

must   come  together to rally the support,  work  united,  stay

united,  and ask ourselves this question: what are the three  to

five  most  important  things  we  have  to  do  together,  work

together, in order to manage and contain  rising unemployment in

the near future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, various ways we can try to regain

full  employment  or to defer unemployment.   Some  people  have

suggested  that since we have a healthy reserve, why  don't   we

spend  more  money - the consumers be given tax incentives,  the

Government  increases the budget.  Then by spending more  money,

hopefully, we can prop up the economy to the 3% to 4% needed  to

sustain full employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a simple calculation. Based on the report I read in

the  newspapers  about leakage through import,  if  we  were  to

increase  consumer spending or government spending  to  increase

GDP growth from 0.5% to 4%, an increase of 3.5

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>

percentage points, we would have to inject an equivalent of   5%

of GDP of spending for  GDP growth to  go up to 4%.  5% out of a

GDP  of $143 billion, as at the  end of last year, works out  to

about  $7  billion,  meaning that we have to  spend  another  $7

billion in the economy to boost the economic growth.   I  called

up  HDB and asked how many flats they can build with $7 billion.

They  said: 61,000 4-room flats.  I called up MOH and asked  how

many  hospitals they can build with $7 billion.  They  said:  20

hospitals with 800 beds each.  I called up the LTA and asked how

many  LRTs they can build with $7 billion.  They said: 14  LRTs,

each one costing $500 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point here is this. $7 billion is a lot of money.

It is easy to talk about spending $7 billion, but by the time we

translate the $7 billion into real goods and services,  then  we

understand.  It is not possible for the Government  or  for  the

people  to  just  throw  $7 billion to building  another  61,000

flats,  another 14 LRTs, another 20 hospitals, just to keep  the

economy  growing, just to defer unemployment.  So  spending  our

way  out of a slowdown is a no-go solution.  Then somebody said,

if  that  is  the  case, why don't  we  send  back  the  foreign

workers?  After all, there are about 450,000 foreign workers  in

Singapore, which is equivalent to about 25% of our workforce  of

1.8 million.  Theoretically speaking, if unemployment were to go

up by 2% to 3% every year, we can just downsize our workforce by

sending back the equivalent number of foreign workers.   So  25%

of  the workforce of foreign workers can defer unemployment,  in

theory, by 10 years, because every year we send back 2.5% of the

workforce.  So we can defer by 10 years.  That sounds very good,

very  attractive.  But if you were to look into the  composition

of the foreign workers, one-third are construction workers; one-third  are  domestic maids; and then how about the  nurses,  how

about the workers who work on shift, the skilled workers working

at wafer fabrication plants and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I come to this guesstimate that if we were to

look at the number of jobs taken by the foreign workers which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>

Singaporean workers are willing to do, are able to do, maybe the

number  is  down to 70,000 or so.  And how long can 70,000  last

us?   My  guess is one year, maybe two years, and after that  we

will  run out of foreign workers to send back.  Then what do  we

do?   Unemployment will still be there.  Then some said, if that

is  the case, it is so difficult to spend the money and to  send

back foreign workers, how about setting up an unemployment fund?

So, again, I did a simple calculation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming unemployment was to rise by 1%, which means 18,000

workers out of a base of 1.8 million, assuming we pay them  $500

a  month,  it will cost the Government $100 million a  year,  at

$500  a  month for each of these retrenched workers.  Then  what

next?   Now  you pay $500, two months later they will come  back

and  say  $500  is not enough, how about $700, how about  $1000?

Also,  do  not  forget, if we do not address the real  issue  of

unemployment, the number will go up, which means over time, what

is going to happen is that Singapore will become a welfare state

whereby  employers say it is okay to retrench because the  State

will take care of them.  The workers will say, "No hurry to find

jobs  because the State will take care of me."  If that  is  the

case, eventually, we are going to go down the tube.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whether spending money, sending back foreign workers

or  setting  up an unemployment fund, in my view,  I  feel  very

strongly  that this should not be the three to five things  that

we  should  be worrying and thinking about at a time like  this.

At  a time like this, the most important thing is to think about

how  we  can  preserve jobs, how we can upgrade  the  skills  of

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to talk about what are the three to

five things I think we can do.  The first thing we need to do is

to  see  in  what way we can minimise unemployment in the  short

term.   There are four ways we can minimise unemployment in  the

short   term.    Firstly,  keep  costs   low;   secondly,   keep

productivity   high;  thirdly,  retrain  rather  than   retrench

workers; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>

lastly,  offer job placement services, employment assistance  to

the  retrenched workers so that we can help them find jobs.   If

you  think  about  it,  this is precisely  what  the  tripartite

partners  are doing - the Government, the unions and  employers.

These are what we have been doing over the last few months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of cost competitiveness, the tripartite

partners  have agreed to go on a wage restraint.  The Government

has  also introduced various cost-cutting measures to reduce the

non-wage  costs.  The tripartite panel on retrenched workers  is

now  working  on things like retrenchment advisory,  encouraging

companies  to  go  for  retraining of  workers  rather  than  to

retrench workers, to go for a shorter work week rather  than  to

downsize  companies.  And at the same time, through  initiatives

like  the Labour Net and Back-to-Work programme, and so  on,  we

are  helping  retrenched workers to find jobs.  All  in  all,  I

think  a lot has been done, and is being done.  However,  if  we

were  to look ahead to the future, a lot more needs to be  done,

because the slow growth that is coming our way is likely to be a

prolonged  one.   And  to  what  extent  we  are  able  to  keep

unemployment  low, I think, depends on whether we  are  able  to

change  our  mindset.  When I said "we", I refer  again  to  the

whole nation, not just the Government, not just the unions,  but

also the employers and the workers.  Let me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the part of the workers, it is important for

our  workers in Singapore to change their mindset towards  jobs.

We  should  never  take full employment for granted;  we  should

never  take  jobs for granted.  At this moment, even  though  we

talk  about  unemployment and slow growth, there are still  many

jobs in Singapore where employers are looking for workers.   But

what  they  are looking for will be workers who are prepared  to

work  in  shifts, prepared to travel the distance to the factory

location and be prepared to upgrade to have the skills to do the

job.   Therefore, for the Singaporean workers, it  is  important

that  at  a  time like this, we should learn to value  jobs  and

learn to change our mindset.  It is all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>

right  to travel a little bit further to the factory; it is  all

right  to  go  on  a  shift  job; it is  all  right  to  go  for

retraining.   But  at  the same time, it is  important  for  the

employers  to change their mindset too.  We have come to  notice

that  many  employers  are still preferring  to  employ  younger

workers.   Any Singaporean worker who is more than 40 years  old

is  considered  as  old.  As a result,  in  the  course  of  job

placement,  we  have come across many situations  whereby  older

workers  who  are more than 40 years old are not  even  able  to

secure interviews.  They are stopped at the factory gates.   The

security guards say that they have received instructions not  to

let  anybody who is more than 40 years old to come  in  for  job

interviews,  not  even  to fill up the  job  application  forms,

because the company is not interested in them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, what we are going through is an aging

population. The workforce is aging.  If every employer  were  to

think that anybody who is more than 40 years old is too old  for

employment,  then  we  are going in for a  very  serious  social

problem.    I think it is important for the employers to  change

their mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area the employers should also change their

mindset is the concept of wage versus productivity.  For  a  few

years  now, at the National Wages Council, we often debate about

this issue of whether wage cost in Singapore is rising too fast.

The very favourite line adopted is that, if you look at the real

wage  of  Singapore  over the last few years,  it  has  exceeded

productivity  gain. Therefore, we are becoming less competitive.

But  I  think there is another way to look at this.  The problem

is not because our wage cost is going up too fast but rather our

productivity  is not going up fast enough.  For many  years,  we

have  been  riding the wave of high growth.  When the growth  is

high, it does not matter what we do, just put in more equipment,

more  people, we achieve high productivity.  But at a time  like

this and looking ahead in the future, I think the challenge  for

Singapore  is  how  to be able to produce more  with  less,  ie,

produce  more output with less equipment, less technology,  less

workers.   The concept is known as the Total Factor Productivity

(TFP).   It is at a time like this that we must bite the  bullet

and ask

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>

ourselves:  have we done enough all these years to  improve  the

TFP  in  Singapore and, if not, what more can we do?   Deferring

the  problem is not the solution because the environment of  the

future will change, and become even more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the part of the unions, we need to change our

mindset too.  We have to change our mindset to one of to be pro-worker, we have to be pro-business.  If we are not pro-business,

companies  cannot  grow  and cannot be profitable.   Eventually,

workers  will  suffer because either they do not get  good  wage

increase or they may even lose their jobs.  In this regard, I am

pleased to say that the labour movement in Singapore takes pride

in  being  one  of  the  first in the  world  to  adopt  such  a

progressive view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the NTUC has formulated NTUC 21 in April 1997, and

that was before we were hit by the slow growth.  Under NTUC  21,

we  have  made  a  formal declaration that  we  do  take  shared

responsibility towards the competitiveness of the companies  and

enhancing  the  life-long employability of the  workers.   Right

now,  the unions affiliated to NTUC are  formulating their Union

21  plan to see how the labour movement can add value, not  just

to the workers, but also to the economy and the employers.  This

is something we will continue to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how about on the part of the Government? The

Government  should also think about changing the mindset  in  at

least  two  areas.  The first area is in the area of  employment

assistance.   For  many years, employment assistance  has  never

been  an issue because we have full employment.  But if you look

ahead  in  the  future, we should not take it for  granted  that

workers will always have jobs, not because there are not  enough

jobs  to go around, but because of the mismatch either in  terms

of  skills, age or location.   I think it is important  for  the

Government  to  give  this  whole idea of  employment  placement

services  higher  priority  and to think  in  what  way  we  can

strengthen and enhance the system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I hope the Government agencies will

consider  to change their mindset is an issue which I  discussed

at  the  last Budget debate.  In the business world, competition

is  so  keen that companies have changed over the years  from  a

cost-plus  mentality  to a price-minus  mentality.   Instead  of

looking at what is the cost of production of goods and services,

add  a   profit  margin and become the selling price,  companies

basically look at the market and customers and see what they can

afford to bear.  From there, they work backwards to see how much

they  need to  lower their cost of production so that  they  can

meet  the  price  set  by the market and at  the  same  time  be

profitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an area I hope the various Government agencies will

seriously  think  about because, in the  next  few  years,  wage

increase  will  be  fairly moderated.  Some workers  may  become

jobless,  and I think they will be concerned about the  cost  of

living,  and so on.  At the same time, many companies  are  also

concerned  about  the  cost  of doing  business.   Sir,  I  hope

Government  agencies can think about how they can also  adopt  a

price-minus  mentality.   Look  at  the  marketplace   and   the

competition we are facing and ask what kind of prices, what kind

of  cost  level  can the business community and members  of  the

public  bear,  and  is  there  any way  the  various  Government

agencies  can  offer  the service without  compromising  on  the

quality  of service and, yet, at the same time, be able to  meet

the pricing target.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which the Government may want to think about

is this.  When we talk about the CPF cut being  the last resort,

the  question which many people ask is: what does it mean by "as

a  last  resort"?  We have asked companies, for example, in  the

manufacturing  sector, what are their major  cost  items.   They

said,  "Yes,  wages are important.  But foreign worker  levy  is

another major cost item.  Industrial land, factory rentals,  and

so on, are all major cost items."  Sir, is it not possible that,

before  we  talk about the CPF cut, the Government  could  think

about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>

whether there is any way it can lower non-wage  cost in terms of

foreign  worker levy?  I understand of course that, on  the  one

hand,  if we were to lower the foreign worker levy too much,  it

may  actually  make  the  Singaporean  workers  less  attractive

compared to the foreign workers.  But, yet, at the same time, if

we  do not lower the foreign worker levy, employers will keep on

looking  at  the  CPF  cut and other wage  cuts  to  make  their

operations more viable.  Therefore, is it not possible for us to

think through this issue ?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we assume that every factory will have some foreign

workers  because  of shortage of workers in  Singapore  and,  in

order not to encourage employers to retrench Singaporean workers

and  replace them with foreign workers, why can't  we  have, for

example, a three-tier foreign worker levy?  For the first  tier,

anybody who employs less than 20% of the workforce, in terms  of

foreign  workers, will pay a very low foreign worker  levy,  and

for  the  next 20%, he has to pay much more, and the  next  10%,

from  40% to 50%, he will have to pay a lot more.  In this  way,

we  help to lower the cost for the businesses and, yet,  at  the

same  time, we do not encourage companies to replace Singaporean

workers with foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of land and buildings, again, we have discussed

several  times before in this House whether it is  possible  for

the  Government to review land pricing policy and make  it  more

predictable  because,  today, it is not predictable.   Companies

are told that their land lease can be revised up to 7.6% a year.

Up  to  7.6%, it is very difficult for any company to plan their

business.  They will never know whether they will be charged  1%

increase  or  7.6% increase.  So they are asking  for  something

more  predictable.  Is it 3%?  Is it 4%?  It should be something

more  predictable.   How about something  more  responsive  too?

Their  view is that when the market is good, the rental goes  up

very  fast.  When the market is down, the rental comes down very

slowly, because Government agencies say that the rental today is

still  below market rate and therefore they are not entitled  to

any adjustment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, intensive use of industrial land. We talk about

how  we  can  encourage  companies  to  intensify  the  use   of

industrial lands which are very expensive in Singapore. We  talk

about reviewing the differential premiums, and so on, but to the

best of my knowledge, nothing has been done.  Sir, my point here

is  that,  in  the  past, when the economy was doing  well,  the

business sector could afford to bear some of these higher costs.

But  at  a  time like this, and looking to the next  few  years,

every  dollar we can help them to save, we should  do  our  very

best.   I  hope the Government agencies can really  think  about

adopting a new mindset like moving away from a cost-plus towards

the price-minus mindset, and ask the business community what  it

can  bear  and  what they can do to achieve that kind  of  price

target.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I talk about all these issues, I look at them in

a  very positive sense.   I believe that we in Singapore are  in

the  best  position to contain rising unemployment.  The  reason

why  we are in the best position is that Singapore is not a  low

cost location.  If today we are a low cost location, how low can

we go?  But since we are not a low cost location, there is still

a  lot of room for us to adjust lower the cost of doing business

in  Singapore.  At the end of the day, the extent  to  which  we

will  be able to contain unemployment  depends a lot on  whether

the workers  are able to change their mindset towards jobs,  the

employers towards older workers and  Government towards the cost

structure   in   Singapore.   Having  talked  about   minimising

unemployment in the short term, I think that is only the  short-term measure and that, in itself, will not be sufficient to  see

Singapore  through this crisis.  Because by the time the  crisis

is  over,  we  are going to find ourselves in a  very  different

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to highlight five trends which are

unstoppable.   Like  it or not, they are already  happening  and

they  will  continue to evolve.  Of these five trends,  two  are

within the region.  The first is the realignment of the regional

currencies.   Because  of  the crisis,  the  Singapore  currency

dropped by 15% to 17%, while the regional currencies dropped  by

35% to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>

84%  in the case of Indonesia.  By the time the crisis is  over,

we  are  going  to  see a complete realignment of  the  regional

currencies.   What  it  means is that these countries  vis-a-vis

Singapore will be about two to five times more cost competitive.

So  that  is  the first trend we have to accept.  It is  already

happening and there is nothing we can do to stop it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second trend is the potential threat of rising

protectionism  in the region.  In the last couple  of  years  in

particular,  we  are  beginning to see very intense  competition

within  the  region,  within ASEAN, for example.   We  have  our

airport,  we  have our  seaport.  They also want to  have  their

airport and seaport.  Ours is big.  They want to be bigger,  and

so on.  But competition is not what I am talking about.  What  I

am  talking  about is,  that  the competition is  turning   into

unhealthy  competition, and unhealthy competition leads  to  all

kinds of protectionistic measures.  This is something we have to

be concerned about.  When the countries in the region forget how

to think win-win and  start to think win-lose, at the end of the

day, it is going to end up lose-lose for all of us.  And we have

to think about what should be our response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two trends are more global. Firstly, it is the

whole  issue of globalisation.  With globalisation of technology

and  market,  and  so  on, companies are now  moving  towards  a

horizontal division of labour, meaning that they will  start  to

deploy  their complete value chain all across Europe, US,  North

America  and Asia.  What this means is that there will  be  more

opportunities  for us to strengthen our economic strength.   But

yet, at the same time, it also means that there will be stronger

and keener competition for these opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other global trend is technology. Technology is

moving  faster and faster.  The good news is that,  with  faster

change  in technology, it means we have more room to move ahead.

But  the bad news is that we can only continue to ride the  wave

of technology provided we are able to quicken the pace of change

in  Singapore  as well to be able to learn new knowledge  faster

and sooner.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last trend is more domestic, the issue of an aging

population.  With  a  longer  lifespan  of  people  and  shorter

lifespan of technology, the  issue of employability will  become

more acute in the future.  So given this new environment that we

are  already  in which will only get more intense, in  terms  of

competition,  pace  of change, and so on,  there  are  basically

three scenarios for Singapore in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scenario is one of unemployment. The second

scenario  is  one  of  structural unemployment,  and  the  third

scenario  is  full  employment.  If we are not  able  to  remain

competitive in this new economic reality, then obviously we will

be heading for unemployment forever.  If we are competitive, but

we  are not able to upgrade the workforce, retrain the workforce

fast   enough,   then   we   are  heading   towards   structural

unemployment.  But if we are able to do both, to be  competitive

and  at the same time ensure the employability of the workforce,

then   of  course  we  have  a  chance  to  head   towards  full

employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before the crisis, I was very sure that we were

moving  from full employment to structural unemployment  because

we could observe that we were beginning to have many bad habits,

whether  it  was in the economy or in the society.  Workers  did

not  take training seriously and employers had no time to  worry

about how to train the workforce for the future.  Because of all

this,  it  was  very  clear to me that many of  our  new  growth

sectors in Singapore will increasingly depend on foreign skilled

workers,  foreign talents.  If you look at the wafer fabrication

plants,  tomorrow if we were to stop foreign talents and foreign

workers from coming in, all our plants would have to close shop.

It  is  good  in  a  way.  It is good that we are  hit  by  this

slowdown.   Because with this slowdown, it gives us a chance  to

reflect  on what has happened to the Singapore economy over  the

last  five  to  10 years and where are the dangers and  pitfalls

that  we  may be trapped in and, therefore, what action  we  can

take at a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>

time  like this  to correct these  mistakes and, hopefully, come

out of this slowdown stronger and better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are three areas I would like to propose as

must-do  for  discussion  - competitiveness,  employability  and

national  unity.   The first must-do for the  long  term  is  to

enhance the competitiveness of Singapore.  We have many domestic

sectors  that, over the years, have continued to enjoy very  low

productivity.  Take, for example, the retail sector.   Everybody

knows  that  the retail sector is not doing well  and  everybody

knows  that there is a surplus of players.  Too many players  in

the  market which is not growing fast enough.  And, yet, at  the

same  time, the pace of restructure and upgrading, for  example,

in the retail sector is way too slow.

I  would  like to quote an example of New York city.   New  York

city  was  in a hard time in 1990/1991 because of the recession.

In fact, companies were closing, workers were retrenched and the

retail  sector almost came to a standstill.  On Christmas  week,

the  whole shopping mall was empty.  But today, if you go to New

York city, things have changed.  Is it because they have no more

competition?   It is not quite true.  In New York city,  if  you

are prepared to drive half an hour out of the city to Queens and

so  on,  you  will  be able to find many factory  outlets.   The

factory  outlets sell the same goods that you can  find  in  the

city  but  maybe  30-40% cheaper.  That is why  they  call  them

factory  outlets.  Yet, many people, whether local or  tourists,

are  still prepared to pay a premium and shop in the city.   Why

is  this so?  It is because they have managed to restructure and

upgrade.  They have managed to change mindsets, from quantity to

quality.   Macys  used to be the largest shopping  mall  in  the

world.   They are successful because they are big.   Anything  a

person  wants to buy, he can find it there.  But today,  in  New

York  city, they cannot operate on the basis of just having more

stock  items on the shelf.  This does not bring them  customers.

It is the value added service that they talk about.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point here is this. When can we start to get some

of  our domestic retailers  to change their mindset?  Things are

going  to  be  difficult over the next few years.  Just  to  sit

there,  sit  tight and do nothing is not going to  do  them  any

good.  Can we find ways of helping the domestic retail sector to

upgrade  and  to  grow again, help them to shift their  mindset,

from  quantity to quality, from hardware to software?   Hardware

means  just  more  goods and more people and software  is  value

added services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is to create new jobs in new growth

sectors.   Many of the jobs which we are losing today  will  not

come  back  to  Singapore forever.  For  example,  the  consumer

electronics  sector has been downsizing and the  jobs  that  are

going away will not come back.  Why should they come back?   Two

or three years from now when the market is back, if they look at

the  cost  structure in Singapore vis-a-vis the region,  we  are

going to be so much more expensive, as I mentioned earlier,  due

to  the realignment of the regional currencies.  So what we have

to  do is to look for new growth sectors and areas where we  can

compete  based  on our new capabilities.  For example,  analogue

consumer electronics is going down.  But that does not  mean  we

should  give  up  consumer electronics, because  after  analogue

consumer  electronics,  there  is  this  thing  called   digital

consumer   electronics.   Since   we  are  not  competitive   in

analogue, why  not go for digital?  Why  not start building  the

infrastructure, the capability and go for this new  product  and

new services in the future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about building new capabilities? In the 60s and 70s,

when  we went through the process of industrialisation,  we  did

not  have  any  market  in  Singapore.   We  did  not  have  any

technology in Singapore.  What did we do?  What we did not have,

we  borrowed.  So we went  to the MNCs and we brought  them  in.

We  did  not  have a market.  We borrowed their  market.   As  a

result,  MNCs exported out of Singapore.  In a way, we  borrowed

their global market.  We did not have technology.  So we brought

in their know-how in processes, products and applications into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.   So  by borrowing their technology, borrowing  their

market  and by creating a conducive environment for mass  volume

production, we were able to earn a living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question is, in the future, given the five global

trends  which  I  mentioned earlier, is it possible  for  us  to

continue  to earn a living by borrowing technology and borrowing

markets  from the global players?  I do not think so.   I  think

what we have to do, looking ahead in the future, is to move away

from  a  cost  containment  strategy  to  a  revenue  generation

strategy.  Revenue generation means: can we try to create  value

out  of technology, out of ideas, out of markets, for the global

players?   It means: can we offer a platform in Singapore  which

will  have the integrated capabilities in technology development

through R&D, in innovation development, being able to design new

products, new processes, new applications, new services, be able

to do market development, help them to create markets in Asia or

in  cyberspace, the new market that we talk about in the future?

If  we  are able to do so, then I think the future for Singapore

will  continue to be a bright one, because we will  be  able  to

differentiate  ourselves and become an  integrated  hub  in  the

knowledge-based economy of the future.  This is the second  area

where I think we can do a lot more and a lot faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is to strengthen our position as a global

hub  in the Asia Pacific.  The idea of a global hub is not  new.

In fact, in Singapore, we started off as a global hub in the 60s

and  70s.   What  we  did was to become  a  global  hub  in  the

industrialisation   age,   eg,   airport,   seaport,   for   the

transportation  and distribution of goods.  In  that  sense,  we

helped  to  link the region (ASEAN) to the global  economy.   We

became  the gateway and, as a result, it was win-win.   But  the

unfortunate  thing  is this.  After so many  years  of  win-win,

instead of thanking us for contributing to this linkage  to  the

global  hub,  we are accused of stealing things  away  from  our

neighbour.  But it does not matter what other people  say  about

us.  I think at the end of the day, what we have to continue  to

pursue is the strategy of global linkage.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>

For  the  simple reason, in the competitive world of the future,

the  strength  of any economy is not what you  are  able  to  do

within  a country.  It is not the strength of the location  that

really  counts.   In  the  future, what  will  really  make  the

difference  to  the  competitiveness of  any  location  is  your

ability to strengthen  the network capability, whether you  have

the network of resources, expertise, markets, that will make the

difference,  meaning that in the future world, we are  going  to

compete on a network basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of Singapore, we have come this far in

becoming a global hub in the industrialisation age.  I think our

next target, our next challenge, must be to become a global  hub

in  the information economy of the future.  And how can this  be

done?   I  am  optimistic  that this can  be  done.   Take,  for

example, in the area of IT.  Today, Singapore is one of the best

computerised  nations  in  the world.  Our  infrastructure  like

Singapore One, for example, is one of the best in the world, one

of  the most leading infrastructures in the world.  In terms  of

our legal framework, we have  the Electronic Transactions Act in

place.    What  we  have  to  do  is  to  capitalise   on   this

infrastructure, this capability, which we have built   over  the

last  17-20 years and then to link ourselves to the rest of  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just think for a moment, if today we can find 10 leading

cities  of the world which are very advanced in the area of  IT,

whether  they are in the US, Europe, Japan or Asia Pacific.   If

each  one of them were to contribute, let us say, 100,000  users

of broadband multi-media services, then what can be done will be

for  Singapore  to link up with these 10 leading cities  of  the

world.   And  together, we would have created  what  we  call  a

global   information  infrastructure  (GII),   the   information

infrastructure  of the future, to support broadband  multi-media

interactive  applications and yet cut across  the  world,  North

America, Europe, Asia Pacific.  And when that happens, Singapore

will  be  a  very key node and integral hub in the  GII  of  the

future.  So by the time the region is ready to go for electronic

commerce and so on,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>

they  can  then,  like in the old days, link  through  this  GII

through Singapore.  In this way, we will be able to continue  to

perform  our role as a global hub in the Asia Pacific by helping

the  region  to  link  up with the information  economy  of  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the area of competitiveness, if I may summarise, I

am   basically  saying  that we have to move  our  mindset  from

competing on the basis of cost competitiveness to a new basis of

capability  competitiveness,  and there  is  a  big  difference.

Being cost competitive means that I do not have to be as good as

you,  but  as long as I am so much cheaper than you, I am  still

more  cost competitive.  But to be capability competitive  means

that we must aspire to be as good as the best in the world,  and

that is what I am talking about.  At a time like this, we should

really  think  about how  we can make use of this  lull  period,

this spare capacity that we have in the economy, turn it into an

investment for the future, so that we can come out as  the  best

in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The must-do at a time like this is to maximise

employability.  I think enough has been said about the  issue of

structural unemployment.  So I do not intend to repeat the whole

issue again, but all I want to say is that in Singapore, we  are

in   the  best  position  to  tackle  the  issue  of  structural

unemployment,   better  than  most  other  countries.   This  is

because  we have always believed in in-employment training.   We

set  up the Skills Development Fund way back in 1979, almost  20

years  ago.    And because of the SDF mechanism,  we  have  been

retraining/upgrading our workers all these years and that is the

reason  why  today  we  have one of the  most  cost  competitive

workforce in the world.  What we have to recognise now  is  that

the  future will be so different from the past and therefore  we

have   to  recognise  that  the  present  system  of  continuing

education  through SDF may not be enough for us  to  tackle  the

issue of structural unemployment.  And what we need is to set up

a new national system for continuing education and training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we need to set up a new national framework for

skills certification.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>

Companies  today  are  coming  to  Singapore  to  set   up   new

operations.  So they want to train their workers.  They want  to

skill  certify their workers.  But some of them found  out  that

the  skill  courses that they want to certify their workers  are

either  not available in Singapore or the skills system  is  not

well  defined in Singapore yet.  As a result, they are not  able

to  proceed  in a systematic way of training the workforce.   So

there  are  gaps  in the skills certification system.   In  that

regard,  the  Government's announcement on the  national  skills

recognition system is a most timely move.  We hope that  quicker

progress  can be made and we hope that the Government  will  set

some  specific  timeframe  for the expansion  of  this  national

skills recognition system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a national skills recognition system is not enough

because what we have is a system on paper.  We have to turn this

system  on paper into reality, which means we have to set  up  a

nation-wide  training infrastructure.  We have  to  upgrade  our

capabilities in CET.  We have to expand our capacity in CET.  In

this  regard, we are very happy that the Government has  decided

to  set  up  the first full-time training centre for  continuing

education  by converting the ITE at Bukit Merah into a full-time

training centre.  I think this is something very strategic.   It

is  something that would pave the way for the evolution of a new

national training infrastructure for CET.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we do not stop at the

Institute  of  Higher Learning (IHL).  We should  encourage  the

private sector to take on that shared responsibility.  Take, for

example,  in the electronic sector, they have a training  centre

co-funded  by  the  Government and the  industry  known  as  the

Electronic  Industry Training Centre.  This Training  Centre  is

performing  a  very  important role in the  present  process  of

retraining  our workers, and we believe that the  same  concept,

the same idea, can be expanded to all the other sectors, whether

they  are  in manufacturing or in services.  And if  we  can  do

that,  then  over  time  we may be able to  set  up  a  training

infrastructure, a training network, linking up both the  IHL  as

well as the training centre in the industry and, in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>

some  cases, for the larger employers who may even have in-house

training centres.   I hope the Government will consider  setting

up  a  formal mechanism to co-fund this kind of training centres

in the industry and in the companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can have the facilities, we can have the

certification in place, but at the end of the day,  we  have  to

mobilise  the workers for this training.  I think the  NTUC  and

the  employers' federation can play an important role.  Overall,

we  estimated  that  there  are  580,000  unskilled  workers  in

Singapore.   It will take quite some time for us to retrain  not

necessarily  all  of them but, hopefully, as  many  of  them  as

possible.   As I say, we believe that we, in Singapore,  are  in

the  best  position to address this, because  the  direction  is

clear, the resources are there and the tripartism spirit is very

strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if we were to strengthen our competitiveness

and enhance our employability, that still does not mean that  we

can  have full employment.  Because, at the end of the  day,  it

all  depends on how we are able to link up the two efforts,  how

we  are  able  to synchronise and derive synergy  from  the  two

efforts.   In   the  OECD countries, in the  case  of  USA,  for

example,  they  discovered  that even  though  the   economy  is

competitive,  even though  they are doing a lot to  retrain  the

workers,   yet, they cannot escape from structural unemployment.

The  conclusion is that the linkage between the two  efforts  is

not strong enough.

Sir,   my  suggestion  is  that the manpower  agencies  and  the

economic agencies have to work very closely together.  Take  one

example.  Today, we have workers who are now prepared to go  for

retraining   because   of   the  crisis,   because   of   rising

unemployment.   They are prepared to go for  three  months,  six

months  or  one  year of retraining in order to secure  new  and

better  jobs  in the new growth sectors.  But our  challenge  is

that, if tomorrow, 5,000 workers are prepared to go through  the

process of retraining, do we know in what area do we train  them

for?  My point here is that we need the economic agencies to  be

more  specific in identifying employment opportunities over  the

next

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>

1-3  years  and  be able to, as far as possible, give  an  early

projection.  This is because retraining of workers  has  a  long

lead time, at least six months, if not one to two years.  If  we

are  not  able  to  have early information on  where  these  job

opportunities are coming from, it is very difficult  for  us  to

retrain the workers, because by the time we retrain them,  again

they are going to miss the boat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my point here is that, as a strategic intent, I should

say  it  is  a  national  challenge, to  systematically  migrate

workers  from the declining sector into the new growth  sectors.

If  we can do that, and do that in sufficient numbers, then I am

confident  that Singapore can be one of the first  countries  in

the world to avoid structural unemployment.  Again, I am hopeful

because  today we have Manpower 21 and we have the Committee  on

Singapore's Competitiveness.  What we have to do is to  link  up

the two into something more tangible and actionable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, for the long term, besides strengthening

competitiveness  and employability, we need  to  strengthen  our

national  unity.  The crisis   is something  we  did   not  wish

for,   but  it  has  happened.   It  is  actually  a  very  rare

opportunity if we look at it positively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I talked about competitiveness and employability,

which  basically  is  to  strengthen and  enhance  the  economic

stakes  of  Singaporeans in the Singapore of  the  future.   The

question  is this:  is this also a great opportunity for  us  to

enhance  and strengthen the emotional stakes of Singaporeans  in

the Singapore of the future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking about this in the last one year or so,

since  the  launch  of  the Singapore 21  Committee  chaired  by

Minister Teo Chee Hean.  There is a lot of discussion about  the

people  sector.  In fact, Minister Teo coined the  term  "people

sector" as against the private sector and public sector, which I

thought was a very exciting idea.  The question is: how  can  we

make  use  of  this  opportunity as a way for us  to  strengthen

heartware  and nurture an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>

active  people sector?  Take, for example, between  the  private

sector  and the public sector.  We often have this public debate

-   the  private  sector  will say the public  sector  does  not

understand  that  the  rain is really pouring,  and  the  public

sector  will  say  the private sector does not  understand  that

government   cannot bail out companies.  So there is  a  lot  of

debate and disagreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own observation is that in a way we have to recognise

and  accept that different business sectors have different  cost

structures.   So  one  solution which may be  relevant  to  some

sectors may not be relevant to the other sectors.  Up till  now,

what  we  have  been trying to do is to come out with  a  common

solution  which  will be common to all sectors.   As  a  result,

there  is  this  mismatch between the solution  and  the  needs.

Maybe  one  possibility  as a way of strengthening  this  active

partnership between the public sector and the private sector  is

for  the  private  sector  to do a proper  analysis.   Can  they

analyse  better what is their cost structure, put out a stronger

case  to  explain their position better, and in what way certain

measures  can help them more than what is being done today?   If

we  can  go through a process of consultation and collaboration,

exchange  of  views  and debate the views,  then  hopefully  the

public  sector and the private sector can come closer  together.

At  the same time, how about the people sector?  Again, we  talk

about the active citizenship of the people sector.  This can  be

done.   At a  time like this, why do we not encourage the people

of   Singapore   to  come  forward  with  their   creative   and

constructive  ideas on how we, as a nation, can go through  this

crisis and come out stronger?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to make use of this opportunity in the right

way,  the  Government  can  make  use  of  this  opportunity  to

encourage  active  citizenship from the people  sector  and  the

private sector, which is what Singapore 21 was set up to do.  At

the  same  time,  the people sector and the private  sector,  by

being responsible and constructive, can also gain the confidence

of  the  Government  that  effective participation  of  the  3Ps

(people, public and private sectors) can actually

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>

lead  to a greater trust, greater respect and, most importantly,

greater  sense  of  ownership of all the national  policies  and

issues.   At the end of the day, I think it can be done  because

we  have Singapore 21, where the message is very clear.  What we

have  to do is to quickly seize this opportunity so that we  can

stay united at a time of crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that we have got to

where  we  are  here today since 1965 from a no-hope  situation.

But  today, we are getting to Singapore 21, not only not from  a

no-hope  situation, but actually we are getting there  from  the

best-hope  situation.   After  all  these  30  years  of  nation

building,  now  we  have a competitive economy  and  a  cohesive

society.   Our  challenge is - if we can do it right,  not  only

will  we  be  able to minimise unemployment in the  short  term,

maximise  our  competitiveness and employability  for  the  long

term, but  more importantly, we should be able to strengthen the

emotional stakes of Singaporeans in Singapore 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I beg to move the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  every businessman has been saying time is bad and everyone

agrees  that  it  will  be worse. Every day  when  we  read  the

newspapers and listen to the news, we learn that  more and  more

companies are winding up and many workers are retrenched.  It is

getting  from  bad  to worse.  More and more people  are  losing

their  jobs.  We also hear a lot of grumblings from the  people.

Some companies have simply closed down and the workers lamented,

"Retrenched today, no more job for me tomorrow!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen are grumbling, "The banks are most merciless,

they  keep  on  pressing us for payments."   In June this  year,

the  Government  announced  the  off-Budget  measures  where  $2

billion  were  pumped  in to bring forward the  construction  of

infrastructure,  and   to  help the businessmen  tide  over  the

difficult times.  But they say that the Government is not  doing

enough.  More rebates should be given.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans who are yet to be retrenched are

worried  that  they would be retrenched. They are  worried  that

once  their CPF contribution is reduced, they will have problems

servicing  their housing loans.  With all these worries,   their

confidence  is lost.  So at this time when we are threatened  by

this regional financial crisis we should pull ourselves together

and  face  the problem together.  In the short term,  we  should

minimise  unemployment and in the long  term  we  will  have  to

improve  our competitiveness.  To attain these targets,  whether

you are the employer, employee  or Government, you must first of

all  have  confidence and the determination to face the problems

squarely  and  work out long-term strategies to  strengthen  our

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall elaborate on the roles of the employers, employees

and  the  Government.  First, let us talk about  the  employers.

When  this financial crisis came all of a sudden, many companies

were caught off-guard.  When business is bad, they try ways  and

means  to  cut cost and  resort to downsizing their  operations.

In  many  circumstances, our employers still have a heart.  They

would discuss with the union representatives and arrange for the

workers  to undergo  retraining so that they can cross  over  to

the  high-tech   industries and command  higher wages.   We  say

that  the bosses do have a heart.  An accountant friend of  mine

who  works  in  an advertising company said that this  year  the

company's business was reduced by 70% and most of the  time  the

staff  had nothing to do.   The management then  discussed  with

the  staff and they all agreed that in order to keep their  jobs

and  stay  employed, they accepted a  wage cut,  and   they  are

allowed to take on part-time jobs outside.  So they retain  good

employer-employee relationship,  the company could  continue  to

survive  and  they  have employees who have developed  a  strong

sense of belonging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the unions affiliated to NTUC are working hand in hand

with  companies  affected  by this downturn.   The  workers  are

either on shorter work week or temporarily laid off or attending

the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, employees who are retrenched are not

confined to ordinary workers in the manufacturing sector and the

service  industry.   Many  managers and company  executives  are

given  the  golden  handshake.  Even CEOs and  General  Managers

could be retrenched.  There are, in fact, more and more cases of

this nature. These managers and executives are neither here  nor

there. It is difficult for them to secure alternative jobs. Some

of  them  have  to  maintain  their parents  and  support  their

families, with  housing loans and car loans to service, and lots

of other financial commitments.  They are prepared to work - any

kind  of  work! So long as they can get a job, they are prepared

to  accept any salary.   But the employers  say these people are

over-qualified,  they are very demanding and will not stay  long

in  the  job.  So they do not even get a chance to go  into  the

interview  room.   A 51 year-old manager told  me  that  he  had

attended  ten  interviews, and had  written  lots  of   letters.

Every  time  he attended an  interview, he could tell  from  the

expression of the interviewers that he did not stand  a  chance.

He  lamented,  "If I do not go, I will have no opportunity.  But

if I go, I do not stand a chance.  It is all the same."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Government is the biggest employer. The

Government  should   take a leading role.   In  some  Government

departments where there are a lot of backlogs to clear, let some

of these retrenched executives and managers be employed to clear

the work.  They have the  management experience and expertise to

take on these jobs.

<br><br><i>Employees face the reality</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that all good things in life do not last

forever. If you say this a  few years ago, not many people would

believe in it.  There used to be long queues to buy the million-dollar  apartments  and  long queues to  buy  club  memberships.

There were long queues everywhere  because people believed  that

where  there was a queue, there was opportunity to make  profits

and amass a lot of money.   With

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>

this  trend developing,  many people were using future money  to

buy  things that they do not need, just to impress others.  When

the  financial crisis hits Singapore, we all realise  that  good

things  in life really do not last forever.   We have to tighten

our belts.  It is a blessing in disguise because it makes people

more  realistic  and  they begin to realise  the  importance  of

upgrading themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, I participated in a dialogue session on

foreign  talents and a young lady told me that the  taxi  driver

who drove her to the dialogue session spoke very good English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found out from him that he was working as a manager and

was retrenched.  Since he spoke such good English, why should he

work  as a taxi driver?  We should find a better job for him.  I

said,  "Well,  there are many taxi drivers who speak  very  good

English.  It does not mean that if one speaks good English,  one

should not be driving a taxi."  I actually admire the courage of

this  ex-manager  who dared to   take up  this  job  of  a  taxi

driver.   He is being realistic.  He grabs a job first and  then

looks  for something better.  Actually driving a taxi is  not  a

bad  thing.  I know of many taxi drivers who drive taxis in  the

day  time and at night time they enjoy themselves by singing  in

the Teochew opera troupe.  In the day time they work hard but at

night  they  go about enjoying themselves by doing  things  they

enjoy doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many retrenched workers are working as taxi

drivers.   Even  those who are not retrenched as yet,  are  also

working as taxi drivers, just in case they are retrenched  later

on. So it is good to have such a sense of crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singaporeans should try to upgrade themselves at

all  times and get better trained to ensure their employability.

In  the  past, we said, "A skill in hand brings you benefit  the

whole  life long."  But now with technologies advancing all  the

time,  your  skill may soon become obsolete when the  technology

you  are  familiar  with is  replaced by new  technologies.   In

order  to  avoid  unemployment, you will have  to  possess  many

skills in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>

hand  so  that  you can be employed all the time.   I  urge  all

Singaporeans  to  have  this  habit  of  lifelong  training  and

participate in the training courses provided by the NTUC and the

various self-help bodies so as to ensure lifelong employability.

<br><br><i>Foreign talents</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the policy of attracting foreign talents.

In  recent years, the Government has been attracting  a  lot  of

foreign  talents  to help in our economic development.   Foreign

talents can be divided into three categories. The first category

of foreign talents are the specialists like the R&D researchers,

the computer experts, the medical specialists, etc. which we  do

not  have.   The  second  category of foreign  talents  are  the

teachers  and nurses, etc., the type of people we are short  of.

These professions were very shorthanded in the past and not many

people  like  to be nurses, but recently there was a  change  in

mind.   This  year, for the first time, Nanyang Polytechnic  has

full  enrolment  for the nursing course.   I  think  it  is  not

because people change their mindset about being a nurse  but  it

is because of the changing circumstances.  The third category of

foreign  talents are those who are recruited to  undertake  jobs

which  Singaporeans  do not wish to do,  such  as  bus  drivers,

construction  workers, etc.  I understand  that  among  our  bus

drivers  in Singapore, some 40% are foreign workers.   We  issue

work  permits for people to do these jobs which Singaporeans  do

not wish to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When discussing the policy of attracting foreign talents

to  come  to   Singapore, everyone supports the idea of  getting

these  foreign  talents here to strengthen our  economy  and  to

enhance our competitiveness.  But now with the economic slowdown

when  many  people  are  losing  their  jobs,  many  people  are

complaining.   They say, "Why are we allowing  so  many  foreign

talents  to come here?  Why are they called `talents'?   Are  we

not  talents ourselves?  Why don't you employ us?"  In order  to

improve  our economy, to increase our competitiveness,  yes,  we

have  to employ foreign workers but we must also look after  our

Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>

The  famous  poet Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty said, "Everyone  is

born  a  talent.   I have my own niche."  I must emphasise  here

that  everyone is a talent, even a taxi driver is a talent.   So

we  must  make  good  use of talents and try  not  to  have  the

mismatch of talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest that the Government's policy on

the attraction of foreign talent be more transparent.  We should

let  everybody  know  that in each industry  what  are  the  job

opportunities  available every year.  How many Singaporeans  can

we absorb and how many foreign talents do we need to absorb?  At

the  same  time, employers who are applying for work permits  or

professional passes should consider employing locals, especially

the  retrenched  middle management people and executives.   Only

when we run out of these local talents, then can work permits be

issued  to  foreign workers.  The Government should also give  a

projection as to what are the jobs available, what can  be  done

by  locals  and  what  are the vacancies that  we  need  foreign

talents to fill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already had the Retrenchment Advisory

Scheme and the Employment Assistance Scheme.  I suggest that the

Ministry of Manpower  publish the statistics of  how many people

have  applied for jobs and what are the job vacancies available.

Give  some  illustrations to let our people  know  what  is  the

success  rate  of  our  job  matching  efforts.   I  suggest  we

consider  allowing  the  middle  management  executives  to   be

registered  too,  because  nowadays there  are  so  many  middle

management people or company executives who are retrenched.   At

the  moment,  many  employers do not wish to  employ  the  older

workers because they  feel that these people are more demanding.

In  fact, many people have lowered their expectations.  A friend

of  mine  was  suddenly retrenched.  He told  me  that  when  he

returned  home  with  the  news of his  retrenchment,  he  asked

members  of  his family, "So, what am I going to do  now?"   The

wife replied, "No problem.  Let us dismiss our foreign maid.  We

can save about $700 a month."  Then the daughter said, "Well,  I

will give private tuition."  The son said, " I am in  national

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>

service.   During  the weekends, I can do some part-time  jobs."

Now,  he  has taken a new job which requires him to  do  typing,

filing and all sorts of odd chores, and  he is earning only  one

quarter of what  he used to earn.  But he said, "Never mind.   I

will  carry on.   I will work hard and I shall survive."  So  it

is  only  in  times of difficulty that you realize how  precious

your family is to you.  The family gives him the support he much

needed.    For  the time being, he may not be able to  meet  the

payments such as income tax, PUB charges, housing loans, etc.  I

think the Government should be more sympathetic - allow them  to

defer payment or even to pay by instalments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the cost of doing business. We all

know  that  in  recent  years, our wage cost  has  already  been

adjusted.   The  Ministers  and top civil  servants  have  their

salaries cut.   Civil servants have their bonuses reduced.  Many

private  companies  are implementing the wage restraint  policy.

Since  the 1990s the property prices have gone up by about 300%.

There  is a chain reaction.  For example, in a coffeeshop  which

is tendered for millions of dollars, a chicken rice stall has to

pay  rental of $3,000 to $4,000 a month.   So let us think about

it.  How many plates of chicken rice has the stall-keeper got to

sell  in order to just pay his rent?  I hope that the Government

will give these property owners more rebates and we must see  to

it  that  their tenants share these rebates.  Many  tenants  are

telling  me that up to now, they have not enjoyed any  of  these

rebates that the owners are getting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays we have a lot of open-bidding exercises, for land

sale,  for  COEs,  etc,  and  all these   tender  exercises  are

absolutely transparent.  The policy is correct.  But many people

feel that property prices can only go up but cannot go down.  So

everyone  will start bidding higher and higher.  Now  all  of  a

sudden, we know that the property price can go down and there is

nothing  that  they  could  do.  In this  aspect,  I  think  the

Government should review the policy.  We should do away with the

speculative element so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>

we  will  not commit the same mistake again in future.  When  we

are reviewing our policy, we should also consider the outcome of

the review so that everybody would benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry of Communications reviewed the

policy of diesel tax.  The saving of the diesel tax rebate is as

much  as  $109 million.  The Land Transport Authority  makes  it

clear  that  the taxi drivers should be entitled to a  share  of

this   benefit.   Recently,   the  three  major  taxi   operator

associations  in Singapore reached an agreement  with  the  taxi

companies,  whereby each principal taxi hirer  shall  have  $750

paid into his Medisave Account for the next five years.   So  in

five  years, every taxi driver would have accumulated $3,500  in

their  Medisave Account.   In all,  $60 million will go to these

taxi  drivers, which is as much as 55% of the savings  from  the

diesel tax.  In the past, whenever the taxi drivers talked about

the  diesel tax, they would become angry. They would  scold  and

abuse. But now, they are happy.  I feel that this diesel tax  is

no  longer a burden to them and the taxi drivers no longer  have

to worry about their contributions to  Medisave.  This is a win-win situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example we can see that the employer does have a

heart and the workers have the incentives to work hard.  This is

a time for everyone to work together with one heart.  As long as

the  Government  has  a realistic, pragmatic  policy  to  reduce

business  cost, I am sure we would be able to overcome all  odds

and come out of this economic crisis stronger and wiser.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in support of the motion exhorting the Government and the people

to  rally  together  so  that Singapore will  emerge  from  this

regional crisis even more competitive and resilient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a strong, able and honest Government in Singapore is

necessary  under any circumstance.  But it is not  a  sufficient

condition  for the survival of our nation, whether  economically

or  socially.  A resilient and equally strong population is just

as important.  During this crisis,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>

there  is  no doubt that the Government's role as a  leader  and

facilitator of changes is crucial to Singapore's ability to  not

just survive the crisis, but also to emerge the stronger for it.

To   do   so,   Singaporeans  should  support   the   Government

constructively  and  should not despair nor  be  overwhelmed  by

pessimism.  Sir, the Government should rally the people  in  the

following ways:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, view challenges collectively. Reflecting on our

own  past, as we struggled through the last three decades, there

can  be no denial that both the Government and the people worked

hand-in-hand  as  there  was a sense of ownership  of  a  common

destiny  and  a  common  vision.  There was  mutual  trust  that

everyone  would strive towards the common good.   This  did  not

mean that there was no suffering, no pain nor adjustments.   But

it  did mean that everyone was prepared to work towards a longer

term  goal  even  though there was going to be hardship  in  the

interim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was again evident as we rode out the downturn in the

mid-80s.   Painful  decisions were taken.  Singaporeans  rallied

behind  this Government and we emerged better able to tap growth

potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial and economic crisis that we are now

confronted  with  has  no  precedent.   It  has  hit  all  Asian

countries  with such ferocity that it would be quite  impossible

to  be spared.  Even though we have a relatively sound financial

system  and  competitive business infrastructure, we  are  still

adversely affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates on how long this crisis will plague us have not

been  encouraging.   This means that for us  in  Singapore,  the

pain,  particularly from unemployment and extremely  challenging

business conditions, is likely to intensify over the next  year.

How  we  react to this monumental crisis will determine  how  we

will fare in the medium, if not, longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current crisis resembles a mighty earthquake, which

unfortunately has many epi-centres within the Asian region, each

capable of triggering equally damaging aftershocks.  The role of

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>

Government is therefore to help prepare people to cope with  the

devastating effects and we have to recognise that there is  very

little,  if at all, that it can do to prevent another aftershock

from happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we cope with this crisis? Do we begin by

shifting  blame,  say,  to  our  employees  or  the  Government?

Understandably, this may be a reaction triggered by despair  for

those  who have been retrenched, or badly affected by the plunge

in  property or stock market values, or financially crippled  by

higher interest rates.  However, once we start drawing lines  of

division and forming separate camps, we will not be able  to  be

on top of the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaction to the current call to stay employable may be a

good   illustration  of  how  we  can  view  these   challenges,

literally, as one people or as different parties.  Do we see the

need  to  be  constantly  trained and upgraded  as  a  necessary

survival skill for all Singaporeans or is it simply an end  unto

itself, the road to another job?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we see training as an obligation of employers or the

Government, then the motivation to get trained will not be  high

nor  sustainable.   However,  if we  see  this  as  a  means  to

remaining  employable, on account of our continual upgrading  of

skills,  then we will fully realise the benefits of the  various

schemes  put  in place by employers, unions and the  Government.

As  Mr  Lim  Swee  Say has elaborated, a change  of  mindset  is

crucial  at this stage, otherwise those who have been retrenched

and  who  have  gone  onto training schemes,  will  emerge  more

disappointed, when they are still unable to find jobs.   In  the

final  analysis,  our sustainable edge will be knowledge-driven,

which  implies that Singaporeans would always have to be  ahead.

This is only possible if we constantly upgrade ourselves for our

own  sake.   The  Government should help by  constantly  raising

awareness  amongst the workforce and companies of  the  changing

skill-sets needed over time.  More incentives for individuals to

upgrade themselves should also be made available.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, be prepared to make adjustments. We feel

helpless or even frustrated when we have just been retrenched or

have  failed  to  find a similar-paying job for  the  last  nine

months.   But, we should all ask ourselves the question -  whose

responsibility is it to secure jobs for us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat, ironically, the very same factor, that is, a

tight  labour market, which has led to strong income  growth  in

the  past decade, is also the cause of our mental unpreparedness

in  coping  with unemployment during this crisis.   To  a  large

extent,  this reflects our vulnerability as an economy  with  no

natural  resources and one which is so dependent  on  the  human

factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government agencies, such as the Economic Development

Board,  slog  hard to garner foreign investments which  will  in

turn create jobs for us.  This has been accompanied by judicious

manpower  planning  for  the  necessary  skills.   So  far,  the

matching has worked well, which has made job placement a  fairly

straightforward,  if  not easy, task for employees.   Therefore,

the  sense of competition for jobs and the need to make  oneself

presentable,  skill-wise especially, is seldom  felt.   This  is

perhaps our greatest challenge - to understand the need to  stay

relevant and flexible at all times, so that in trying times such

as  these, we can make the necessary adjustments, both  mentally

and physically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is therefore not an issue of what else the

Government  should be doing to reduce unemployment.   Certainly,

there is no question that the Government should drive retraining

efforts, with the necessary funding and placement assistance, to

help those who are seeking to stay employable.  But the response

of  Singaporeans  must  be compatible in  order  for  the  whole

exercise to be a constructive one.  For example, as Mr Lim  Swee

Say  has  alluded to, Singaporeans have, justifiably, called  on

the  Government to reduce reliance on foreign labour and  divert

jobs  to  locals  instead,  in  a  bid  to  lower  unemployment.

However,  will there be enough Singaporeans to fill these  jobs,

for example, in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>

the  construction  industry?  So the question  really  is:  will

Singaporeans   be   prepared  to  make  adjustments   to   their

expectations and take on jobs which may not always be ideal  but

which  will  nonetheless  reduce unemployment  and  the  related

financial problems?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, do not allow pessimism to overwhelm us. Daily

headlines just do not make for pleasant reading nowadays -  they

merely  reinforce  some of our greatest  fears  that  the  whole

region  is  plunging into a recession.  Acknowledging how  badly

even  the  Singapore economy has deteriorated is  necessary  and

painful, but we should try to look beyond this crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not allow pessimism to drag us down the economic

spiral.  For we are a small economy and if we continue to wallow

in   self-pity,  we  will  miss  out  on  the  opportunities  to

reposition ourselves.  We should try to resist the temptation to

pour  our reserves into repairing depressed sectors per se,  but

to instead focus on how we can deploy them towards consolidating

our position economically.  This would have favourable long-term

implications and will help ensure that we have sufficient growth

impetus beyond this crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there is feedback that many Singaporeans feel

that  instead of pledging the $5 billion to Indonesia  as  trade

financing  assistance, the Government should redirect  this  sum

towards  helping  Singaporean companies that  are  going  under.

This  is perhaps a good example of how difficult it is to strike

a  balance between competing demands.  Ultimately, what  is  the

swinging  factor  has  to  be  the longer  term  value  of  each

competing  course  of  action, for we  have  limited  resources.

Seeking  the  Government's assistance to avert bankruptcy  or  a

shake-out  may  seem  to  be  a  perfectly  reasonable  request.

Deciding  which  companies  or individuals  to  help,  and  help

constructively,   is  however  extremely   difficult.    It   is

inevitable  that some may drop out of the economy in the  course

of  this downturn, and this is something which is of course hard

to accept.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this economic crisis is both a test of political

leadership  and the robustness of Singaporeans.   It  calls  for

mutual trust and assurance that all parties, the Government, the

economic sector and the population at large, will respond  in  a

responsible  manner.  Whilst the Government should  continue  to

show empathy, Singaporeans should be prepared to endure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt in my mind that only when Singaporeans

rally  behind the Government and make the necessary adjustments,

can  we  all cope with this crisis, emerge more cohesive, better

prepared  to  tackle new challenges and realise  further  growth

potential.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rallying point for

a  country  in times of crisis must be the political leadership.

The  Government must lead and must be seen to be leading in  the

process  of  alleviating the hardship  and  in  the  process  of

restructuring.  In the midst of pessimism, the Government  needs

to  encourage.   Where people are disheartened,  the  Government

needs  to  inspire. Where people are suffering,  the  Government

should show that it cares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the motion that the Government can act in

three  ways.  It can take short-term measures, it can take long-term  measures, and it can rally the people.  First, the  short-term  measures.  I think the Government faces a genuine dilemma.

Nobody, not even our competent Government, can tell how long and

how severe the downturn will be.  It depends on a whole host  of

external factors, Japan, China, US, Indonesia, and so  on.   And

on  top  of  that,  the relatively painless  measures  that  the

Government can take are limited in effectiveness and  in  scope.

For  example,  the  traditional pump priming measures,  such  as

increases in public sector spending and even temporary  cuts  in

income  tax  and GST have limited effect because  the  Singapore

economy  is  so externally driven.  In 1986, for example,  there

was  a 25% income tax rebate.  This time around, because 70%  of

the people do not pay income tax, the effectiveness of an income

tax rebate is therefore limited.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about policies to cut business cost? The problem is

that  every  levy  or charge has its specific  micro  allocation

objective   and  reducing  these  charges  would   disrupt   the

attainment of these allocated goals.  This applies, for example,

to  the  foreign worker levy which is used to discourage use  of

unskilled foreign workers, ERP charges which discourage  use  of

certain  roads and utility charges.  Even lowering the corporate

income  tax would be useful only for those companies  which  pay

tax  and is irrelevant for those suffering losses or those  with

pioneer status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficult though this message of limited effectiveness is,

I  think  that  it is important for all sectors,  including  the

business  community, to understand and to accept  this.   It  is

important for the business community to expect neither  bailouts

nor  handouts.   In my view, the $2 billion off-Budget  measures

announced  in June are appropriate and sufficient for  the  time

being.   However, as the downturn gets worse in  the  future,  a

further  round  of  off-Budget measures would  be  needed.   The

timing of the second round is all important.  It should be early

enough and large enough to have an impact.  The action should be

decisive and strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the second round of measures should include

some of the policy options mentioned above.  They may not be  as

effective as we would like.  However, in times of crisis, it  is

not  just the hard and fast numbers which count.  Confidence  is

all important and signals an impact that can extend beyond their

actual dollar value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we may have to face the harsh and painful reality that

what would have the most direct impact on business costs is  the

reduction  of  labour costs.  The variable  component  of  wages

which constituted 16% of total annual wages last year should  be

the  first  to  go.  Furthermore, in my view, the public  sector

should carefully consider what annual variable component  it  is

going  to  give in December, if any, and announce this early  in

order  to send a signal to other employers.  And then, there  is

the CPF.  Considering that more than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>

100,000 households are already withdrawing the maximum allowable

from the CPF for housing loan payment, a CPF cut should only  be

used  as a last resort and, even then, should be accompanied  by

means to help those with loan repayment difficulties.  And  this

is where, I believe, a compassionate Government should chip in - the  realisation that a CPF cut, or whatever cut, is  needed  in

order  to  reduce labour costs would be painful, would be  harsh

and would affect many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the long-term measures. As Lim Swee Say has spoken

at  length and very eloquently on these measures and I think  he

has  given us a very good lecture on the economic possibilities,

I  shall  not elaborate on these measures.  Suffice to say  that

the  Government can focus its mind and channel resources on  the

opportunities and that we do not need to wait for full  recovery

and  once  the region bottoms out, there are going to be  growth

areas.   We  also  need  to  diversify  and  we  should  prepare

ourselves for these opportunities and be quick on the uptake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third role of the Government is to rally the people. A

national crisis calls for all hands to be on deck.  Everyone has

a  role to play.  Allow me to outline what I think should be the

role of business, workers and the community.  First, the role of

business.   I  have consulted a number of business leaders.   Mr

Stephen  Lee,  President  of the Singapore  National  Employers'

Federation (SNEF) has said that he supports the motion.  He said

that  SNEF's stand is to minimise job losses.  In order to  stay

afloat,  companies can agree to stop hiring, they can  agree  to

terminate   contract  work,  cut  overtime,  cut  the   variable

component of wages and redeploy staff.  Retrenchment is the last

resort.  But it is a legitimate response to save the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the role of workers. Workers must be willing to be

trained  and flexible enough to ensure that there is no mismatch

in  capabilities.  NTUC's effort in promoting retraining through

the  SRP  and the Government's support for this effort has  been

crucial and timely.  It is also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>

encouraging to note from Minister Lee Boon Yang's response  this

afternoon  that  workers  nowadays  are  more  willing   to   be

retrained.  Also, if workers are retrenched, they should not  be

choosy about job options.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, financial institutions also have a role to play. It

is  understandable that they are concerned about  non-performing

loans.   However, banks and financial companies should not  take

advantage  of this situation to force companies and  individuals

to  top  up  so  long as they are able to service  their  loans.

Also,  while  there is a lot going for the DBS/POSB  merger,  it

does  have  a  negative  side effect on Credit  POSB  home  loan

repayments.    It  has  been  said  that,  at  current   levels,

readjustment  of Credit POSB interest rates to  the  DBS'  level

would,  for  a  20-year  loan, require an  increase  in  monthly

repayment of $92 for every $100,000 borrowed.  In other words, a

person  who  borrowed half a million dollars on a  20-year  loan

would  have his repayment increased by $460 a month, and  not  a

small  sum  indeed.  Considering that Credit POSB housing  loans

amount to an estimated $7-$8 billion, the effect of this on  the

economy is not small.  Even though there is a grace period up to

the end of 1999, and the adjustment will take place over a three-year  period,  this  is definitely bad news for  the  mortgagees

affected.   Could not the grace period be extended at  least  by

one  year up to the end of the year 2000 to soften the  blow  on

those who have already borrowed money from Credit POSB?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the community also has a role to play. During

times  of economic downturn, there are those in our society  who

are  genuinely  hit hard, families whose main breadwinners  have

been  retrenched, wage cuts which eat into their already  meagre

income  and  so on.  We do not have a social safety net  in  the

form  of  unemployment benefits in Singapore.  But what  can  be

done  at  a time like this?  It is for the community to bear  in

mind that there are those who are worse off than ourselves,  and

to  continue  to  give.   The Government  should  also  increase

funding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>

for the Government and voluntary welfare organisations precisely

so that they can continue to help those in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, where there is confidence that the political

leadership can implement the appropriate policies, convince  the

people  to  swallow the bitter medicine and unite society,  half

the  battle is already won.  I would like to state that  I,  for

one,  have that confidence in our Government and I am sure  that

this  view is shared by many.  This is the time to close  ranks,

face the crisis together as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise in support of the motion standing in the name of Mr  Lim

Swee Say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economies of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia have

been  significantly affected largely because  of  inadequacy  in

their  national policies, their political culture, their  crisis

management or mismanagement, or for many other reasons that have

been advanced.  Singapore, on the other hand, despite its strong

fundamentals and an able and honest Government, has nevertheless

inevitably  been inflicted by this economic flu, or perhaps  the

economic bronchitis that has swept the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While other governments are scrambling around trying to

solve  their  economic  and political upheavals,  the  Singapore

Government  has  begun  to  steer  its  course  to  address  the

worsening  economic  downturn.  Despite its  efforts  to  reduce

business costs, the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>

has  come  under  attack  from some  quarters  of  the  business

community.   But as economic analysts, like Dr Jim Walker,  have

pointed out, despite the clamour for more actions to address the

crisis,  the  reality  is  that  there  is  not  much  that  the

Government can do to lift the economy from the downturn  or  the

recession that is looming.  The external factors, as Dr Lee Tsao

Yuan  has  pointed out, far outweigh whatever internal  measures

that the Government takes in the short term.  But the Government

cannot simply sit out the recession or downturn but instead must

plan   for   the   future  and  develop  Singapore's   long-term

pontential.   The crisis mode and environment present  a  silver

lining for Singapore to strengthen its long-term competitiveness

and social cohesion.  And by "Singapore", I do not mean just the

Government but also the employers, unions and the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government on its part sees skills upgrading as a

way  to  save  jobs and to restructure the economy  and  prepare

itself for the knowledge-based economy in the 21st century.  The

Government  has  allocated  some $120  million  for  the  skills

redevelopment  programme.  But the Government's role  in  skills

redevelopment  cannot  be  limited  merely  to  the  funding  of

programmes.  Presently, the NTUC, through its own initiative and

to  its  credit,  has  taken centre stage  in  skills  upgrading

through the SRP.  But only about 5,000 workers, out of the  more

than   700,000   workers   without   a   full   secondary   four

qualification, have been reached so far.  This is even less than

1% of those vulnerable workers in our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NTUC, I believe, has got finite non-financial

resources.  The strategy of outreach to individual companies,  I

understand from the media, has been refocused to one of outreach

through  the industry, federations and associations, so  that  a

larger  number  and  spectrum of workers can  benefit  from  the

programme.   This is where I feel that the Ministry of  Manpower

(MOM) should play an important role.  From feedback, I hear many

people telling me that the Ministry of Manpower is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>

perceived  as not doing enough and leaving the job of  upgrading

to the NTUC.  This is certainly a common perception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MOM must, like the NTUC, take a pre-eminent role

in  worker upgrading and drive these efforts.  The MOM must move

swiftly   into  action  supported  by  the  various   Government

agencies,  the  NTUC,  the unions and the employers  federation.

Skills  upgrading of the workforce cannot materialise by  merely

providing funding.  From NTUC's experience, the workers'  skills

upgrading  is  achieved  through a lot of  marketing,  cajoling,

coaxing,  perseverance and sustained effort.  The MOM  must  get

into the thick of action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, the Government disburses funds for skills

training through some central funding programmes like the SDF or

the  SRP.   I  think  it is very timely for  the  Government  to

consider  the much talked about CPF account for skills training,

or,  as  some  call it, "trainsave" or "skillsave".  Introducing

such  an  account  for workers now has got two main  advantages.

One  is  that it will make available funding directly to workers

to  embark on training.  It will have the advantage of the  push

effect  on  workers  to  go for training,  especially  if  their

companies are reluctant to send them for training.  It  is  just

like  what  NTUC is now trying to do, instead of  going  to  the

individual  companies  it  reaches  out  through  the   industry

associations.  But there may be many workers out there who  find

that  they  cannot approach their companies to go for  training.

Having  an account like this will make it possible for  them  to

directly  join some of these programmes.  It will  certainly  be

much  better to have this push effect than just the pull  effect

of central funding for the programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why this should be done is that there has

been  much  discussion on the possibilities  of  a  CPF  cut  if

Singapore goes into a recession.  A CPF training account  top-up

scheme of sorts will send the right signal on the importance  of

skills training to workers and help show alternate directions to

workers who are facing difficulties, or who would face

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>

even  more difficulties if CPF is cut.  So a CPF reduction  will

be well buffered by having a CPF training account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this point of time I would also like to ask the

Government or perhaps the Minister for Manpower as to  when  the

report  on the CET 21 will be released.  It seems long  overdue,

although  I believe that the Committee might have completed  its

work.  The report, I believe, will provide insights as to how we

can develop a comprehensive framework and action plan which will

help turn the economic slow- down into an opportunity for growth

for Singapore and Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the employers and workers, besides the Government,

have  also  an  important  role  in  shaping  and  strengthening

Singapore's  competitiveness for  future  growth.   Having  just

returned to the private sector, after spending nearly five years

in  the trade union movement, I deeply appreciate the respective

roles  and responsibilities of employers and workers, especially

in  difficult times like this. In this regard, I would  like  to

urge  fellow  employers  not to use the excuse  of  the  looming

recession  as  a  first  excuse to shed  their  workers  through

retrenchment or temporary lay-offs.  This must certainly be  the

last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies must embark on retraining programmes, such as the

SRP  instead.  Many employers do not realise that it is  cheaper

for them to send their workers for training like the SRP instead

of  laying  them off, retrenching them or having temporary  lay-offs.  For example, the temporary lay-off very often means  that

the  company  bears, say, 50% of their payroll  whereas  sending

workers  to SRP means that the company only pays 30% of  salary,

since  SRP  pays 70% of absentee payroll.  Therefore,  companies

must  approach  the  workforce with  a  medium  to  longer  term

perspective  and use the downturn to train their  workforce  and

nurture  in  their workforce a sense of company loyalty.   I  am

sure this will pay off when the good times return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the workers must also become more loyal

and committed to the employers that they work for and do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>

their  part  to  improve their work attitude  which  is  grossly

lacking, according to BERI's findings, and the workers  must  do

their   part   to  improving  productivity  at  the   workplace.

Programmes  like  the  NTUC's Productivity Push  will  certainly

strengthen  competitiveness of companies in the medium  to  long

term.   I  urge  the  NTUC  and  the  PSB  to  push  ahead  more

aggressively  on such programmes so that more  can  be  done  to

enhance productivity at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area that I would like to touch on

relating to employers and unions' bipartite relationship at  the

workplace.   Generally speaking, the relationship between,  say,

the  NTUC  leaders and the top management in most companies,  is

usually  pretty  good  and  cordial.   Somehow,  from   my   own

experience,  it  cannot  be said that the  relationship  between

middle management and many of the branch union officials is just

as  good.   There are many reasons for it.  But I  think  it  is

important,  at  a time like this, to close ranks and  strengthen

that  relationship  because  that relationship  would  become  a

strong  pillar  to  strengthen tripartism in Singapore.   So  we

should use this difficult period to focus on strengthening  this

relationship between the middle management and the branch  union

officials  so  that we can come out of it better,  stronger  and

ensure that tripartism will thrive in the beginning of the  21st

century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<div align="center"><b>OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE GROWTH</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  more  than 2,000 years ago,  the  great  Chinese

philosopher, Lao Zi, said in his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>

famous Daode Jing (Moral Canon), "In calamity lies good fortune,

and in good fortune lurks calamity."  The meaning of this saying

is  that  good fortune is concealed in calamity and calamity  is

also hidden in good fortune. In other words, bad things may turn

into good things, and good things can also turn into bad things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past decade, when the leaders and people of many

Asian   countries  were  complacent  over  their   unprecedented

economic  growth, it never crossed their minds that the calamity

in  the  form  of a financial crisis was lurking   in  the  good

fortune  of economic prosperity. As such, when this calamity  of

financial crisis surfaced, they appeared to be caught off-guard.

Of course, such a reaction is perfectly normal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singaporeans, we ought to be happy because we have a

good   and  responsible  Government.  The  Singapore  Government

leaders  have  all  along  possessed a  very  strong   sense  of

anxiety.   Even  in the good years when we had good  and  strong

economic  growth,  the Government has been reminding the  people

not  to take economic prosperity for granted, but to look at the

success as the fruits of our hard work and diligence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has, on more than one

occasion,   told  the people of Singapore to  "be  prepared  for

danger  even in times of peace". Therefore, the arrival of  this

financial  crisis  should be looked upon more  positively  as  a

challenge  to the Government, the business and the  workers,  to

see  whether  they could once again put the advantage  of  their

tripartite co-operation to full play, pull together in times  of

trouble and tide over difficulties, rather than treating it as a

crisis per se.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In calamity lies good fortune". Bad things can be turned

into  good things. This is an objective dialectical law  of  the

development  of  history.   It  cannot  be  diverted  by   man's

subjective  will. As such, I strongly believe that  the  current

financial  crisis  will  be a  turning point  for   the  further

development of Singapore's economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I support the long-term objective of the

motion moved by Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Seng Han Thong, that  is,

to  suggest  that the Government should make full  use  of  this

economic downturn to strengthen our economic competitiveness and

social  cohesion,  so  that  Singapore  will  emerge  from  this

regional crisis even more competitive and resilient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the short-term target as raised by the two hon.

Members,   that is, to urge the Government to rally the  support

of  the entire nation to minimize unemployment, I have no reason

not  to  support it, because it concerns not only  the  abstract

meaning  of  the standard of living of the people of  Singapore,

but  also  the  actual  problem of the  friends,  relatives  and

neighbours of each and every one of us here.   However,  I  hope

that  while trying its best to rally the entire nation to ensure

that   our  unemployment  remains  at  the  lowest  level,   the

Government  would  also make every effort to  ensure  that   the

impact  on  the  industrial and commercial sector of  Singapore,

particularly the SMEs, would be minimal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to make a rough analysis of the employment

structure  in Singapore, we will find that the vast majority  of

Singaporeans  are  employees of the  five  major  categories  of

employers,  namely, the Government and statutory  boards,  MNCs,

Government-linked  companies, local large enterprises,  and  the

SMEs.   In the current financial crisis, all the five categories

of employers are affected, without exception. But the "degree of

injury" varies.  The first four categories have strong financial

and  resource  capabilities.  As it is said, "a  lean  camel  is

still bigger than a horse". Their injuries are just superficial.

After  a period of recuperation, they will regain their strength

and  vitality. As for the last category, that is, the SMEs, they

are critically injured.  If they are not treated promptly,  they

will most probably succumb to their injuries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry conducted two

surveys on the SMEs this year.  In the January survey, 73.9%  of

the SMEs indicated that they suffered drastic reduction in their

turnover

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>

and,   at the same time, 45.1% indicated that they had cash-flow

problems.   In the June survey, both figures exceeded  80%.   If

the  situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences  would

be too ghastly to contemplate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the other countries in this region are recording

negative  growth, Singapore managed a 3.8% growth in  the  first

half  of  this year.  This is evidence of our strong and healthy

economic  foundation.   Yet, while we  rejoice  in  feeling  how

privileged  we  are,  we  must not forget  that  this  financial

turbulence  has  in fact destroyed a good number of  enterprises

which  could not withstand the impact, with many others  hanging

by  a  thread  in a precarious position. Since the beginning  of

this  year, more than 12,000 employees have been retrenched  due

to liquidation or down-sizing of their companies. According to a

report, by the end of this year, this figure would be more  than

doubled,  touching 30,000.  Apparently, we no longer  enjoy  the

enviable situation of  full employment that we have enjoyed over

the last many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General of NTUC and Minister-without-Portfolio, Mr Lim Boon Heng, recently told the media that if the

economy further deteriorates, the first thing to do would be  to

save  jobs.  And to save jobs, we must ensure that  there  is  a

market  for the type of services and products we supply, and  to

reduce  cost.  He also said that the Singapore dollar was higher

than  the  currencies of our neighbouring countries.  Unless  we

can reduce our unit cost, improve our productivity and implement

cost-saving measures, Singapore may lose out to countries  where

the cost is lower.

At  another occasion, DPM BG Lee Hsien Loong  raised  a  similar

point.  He  said that reducing cost, including wage cost,  would

not  only  help  the companies to survive, but also  enable  the

companies to be more competitive, thereby helping the workers to

save their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the spirit of the speeches of DPM and the

Minister-without-Portfolio  happens   to   coincide   with   the

objective of this motion before us.  As

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>

a  representative  of  the business sector,  I  agree  that  the

business sector should also try its best to coordinate  and  put

to  full play the advantage of our tripartite cooperation.   Let

us put in a concerted effort to lead all the people of Singapore

in tiding over the current difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must emphasise that to do this, our imminent

task is to help the local large, medium and small enterprises to

maintain  their confidence and fighting-spirit to  persevere  in

exerting themselves in their struggle for survival, for the sake

of  their  own  business development and the  welfare  of  their

workers, so as to tide over the troubled waters and search for a

breakthrough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As employers, unless it is of absolute necessity and as a

last  resort,  we  do not wish to retrench our  workers.   As  a

matter of fact, we are even reluctant to cut the salaries of our

workers, including reducing the CPF contributions.  Because,  by

so  doing,  it will result in reduction in the workers'  income,

which   in  turn  result  in  lower  purchasing  power.    Lower

purchasing  power will then lead to further contraction  of  the

market.  The end result is that we, the businessmen, will  stand

to lose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a vicious cycle. It will make our economic

situation turn from bad to worse.  Recently, the Senior Minister

called  upon  Singaporeans to consume more.  I believe  he  made

this  call because he was worried that Singapore's economy might

fall into this strange vicious cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our local enterprises must reduce their

operational  cost.  This goes without saying.   However,  labour

cost  is  only  part  of the cost of doing business.   In  other

words,  if  the local enterprises can further reduce  the  other

parts  of  their operational cost , such as rentals,  taxes  and

other  charges, our pressure on labour cost will  be  relatively

alleviated.   Lowering of labour cost implies that less  workers

will be out of job.  Is this not the short-term target that  the

two hon. Members are seeking?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Government has already adopted some measures

to lighten the burden of the SMEs.  We are not turning a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>

blind  eye  to  all  these.  Indeed,  we  are  grateful  to  the

Government  for  the various cost-saving measures,  particularly

the   series  of  off-Budget  measures  introduced  by   Finance

Minister, Dr Richard Hu, in  Parliament on 29th June.   However,

as  a  Nominated MP representing the interest of the  industrial

and commercial sector, I am duty-bound to accurately reflect the

views  of  the  SMEs in this august Chamber, that is,  what  the

Government has done seems to be not quite enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore entrepreneurs, big or small,

generally  keep  to the excellent tradition of our  forefathers,

that is, they all possess the sense of duty and sense of mission

towards society and the nation.  With the zeal of "what is taken

from society to be used in the interests of society", they often

share  the  profits they earned from their business  with  their

employees, and even donate generously to national and  community

welfare  organisations, benefiting Singaporeans  of  all  races,

religions  and walks of life.  Of course, we have not  forgotten

to  pay all the taxes and levies to the country, accumulating  a

lot  of  surpluses for our national coffers.  Now, these  large,

medium  and small enterprises are subjected to the sudden impact

of  the  financial  turmoil.  Faced with the pressure  from  the

various  cost inflation and credit squeeze, they can be said  to

be  burning with anxiety and racking their brains for solutions.

In  this  crucial moment, if they are unable to receive  further

support and assistance from the Government and the understanding

and  cooperation of their employees, then eventually  they  will

collapse  and  have  no choice but to wind  up  their  business.

Then, not only will more workers lose their jobs, the Government

will  also  lose tax revenue.  As a result, the entire  national

economy will shrink further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and

Industry announced the results of the second survey of this year

on 26th June, it recommended to the Government to adopt a series

of pro-business measures in the areas of taxes, property sector,

banking  and  financial  sector, transport  and  communications,

supplementary schemes,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>

etc. to help the local SMEs tide over this crisis.  In order  to

save  time,  I  will  elaborate on just a  number  of  important

points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of taxation policy, we hope that the Government

would  adjust  the GST, say, from 3% to 1%.  This will  help  to

reduce some pressure of the small businessmen.  In addition,  we

also  hope  that the Government will allow more personal  income

tax rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the property sector, we hope that the

Government will further revoke the anti-speculation measures for

the  property  market,  and to raise  the  CPF  portion  of  the

purchase price to 90%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the banking and finance sector, we hope that

the  Government will relax the credit regulations,  and  at  the

same  time try to adopt some measures to stabilize the  exchange

rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of transport and communications, we hope that

the  Government will consider reducing the duties on diesel  and

petrol.   At  that time, we also suggested that  the  Government

postpone  the  implementation  of the  Electronic  Road  Pricing

system.   But the Land Transport Authority has already announced

that they are going ahead with it.  It may seem inappropriate if

I  were  to  raise  this  point again today.   However,  I  must

emphasise  that if the Government discovers any negative  impact

with  the implementation of this system, it should promptly make

some adjustment to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of supplementary schemes, we hope that the

Government  can  establish some special schemes  to  help  those

companies which are facing difficulties in capital turnover.  At

the  same time, assist SMEs to explore new markets, for example,

help  them  to  go to emerging markets in India,  Europe,  South

Africa and Latin America to look for business opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope that while the enterprises and the

workers  are  making substantial sacrifices, the Government  can

also make corresponding adjustments in its policies, and lead us

out of this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>

"coldest  winter in the history of Singapore", into a  beautiful

and warm springtime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank  you  for giving me this opportunity   to  speak  in

support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent regional financial and economic crisis can be

said  to be the most serious one in 30 years.  Various countries

in  Southeast  Asia  are  suffering  from  its  serious  impact,

resulting  in  many  companies closing  down  and  many  workers

unemployed.   There  was even social unrest  in  some  countries

where properties were destroyed and many lives were lost.   This

economic  crisis  which has been  evolved into a  political  and

social  crisis has serious undermining effect on the  prosperity

of  the societies that have been painstakingly built up over the

years.   In order to avoid such incidents from happening  again,

leaders  of  the  various countries are actively trying  various

ways and means to buffer the deterioration to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various countries in ASEAN have manifested their

cooperative spirit to help these countries which are in trouble.

Singapore has participated in the economic action of the IMF  to

save  Thailand.  We have also committed a US$5 billion guarantee

for  the  letters  of  credit used in  bilateral  trade  between

Indonesia and Singapore.  At the same time, we have lobbied  for

the  assistance of the United States and the IMF with  the  hope

that  with the cooperation of the various quarters, we would  be

able  to prevent the economy from deterioration, with a view  to

an early recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment, we are most concerned with the stability of

the renminbi.  Once the renminbi devalues, there will be another

round  of  economic crisis for the region.  The economy  of  the

whole  of Asia, even that of Europe and the United States,  will

be  affected.  A regional economic crisis is not an easy problem

to resolve.  It is not something which Singapore can overcome by

itself.  We have to depend on the cooperation and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>

assistance  of our neighbouring countries and the  super  powers

for an early recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the economic crisis does not evolve into a

political or social crisis, the Singapore Government should have

the ability to lead us out of the crisis. The economic recession

in  1985/86  is  a good example of our Government's  capability.

However,  all the people of Singapore must have full  confidence

in the Government's ability to lead us out of the bad times.  We

must  stand united with the Government so that we would be  able

to  resolve these economic problems together.  At this time when

we  are  facing an economic downturn, it is a test on the degree

of  unity between the Government and the people.  We should also

make use of this opportunity to strengthen our social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we are facing the regional economic crisis, our

neighbouring countries  adopted an uncooperative attitude in our

removal of CIQ from Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands.  They have  also

issued some erroneous statements aimed at undermining the  unity

between  the Government and our people.  This is very dangerous.

With  regard  to the background of the removal of our  CIQ  from

Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands, the Minister has already given us  a

very detailed explanation.  I feel that so long as the policy is

for  the benefit of the people, we should implement it.  So long

as  the people and the Government stand untied, we would not  be

affected by erroneous  arguments coming from outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the country belongs to us. The Government

is elected by us.  We should give the Government 100% confidence

and to give it our full support so that the Government will have

the  full authority to deal with its foreign policies.  So  long

as  our  stand is correct, the principles are right, the matters

will be eventually resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the imminent task before the Government is how

to  implement appropriate measures to help the businessmen  tide

over  the  difficult  times.  At the same time,  we  should  use

effective ways to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>

help  the retrenched workers in securing alternative employment.

The  Ministry  of  Manpower  (MOM)  has  already  provided  this

service.   However, MOM alone is not enough.  I  feel  that  the

CDCs  and the community centres in all the 83 constituencies  in

Singapore  should  set up "Employment Services"   counters.   We

should  combine the resources of the Ministry of  Manpower,  the

Ministry  of  Community Development and the CCs to  establish  a

National  Employment Network to help Singaporeans find jobs  and

tide  over  the difficult times.  If everybody has a  job,  then

socially  we  will  have no big problems. We would  be  able  to

maintain  a peaceful society and to work hard to get us  out  of

the  recession.  So long as we stand united as a nation, we will

be  able to take one step at a time to get out of this financial

crisis,  and position ourselves in better conditions  and  solid

foundation for our future economic development.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the motion. Sir, there are a few critical issues that we

need to address, especially at this time of our economic crisis.

This economic crisis has not been brought upon by ourselves.  It

is  like  an economic haze because, as you all know, if somebody

burns  a  forest somewhere, we are affected by it.   So  we  are

faced  with  this dilemma and many of these events are  in  fact

beyond  our  control.   I  hope that Singaporeans,  workers  and

others  would be able to see that these problems are not  really

brought  upon  by  us.   Many of these events  are  outside  our

control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this, it is very important therefore for us

to  mobilise  ourselves and to rally behind the Government,  the

trade  unions and the employers so that we should begin to  join

hands and see how we can brace this economic storm.  Unless  and

until  we  get  together  to  think of  effective  and  creative

solutions to these problems, I do not think we will be  able  to

surge  forward and find new solutions and opportunities to  deal

with the problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, at this stage, it is very important for

Singaporean  workers, the Government and the  employers  not  to

blame each other.  It is time that we should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>

get  together and see how we can tackle the problems  which  are

very critical and crucial for us.  This is essentially necessary

because  it  is  time that we should rally and find  a  creative

solution  and band together to surge forward to bring  Singapore

another economic growth, and to try and find ways to reduce  the

burdens that we will be facing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a few important issues that we need to

tackle,  to  try  and  ensure that  we  can  keep  Singapore  as

attractive  as possible so that people would want  to  come  and

invest  in  Singapore.  If we really cannot  make  Singapore  an

attractive  and  competitive place, then I do not  think  it  is

possible for us to solve the problems.  So how do we ensure that

Singapore  is  an attractive place for people to  come,  whether

they  are  foreign  talents, or people who  want  to  invest  in

Singapore,  or  people who want to be educated in Singapore,  or

tourists who want to come to Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important issue that we need to address and

Singaporeans   must   examine  this,  that   we   all   have   a

responsibility that we all owe to Singapore, to try and see  how

we  can  work  at this hard time to find effective and  cohesive

efforts  to tackle the problems.  Unless we stay together  as  a

bigger  family,  I  do not think we will be  in  a  position  to

weather the storm.  We may be in sixes and sevens and this  will

inevitably  do us in.  So I urge Singaporeans, be they  workers,

students,  families,  retirees  or  others,  to  come  and  work

together  to  solve  this economic crisis that  we  are  facing.

Although many of these problems are beyond our control, when  we

band together, we are likely to find ways to meet the problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can see, Sir, is that it is very important to have

political stability, especially at this time.  There are various

people  trying to blame us for their problems, particularly  the

Malaysian politicians, and many of them have recently said  that

we  are  doing  them  in or undermining  them.   Being  a  small

country,  we want to live mutually, with good understanding  and

with good neighbours.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>

How  can  a small country, like us, try and create problems  for

others?  We want a stable place, we want a stable Singapore,  we

want  a stable community, we want to have a stable ASEAN region,

and we are trying our best to contribute to this.  Therefore, it

is  important for Singaporeans to realise all these  issues  and

the  blames  on Singapore by many politicians outside Singapore.

Recently,  Members  must  have  read  many  of  these  Malaysian

politicians blaming Singapore for their problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the case? I do not think it is the case. We are a

peace  loving people.  We are a small nation.  What else can  we

do?   We would like to live as peacefully as possible.  As  good

neighbours,  we will encourage and support the interest  of  the

wider  majority in the region.  I do not think we should stomach

all  this bullying and blaming.  As Singaporeans, I am sure,  we

must be able to see the broader picture that Singapore wants  to

be   mutual,   supportive  and  have  as  good  as  possible   a

relationship with anyone who wants to bring progress and provide

a  better  life  for  all  within the region.   So  we  need  to

cooperate,  and Singapore's belief is this.  All our workers  in

the  various  factories  and industries believe  that  the  more

stable  the  place,  the more prosperous the  region,  the  more

attractive  it is, the more stable the governments  are  in  the

region,  the better for us, be they Singapore workers, Malaysian

workers, Indonesian workers or workers in the ASEAN region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would urge Singaporeans to make sure that we do not

allow foreign politicians to subvert us and bring dissent.  What

I  am  very  concerned  about  is  the  possible  resurgence  of

religious  fanatics,  racial  fanatics,  language  fanatics,  in

trying  to  subvert us.  We will have to be aware of  this.   We

should ensure that we do not allow this to happen in the context

of  Singapore's growth and development at this stage, because it

is very easy to put the blame on racial division for an economic

problem.    We  are a multi-racial society and, being  a  multi-racial  society,  there  is always this  danger  that  you  have

fanatical elements to assign the blame to various racial  groups

for their problems and issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that thinking Singaporeans will band together to

ensure  that there is progress, be they Malays, Indians, Chinese

or  Eurasians.  We all have a stake in Singapore.  We should  in

fact  try and see how we can work together and we should not  be

allowed to be made use of by fanatics who are out there to do us

in.  If we succumb to this whole thing, then Singapore would  be

a  broken  society  and we will never be able  to  put  it  back

because political stability is a very critical issue for all  of

us.   Without political stability, you can talk about economics,

better  education  and  better housing,  all  these  will  never

happen.   If  we  do not manage this carefully and  we  are  not

aware,  we are all gullible Singaporeans, and we allow ourselves

to  be  subverted and made use of, then we cannot put  Singapore

together.   Because  once the setback happens  and  once  it  is

exploded  in our hands, then Singapore would never be  the  same

again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all thinking, well meaning Singaporeans,

whether  they  be Malays, Indians, Chinese or Eurasians,  should

band  together to see what we can do to help Singapore  to  move

ahead.  We should not allow religion, race and language to stand

in  our  way  because these are not the critical  issues.   What

faces us is the economic issue and we should see how we can come

out  with  sound  economic  plans and  policies  to  tackle  the

problem.  I think this is very critical and essential for us  to

move ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second important issue is to have a proactive

labour union, workforce and employers.  It is important for  the

labour union, workers and employers to work together.  And here,

I do not think we can assign blame on any of these quarters.  If

we  do so, we will be foolish because we will be doing ourselves

in.   We  are  in  the same boat, whether you are  an  employer,

worker  or Government.  Try and puncture the boat, try and  rock

the boat, who is to gain at the end?  Employers are not going to

gain at the end of the day if they are going to retrench workers

at  the slightest excuse they can find.  Neither can workers say

they  would want to have better salaries at this point in  time.

It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>

very  important for the three parties to work together and  find

effective solutions to their problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that there is a need for employers, unions and

Government to come out with strategic plans, particularly unions

and   employers,  to  deal  with  saving  jobs  and   to   think

strategically  in  terms of ensuring that the  workers  are  not

retrenched because many of these workers have served a long time

in their companies.  Some have served 15 years while others have

served  20  years.  So I think it is important for us to  ensure

that  workers who have been with these companies are  given  the

best.   We should try and see how they can be kept and, if  they

need  to be trained, we should find ways in which they could  be

trained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, many employers took the slightest excuse to

retrench older workers.  I am very concerned about this.  I want

to  find out from the Ministry of Manpower what steps are  being

taken  to  ensure that these workers are not retrenched  at  the

slightest  excuse.  Many of these workers have worked  for  many

years  in the company.  When bad times come, instead of  finding

strategic solutions to deal with these issues, they find a short

cut approach through retrenchment which is not a solution to the

problem.  Many of these workers have given their lives and  many

years  of  service to the company.  It is humanly important  for

the  companies to think of ways in which they could  help  these

workers  to be reorganised and find ways in which they could  be

redeployed.

Sir,  there are also the other aspects that we need to  look  at

and, that is, to see how the Government can also play a part  in

trying  to  soften  the  blow by taking a  number  of  measures.

First, many of our workers are paying mortgage loans and we  are

quite  fortunate that about 85% of them are living in HDB flats.

I  want  to  find  out  from  the  Minister  whether  there  are

contingency measures to help defer payments and other approaches

to tackle the problems of their housing mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issues that we need to look at are job placements

and manpower plans;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>

what  are the long-term manpower plans and how workers are going

to  be  trained; whether these are in place and whether we would

have  to develop a comprehensive plan that can carry us for  the

next  20 years in terms of having an effective manpower plan  to

deal  with  the  training and development  of  a  more  educated

workforce.   I  would  like to see more training  incentives  by

Government  and  also incentives to enable  companies  to  begin

reviewing  what training plans they can implement  at  the  work

site.   I  think  there  is  a need for  Government  to  provide

matching  grants for companies that are very interested  to  run

their  manpower  retraining plans.   If  many  of  them  can  be

encouraged to do so and they fit in the overall manpower plan, I

think  it is in the interest of Singapore and for Government  to

support these companies to think of how they can participate  in

the  retraining of workers.  And that will help  us  to  have  a

better   educated  and  well  trained  workforce  to  meet   the

contingency plans of the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also a need to look at how Government could

soften the blows of the economic downturn.  We could look at how

we  can  cut  costs  in terms of land cost, cost  for  rents  of

industrial  sites and other related things.  How can  Government

review, besides the current measures that are in place, the off-Budget  measures, whether there are some long-term  measures  to

review  how we can reduce business costs in view of the economic

problems?  Can we do this?  Can we take a bolder step to try and

ensure that Singapore remains very attractive in terms of  land,

capital  and  factory  costs  for the  development  of  our  own

infrastructure?   There have always been a lot of  arguments  by

many  investors that our land cost is high and, over the  years,

we  have become quite expensive and less competitive compared to

other countries in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last area we need to look at is the training of

workers.   I am very concerned that close to 48% or nearly  half

of our workforce are 40 years and above.  As Mr Lim Swee Say has

said, we are moving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>

towards an aging workforce and half of this workforce are  going

to  be  aged workers of the future.  It has serious implications

in  terms of productivity, in terms of rejuvenation of what they

can  do  and how they can be retrained, in terms of their social

security and their old age pensions. I think there is a need for

serious  examination  as  to how we  should  tackle  this  aging

workforce and, despite the extension of retirement age, how  can

we  utilise this large number of workers who are in the 40s  and

who  are  going to be in the 50s.  There is this big  number  of

them and I think we should come out with a serious plan in terms

of what could be done for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us will be in the aging workforce in about 10 years

from  now, me included, Mr Speaker.  I am sure the Minister  for

Manpower  would  agree with me that this would  be  one  of  the

serious  issues  that we would be confronted with.   How  do  we

attract younger people into the workforce when families are very

small?  We do not have enough people to come into the workforce.

What  do  we  do and how do we try and ensure that  there  is  a

continuing  productive  workforce that will  help  in  terms  of

Singapore's economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that, ultimately, it is very important for

workers,  for employers and for Government to band  together  in

these economic hard times that we are facing and many of us have

said  that recession is going to be deeper in the next few years

and we need to stay together as a strong family and Singaporeans

must  find  ways  to  work together despite all  these  external

problems  that we are facing.  I think it is important  that  we

stay  ahead,  we  stay  cool, we stay collected  and  we  remain

cohesive.   If we are able to do this, then I think  we  have  a

good future, we have a good promise to be able to deal with  the

hard times ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to support the motion standing

in the name of Mr Lim Swee Say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support this motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch specifically on the issue of social

cohesion  which  Mr Lim Swee Say and some other  speakers  spoke

about.   I  have no doubt that there is enough goodwill,  public

spiritedness and national pride among Singaporeans that when the

crunch  comes, I am confident that Singaporeans would be willing

to  do  whatever they can to help one another.  But I am  afraid

that  we  do it too late and wait for the worst of the  economic

situation to hit us before we do something.  We have seen how in

Thailand and Korea, people give up their jewellery and  gold  in

order  to  save  the country.  And we have seen  starvation  and

hunger in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in Singapore the situation is not as bad, never have

I known more people, including my friends and acquaintances, who

have either lost their jobs or risk losing one.  I have known of

families who have to take the painful decision of having to  cut

their children's tuition because they have suffered, because  of

retrenchment.   This is sad because I fear the implication  that

we  have on our children.  That is the reason I think we have to

do everything we can to help buffer our children from the impact

of  this  economic  crisis.  I therefore urge all  Singaporeans,

young   and  old,  to  start  doing  something  to  help  fellow

Singaporeans who are in need of help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has stated that retraining of workers and

continuing  education are important aspects in our  strategy  to

prepare  ourselves  during this difficult  time.   Let  me  just

highlight examples of how Singaporeans can help in this  effort.

The Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE),

of  which  I am a board member, recently organised training  for

inmates  to  prepare  them to work as cooks in  the  hospitality

industry.   It  costs more than $50,000 to pay for trainers  and

tutors  for  the 17 inmates.  Despite the slowdown  in  business

faced  by  many  hotels,  SCORE  has,  with  great  success  and

difficulty,  managed to secure sponsorship for  these  trainees.

But  I think we could have done better and train more people  if

more  qualified  Singaporeans are prepared to come  forward  and

train these people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is times like this that we must ensure that every

Singaporean  counts  and  be  an important  contributor  to  our

national economy.  Untrained and unskilled workers would only be

a  national  burden we cannot afford.  Even at the neighbourhood

level,  Singaporeans  can  help  neighbours  to  babysit   their

neighbour's  children, provide tuition at  the  various  tuition

centres  in  the  neighbourhood or even do  simple  things  like

preparing  a  meal for their neighbours or giving a neighbour  a

ride  to  the office.  Simple things like this take  on  a  very

important  and significant meaning in times like this.  Everyone

can  help  and must help.  Whether you are a doctor  or  lawyer,

school teacher or taxi driver, everyone can play a part if  they

want to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that agencies like the Community

Development  Councils  and  the  National  Council  for   Social

Services  set  up registers to match the skills of  Singaporeans

volunteering their services with the needs of the community.   I

note the Minister for Education's call to develop what he called

the  people sector.  I really feel that there is no better  time

and  no greater need than now for each and every Singaporean  to

do  something  for  their friends and  neighbours.   I  know  of

families where both parents with young children have to take  on

an  additional  job  or  do  shift work,  leaving  behind  their

children at home to look after themselves, to cook and to  wash.

In this example, a caring and friendly neighbour does help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current economic difficulty poses the danger of

weakening  our  social infrastructure when people  become  self-centred, less caring and disinterested in things around them  if

it  does  not  bring  immediate  benefits.   We  have  seen  how

countries   become   more   protectionist   and   nationalistic.

Internally,  we  must be aware that our people can  become  more

selfish.  This attitude cannot be allowed to take place  in  our

society.  On the contrary, we  must rally our people to do  more

to  help strengthen our social infrastructure and civil society.

This  is a calling to all Singaporeans.  We must ensure that  we

not  only  recover  from this crisis economically  stronger  but

equally important is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>

need  to preserve and enhance social cohesiveness of our people.

And  this  can only be achieved through shared experience,  good

deeds and good work amongst all our people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. We have so far been fortunate

in  that Singapore has been hit by the regional economic  crisis

relatively   late  as  compared  to  our  immediate  neighbours.

Malaysia,  Indonesia and Thailand are going to be in a recession

and  possibly in deep recession, and Singapore cannot avoid  but

go  into  a  recession later this year, in my own opinion.   The

downslide should continue for another year or so.  We can either

get defensive and become conservative in such an environment or,

alternatively, we can be aggressive and consider  this  downturn

as  an  era  of  opportunities to invest while preparing  for  a

better future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the call from all the Members who have

spoken  before me for the public, private and the people sectors

to  work hand in hand to solve our problems as a team.  I  will,

however,  focus my speech on what I feel we can do to strengthen

our economy, both in the short and the long-term.  While some of

the  suggestions  I  am going to make would  be  appropriate  as

Budget  proposals,  I feel that we cannot wait  for  the  normal

Budget  cycle  and  they  should be  addressed  very  early.   I

therefore hope that we can take some more off-Budget measures to

further strengthen our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some areas where I feel our fundamentals are

weak, basically the fundamentals of the Singapore economy and if

we  can focus in correcting the problems, we will be able to  do

much  better  than before.  However, if we do not  tackle  these

inherent  weaknesses in our economic structure, we will  not  be

able  to  take  the  full advantage of the next  upturn.   Worse

still,  we  may  face even worse problems in the  future  should

another downturn hit us.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One obvious problem in our economy is the over reliance on

the  property  sector.  I refer the House to the Business  Times

report  dated  20th  July, titled "The Perils  of  the  Property

Economy".   I  fully  agree  with the  analysis  made  that  the

Singapore's  economy,  just like those of  our  neighbours',  is

heavily dependent on the property sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realise that the property sector also impacts many

other  sectors of our economy, especially the financial  sector.

It  was reported that the banks in Singapore have an exposure to

the  property sector of about $49 billion or a whopping  34%  of

our GDP as of May this year.  And it is believed that this is an

under estimation, since the numbers do not take into account the

loans  that are given to professionals, individuals and  so  on.

It  is  likely that the exposure of our banks could be close  to

50% of our GDP.  By any account, this has to be a very unhealthy

position for any country to be in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one area where all Singaporeans, including the

Government, can learn a very valuable lesson.  We need to reduce

our  dependence  on  the property sector  drastically.   In  the

Western economies, property is nowhere near the top in terms  of

contribution  to  economic  growth.   If  we  look  at  our  top

companies  and wealthy people in Singapore, most  of  them  made

their  fortunes through the property sector, while those in  the

Western  countries came mainly from value added activities  like

technology and innovation.

In Singapore, many companies tried to make a quick buck through

the property sector.  Even bus companies, food companies and

others tried to do so.  Even the Government, through most of its

Government-linked companies,  too is to be blamed for adding to

the perils of our economy by getting involved in the property

sector in a big way.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that our solution is to defocus from the

property sector and to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>

refocus  on  more technology and innovation based  economy.   In

Singapore we do not have enough large local companies capable of

growing   in  this  area  other  than  the  likes  of   Creative

Technology.   I  urge  the Government to stimulate  the  private

sector in this direction by creating a conducive environment for

more  technology  and  innovation based  economy  which,  in  my

opinion,  will be better able to weather a downturn if it  comes

again  the next round.  I also call on the private sector to  do

likewise to be more entrepreneurial in developing their business

in   this  direction.   This  downturn  provides  us  the   best

opportunity  to restructure our economy.  Sir, while  we  cannot

become the USA, we could try to become the Silicon Valley of the

East.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the effects of the property economy has been asset

price  inflation,  particularly the high land rentals,  building

cost  and  property  cost.  Being involved  in  the  electronics

sector  and in the high technology area in the last 15 years,  I

have  seen  many  examples of new investments  deciding  not  to

locate  in Singapore or existing companies who decided  to  move

their investment overseas because of the high cost being one  of

the  major issues.  The economic downturn has made this  problem

even  worse with our neighbouring countries being able to  offer

much cheaper land cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the off-Budget measures did try to address the issue

by  offering  rental and property tax rebates, I feel  that  the

Government  did  not  do enough to instill  long  term  investor

confidence.  Permanent cuts would have been much better, because

investors and businesses would see the rebates go away in one to

two  years  should  the economy recover.  In   my  opinion,  the

Government could take this opportunity to put in place long term

measures,  like very clear policies on strategic  land  pricing,

where a large cross section of companies will be allowed to  pay

much  lower rentals for companies that we would really  like  to

bring  into  Singapore, which can provide widespread employment.

One  other way is to give a 10-year tax rebate in lieu  of  high

rentals  paid to JTC or HDB so that we can de-couple the  market

price of property

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>

from  the  cost of doing business in Singapore.   In  this  way,

companies  will  take  a  longer  term  view  of  investing   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also need to do more to bring in investments by

offering  innovative incentives.  I must admit that the Economic

Development Board is doing a good job here.  But there are  many

more private sector initiatives that could develop into concrete

investments in Singapore and hence creating jobs.  We  all  know

that  our  neighbours are today able to offer exactly  the  same

investment  incentives as we can.  In fact,  their  approach  in

luring investors is to copy exactly what Singapore can offer and

then to offer a little more.  With their cheaper land and labour

cost, we are definitely in a disadvantaged position and have  in

fact  lost  a  number of big companies that could have  invested

here  in  Singapore  to them.  We  therefore  need  to  be  more

transparent and be more innovative in the type of incentives  we

can offer to these companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate this year, I talked about the need

for  us to promote entrepreneurship among Singaporeans.  I  also

asked  for  a review of the bankruptcy laws, easier  listing  of

high-tech  companies  on the Stock Exchange,  promoting  venture

capitalists  and a number of other incentives that can  help  us

better  create an environment of innovation.  In his reply,  the

Minister for Trade and Industry said that his Ministry is in the

process  of  reviewing some of these things.  I  feel  that  the

process  needs to be speeded up so that we could take  advantage

of the many opportunities that are available in Singapore and in

the  region.   We should not wait for the next Budget  cycle  to

announce some of these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we need to do more to encourage our companies to

accelerate  their regional drive and not to slow  down,  despite

the economic crisis.  Banks need to be more proactive in lending

to  their  strong  clients.  Unfortunately, in this  environment

where  tremendous opportunities to invest are available for  our

companies,  and there are viable companies in the  region,  cash

flow seems

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>

to be a problem.  Since our local banks are very conservative, I

feel  we  can  do  with  many more venture capitalists  locally.

However, the incentives to some of the small venture capitalists

are  not  as  attractive  as  those provided  to  the  big  fund

managers.   Most  of these incentives favour the fund  managers,

for example, very generous tax cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government and the Monetary Authority of

Singapore to review some of these rules and incentives  to  make

it  more conducive for such boutique funds to flourish and to do

away  with the bias favouring the bigger funds.  I feel that  by

creating such an environment today we will position ourselves to

benefit  the high technology investments that are going to  come

our  way in a few years to come.  We could learn a lot from Hong

Kong and Taiwan in doing such things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the motion and feel that, other

than  improving labour cost and productivity, we  can  create  a

much  more vibrant business environment that consists of a  high

proportion of value-added activities while we try to  move  away

from the low value-added activities like the property sector.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,

Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to support the

motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take the opportunity to add two proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that the Government should invest in and develop

social  infrastructure.  During economic downturns,  governments

often  adopt expansionary fiscal policies and invest in physical

infrastructure such as roads, schools, MRT lines, and so  forth.

Our Finance Minister during last Friday's sitting listed out  in

detail  the  current and planned infrastructure projects  to  be

accelerated  to  increase  public  spending.   These  are  hard,

tangible projects which directly generate jobs and spur economic

demand.  The tendency is, however, to cut back on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>

investment in social infrastructure, as these are seen to be not

contributing directly to economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue the contrary. Not only can investment in

social infrastructure spur employment creation, but it can  also

achieve   two   further  objectives.   It  can   contribute   to

Government's efforts to retrain retrenched people in new  skills

which 21st century Singapore will need. And, as we prepare for a

long  period of slow growth or even no growth, it can contribute

to  the  social  cohesion which we will need  to  tide  us  over

difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. For the past few months, MOM has taken

the  lead to develop numerous re-skilling programmes and to work

with  MOE to create a culture of life-long learning for workers.

This  focus  on  continual learning, training and  education  to

enhance workers' existing skills or train them for new skills is

a  significant  long  term  strategic  measure  to  develop  our

competitiveness.   I  also note that  DPM  BG  Lee  Hsien  Loong

recently identified the service sector as an opportunity  for  a

comprehensive   infrastructure  to  be  set  up   including   "a

regulatory  framework, promotion strategies, and an approach  to

attracting and developing manpower."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to also see the social services

sector as another opportunity sector for development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social services community has drawn the bulk of its

manpower from

volunteers.  But while volunteerism remains a bedrock  principle

in community service, there is a dire need for more professional

workers  to  help us deliver a higher level of  service  to  the

community.   Recession  or not, Singapore  has  all  the  socio-economic and demographic characteristics of a developed society,

and  if  we  study other developed societies, we can  anticipate

that  demand  for social services, and by implication  for  full

time  social  service workers, will increase  in  the  next  two

decades.  And I see a growing demand for more sophisticated  and

informed care which the market can respond by developing a range

of job types.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for trained therapists, para-medical and social

service  workers to cater to the elderly, the chronic  sick  and

the  disabled, will grow as our society ages rapidly and medical

technologies  increase longevity.   As a developed  society,  we

will  face  the pressure to improve services for the  small  but

growing  part  of  our  population which  is  intellectually  or

physically disabled, or blind or deaf.  For the marginalised and

criminalised  population,  such  as  drug  offenders  and  young

criminals,   we  will  face  pressures  not  to  just   increase

deterrence, but improve rehabilitation and aftercare services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that a lot more jobs at both the

community preventive and remedial levels are necessary  to  fill

the gaps in the continuum of services in this sector.  We should

stop seeing them as social problem professions.  We need to  see

them  as people service professions which we must nurture within

a  comprehensive social infrastructure.  During times of crisis,

we  all the more need social engineers who are trained to repair

and  mend  people's  lives,  and by doing  so,  they  strengthen

society's competitiveness and resilience as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the amount of resources spent on economic solutions,

significant  inputs must equally be spent on  developing  social

service infrastructure to reap investment returns not in  dollar

terms, but in terms of social cohesion.  Social cohesion can  be

threatened  even  during economically good  times.   During  bad

times,  the  lack of social cohesion can sabotage  all  credible

economic efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the various skills training or retraining

funds   be   extended  to  train  some  of  the  retrenched   or

structurally  unemployed  to  seek  employment  in  the   social

services  sector.   This is consistent with MP  Lim  Swee  Say's

call for maximizing employability of our workforce.  Here, I  am

broadening   the   call   for  cross  sectoral    employability.

Government's  investment here will be both in the  provision  of

training  funds and also in identifying sectoral needs  and  the

provision of social service jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it will be employment-generating, my proposal is

not  an ad hoc approach to just mop up the jobless.  In the long

run,  we  create new employment, and develop a manpower resource

for  staffing  the social service sector to address  our  social

problems.   Such  investment in social infrastructure  therefore

has  both short term and long term merits.  The workers who  are

past  40  and who are retrenched are most suited, in my opinion,

to  these  jobs,  because they are married, they have  families,

they  have lived life and they have learnt from the hard  knocks

of  living.  This proposal is consistent with what Minister  Lee

Boon  Yang  said  last  Friday that in  lieu  of  setting  up  a

Retrenchment  Fund for workers, the more lasting measure  is  to

retrain  workers and help them keep their jobs or  re-enter  the

job market eventually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second proposal is for the Government to set up a task

force  to develop our own misery index as the first step towards

developing  our  own social security net or social  safety  net.

With  full  employment  and double-digit  growth  for  the  past

decade,  Asia,  Singapore included, never really pondered  about

the  social  consequences  of  unemployment.   Any  able-bodied,

willing  worker should be able to find some job, though  perhaps

at  a  lower pay.  Now, we face the prospect of sustained period

of  relatively  moderate  unemployment  by  western  terms,  but

serious by our previous standards.  Government has long promised

that  for  the truly destitute, basic services such  as  primary

health care, education and housing will not be denied.  This  is

indeed a promise which many other societies cannot give, and for

that I am proud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond the truly destitute, there is a broad range of

the  poor  and  near-poor  who may be long  term  unemployed  or

unemployable.  While we as a society do not believe in welfarism

and its excesses as practised in the west, we do need to ask the

question:  should we create a social safety net  for  the  truly

needy?   This, of course, begs another question.   Who  are  the

truly needy?  Can we measure this by just one yardstick, such as

net income?  My answer is no, because a chronically

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>

sick,  old  and disabled person with no relatives, who  earns  a

subsistence income is to me more needy than a young, able-bodied

person  living with relatives but earns zero income.  If  income

is  not  the sole yardstick, then what are the others,  and  how

should  they  be weighted?  By the year 2030, we will  have  two

active persons supporting the needs of one elderly person.   How

are we allocating our funds to meet their needs?  Is it time  to

look  into  an  elderly  welfare fund to repay  to  these  older

persons who had contributed to the making of this nation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe that education and employment are the

best  welfare policies in the long-run.  But for pockets of  our

population,  there  may not be available opportunities.   School

drop-outs,   single  parents,  the  illiterate  older   persons,

deserted  homemakers,  the  severely disabled,  the  very  sick.

Among  these, some individuals can still contribute  given  some

level  of support.   The questions that follow will be to  whom,

how much and for how long.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop an appropriate social safety net

which avoids resource wastage and programme duplication, we need

to  define  a  "misery index" as it has sometimes  been  called,

which  takes into account various factors to determine  who  are

the  truly  needy in our society, for whom a social  safety  net

needs to be constructed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we get scattered data and signals from the

community on the extent of the impact of this downturn on family

situations.  Some hotlines registered a rise in the  numbers  of

calls  related to financial difficulties; a few social  services

registered  increasing petitions for financial  support.   These

are  early  indications of the hardship but  we  cannot  clearly

establish  if they are due to the current economic  slowdown  or

not.   How bad off are Singaporeans?  Who are the casualties  in

this regional crisis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Soo Sen this afternoon, in response to my question,

said that between the years 1996 and 1997, there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>

were only 41 applicants for the Interim Financial Scheme and the

Ministry only disbursed $11,000.  Are we saying that people  are

not   poor  enough?   Or  are  we  saying  that  the  forms  for

applications are too complicated that they have decided  not  to

fill  them?   Or are we saying the criteria for the  application

are too stringent, and maybe it is time to broaden the criteria?

I do not think we know the answers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a written response to me from MOM, it was reported that

out  of  80% of job placements for the retrenched workers,  only

10%  accepted  the referral.  This says to me that  workers  are

still choosy and therefore times are not as hard yet.  So I have

varying impressions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proposing that we set up a cross-agency fact-finding

task   force  comprising  Government  statisticians,  academics,

social  workers, and others, to conduct surveys to identify  the

distressed  in  our  midst, and to devise a  Singapore  specific

misery index with indices which are socio-economic in nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that we need to be cautious, not to travel on

the  slippery slope of welfarism as practised in some  developed

countries,  and we must not determine social policies  based  on

compassion and generosity alone, but on principles of efficiency

and  effectiveness.  We all appreciate the contingency  measures

recently  set  up by the various Ministries and  CDCs  to  offer

assistance to people with financial difficulties.  A question  I

would  then  raise  is:  when was the last  time  we  thoroughly

reviewed  our  social  security  schemes?   Are  these   schemes

adequate?  As other ASEAN states are now studying ways to create

their  social safety nets, is it time for us too to review  ours

and  identify  new ways of providing funding and infrastructural

support for the families, in view of the fact that this economic

downturn  may  well be the worst that Singapore and  the  region

have experienced in 50 years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A timely and well-considered policy evaluation exercise by

the  Government,  in conjunction with social services  agencies,

regarding  investment in social infrastructure as  well  as  the

creation of appropriate safety nets for our most needy, will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>

contribute both to our short-term economic recovery as  well  as

long-term well-being of a society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the motion moved

by  Mr Lim Swee Say is timely.  It is a time of crisis, although

I  do  not agree with some of the suggestions.  I think  we  are

going  through  an  economic crisis.  It is important  that  the

people and the Government rally together and come to grips  with

the problem and try to find the solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government can lead but it is equally important

for  the  people  to be led in such a way that they  will  reach

their  destiny.  We are fortunate than many other rulers in  the

region  are  worried about their political  fortune.   Here  the

ruling  Party does not have to worry about change of power  from

one  man  to another.  There is political stability  here.   The

banking system is still sound and this, I think, is a credit  to

our  political leadership and to the people for working hand-in-hand.  It is important for us, therefore, Sir, to see that  this

institution  is preserved.  Many a time we take it for  granted.

But when we look around the region, we realise how fortunate  we

are  for having a banking system that is sound.  Of course, some

of  us  feel  that  the bankers are trying to be  a  little  too

cautious in this period.  I would urge the MAS from time to time

to  give  the  bankers some indication, that they  should  be  a

little slow in enforcing claims.  Because I have heard from some

clients  that the bankers are asking for reassessment  of  their

loans, which they are entitled.  But unless these customers  are

in  danger  of collapsing, I think we must not pull the  carpet.

It is very important for the banking system, the institution, to

gain  the  confidence of the people.  I know that DPM  had  said

earlier  that  banking is a private institution, and  we  cannot

interfere.   But  I think the Government can take  the  lead  in

giving indication as to which way the banking sector should go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Vasoo mentioned very eloquently about the spirit.

I  think it is very important for us to have the fighting spirit

in  us.  What I am a little disappointed with some of the people

is  this.  There is some sector, and I give an example, where we

see very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>

young  able-bodied  men in early 30s, 40s, working  as  security

guards. What is the pay?  $1,000, $1,100.  My work in SINDA  has

led  me  to meet some of these people and talk to them.   And  I

asked:  "Why  can't   you be a driver?"  He  said,  "I  have  no

driving  licence."  I said, "Why don't you go and take a driving

licence?   It  will  take  some time."   He  said,  "Oh,  it  is

difficult.  I have got a family to support."  All he requires is

half  an  hour to one hour, three to four times a week, and  the

job  is  ready in the market.  Similarly, a restaurant  man  was

telling  me  that he is finding difficulty getting workers.   So

something  is  wrong here.  While some people are  losing  jobs,

there  are  other people who are happy with their  jobs.   So  I

share  the sentiments shown by earlier speakers that we must  at

all  costs  tell the people that they must upgrade.  And  unless

they  upgrade, unless the productivity increases, they  are  not

going  to  succeed.   Here again, Sir, if  I  could  share  with

Members  a  classic example of how an institution  went  out  of

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to have in early 1970s a company called the

Singapore  Traction Company.  Who were its  rivals?   More  than

half  a dozen Chinese bus companies.  They started with mosquito

buses.  I remember they carried 20 passengers.  But because  STC

did  not  know  how  to  change with the  time,  the  small  bus

operators  merged  together  and took  over  STC.   It  operated

through  a Charter.  It was guaranteed by the British government

through a charter.  But it did not know how to compete and  live

with  the  economic  realities of Singapore in  changing  times.

When  the  market was open, they could not compete.   Similarly,

Sir,  as  Mr  Lim  Swee  Say has said earlier,  we  have  to  be

conscious of not only the cost price but we must be in position,

as  our neighbours are going to have cheaper cost of production,

and  we must be seen to be very competitive.  Today, I think the

only solution is through productivity and education.  There  are

a  lot  of  Singaporeans who do not even have primary education.

The  WISE  and BEST programmes must be worked to such an  extent

that they are all gainfully employed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to another related issue. Again, I would like

to  draw from personal experience.  Over $60 billion is tied  to

property.  Every young Singaporean wants to upgrade from 4- to 5-room  flats  to  Executive flats to terrace  houses.   There  is

nothing wrong with being ambitious.  But let us have a sense  of

realism.   Can  we  afford at the end of  the  day  to  pay  the

instalments  in  case  there is a rise in interest  rates?   And

specially  so for those who have bought, let us say,  a  terrace

house  in 1995 for $1 million, it is probably now worth $700,000

to $800,000.  And if the bank suddenly decides to call back just

$100,000, where are they going to find this money to pay?  So my

appeal to all these people is to get their priority right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, through the Housing and Development Board,

has  built enough houses.  Nobody lives in the streets, save for

some  of  the  foreign workers.  We all have a  home.   Get  the

priority  right  by  having  some  savings.   And  I  am  really

surprised  when  I see young people, husband and  wife,  earning

$9,000 a month jointly, and they straightaway upgrade from a  4-room  flat to a terrace house.  Why must we be so much attracted

by  this  private  property?  Sir, I  have  a  private  property

because I could not qualify for HDB flat; otherwise, I will  opt

for it.  In fact, when I am older in my age, I probably would do

that.   There will be homes for the aged, I hope by  then.   HDB

will build them.  Sir, the question that we have to ask is:  can

we  afford?  I think this is where I would urge members  of  the

public to be very careful with these commitments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter is this. It is in times of crisis

that the community really is being examined, whether we are  one

social cohesive unit.  As has been told by Mdm Claire Chiang and

Dr  Lee Tsao Yuan earlier, we must feel for fellow Singaporeans.

I  am  not asking that if you have a whole loaf, give the  whole

thing to him, but share some of the suffering.  Those of us  who

could  afford  to  share a bit of our extra, give  it  to  them.

Talking  about  social cohesiveness, I think the Government  can

feel a sense of achievement.  Last Saturday, together with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Inderjit Singh, I attended a function organised by the  Sikh

community.   Very young Sikh boys and girls, who  are  secondary

school  students,  were  singing  in  Punjabi,  songs  based  on

Singapore's  national values, and I was really touched.   I  can

understand a little bit of Punjabi.  Hindi is my mother  tongue.

And I was really touched by these boys and girls, how they could

sing  the  core values of Singapore.  Ten years ago,  I  do  not

think  they  would  have  done it.   This  is  called  community

bonding.  The Minister for Community Development was there.   It

is  an  example of bonding of a community, small it may be.   We

were  told by Bhajan Singh, the Chairman of Sikh Advisory Board,

who  is  an educationist himself, how Sikhs have welfare schemes

to help those in need.  I thought it is something we can emulate

from them for the whole of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wanted to say many things but, unfortunately, most

of the things have been touched and I do not want to prolong the

debate longer than necessary.  Sir, this is the disadvantage  of

being the last few speakers.  Everybody has spoken what probably

you  wanted to.  But I just want to say one thing.  Whatever  we

do, we always must do, the Government and the people, and it  is

important that Government from time to time consult the  people,

not  after  it has taken the decision and then get the  feedback

from  the  people.   I think that is not correct.   Consult  the

Chambers  of  Commerce and the various professional groups,  get

their  inputs and see how the policy is going to be  implemented

to  help the community.  And I would say that the Government  is

concerned,  because  the  Government always  consults,  but  its

consultative process must go for some fine-tuning.  I  urge  the

Ministers  from  time  to time to consult Chambers  of  Commerce

because they are the most concerned people in this issue  and  I

share the sentiments of my fellow NMP Mr Tay Beng Chuan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the motion.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I have some doubts on this motion.  This motion

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>

urges  the Government to rally the support of the entire  nation

in  this  time of economic downturn to minimise unemployment  in

the  short  term  and  strengthen economic  competitiveness  and

social  cohesion for the long term so that Singapore will emerge

from this regional crisis even more competitive and resilient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, to unite all the people of the nation and to

enhance  social cohesion and the competitiveness of the  country

is something which a responsible government should be doing.  To

emphasise  that  point  in this time of economic  downturn,  the

Government should unite all the people.  In moving this  motion,

are  the  PAP  Members saying that the Government has  not  been

doing enough in this area?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, during the general election last year, in order

to  win  votes, the PAP Government used the HDB upgrading policy

which undermined the unity of our people and weakened our social

cohesion.  Now the PAP MPs are raising this motion to rally  the

support  of  the  entire  nation.  Is it  an  admission  of  the

mistakes committed during the last general election?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the focus of this motion is on unemployment and

the  economic  downturn.   Is it because  the  PAP  Government's

feeling  that  its economic trump card of urging  the  Singapore

people  to submit them in exchange for economic growth, for  the

creation  of wealth and for enhancement of assets is losing  its

effect and it has come to a sudden realisation of the importance

of  national  unity?  By right, the Government  and  the  people

should  work together.  This is something which of course should

be  done.   Yet,  during the election, the  PAP  Government  was

unable  to share the fruits of prosperity with those who opposed

them.   And  yet,  at this time of economic downturn,  they  are

asking  everybody  to  share the sufferings.   It  is  like  the

Emperor Qian in ancient China who sought company of the ugly but

resourceful  concubine when he was in trouble but  favoured  the

pretty but ineffective beauty when everything was fine.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all this, I would say that national unity and a

strong  sense of identity with the nation is the basis  for  the

prosperity of the nation.  Although the PAP Government  has  not

been  kind to the people, in this time of crisis, I support this

motion to rally the support of all the people in the nation.  To

rally the support of the entire nation and to enhance our social

cohesion,  I  feel  that the most important  thing  is  to  make

everyone in Singapore feel that he is a part of the country  and

he  is  being  treated fairly.  For the Government  to  get  the

support of all the people, it should treat every citizen fairly,

particularly  in  the  distribution of the  fruits  of  economic

success.   We  should look after the people  and  make  everyone

truly convinced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PAP Government is sincere in enhancing social

cohesion  and achieving the target of national unity,  first  of

all, it must remove the psychological barrier that prevents  our

people  from  being  united together  and  should  consider  the

following  suggestions.  First, we should remove  the  political

elements  in  the  conditions  for  HDB  flat  upgrading.   This

political  factor is that when all conditions are the same,  the

rate  of  support  for the PAP becomes a deciding  factor.   The

impression  given by the PAP in the last election was  that  the

housing  estates in the opposition constituencies will never  be

upgraded.   I  think the Government should clarify  this  point.

PAP  Government should also consider announcing the schedule  of

upgrading  of  flats in all constituencies in advance  to  prove

that its deed matches with its words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should amend the criterion for application of

CIPC funds from the Ministry of National Development so that the

opposition town councils can apply directly to the Ministry  for

CIPC  assistance  in  improving the facilities  of  the  housing

estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to open the MRT station in Potong Pasir. If they

feel  that  there is not enough volume of passengers, we  should

develop the nearby areas so that the residents in the opposition

wards  could  also benefit from that.  This will show  that  the

Government  makes  use of national resource without  favour  and

takes care of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>

every  citizen and in turn expresses the Government's  sincerity

in uniting the entire nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Government should remove GST and reduce the

various  charges.   Although  all these  suggestions  have  been

rejected  by  the Minister, the Government should  consider  the

feelings of the people.  At the time when everyone is facing the

impact  of  the economic downturn, especially the  lower  income

population  and those who lose their employment, the  Government

should respond to help by minimizing the pressure in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the Ministers should volunteer to take a pay cut,

although I understand that the pay cut by the Ministers will not

help  to  improve our economy.  But when the people  are  facing

economic  difficulties, as leaders of the nation  the  Ministers

volunteer to take a pay cut, it will have some positive effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, the PAP Government should frankly admit that the

prosperity and development of the Singapore economy is dependent

on  the  regional and world economy and not just on the economic

policies of the PAP Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the PAP will stop blowing its trumpet and

proclaim to be the saviour of Singapore and assuring the  people

during  the  general elections that they will have their  assets

enhanced  and their incomes will be increased year  by  year  as

though  the  PAP Government is omnipotent, they  can  solve  all

problems  and  help the people in every way.  This  resulted  in

people not seeing the need to be united in order to make use  of

the  strength  of  unity to help the nation pull  through  in  a

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier, to enhance our

social cohesion and to unite our people, the important factor is

to treat every Singapore citizen fairly.  The PAP Government has

been using the national resources to distribute unfairly to  the

people,  inducing  and  threatening  people,  such  as  the  HDB

upgrading programme, CIPC funds and infrastructural measures,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>

such  as  the MRT.  It has created a psychological barrier  that

prevents our people from being united.  This feeling is not only

in  the hearts of the people in the opposition wards, but it  is

also  something which has been disturbing every Singaporean  who

has a conscience.  The PAP should now realise that every citizen

has  its  own  contribution to Singapore.   The  PAP  should  be

magnanimous  to accommodate those who hold different  views  and

the  supporters  of  the  other political  camps.   If  the  PAP

Government  has  such  a heart, I believe that  we  can  enhance

cohesion, we can make all the people stand united and  create  a

home that belongs to us, our Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, on many

occasions in recent years, I have heard many top executives, top

businessmen,  educationists  and even  politicians,  complaining

that the long boom years have led to escalating costs, demanding

workers and lower productivity.  We should all somewhat  have  a

recession to moderate the untenable cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a tremendous economic slowdown or even a recession

coming.  Some people from the very same group complain and  they

cry  foul  and  ask  for  help.  So are  we  really  hypocrites?

Although this crash in East Asia has come too fast and too great

for most people to anticipate and be prepared, why are there  so

many  people out there who are affected by the crash?   Perhaps,

we  should re-examine ourselves and see whether we are all  part

of  the reason why the economy has turned sour.  Did we not  try

to  get  more gains out of the stock market or property  market?

Did we not try to get more pay to buy a second home or have more

overseas  holidays, without regard whether we  are  adding  more

value  to our jobs?  Collectively, yes.  Greed in people  drives

the market economy.  But that very market economy is sustainable

only  if  the  collective decisions or the expectations  of  the

players  are  rational.  When the decisions  become  irrational,

that  is,  when the speculative effect overwhelms the investment

effect or the cost overwhelms

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>

productivity,  the market has to correct itself  to  a  truthful

equilibrium position.  We should not cry now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, as a nation, as a people, we should take stock.

We  should  honestly  and  boldly be self-critical.   We  should

examine  our  systems for possible weaknesses,  reflect  on  our

mistakes and then tap on the internal and external resources  to

formulate  new  strategies to move on.   With  $100  billion  in

reserves,  our  economic situation is not in a state  of  panic.

But  we should not be complacent either.  Rather, we should  see

what  our  huge reserves and our people, that is the only  other

reserve we have, can serve to procure us a better future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to draw an analogy to a situation faced

by  a  large and cash-rich corporation like IBM a few years ago,

even  Microsoft,  two or three years ago,  when  they  faced  an

attack  on  the  Internet issue, and how  these  companies  with

bloating cost, with possibly unwise investment or wrong  product

lines,   had   eroded  their  competitiveness  in   the   global

marketplace.   So what would the CEO do?  The immediate task  of

the turnaround CEO would be to troubleshoot quickly by examining

their   strengths  and  weaknesses  internally  and  externally,

benchmark  its  own company against the best in the  world,  and

formulate  a  clear  strategy to rally its  employees  from  the

bottom to the top to work towards a new corporate goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe that, for a nation like Singapore, we

should  do  exactly  the same but on an even  larger  and  wider

scale,  covering  not only the economic issues  but  social  and

political  as well.  Before we can rally the people  round,  the

Government should face the economic crisis and take advantage of

it for future opportunities.  We should carry out a diagnosis to

find  out the symptoms and put forward a very clear plan stating

the  directions,  the  resources  required,  the  timeframe  and

possible belt-tightening measures that our people and businesses

have  to bear to cope with the economic slowdown and be prepared

for a brighter future.  Without the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>

plan, I do not think people can see the light at the end of  the

tunnel.  That is what they are feeling now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent economic forecast conducted by various agencies

shows  that  most  likely Singapore is going  to  have  negative

growth  for  the  third  and  fourth  quarters.   Barring   some

exceptional  turnaround,  we  are  definitely  heading   for   a

recession.   Hence, I think the Government should  not  hesitate

now  to  assert its leadership by declaring a very comprehensive

national  action plan that will help to mobilise and  unite  the

people as a cohesive force to resolve the economic problems.

The  citizens  of  Singapore  can lend  better  support  to  the

Government  if  they  are convinced.  The efforts  are  genuine,

workable,  comprehensive,  not  just  piecemeal,  haphazard   or

sectoral.   When  a person is feeling down, he needs  comforting

words.  In this trying moment, it is particularly necessary  for

the Government to be more sensitive to the nagging complaints of

its people.  To cite just a few examples, the typical complaints

are, as Mr Inderjit Singh has pointed out many times before, the

encroachment  into private business domain by the GLCs  and  the

resistance  to changes by Government departments.  For  example,

Mr  Lim Swee Say mentioned about the concept of price-minus  and

cost-plus, and also the lack of sensitivity or understanding  by

Government  administrators about the  problems  in  the  private

sector.  Another example would be  - of course, everybody  knows

about this - the ever rising business costs and, last,  the boom

and  bust  of  the  property  sector  and  its  related  banking

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few problems have been very well covered by all

the  Members  here earlier and I am not going to  elaborate  any

further.  The last one has been touched on by Mr Inderjit  Singh

and Mr Rai, but I think I want to elaborate more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, I think the property sector makes up too big a

chunk  in our whole economy.  Based on the Straits Times  report

last  week,  correct  me  if  I am wrong,  the  people  and  the

institutions in Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>

committed  $140 billion to the property sector.  Last  Saturday,

in  a  Chinese  paper,  there was a report  on  the  Accountant-General's  Report on the Government's net worth.  It  shows  net

assets  of  $251 billion.  Hence, even a primary school  student

can find out that the total commitment to property is equivalent

to 60% of the total assets of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, concerning the same matter, I understand that the

valuation  of  land  by the Government is based  on  the  moving

average  of recent land tenders.  Now I am going to give Members

some  examples.   Supposing the price of the  last  $10  billion

worth  of land is bidded up by 10%, that means somebody pays  $1

billion  extra  for  the $10 billion.  Then the  remaining  $130

billion would correspondingly rise by 10% too.  That is the  way

we value our land, and that is a $13 billion increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all the property owners are euphoric over this and the

banks,  of  course, feel very secure and they probably encourage

more  borrowing.  With more loans available, what happens?   The

borrowers  would buy more properties and so they chase  property

prices up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial institutions, whose traditional preferred

lending  policy  is  to  have property as  collateral,  actually

encourage the property sector to grow in this unhealthy  manner.

You  can imagine if you are an owner of a firm, you invest money

into  training your workers.  Would the bank lend you the money?

But  I  am  sure  if you use the money to pay  for  a  piece  of

property  and  mortgage it to the bank, the bank  will  be  very

happy.   So where is the line drawn?  Are we encouraging  people

to  buy property or are we encouraging people to put more  money

into  something less tangible?  Because of this practice,  as  a

very  prominent  foreign  banker  pointed  out,  the  banks   in

Singapore  probably  have not perfected their  skill  in  making

loans  in  any  other way but getting a piece of property  as  a

collateral.   So  in boom years, because of this lending  policy

and  because  the way land is being valued, the property  sector

grew disproportionately

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>

to the whole economy.  The banks' performance also exceeded that

of the GDP, year after year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the economic crisis prevailing in the region,

this issue is here to haunt us.  It is beginning to appear, from

what I read in the papers, that the country seems to be held  to

ransom  by  the  property  developers  and  the  banks,  because

everybody  worries that the bankruptcy of these companies  would

have  far-reaching repercussions.  So we have  to  address  this

issue.   The importance of addressing this issue cannot be  over

emphasised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an individual, the problem closest to my chest is the

fear  of not being able to maintain payments of a mortgage  loan

at   a   time  of  unemployment.   As  a  nation,  our  economic

competitiveness is also dragged down by the over  investment  in

low value added properties.  So I beg to urge the Government  to

confront this issue head on and do some clear thinking about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not here to speak against the developers and bankers.

I  am  not  here to beg the Government to subsidise the property

sector.  But I think the more sensible way to solve this problem

now  is  to  moderate the decline in property prices in  a  very

gradual way so that there will be a soft landing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the Government do now? I think the Government

should  immediately accelerate the creation  of  new  wealth  in

knowledge-based  economy,  as  Mr  Singh  has  pointed  out,  by

diverting  more  of our resources to human capital  and  to  the

promotion of new industries.  In the long run, we should  reduce

our  overall  exposure  to  properties  and  increase  high-tech

services  or,  as  Mr Lim described, the capability  competitive

sector, significantly.  And in the short term, to alleviate  the

unemployment problem, the Government should come out and  stress

the  need  for  workers to work harder and  smarter,  so  as  to

increase  productivity which is in a way translated into  better

chance  of keeping jobs.  The employers, of course, should  also

adopt a more positive attitude rather than the kind of pessimism

they seem to convey in the press.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>

should  improve themselves by emphasising on more skill training

for  their  workers and also get involved in  more  value  added

activities.   And,  of  course, the  Government  can  take  this

opportunity to show their concern, to establish rapport with the

businesses  by  helping them to search for new  strategies,  new

directions or new markets beyond the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Sir, I support the motion by sharing Mr Lim's

call  on the Government to blur the invisible line drawn between

me,  Government, and you, the private sector, and work  together

as a united force to brave the storms ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, we have come to almost the end of

the  debate  and  I do not think it would be useful  for  me  to

suggest any solutions to our economic problems, because I  think

most or nearly all the solutions have already been given in this

House today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my colleague, Mr Low Thia Khiang, the other Opposition

Member  in this House, I think we are particularly concerned  in

this  issue of social cohesion.  I support what Mr Low has said,

ie,  the Government should be fair to all citizens whether  they

are  in  the  Opposition  or whether  they  are  supporting  the

Government.   In good times, when the economy was  booming,  our

banks  were flushed with money, the Government spoke a different

language.   At the last election, the Government said,  "If  you

support the opposition, you will be last in the queue.  Probably

you  will  never  even see upgrading."  That kind  of  a  policy

alienates one section of the population from the other.  And we,

in  the  Opposition, have felt the alienation  policies  of  the

Government.   We  have  heard  threats  being  uttered  by   the

Government,  "that if you vote the Opposition  and  if  you  get

stuck in the lift, you should be rescued last."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, this was in the early days. The

opposition  ward shall be slow in getting public  services.   If

somebody  sets a fire in the lift, the police might  not  attend

even after a complaint has been lodged.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> This kind of threat tactics will

certainly  not  build a cohesive society.  Even now,  presently,

the  Opposition is being unfairly treated.  A simple application

for  the  use of land to fly kites or to hold a lantern festival

and  we  would  not get an early reply.  How  are  we  going  to

prepare  for  the event?  How are we going to send out  notices?

And  every time we ring up and ask about a simple answer to  the

application, they say, "We can't give you an answer now  because

the  answer from the top has not come down yet."  Sir,  the  way

the  Opposition is treated is really shameful.  So I  hope  that

the  Government,  if it wants a true cohesive society,  I  think

they   should  treat  the  Opposition  fairly  like  any   other

Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has spoken about the CIPC funds. Millions of

dollars  have  been  distributed  to  the  PAP  wards,  but  the

Opposition wards are not enjoying any of those funds.  Then when

we  talk of applications we wish to make, we always seem to  get

it  rather  slowly, whether it is for a licence to  speak  at  a

public dinner or whatever simple applications like that.   Then,

every  week,  we  have  to meet in the  void  deck  to  see  our

residents and other people from other parts of Singapore in  the

meet-the-people  sessions.  We do not have  a  proper  place  to

meet,  whereas the PAP MPs have got nice air-conditioned  rooms,

computer sets, everything.  But we, as I have said, are like the

Chinese  medicine sellers with one table and one  chair  at  the

void deck.  So I hope all these can change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, do the Opposition support the

Government  in times of difficulty?  Of course, we do.   We  are

Singaporeans.  We want to see Singapore do well.  We want to see

that  the economic downturn can go away very quickly.  Dr  Vasoo

has  spoken of the fact that we are all in the same boat. I know

we  are  all in the same boat, but we are not even in the  third

class.   Probably  we are in the bottom or in the  hull  of  the

ship.   Whereas the PAP and others who support them are  in  the

first class.  Nevertheless, if we sink, we all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>

sink together.  It is true that we are all in the same boat  but

I hope that there can only be one class and not several classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards this problem of the economic downturn, how do we

turn  around?  As the Deputy Prime Minister has said in  public,

the problem is external.  This is like a person getting flu.  We

have  to  go through the full cycle and then we get cured.   But

meanwhile, I think what we can do is to try to give a remedy  to

the symptoms to lighten the sickness.  I think Mr Tay Beng Chuan

has  already said and I think the Government should look at  the

problems   and   the  plight  of  the  small   business   people

sympathetically and if it can, I think it should lower  some  of

its  levies, its charges and lower the costs of all these  small

businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think in the long term, the important thing is

productivity.  Even foreign organisations have pointed out  that

Singapore  workers  have  got  a  bad  attitude  and  have   low

productivity.   I  have seen it with my own eyes.   We  were  in

Copenhagen once on some kind of a conference and we  were  in  a

lounge  of  a hotel.  I noticed that only one lady was  managing

everything,  collecting money, taking orders, being a  waitress,

serving, taking back all the used plates and crockery. Sometimes

she  was  assisted by a man who came out once  or  twice.   But,

basically,  it was one lady doing the work.  I have  never  seen

that  kind  of productivity in Singapore.  I hope we can  really

improve our productivity.

There  is  nothing wrong with our Singapore workers.   They  are

very  skilful.   I  think they can work if  they  want  to,  the

problem is attitude.  Singaporean workers have got something  in

them which is hard to describe.  They seem to be reluctant to be

as  productive as what they should be.  I think the  genesis  of

this attitude problem is our education system.  I think there is

a flaw in our education system.  All this streaming and dividing

the  sheep from the goat is bad for the child.  Right  from  the

early  age, the motivation of the child has already been killed.

In fact, there is negative motivation on the child.  As the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>

child  grows up, he just refuses to be cooperative.  He  refuses

to  contribute and be socially useful.  So there is  a  negative

attitude  about this type of children who have been  branded  in

the  early days as a failure, as a no-good, as a drop  out.   So

what  do you expect him to be?  If you tell me that I am a drop-out, I am no good, what do you expect me to be?  I think for the

long-term of Singapore, not just for quick turn around  in  this

economic downturn, the education system of our country has to be

looked at hard.  I have spoken against streaming at an early age

since 1984 and the problem is always there.  I was in Parliament

in  1984  and  they  were saying that half  of  our  600,000-odd

workers  did  not even have an education.  They were illiterate.

They  did not know how to read.  They did not know how to write.

They  cannot  recognise  numbers.  How  are  they  going  to  be

productive? Today, we still hear the same thing.  700,000 of our

workers have got no secondary education.  As for retraining,  it

is  only  5,000 of them.  That is not good enough.  We  have  to

revamp  the education system across the board and only if  their

productivity is high, then their wages are justified.   This  is

the message that I want to tell the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is attitude. We should give the dignity to

our  labourers.   There  is dignity in  labour.   That  must  be

recognised.  If a person has to work with his hand,  so  be  it.

But  he can be proud of it and be good at it.  Whether he  is  a

cook  or  a  carpenter, if he is good at it, then  society  must

respect  him  for  what he can do, and not stress  too  much  on

academism, brain work and degrees.  In fact, a former Member  of

this  House  has already pointed out that there is too  great  a

disparity   of  wages  between  manual  workers  and  university

graduates.   If  you  go  to  a western  country,  you  will  be

surprised  to note that a carpenter can earn just as much  as  a

university graduate.  But I am just trying to say that his skill

is recognised by society and he is paid for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans can be educated to get rid of their negative

motivation  and be taught initiative, leadership,  and  work  on

their own instead of always being supervised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>

I  think  one  of the problems of foreign workers -   they  have

almost  nil productivity - is because they have to be supervised

all the time.  I have seen that in the Town Council.  As soon as

you leave the foreign workers alone, off they go somewhere else.

They  would  not  be  working  anymore.   So  they  have  to  be

supervised every minute of the day.  That is the problem.  I  do

not  think  we want our workers to be like that.   We  want  our

workers to be responsible and to show initiative.  If you  leave

them on their own, you pay them a day's wage, they will give you

a day's work.

<br>5.33 pm

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, I support the motion standing in the names of Mr

Lim Swee  Say and Mr Seng Han Thong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing the problems of employment and employability,

it is important to understand the nature of this crisis, because

what  we  do must be in accord with the dynamics of this crisis.

This  is the biggest event sweeping Asia since the Second  World

War.   It is a big thing.  Already it has brought down a  number

of   national  leaders,  like  General  Chaovalit  in  Thailand,

President  Suharto  in  Indonesia, Prime Minister  Hashimoto  in

Japan.  It contributed to the election of Kim Dae Jung in  South

Korea and President Estrada in the Philippines.  It is not  over

yet. We know it is not over yet because the fundamental problems

have not yet been resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is, of course, the Japanese economy, which is two-thirds of the Asian economy. The old political consensus in

Japan  has broken down.  Today, it does not matter how brilliant

you are as a Minister or as a civil servant.  Within that sticky

rice  culture,  it is very difficult to effect  change.   Within

Japan  itself,  there is no great sense of  a  crisis.   Because

Japan is unable to re-stimulate her economy, the effects of  the

Asian  crisis  have  not  only  not  been  contained,  they  are

increasingly being felt in North America and in Europe.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would have read in yesterday's newspapers President

Clinton using the argument to Congress to persuade them to cough

up  more  money for the IMF, that if they do not, and the  Asian

crisis  is not stabilised, it will in the end drag down  the  US

economy.  These are large forces not within our control. We have

to  observe  them closely and carefully, the way a farmer  would

try to estimate the effects of an El Nino.  There is nothing you

can  do about an El Nino.   But you can dig reservoirs, you  can

protect yourself, and this is the approach that we should  take.

This   is  completely  different  from  the  1985/86  recession.

Therefore,  we should not be too quick to apply the  lessons  of

1985/86  recession  to this current economic downturn,  just  as

generals  have always been advised, never, never  to  fight  the

last war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, a big change in the larger situation,

the  dollar-yen relationship.  In 1985, the Japanese yen was 250

yen  to US$1.  The Americans complained that it was too low, and

they had this current account deficit.  During the Plaza Accord,

they  forced  Japan to revalue the yen, and within three  years,

from the Plaza Accord in 1985 to 1988, the yen rose from 250 yen

to  US$1, to 130 yen to US$1.  If you look at the graph, that is

just  one  movement.  But it created a sea change  in  Southeast

Asia,  because  an expensive yen led to an outflow  of  Japanese

capital  out  of  Japan  and a lot of  it  found  its  way  into

Southeast    Asia.     Malaysia   had    good    infrastructure,

administrative  and  physical  infrastructure,   they   were   a

beneficiary.   So was Thailand.  The Plaza Accord was  in  1985,

and by the end of 1986/87, Malaysia and Thailand were on a boom.

We  were  coming out of the recession and we were  swept  along.

Indonesia  had a boom later in 1988/89.  China after  Tiananmen,

June 4th 1989, by 1990/91, ethnic Chinese capital from Southeast

Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong went in, and that in turn sparked off  a

Chinese boom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese economy is huge. It dominates most of Asia.

So  that 50% change in the value of the yen led to an in-rushing

tide which brought prosperity to all of Southeast Asia.  It  was

supplemented by a revaluation of Korean Won and the Taiwan

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>

NT.   So  in addition to the capital flow from Japan, there  was

also  the  capital flow from the NIEs.  Let us now look  at  the

events of the last few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of 1995, it was 80 yen to a dollar. Today,

1998,  it  is about 143, 144, 145 yen to a dollar.   Within  the

same  period  of three years, the yen has moved the  other  way,

about  50%.   Because  of it, it has an enormous  contractionary

effect  on  the  economies of all of Southeast Asia.   In  other

words, what we are talking about are huge tidal flows over which

we  have no control because the yen-dollar relationship  is  not

dependent  upon what happens in Southeast Asia.  It is dependent

upon  the  complex interaction between the US  economy  and  the

Japanese  economy.  The key contradiction now is that Japan  has

no  capacity  to  lead internationally, even though  it  is  the

world's  greatest creditor country.  America is the only leading

superpower left in the world but it is also the world's greatest

debtor  country.   It  is a complex relationship  suffused  with

policy and other implications.  But that relationship plays dice

with  our  lives.   The  question now is,  this  tide  which  is

receding,  how  long will it recede?  The last tide  brought  10

years  of  prosperity to Southeast Asia. This tide, we  hope  it

will  turn  around quickly, but I do not see it  turning  around

yet, and we have to wait, and have to wait anxiously, and in the

meantime  take all necessary precautions.  We hope for the  best

but prepare for the worst.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of boom in Southeast Asia led to a period of

excess.   Suddenly money was easy.  Borrow American  dollars  on

the short term.  Institutions were weak and capital markets were

opened freely before the regulatory structures were in place. So

they  became very vulnerable to short term capital flows.   This

happened in particular in Thailand and Indonesia.  Worse,  there

grew  in Southeast Asia, political structures which were  fueled

by  easy money.  Politically connected vested interest got rich,

because they were near centres of power.  All that was fine  and

a  wonderful game to play when the tide was coming in.  Now when

the tide is receding, all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>

those  poorly  built structures have either  collapsed  or  have

become very shaky.  During high tide, the water looks very  calm

and beautiful.  During low tide, all the sins and wreckage show.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are completely affected. Because we are,

as  it  were, in the middle of that tidal cross flow.  We cannot

fight the tide.   If we fight the tide, we are sure to lose.  We

must float with the tide.  We are feeling it.  There is a lot of

pessimism  in Singapore, not all of it justified.   We  have  to

revise  our growth projections downwards every few months.   And

as  Mr  Lim  Swee  Say  and  many MPs  have  spoken  about  this

afternoon, unemployment is growing and will continue to grow for

a  while  yet.  But unlike many of the countries around us,  our

fundamentals  are  strong.  This is where I profoundly  disagree

with Mr Low Thia Khiang who said that when we were successful we

blew our trumpet.  Now when the tide is down, we should take the

blame.  We never took liberties with ourselves.  Even when times

were  good, we were frugal.  In fact, the PAP Government  had  a

certain  reputation  for  being very  careful  with  money,  and

watching  the  cents.  We were like Joseph in Egypt.   Years  of

plenty,  rather  than squandering the money, we carefully  built

warehouses, stashed away whatever we could, whatever we did  not

consume,   wasting  not  a  grain,  because  we  were  preparing

ourselves  mentally for difficult times.  I hope  the  difficult

times  will not be as long as in the Bible, but still we  cannot

be sure.  We should not take liberties with ourselves, as we did

not when times were good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, as a number of speakers have pointed out

this  afternoon,  there have been a few excesses  in  Singapore,

particularly in the property market.  Young people  became  very

ambitious, leverage themselves to the eye balls, and are now  in

trouble.  It is sad that every generation must learn its lessons

for  itself, that whatever their parents may have to tell  them,

they must make their own mistakes before an internal balance  is

found.   But because our infrastructure is basically strong  and

our  system  is  basically  sound, I  think  that  lesson  comes

relatively cheap.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial, as Mr Lim Swee Say and many MPs have

said, that whatever the situation, whether the tide is coming in

or   going  out,  that  we  maintain  our  relative  competitive

position.  Take no chances.  Always assume that things will  get

a  bit worse.  It is like running with lead weights.  If you  do

not  have to wear those weights, you fly.  Here, we have got  to

worry  about not just short term investment conditions  but  the

long term, as Mr Inderjit Singh has said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is to convince domestic and international investors

that  Singapore runs a tight ship, that our core  philosophy  is

that  there is no free lunch in the world.  That if  we  make  a

good  living it is because we are of service to others.  No  one

owes  us a living.  If we have something in the kitchen, we have

something in the living room, it is because we work hard for it.

We  must  continue to project this philosophy to  all  potential

investors, foreigners and Singaporeans, that whatever we need to

do,  we  will  do.    There are no sacred cows.   There  are  no

mindsets.  If we have to adjust, we will adjust.  That  is  all.

Because  if we do not adjust, if we become paralysed or ossified

in  our present position, then we will be swept aside.  That  is

all.   I  think most Singaporeans understand this.   And  it  is

because  they understand this that we continue to do  well.   In

fact,  when  I  listened to the many Members of  Parliament  who

spoke  today, except for the two Opposition MPs who have to  say

something,  on  the whole, there were really no  sides  to  this

debate.   On the fundamentals of competitiveness and  having  to

make  a  living  in the world, on education, on  discipline,  on

collective  effort, there is no disagreement.  And this  is  the

great strength of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries in Asia today, because of economic

astringency,  very  quickly  the  economic  problem  becomes   a

political problem, and the fracture quickly finds its way to the

core, because powerful vested interests are involved.  I support

A,  he  wins,  I am millions of dollars richer; he loses,  I  am

finished.   If B wins, he wins, and so on.  But in  our  system,

complete   rationality,  complete  objectivity.   If   this   is

something that must

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>

be done, let us do it.  We can disagree honestly, but not on the

basis of your vested interest versus his vested interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You remember last year before the crisis, we established

the  CSC,  the Committee to look at Singapore's competitiveness,

chaired  by  Minister Mr Lee Yock Suan.  And no sooner  had  the

Committee  sat for two or three sessions, we were straight  into

the  downturn.   At  each  meeting it was  a  different  set  of

circumstances than the previous one.  So we have had  to  adjust

our position.  When we started, a top item on the agenda was job-hopping,  and many papers were written on how to stop  the  job-hopping problem - very creative policy adjustments to stop  that

problem.  Today, that problem has completely evaporated.  We  do

not   even  talk  about  it.   The  problems  are  unemployment,

restructuring, competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has been meeting, its sub-Committees have

been working very hard.  The report will come out at the end  of

the  year.  And many of the ideas have already been incorporated

in  the  meantime.  It is economic competitiveness  in  the  end

which will solve the problem of employment and employability  in

Singapore;   nothing  else.   And  to  maintain   our   economic

competitiveness, there are two things that you have to watch out

for, and they never change.  One is our cost structure.  It does

not  mean  that we cheapen ourselves.  Cost structure  does  not

mean  that we must be the cheapest in town.  We offer value  for

money, but we must watch the cost structure to make sure that we

are not out of whack.  Secondly, and this is an endless task, we

must continually increase productivity and efficiency.  This  is

an endless game.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost structure. Lowering business cost was, of course, the

focus  of Dr Richard Hu's off-Budget measures which came  to  $2

billion.  If you look at the exchange rates, we can be in danger

of  being  uncompetitive.   Around  us,  Malaysia,  Philippines,

Thailand,  they  have  gone down close to 40%,  Indonesia,  much

more.  We have only gone down 15% to 20%.  Of course, Hong  Kong

has maintained the peg.  So they are above us.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>

as  any  of us who has travelled in the region will know, things

look  incredibly cheap in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and  the

Philippines.  So if we are not careful, very quickly investments

can  flow out of Singapore into the region around us.   We  have

got  to  watch  the  cost  structure, and  make  sure  that  all

components of costs are kept as low as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to fiddle with the exchange rate, because

the  reason  why the Singapore dollar is viewed with  such  high

regard  in  the  region  and  why so many  ten  thousand  dollar

Singapore  notes  are in circulation in the  region  is  because

there  is  a deep trust in its value.  And I would say  that  it

lies  at the core of our financial system.  The easy way a  weak

government would take is to lower the Singapore dollar,  devalue

it.   And  then you get a flush, things may appear  better,  but

long-term problems are not solved.  And I do not think we should

use the Singapore dollar to solve this problem.  Instead, let us

be   trim  and  flexible.   If  we  have  to  make  adjustments,

Government, workers, unions, everybody together, we  make  those

adjustments,  take the decisions, and not toy  around  with  the

Singapore dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land cost, rental cost, because of the boom years, they

have  gone out of line.  So they are coming down.  I think  they

will have to ease to a lower level.  We want a soft landing.  We

do  not  want  a major destabilisation of our financial  system.

And  I  think the market will gradually correct itself,  and  we

should  be in a more competitive situation in the coming  years.

Of  course, when the tide comes in again, then we will float  up

again.  But in the meantime, do not take it for granted.  Let us

ease ourselves into the lower position so that rentals are lower

and business costs are lower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Tay Beng Chuan and other MPs have said, we must also

watch Government levies, Government fees and taxes, and whatever

causes  problems, and where we can make adjustments, we  should.

But  this  is really for the Finance Minister to decide  and  we

have to wait till

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>

next  March for new measures to be announced, if and when  those

measures are deemed to be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major component is, of course, wage level,

especially  in the service industry where it can  be  more  than

half of total cost.  In many manufacturing sectors, it could  be

up  to 40%.  We have got to allow wages to adjust.  Mr Lim  Swee

Say  said  that to be pro-employment is to be pro-business.   In

the  old  days,  that would have been considered  a  reactionary

remark.   Today, that is a very progressive remark.  To be  pro-employment is to be pro-business.  Because if the businesses  do

not  survive, where is the employment?  So we have got to  watch

our  wage  levels,  accept  that  it  varies  from  industry  to

industry,  from  company  to  company  but,  at  the  least,  we

restrain;  at  the  most, we prepare for adjustments.   We  have

built up over the years now a variable component of up to 20% in

the  public  sector  and maybe 16% in the  private  sector.   We

should  be  prepared to go into those before talking  about  the

CPF.  But even if it means talking about the CPF, so be it.   No

sacred  cows.  Whatever we need to stay competitive.   And  that

must  be  the impression we give to foreign and local investors.

This   Government,  this  society,  these  people   called   the

Singaporeans,  they  will do everything  necessary  to  stay  in

business, and we intend to stay in business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, of course, minimise unemployment. But

minimising  unemployment  must not mean  stopping  unemployment.

That  will be very dangerous.  The Ministry of Manpower has  set

up  a tripartite retrenchment panel so that companies which have

to  retrench  would give early warning, and try to  prepare  the

workers  for  it.  We have the SRP.  We have various  funds  and

programmes to help retrain them and to get them new jobs so that

the  pain  is minimised.  But if that company, if the  industry,

cannot  sustain that level of employment, their unemployment  is

inevitable, we should not stop it.  It is part of the process of

adjusting.   We have got to float with the tide.  If  we  anchor

ourselves when the tide is shifting, we will be in trouble.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan spoke at length about the plight of the

SMEs  and  how many of them are in pain.  There is  a  liquidity

crunch and the LEFS programme which is introduced can only  help

some of them.  I think we should do all that we can to make life

easier  for  them  but we must accept that whatever  we  do,  we

cannot save everybody.  If we try to save everybody, we will  be

in  deep  trouble.  But those whom we can save, we should  save.

The  LEFS  is being extended in order to allow more to be  taken

in.   But  at  the  end  of  the day,  the  banks  must  decide.

Government is only co-financing.  The banks must decide who will

survive and who will not.  Yes, if we can raise the level of the

water  by  one  inch more, more will be saved;  but  it  is  not

possible to freeze things in position.   That will be the  wrong

strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is on the cost side. Then on the productivity and

efficiency side, there are many things that we have to do.   The

key  in  the  end  is  the individual.  We  can  have  the  best

infrastructure. We can have all the programmes,  all  the  bells

and whistles, but if the individual does not make the effort and

does  not try harder, nothing can be done.  And all our  efforts

are to enable the individual to help himself.  Unless he is sick

or  an invalid, there should be a way out for him through one of

our programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SRP was initiated by the NTUC, together with the SNEF

and  the  Government.   SDF put in $50 million.  The  Government

threw in another $50 million.  And recently the Government added

another $20 million.  So they set up a skills development centre

and  introduce a whole range of courses.  In other  words,  when

the  economic agencies sense there are areas of potential growth

which   can  take  additional  employment,  we  put  out   these

indicators, encourage those who might be unemployed  to  upgrade

themselves and try.  But, of course, as many MPs have  said,  it

may  mean  that they have to travel further.  It may  mean  that

they  have  to work shifts.  It may mean that they have  got  to

convert from white collar to blue collar.  But so what?   I  was

in  Thailand  two  or  three weeks ago.   There  was  this  Thai

businessman whose company had gone bust, and he now sells

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>

sandwiches.  The newspapers have been reporting on him.   He  is

bubbly  and very cheerful about it, and in a very wonderful  way

he has given heart to a lot of Thai people.  And if Singaporeans

make   that  effort,  I  do  not  think  that  the  problem   of

unemployment  will get out of hand.  To begin  with,  there  are

hundreds  of  thousands of work permit holders in Singapore  and

many of their jobs can in fact be taken over by Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must educate every individual to the fullest possible.

Mdm  Claire  Chiang has talked about social infrastructure.   We

are  spending  a  lot  of money on building up  our  educational

infrastructure.   Not  just a formal school  system  of  primary

schools, secondary schools, ITEs, polytechnics and universities,

but  also life-long education, so that all of us are used to the

idea of going back to school to update ourselves, whether it  is

on  Windows,  whether it is on computer-aided manufacturing,  or

whatever.   Eventually, what we hope is for all our institutions

to  become "one institute, two systems"  - one system for  those

who  come  out from school; the other for those who  are  coming

back from working life in order to upgrade themselves.  And that

is  the kind of society that we must become, the kind of culture

that  we must have.  Never stop learning.  Always have a  child-like curiosity for what is new, and try.  Fail, never mind;  try

again.   Fail again, never mind; try again.  In the  end,  learn

something.   And  if  we cannot master these  skills  ourselves,

encourage  our  younger  brothers  or  sisters,  encourage   our

children  and grandchildren to master them, because it  is  good

for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are preparing for something which we know will come, in

the  21st  century,  when  wealth  is  increasingly  based  upon

knowledge, not land or raw materials or natural resources but on

human  minds  and the knowledge in those human minds  and  their

ability  to network together.  This is why we have been  pushing

IT; we have been pushing Singapore One and encouraging our young

children to prepare themselves for that kind of a world.   Then,

however  that  world changes, you will still come up  against  a

computer,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>

you  will still come up against Windows; you will still come  up

against  Internet,  and  you  make  the  necessary  adjustments.

Whether in a restaurant, in a bank, in a shopping centre, in the

SAF,  whatever,  it  does not matter.  Put  someone  before  the

computer  screen  and he is there hammering away,  no  sense  of

being intimidated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other things that we should do too, like

encouraging entrepreneurship and so on.  These are all long-term

efforts.   If we can make 1% improvement a year, we  would  have

done  well.  It is not something which will change the situation

rapidly.  EDB has mounted an Industry 21 programme which targets

not  just  manufacturing  but also  manufacturing  services.   I

announced some of the details in June this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporations will also have to restructure. We must

help them to restructure.  We must not, through threats or moral

pressure,  make  it more difficult for them to restructure.   Dr

Lee  Tsao  Yuan talked about POSB.  Why not we slow the  process

down,  make it easier for those who have loans from POSB and  so

on?    Yes,   in  every  case,  it  is  better  to   hold   back

restructuring.   But there is also a heavy price  when  we  hold

back  restructuring. Because every year lost is a year  lost  to

competitors.  And at a time like this, I do not think  that  our

instinct  should  be  to  hold things  in  place,  but  to  help

individuals, corporations make the adjustments.  But whether  or

not  POSB can lengthen by a year the grace period, that  is  for

POSB  to decide.  But we must remember that, at the end  of  the

day, all restructuring is difficult.  It is never easy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important things that we should pay

attention  to in this period is to fight political  pressure  to

make life more difficult for foreign talent and foreign workers.

At  a  time  like this, the easiest thing to do and to  say  is,

"Let's  keep the foreigners out.  Save the jobs for Singaporeans

and  treat it as a zero sum game."  And at the political  rally,

on  a  soapbox, one can make quite a stirring speech.  Our trade

unionists can make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>

quite  a  stirring  speech on this.  Therefore,  at  a  critical

period like this, it is very important that all of us, PAP  MPs,

Opposition MPs, NMPs, all of us, hold to this position  that  we

need foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have these foreign workers, our economy will

seize  up.   Let  us  say, for electronics  companies,  40%  are

foreign  workers.  Without that 40%, there will be  no  60%  for

Singaporeans,  is  it not?  Without foreign  workers,  who  will

build our homes, our MRT line, who will repair our ships?  There

are  many areas which Singaporeans would not want to do even  if

they  are quite hard up.  And we need foreign workers for  those

jobs.   And  at  all  times,  there  are  imbalances.   We  need

machinists, we need computer programmers, we need restaurateurs,

and  so  on,  bring them in.  Of course, where a Singaporean  is

equal  to  a  foreigner,  prefer  the  Singaporean,  choose  the

Singaporean.  We do not have to say this.  Instinctively,  every

Singaporean  employer, for reasons of cultural  affinity,  would

prefer  a  Singaporean.   If he has to choose  between  whom  to

retrench,  a  Singaporean or a foreigner, and they are  more  or

less the same, I have no doubts in my mind that he will retrench

the  foreigner, not the Singaporean.  So I do not think this  is

such a serious problem.  But we must not allow this issue to  be

politicised or polemicised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we talk about foreign talents, it is even more

important.   Our  universities,  our  research  institutes,  our

financial  sector, in many areas, without foreigners, we  cannot

maintain this high level of performance.  In fact, at the higher

reaches, the majority may have to be foreigners.  If you look at

the  economy of London, or the economy of Tokyo, or the  economy

of  New York, how many are local to London or New York or Tokyo.

If  you  tell  the  City  of London that you  can  only  recruit

Londoners, I think the City of London might as well pack up.  So

in  the same way, to maintain the kind of economy that we  have,

we  have  got  to  have a free flow of talents  coming  in  from

outside, and this is very important.  But as I said, this  is  a

subject  on which it is very easy to make stirring speeches  and

get the ground worked up in the wrong direction.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>

Therefore  it is incumbent upon all of us who have  a  sense  of

responsibility  to hold this ground because on  it  depends  our

long-term   survival   and   the   long-term   employment    and

employability of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS, OCBC, you notice recently, having to restructure and

adjust  to a new situation, both of them have recruited  foreign

CEOs.  Should we stop them?  That would be stupid, would it not?

In  fact,  I  will go a step further.  All over the region  now,

bright,  able, dynamic entrepreneurial people have gone bankrupt

or are without jobs.  Should we not, selectively, encourage some

of  them  to come into Singapore so that when the tide comes  in

again,  we will have a thick layer of entrepreneurs and  foreign

talent  to take our economy even further into the next  century?

If  Hong Kong, in 1949, did not get that outflow of talent  from

Shanghai,  and  Hong  Kong in 1949 was  not  a  very  prosperous

economy, would Hong Kong have done as well as it did?  If Taiwan

did  not  get  the one million mainlanders, would the  Taiwanese

have  achieved  that kind of progress which they achieved?   The

one  million was the cream of a whole continent.  So  we  should

have  the instinct and the wisdom at a time like this to welcome

foreign talent into Singapore so that when times improve  again,

we will take off in double quick time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the key to all this is political unity and social

cohesion, a point raised by almost all MPs this afternoon.  This

crisis  will  put  our society under stress.  It  will  put  our

institutions  under  stress,  it  will  put  corporations  under

stress,  it will put every family under some kind of stress.   I

do not think any family is unaffected by it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have welfare? I listened to Mr Lim Boon Heng

yesterday  saying  that we should not have a  retrenchment  fund

because  this can impede our long-term competitiveness.   And  I

think  we  are  very lucky that, in Singapore, the  trade  union

movement understands this profoundly.  If we have welfarism  and

get ourselves into the European position, then we are sowing the

seeds  of  future  problems for years and years  to  come.   The

European economies are doing quite well now, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>

their  unemployment levels remain stubbornly at well  over  10%.

Why  is this?  Because of overly generous retrenchment benefits.

There  is a tremendous moral hazard involved.  So we must  guard

against  this.   We can have welfare, yes.  If a breadwinner  is

unemployed, children need school books, school fees,  assistance

from  MCD,  yes,  help  him, help him to get  a  job,  help  the

children  remain in school, do his examinations, get jobs  later

on.   And  in  every CDC now, we have a whole slew of programmes

through  various  NGOs and grassroots organisations  to  provide

help.   During  the boom years, I think many of us,  in  various

constituencies, had to go around persuading children to take  up

bursaries  and  scholarships.  Maybe in the coming  years,  they

will come on their own.  But I think we have the programmes  and

if  we  need  many more such programmes, so be it.   But  always

watch the moral hazard and do not allow an attitude of welfarism

to  seep in, then it is by right, and if you do not give  me,  I

will  vote  against  you.   Because once  we  settle  into  that

position, it is well-nigh impossible to get out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we done poorly? Mr Low Thia Khiang said that we

discriminated against certain Singaporeans.  Mr Chiam  See  Tong

said that we discriminated against his kite fliers and that  his

MPS  is  conducted  in  the void deck  instead  of  in  an  air-conditioned  room.    If you look at the bottom  5%  to  10%  of

Singaporeans of any race, we are far better off than  any  other

city  in  the world.  Our bottom 5%-10% are better looked  after

than  the  corresponding groups in Tokyo, or New  York,  or  Los

Angeles,  anywhere in the world. And it is because of this  that

we  are  socially very stable.  Yes, in minor things, these  are

part  of  the rough-and-tumble of democratic politics.   But  on

major  things,  we  provide a solid base  for  all  Singaporeans

regardless of race, language, religion or political affiliation.

Mr Chiam knows this.  When he talked about fires in Potong Pasir

not  being fought by the Fire Brigade, or crimes in Potong Pasir

ignored  by  the Police, he knew he was joking.  If he  was  not

joking, I say we should have a proper debate in this House and a

proper Commission of Inquiry for the Fire Service

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>

and the Police Department.  It was a joke and we should take  it

in that spirit and not pursue the matter much further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at a time like this when economic conditions are hard,

human societies turn inwards.  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua talked about how

her  friends complained to her about the $5 billion aid we  gave

to the Indonesians.  There is a lot of carping, "If you can give

Indonesians $5 billion, why cannot you help me?"  To begin with,

let  us  get  the facts right.  That $5 billion  have  not  been

disbursed  because the IMF programme under which we  rode  along

has  not  been implemented.  We are helping Indonesia  in  other

ways,  through  trade  financing, humanitarian  assistance,  our

investment in natural gas, by maintaining operations  in  Batam,

Bintan and the Riau Islands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it right at a time like this for Singaporeans also to

turn  inwards and ignore our neighbours?  I think that would  be

wrong   because   we  are  then  sowing  seeds   for   long-term

difficulties.   How  can we turn our back  because  Singaporeans

want  help?  The majority of Indonesian workers earn  less  than

S$1 a day to support an entire family.  Their future is in their

own hands.  There is not very much we can do to help.  But if we

can help in small ways, we should, and we are.  There is nothing

wrong with that and we should not be defensive about it.  It  is

in  our  own  enlightened self-interest to help  our  neighbours

because our destinies are intertwined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, I hear some MPs talk about some of

our  Malaysian  friends making unkind remarks  against  us.   We

should  be  principled and firm.  We should  not  be  taken  for

granted.  And at a time like this, Singaporeans should have  the

instinct  to bunch together.  Last week, a friend of  mine  from

the SAF, he used to be a senior doctor in the SAF, called me up.

He  said,  "I  want to see you urgently."  I said, "Come,  let's

have lunch together."  He was very unhappy because he works in a

private hospital and in the doctor's room, one Singaporean  came

in and railed against the Singapore Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>

for  being difficult with Malaysia.  He said that we should just

give  in.   CPF, return it.  CIQ, why do you want  to  make  all

these  changes?   This friend of mine was  so  angry.   We  were

friends  in the SAF for many years.  He said he gave him  a  40-minute lecture and all the other Singaporeans in the common room

became  very  encouraged, and some of them also spoke  up.   The

Malaysian doctors in the room kept quiet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time like this, it is crucial that we bunch together,

that  we  have  the  instinct that,  "Look,  we  must  help  our

neighbours,  but in a way which is proper and principled."   And

we  cannot  assume that this regional crisis will  not  lead  to

political  crisis in various parts of the region.   Many  things

can  go  wrong.   The horrible events of May in  Indonesia  were

triggered  off  by  the  regional economic  crisis.   Other  bad

things, other evil things can happen in the region.  We have got

to  be careful, we have got to be mentally prepared for it.   We

cannot turn inwards.  The other day, I was very cheered.  I  was

talking  to  Teo Chee Hean about the SAF.  He told me  that  the

morale  of  the senior SAF officers is very high.  I  felt  very

good  about it because if, at a time like this, our SAF officers

are weak-kneed, then we might as well pack up and go, is it not?

We  have got to, especially at a time like this, go out  of  our

way to help those who are in difficulties but to help them in  a

way which does not create long-term problems for ourselves.  And

I think on the whole, Singaporeans have that instinct.  There is

a certain resilience which our people have got.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEE Exhibition has been a tremendous success. I have

not  heard  a  single negative remark about the Exhibition.   We

extended  it  by  six  days but within one  afternoon,  all  the

tickets  were  snapped up.  Why is this?   It  is  because  when

Singaporeans  look  back  upon  their  past,  upon  what   their

forefathers have done, what an earlier generation of leaders had

brought  us through, they felt proud and their morale  went  up,

and we must build upon this.  And what we really must have is  a

certain spirit of resilience, pak buay see (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) kind of

spirit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>

However the situation turns, we will survive; we will find a way

to prevail; we will find a way to compete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said at a time like this, Ministers

should  take  a pay cut.  I am glad to tell Mr Low  Thia  Khiang

that  Ministers  will take a pay cut because  our  salaries  are

pegged.  The salaries in the private sector have gone down  and,

with  a time lag, Superscale salaries will also go down.  So  he

need not be too worried about this subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> MP's allowances?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> And so will our allowances too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is: if we do not make major mistakes, our boat

will  stay  afloat.  We must be prepared for what can  become  a

long  haul, all working together, all at battle station,  alert,

Government, employers, trade unionists, social workers,  looking

after  each other.  If someone falls over, a lifeboat;  a  dent,

quick repair; a leak, plug it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be seven years of famine? I hope not. But can

we  be sure?  And should we be so reckless as to say, "Let us in

one  decisive  move raise this boat when the  tide  is  ebbing."

Some  friends  have  told me, they said,  "Government  has  been

saying reserves are for a rainy day.  Now there is a storm.  Now

is  the time to spend the reserves."  The storm has just started

and  we have got to husband our resources carefully.  And if  we

do  it  carefully, not losing our nerves, but with a quiet sense

of  self-possession and self-confidence, we will sail this boat,

position  it well and when the tide comes in again, we  will  be

far ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will take some knocks. There will be casualties and a

few  Singaporeans may even lose heart and leave  Singapore.   In

the  1985-86 recession, we had a small outflow.  And  this  time

round, there may be a small outflow again.  But the majority  of

us,  I think, will stay and we will bunch together and keep this

boat chugging along and prepare for a new situation.  When sweet

and  gentle  breezes  return again, the  region  will  not  look

anything

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>

like  what  it  was  before last year.  The  landscape  will  be

different.  We cannot be sure.  We cannot have a fixed plan that

we  must be there or here, because things are changing so  fast.

But we know the general direction we must move towards.  We know

there  is  no  free  lunch in the world.   We  know  that  every

Singaporean will have to carry his own weight.  We know that  we

have got to be competitive and that is the only sure way to stay

employed and to stay employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. [Applause].

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I

would  like to thank all the Members who have spoken up on  this

motion.  I would like to acknowledge their contribution and  key

points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will go in the reverse order. Mr Chiam See Tong and

Mr Low Thia Khiang, basically, called on the Government to treat

everybody  fairly  and  equally  so  as  to  strengthen   social

cohesion, and we have heard the response from the Minister.  NMP

Mr  Chuang  talked  about the over investment  in  the  property

market  and the need to divert this investment in the future  to

human  capital.   NMP Mr Rai talked about the  need  to  upgrade

workers  so  that  they can take on better paying  jobs  and  he

called  on  the  people to save more.  Mdm Claire Chiang  talked

about the importance of the people services sector and the  need

to  strengthen the social safety net, and to set up a  Singapore

misery index.  Mr Inderjit Singh talked about the need to have a

vibrant business environment for technology and innovation-based

economy.  I like that very much.  Dr Vasoo talked about the need

to  have a fighting spirit and the need to do long-term manpower

planning,  if  possible, for the next 20 years.  I thought  that

was  excellent too.  NMP Mr Zulkifli talked about  the  need  to

match  the VWOs, the social workers, to the needs of the  people

at  a time like this.  Mr Ang Mong Seng talked about the need to

set  up an employment network linking MOM, CDCs, CCs and so  on.

NMP  Mr  Tay talked about the need to give more support  to  the

SMEs and to have a stronger process of consultation with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>

private  sector.  Mr Sinnakaruppan proposed the earlier  release

of  the report on CET 21.  NMP Dr Lee Tsao Yuan talked about the

need  for early and big enough off-Budget measures.  And,  first

but  not  least, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Mr Seng Han  Thong  talked

about  the  older workers, skills upgrading, cost  cutting,  job

matching,  unity and so on.  And I thank all the MPs  for  their

contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to thank the Second Minister for Trade and

Industry,  BG  George Yeo, for his very spirited  and  inspiring

response.   I  am very glad that he talked about  the  need  for

employment,  employability, competitiveness and national  unity.

I  am  most  impressed by his pak buay see kind of reply  and  I

guess  some  of the MPs here are also the pak buay see  type  of

MPs.   So  if  your  proposal  has not  been  responded  by  the

Minister, please continue to bring them up on a future  occasion

until some response comes out with a yes or no, whatever way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to summarise my motion

in  this  way.   I  think  Mr Low Thia Khiang  also  asked  this

question  about moving this motion at a time like this.   Is  it

because the PAP Government admits making mistakes and so on?   I

want  to  explain.  The one and only reason why I proposed  this

particular motion at a time like this is because I remember what

a Chinese businessman told me about five years ago.  The Chinese

businessman  was very successful in China.  I hope he  still  is

because I have not been in touch with him for quite a while now.

I  asked  him, "How did you manage to be so successful?  Somehow

everywhere  you went, you made money, when other people  may  be

losing money."  He said, "Very simple.  Zui wei xian de di fang,

ye     shi     zui     an     quan     de     di     fang      [

],  meaning  that  the most dangerous place is also  the  safest

place.  Why?  Very simple.  If the place is very safe, everybody

rushes  in.  The place will be so crowded and the market is  not

enough  to go round everyone.  So in the end there is no winner,

because they all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>

undercut  each other.  What he did was he went to  places  where

nobody  dared to be there, because it was known to be dangerous.

This is dangerous from a business point of view, not in terms of

physical safety.  Basically, he was a pioneer.  He looked around

China.   He looked at the provinces, the cities and places  that

he  thought  there  were investment opportunities.   But  before

anybody  else moved in, he moved in first.  Because of that,  he

was able to basically make a good business out of that venture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think for Singapore, in terms of the national economy,

it  is  the  same thing.  I think we have been taking risks  all

these 35 years since independence and that is the reason why our

economy  has  been  successful.   We  went  to  foreign   direct

investment  (FDI) when many people, many countries, thought  FDI

is  no good for the country.  They say it will enable the multi-national  companies  to come in to exploit our  people  and  our

resources.   But we said, no.  We say that it is  dangerous  but

also the safest.  So we went to FDI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's situation has changed. Looking ahead, in the

future,  as I mentioned, I think the Minister has also mentioned

about  the realignment of the regional currencies. The  economic

space  that we are in today is going to be very crowded  in  the

future,  by the time the crisis is over.  Therefore, we have  to

look  for new space, space that is even more dangerous  and  has

fewer players so that we can continue to succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is very easy for our regional economies to copy us.

They  can  copy our strategies on paper but it is very difficult

for them to duplicate the implementation on the ground if we are

prepared  not to shy away from greater and difficult  challenges

and,  in  a way, more dangerous places.  But to survive in  more

dangerous places, we better be stronger and better, and that  is

the only reason why I proposed this motion because I think at  a

time  like  this,  instead of being bogged  down  by  short-term

problems,  we should cast our mind, our vision, ahead or  beyond

this  crisis,  and ask ourselves what can we do  now  over  this

year, the next two years or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>

three  years,   what  can we do to make Singapore  stronger  and

better.  So that by the time the crisis is over, when we have to

venture into more dangerous places, we will be ready and we will

succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me in conclusion, as the Minister BG George Yeo

has mentioned, at a time like this, there is a lot of stress,  a

lot  of ya li [               ].  There is a Chinese saying,  we

must       ba     ya    li,    ding    wei     dong     li     [

],  meaning you must turn the stress, the pressure, into forward

thrust so that we can run even faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, let me thank again the House for the

support of this motion and I look forward to your approval.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in view of the economic downturn, the Government

should  rally  the  support  of the entire  nation  to  minimise

unemployment   in   the  short  term  and  strengthen   economic

competitiveness and social cohesion for the long  term  so  that

Singapore  will  emerge  from this  regional  crisis  even  more

competitive and resilient.

<div align="center"><b>SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES PROGRAMME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr S Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Education what progress

has been made on the introduction of a South Asian Studies

programme at the National University of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Aline Wong announced in Parliament in January 1998 that

NUS had found it feasible to start the South Asian Studies

Programme (SASP) from the Academic Year 1999/2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS is making good progress in the preparations and will be

ready to launch the SASP from July 1999.  Let me update Members

on the key steps in the preparations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the curriculum. A committee comprising historians,

economists, political scientists and sociologists started

developing the curriculum from late 1997.  They have sought the

advice and inputs from local and international experts on South

Asia.  The draft curriculum is now ready and will be finalised

by the end of this year, after getting feedback, including

feedback from potential students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the recruitment of staff. The Programme has

provisions for five full time academic staff.  NUS is currently

in the process of identifying and attracting good scholars to

take up these teaching positions.  Advertisements have been

placed in leading journals and academic magazines in South Asia,

UK, USA and Australia.  NUS intends to hold recruitment visits

to these regions later this year.  It expects these posts to be

filled by early 1999.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, marketing. NUS will be conducting a series of

publicity activities, including seminars and public talks, to

promote the Programme from January and June 1999.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>HISTORY SYLLABUS OF SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Education if he

will consider reviewing the History syllabus of schools to give

greater emphasis to post-war history of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, pupils at the lower secondary level are taught

Singapore's history from the colonial era till our achievement

of nationhood in 1965.  At the upper secondary level, pupils

learn about post-war constitutional developments in Singapore

till the formation of Malaysia in 1963.  Pre-university students

study political developments till the achievement of self-government in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The History and Social Studies are currently being revised

to give greater emphasis to Singapore's struggles against

colonialism, communism and communalism.  The content will also

include the achievements and constraints Singapore experienced

in the early years of nation-building.  These revised syllabuses

will be implemented from year 2000 onwards.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATIONS APROVED BY REGISTRAR OF SOCIETIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether from June 1997 to June 1998, the Registrar of Societies

has refused registration to any applicants or delayed approval

of applications in any case for six months or more, and if so,

the number of cases refused or delayed and the reasons for such

refusal or delay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period 1st June, 1997 to 30th June, 1998 the

Registrar of Societies approved 221 applications. Of these 167

(75%) were approved within 3 months and another 46 (21%) within

4 to 6 months. Eight (4%) applications took more than 6 months

to complete due to the need to seek more information and

clarifications during the processing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the same period from 1st June, 1997 to 30th June,

1998, 5 (2%) applications were rejected because the Registrar

was satisfied that the proposed societies were likely to be used

for unlawful purposes or that it would be contrary to the

national interest for the societies to be registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is one application which is outstanding

for more than 6 months. Its processing will be completed

shortly.
