<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>NEW CONSTITUTION FOR SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether   the   necessary  legislation   for   the

introduction of the new Constitution for Singapore

has  been finalised; and whether he can state when

the Order of Her Majesty in Council containing the

new Constitution will be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) when was the draft of the proposed new

Constitution for Singapore received  by  the

Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) are there any aspects in the draft of the

proposed  new  Constitution which  call  for

further   negotiations,  and  if   he   will

identify them; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether he has been in correspondence with

the  Colonial  Office in London  during  the

past  year in connection with these aspects,

and  if  he  will present the correspondence

to this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether he has received from London a draft of the

Constitution  of the new State of  Singapore,  and

when  other parties who participated in the London

talks  will receive copies of the draft for  their

approval.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether he will give this House an opportunity  to

debate the desirability of a proposed further all-Party  Mission  to London in connection  with  the

proposed new Constitution for Singapore; and if he

will  give an estimate of the probable expense  to

be  borne by this territory in connection with the

proposed Mission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether there has been correspondence between  the

Singapore  Government and the Colonial  Office  in

London  arising  out  of  the  rejection  by  this

Assembly  last year of the anti-subversive  clause

in  the  Report  of the Constitutional  Conference

held in London in March and April 1957 and whether

he will present such correspondence to this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, as there are a number of  questions

on  today's  Order  Paper on the  subject  of  the

Constitutional   Order  in  Council,   with   your

permission I shall answer Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 at

the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constitutional instruments are still being

drafted in the Colonial Office and I hope that the

completed draft will be received here by  the  end

of  this  month. I have myself recently  discussed

the  drafting  with Mr Melville of  the  Colonial

Office  during his visit to Singaport, and certain

sections  have been referred to our local  experts

for   checking  and  revision.  As  soon  as   the

completed  draft  is ready, I shall  study  it  in

conjunction  with  the members  of  the  All-Party

Delegation  who were signatories to the conference

report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stand taken by the Assembly on the anti-subversive clause was reported to the Secretary of

State.  No  correspondence between this Government

and  the Colonial Office was entered into on  this

matter, nor has this Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



entered  into any correspondence with the Colonial

Office on the drafting of the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the new Constitution can be

effected at any time this Assembly considers  that

the time has come to address the Governor to fix a

date  for the new Constitution in accordance  with

the  agreement  set  out in paragraph  54  of  the

Report of the Singapore Constitutional Conference, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would invite the attention of hon. Members to

that  part  of the Governor's speech delivered  on 9th April which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government intends that the agreement with

the  United Kingdom Government on the form of  the

constitutional instruments should be made  by  the

All-Party  delegation  which  took  part  in   the

Constitutional discussion last year."



<br>The  constitutional instruments deal with the life

and  future  of  the new State  of  Singapore  and

cannot  be  framed  to the satisfaction  of  local

political Parties and the local Government on  the

one  side, and the United Kingdom Government  some

8,000  miles  away, without delay and without  the

risk of losing that unity so desirable for such  a

vital  business save by discussions by the parties

concerned. I have therefore made arrangements with

the  Colonial Office for such discussions to  take

place  in  May, and I propose to invite  the  same

members  to  London to finalise the constitutional

instruments. The probable expense to Singapore  is

return air passages for six persons plus necessary

incidentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desirability of visiting London for this

purpose  cannot be gainsaid and I do not  consider

it necessary that this Assembly should be given an

opportunity to debate this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Will the Hon.

the  Chief  Minister confirm that copies  of  this

draft  constitution have been circulating  or  are

being  circulated  to  some  heads  of  Government

Departments?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I said in my reply just

now   that   certain   sections   of   the   draft

Constitution  have  been  referred  but  not  full

copies.  As  it  is,  I myself  have  not  seen  a

completed copy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is that because the Chief

Minister is not in the confidence of Her Majesty's

Colonial Office?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I do not know whether that

is to my credit or to my discredit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Chief Minister

remember  that  in London it was agreed  that  the

terms  of  the constitutional instruments  setting

out  what was agreed to in the Report of the  All-Party   Committee  were  to  be  settled  by   the

Delegation  and  the Parties that  the  Delegation

represented?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I said, Sir, that when the

complete  draft is received by me, there  will  be

consultations   with  members  of  the   All-Party

Delegation, and I also drew attention to that part

of  the  Governor's speech which clearly sets  out

that  this  Government will do nothing  about  the

draft  Constitution without bringing in  the  All-Party Delegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  know whether the Hon. the  Chief

Minister is able to inform this House what is  the

main  cause of the delay in drawing up  the  draft

Constitution. It has taken one solid year already.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I do not know whether I am

in  a position to reply to that question. It is  a

matter for the Colonial Office. I understand  they

have  their hands full because there are a  number

of   other   Colonies   which   are   having   new

constitutions   almost  at  the   same   time   as Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>AMENDING LEGISLATION FOR COMPULSORY VOTING IN GENERAL ELECTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether  the  Government will consider introducing

amending legislation for compulsory voting in  the

forthcoming General Election.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the answer to this

question  will  depend  on the  stand  which  this

Assembly  is prepared to take when it debates  the

motion  dealing with this subject and standing  in

the name of the hon. Member for Changi.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS</b></div></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(New Register of Electors and election date)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Minister

when  the new Register of Electors for Legislative

Assembly   elections  under   the   proposed   new

Constitution for Singapore will be ready; and what

is  the  earliest practicable date for the holding

of a General Election under the new Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, provided there are no

major  mechanical  breakdowns or other  unforeseen

difficulties,  the Registers of Electors  for  the

Legislative Assembly elections under the  proposed

new  Constitution for Singapore will be ready  for

inspection by the first week of June 1958. On this

timetable,  the  earliest  practicable  date   for

holding  elections will be the  end  of  September 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of this question

is  dependent  on the stand to be  taken  by  this

Assembly  when it debates the motion on compulsory

voting standing in the name of the hon. Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC SECURITY ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Release of detainees)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether he will make a statement as to the purpose

of    requiring   persons   detained   under   the

Preservation  of Public Security Ordinance,  1955,

and their families to appear before him before the

detainees are released.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although

the  Government has been responsible for  ordering

the detention of certain persons, its attitude  to

the relatives of the detainees has always been one

of   sympathy.  In  some  cases,  relatives   have

approached me immediately following the arrest  of

a member of their family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I cannot interfere with the course of

action  which  Government  has  taken  after  very

serious  and careful consideration for the general

good of the people of Singapore, I consider it my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



duty, as the head of an elected Government, on the

conditional release of these detainees  to  advise

parents,  particularly on a personal  basis,  that

they  should discharge their duties as parents  by

looking  after  the  welfare of  their  sons,  and

enjoining both parties that they would do well  to

examine the company they keep in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I consider to be my duty, just as I

consider it my duty that a detainee should not  be

detained one minute longer than is necessary if  a

single  doubt  exists in my mind of the  need  for

detaining him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and  Welfare what is the total  number  of

unemployed  persons  in  Singapore  as   on   31st

January,  1958, giving a breakdown of this  figure

into:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the number of able-bodied persons; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the number of sick and disabled persons.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to Employment

Exchange  statistics, there were 8,292  unemployed

persons  in  Singapore on 31st January,  1958,  of

whom 393 were either sick or disabled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYED REGISTERED AT LABOUR EXCHANGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Steps to secure employment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and Welfare whether there are persons  who

have  been  registered at the Labour Exchange  for

some  years  now, who have so far been  unable  to

secure  employment; and what steps the  Government

proposes  to take to secure employment  for  these

people as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the numbers

of  persons  whose  names have been  on  the  live

register classified by duration of unemployment in

respect  of  periods exceeding six months  are  as

follows:

<pre>

  Six months to one year     653 persons

  One year to two years      608   "

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

  Two to three years ...     211 persons

  Three years and over ...    14   "

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered not profitable to initiate any

national   scheme  for  the  special  purpose   of

providing employment to the 225 persons  who  have

been  unemployed for more than two years,  because

most  of them are unemployable due to old age,  to

health and to low standards of skill.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE-DUMPING GROUND FOR PROSTITUTES FROM CHINA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Allegation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare what action the Government  has

taken  or  intends  to  take  in  regard  to   the

statement  reported  to have been  made  by.  Mrs

Shirin  Fozdar  at  the Afro-Asian  Conference  of



women  social  workers  in Colombo  alleging  that

prostitutes  from China have dumped themselves  in

Singapore  and  that the Colony  is  now  one  big

brothel.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a prompt

denial to Mrs Shirin Fozdar's statement was  made

by  my  Ministry on 22nd February,  1958.  I  have

since  interviewed Mrs Fozdar  and  am  satisfied

that  she  had  not  intended that  her  statement

should be given such a sensational twist.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATION FOR ENTRY FROM CHINA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare if he will make a statement  on

Government  policy with regard to the  application

for entry into Singapore from China of the wife of

a sponsor, resident in Singapore, who has produced

documents  to prove that his former wife  is  dead

and that his application is in respect of his only

wife now living in China.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

Government's  policy  to admit  wives  of  persons

lawfully  resident in the Colony. The  appropriate

regulation to admit such a category of persons  is

found  in  paragraph  7  (g)  of  the  Immigration

(Prohibition  of Entry) Order, 1953. Therefore  if

the local sponsor in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



question  has submitted satisfactory  evidence  to

prove  (1) that the applicant is his lawful wedded

wife,  and (2) that his former wife is dead, there

is  no  reason why the application should  not  be

approved,  unless in the opinion of the Controller

the  sponsor has insufficient means to provide for

her maintenance.

since June, 1952.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the

is   of   some   length,  I  will  circulate   the

information  requested  by  the  hon.  Member  for

Kampong Kapor in the Official Report.



<pre>

  Following is the information:



  Every year in July the Labour Department conducts a stratified sample survey of average

weekly earnings, hours of work and conditions of employment.  The results of this survey

for the years 1953 to 1957 are given below:-



    AVERAGE WEEKLY HOURS WORKED, AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS AND AVERAGE EARNINGS

                            PER HOUR IN ALL INDUSTRIES

1957 ...       47.80             37 98                0 79



No figures are available for 1952.

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

 The figures quoted indicate:



   that average weekly hours of work have been progressively decreasing (49.89 hours

     for all workers in 1953 as against 47.80 hours in 1957);

   that average weekly earnings have risen progressively from $32.04 in 1953 to

     $37.98 in 1957 for all workers, an increase of 18.5 per cent;

   and that average hourly earnings have shown a progressively steady rise from 0.64

     cents in 1953 to 0.79 cents in 1957, an increase of 23.4 per cent.



Money earnings have increased whilst hours of work have decreased since 1953.



  On the other hand, the cost of living has remained fairly stable since 1954, as shown below

by the Cost of Living Index of the lower income group for the month of June from 1952 to 1957:-



         COST OF LIVING INDEX OF LOWER INCOME GROUP



        Weight     June    June    June    June    June    June

        1939       1952    1953    1954    1955    1956    1957

       100.0      344.6   346.8   313.9   308.2   313.1   320.6



  Further, the Labour Ordinance, 1955 provides a number of benefits, including paid annual

leave and paid sick leave which were not provided for by law before December 1955.



  On the basis of these facts, there has been a marked increase in the standard of living of

the workers since 1953, and consequently a greater share in the national income.

instructions  issued by the Chief Secretary  under

subsection  (3) of section 3 of the  Ordinance.  I

follow  as  far  as is practicable the  conditions

imposed  in the United Kingdom on detainees  under

Defence Regulation 18 (b) during the last War. The

conditions  are  as  liberal as considerations  of

security and discipline permit. Detainees are  not

required to work except for the purpose of keeping

their rooms and precincts clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no separate detention camp for detainees

but   subject  to  the  availability  of  suitable

which have been in force in the United Kingdom for

those detained during the last War.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards putting up a separate detention camp,

of any clothing during the actual performances, or

the  making  of any indecent or improper  gesture,

<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The hon. Member has been misled, Sir.

Income  Tax forms of returns have been  issued  to

Centre  has  received such forms.  Are  not  these

<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It is certainly the case, Sir, that

there has been some delay. The Balestier Community

under  section 63 (2) of the Ordinance, as  it  is

required



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



to,  and the Income Tax Department had to find out

about the existence of this community centre  from

its  own sources of information. Subsequently when

the  first  return  was  sent  to  this  community

centre, certain questions arose in connection with

its  accounts. These questions have only  recently

been  resolved  and the forms of  assessment  were

sent to them in September 1957 and subsequently in

December 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

Balestier   Community  Centre  not  a   registered

Department  to find out whether it is a registered

society or not; and if it is, why the delay in the

submission of forms?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> As I understand it, Sir, the Income Tax

may send forms to all taxpayers, but under section

63  (2),  if  that form has not been  sent  within

three   months  of  the  start  of  the  year   of

assessment, the taxpayer is obliged to notify  his

liability to tax to the Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether technical equipment for secondary

schools   had  been  received  in  Singapore

under  the  Colombo Plan  in  1953  and  has

still not been distributed to the schools;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether technical equipment for secondary

technical  schools  had been  purchased  and

received  by  the  Singapore  Government  in 1953  and has still not been distributed  to

the technical schools; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if he will make a statement on the extent

of   technical   equipment   for   secondary

technical   schools   donated   to    and/or

purchased  by  the  Government  since   1953

which  is not being used, and the action  he

intends to take in connection therewith.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I will divide my answer

into  two  parts. The first part is  none  of  the

equipment referred to in the question was received

or purchased for secondary technical schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, technical schools were not proposed until

late 1954, and the first of them was not completed

until 1956. It was Government's original intention

in  1952 to build two trade schools similar to the

Balestier Road Junior Trade School. In late  1953,

Government approved the creation of a new post  of

Assistant  Director of Education  (Technical)  and

accepted the idea of the building of a Polytechnic

which  would  provide technical education  at  the

highest level. The Assistant Director of Education

(Technical) on arrival in the Colony in late 1954,

reviewed the situation in view of the need  for  a

bridge   between  the  primary  school   and   the

Polytechnic not provided by the trade schools, and

advised  the setting up of two secondary technical

schools  in  place  of  the  proposed  two   trade

schools.  Government accepted the  suggestion  and

two  secondary  technical schools were  built  and

began operating in January 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, in 1952 and 1953, apparatus and

equipment  for  trade schools had  been  requested

from  Australia under the Colombo Plan and ordered

against Government funds. A fair proportion of the

equipment  and  apparatus requested and  purchased

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



unsuitable  for secondary technical schools  since

the  latter type of schools does not provide trade

training.



The answers to the specific questions are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the first Colombo Plan equipment was

received in 1954;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) technical equipment for trade schools was

purchased from Government funds; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the approximate value of the above

apparatus and equipment is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) purchased by Government by indents

placed  with the Crown Agents in  1952

and  1953, and delivered in  1953  and

1954 was approximately $120,000; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) received under the Colombo Plan

from   requests  made  in   1953   was

approximately $24,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following action is to be taken: Part of the

equipment purchased from Government funds will  be

sold to the Polytechnic; part of the equipment  to

be   used   for  equipping  an  afternoon   school

providing  a one-year artisan course for  over-age

school  leavers;  and part to be transferred  when

staff  are  appointed to the schools to  undertake

woodwork  and  metal work in preparation  for  the

General Certificate of Education examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No request for Colombo Plan gifts for secondary

technical schools has been made, and all equipment

<div align="center"><b>COMMITTEE ON ENGLISH SECONDARY EDUCATION AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE SENIOR MIDDLE SCHOOL EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if  the  Government  will  set   up   a

Committee  to  enquire into the  report  upon  the

standard  of English Secondary Education  compared

with  the  Chinese Senior Middle School  Education

and also to recommend to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



the  Government the need or otherwise of  changing

the  text-books  at  present  in  use  in  English

Schools  to  suit the present trend  of  political

changes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, it is extremely

difficult  to  compare  educational  standards  of

different  systems  which use different  media  of

instruction. The path proposed by the hon.  Member

for  Queenstown would call for a Committee with  a

wide  range  of  ability and technical  experience

both in English and Chinese, and their studies, to

be  of  any value, would necessarily take  a  long

time.  Officers  with the necessary qualifications

are  already  fully occupied with  more  important

duties, and the answer to the hon. Member's  first

question  must therefore be no. However, there  is

now  in  Singapore  a visiting research  professor

conducting  a  course of training  in  methods  of

educational  testing, and it  would  be  possible,

with his help, to undertake the task at some later

date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to have the opportunity to answer the

second part of the hon. Member's question, and  to

make  a brief statement on the progress which  has

already  been made in Malayanising syllabuses  and

textbooks. The Ministry has set up a committee and

this  Committee  and  its  various  Sub-Committees

contain   representatives  of  all   the   various

interested  groups, and progress  has  been  made.

Syllabuses for geography and physical education in

primary schools, English in secondary schools, and

civics  in Singapore schools are already in print,

and  others  for  mathematics,  science,  history,

English   in  English  primary  schools,  physical

education in secondary schools and geography, that

is  Malay version, are ready for publication. They

are  to be published in all the appropriate  local

languages and will cover the contents of  teaching

in all Singapore schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writers and publishers of school textbooks in

English   anticipate  the  need  for   Malayanised

textbooks, and some textbooks are already in  use.

Many  others are being prepared in the  course  of

the  new  syllabuses. Similarly, there are several

new schemes of textbooks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



for use in Chinese primary schools. It is only  in

regard  to  the  Malayanisation of Chinese  Middle

School   textbooks  that  there   has   been   any

difficulty at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the work of drafting common Malayan

syllabuses has almost been completed, the work  of

providing  the necessary textbooks is a  difficult

and  highly  specialised  business  and  I  cannot

promise  quick results, but my officers are  aware

of its importance and are doing all they can.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Hon. the Minister for Education compares standards

in English and Chinese schools, may I know whether

he  recognises the significant improvement of  the

English  language in the Chinese schools?  At  the

same  time,  does  he recognise  the  very  little

improvement   in   the  standard   of   vernacular

languages in the English schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> On the contrary, there has

been  an  appreciable increase in the standard  of

vernacular languages in English schools.

Secondary  School  building  is  expected  to   be

completed  for occupation in January 1959.  It  is

proposed to retain the present school as a primary

school   because  Bukit  Panjang  is   a   rapidly

<div align="center"><b>INCREASED TELEPHONE CHARGES AND NATIONALISATION OF TELEPHONE UNDERTAKING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works whether, in view  of  the

announcement made by the Singapore Telephone Board

of  the  steep  and sudden increases in  telephone

charges from 1st July, 1958, and the effect on the

cost  of  living in Singapore consequent  on  such

increases:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Government will take steps, by amending

legislation  or  otherwise,  to  prevent  the

increase taking effect; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Government will consider nationalising

the  telephone  undertaking  now  under  the

control of the Singapore Telephone Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> As I informed the hon. Member for

Queenstown in answer to his question in this House

on  24th  April, 1957, the Telephone  Board  is  a

statutory   corporation.  The   Board   has   full

responsibility for prescribing the rate of charges

to  be  made in respect of the telephone services,

and  Government  has no intention  of  introducing

amending legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the telephone charges are the

first  in  Singapore for 35 years  and  have  been

rendered  necessary by the rise  in  the  cost  of

equipment,  of  labour  and,  above  all,  of  the

finance  necessary  to meet the increasing  demand

for  new  lines. In the last two years, the  Board

has  provided an additional 7,500 exchange  lines,

that  is  a  33  per  cent increase,  and  current

expansion  is running at the rate of 450  lines  a

month.  The hon. Member will appreciate what  this

rate of expansion involves in terms of interest at

current market rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased charges only brings Singapore rates

up  to  a level slightly below that the Federation

Government  has  already  found  necessary.  I  am

satisfied  that any general rise in  the  cost  of

living  will be extremely small as the main burden

will fall almost entirely on persons well able  to

bear  it, but I have, however, represented to  the

Board  that the increase in the charge for  public

call  boxes may be onerous to the poor, and  I  am

awaiting  the  Board's  reply  whether  they   can

reconsider this part of their proposed increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telephone services have been nationalised

since  1955  and  the question of  nationalisation

does not arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will these

increased  rates result in giving better  services

to subscribers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



and   is  it  not  a  fact  that  current  capital

expenditure will result in a return in due course?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The capital expenditure is related

primarily to expansion of the services. The system

is  at  present  very heavily overloaded  and  the

reason  why  there have been deficiencies - such  as

wrong numbers and the crossed lines occur - is  that

to  meet  the  demand for lines, the load  on  the

network  has been increased above that appropriate

for full efficiency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it not

fair for the Singapore Telephone Board to withdraw

such increases until such time when it can provide

a better service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> No, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce and Industry whether he is aware that the

prices of chickens and eggs have slumped over  the

last  six  months, but that prices of chicken-feed

have  not gone down comparatively; and whether  he

proposes  to  take  action to  help  the  poultry-rearers.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The hon. Member is aware,

Sir,  that  as  a result of Government's  vigorous

drive  to  increase food supplies, the  prices  of

poultry  and  eggs have as compared to  last  July

declined now by about ten per cent in the case  of

poultry and about 20 per cent in the case of eggs.

Of course compared to April 1955 prices of poultry

and  eggs  have come down by about  30  per  cent.

Prices  of  chicken feed, on the other hand,  have

declined  on  the  average by about  10  per  cent

between August 1956 and March 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has lately been unfair dumping of eggs from

China  which  has hit our poultry rearers  and  in

order  to give a chance of survival to our farmers

I have ordered that all egg imports be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



placed  under specific licensing and that as  from

15th  June  all  imported eggs,  except  from  the

Federation  of  Malaya, be  required  to  bear  an

indelible stamp impression to show that  they  are

imported eggs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does it

occur  to  the Minister that there is a  class  of

people  who specially go in for stamped  eggs  for

cake-making?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

requirement of stamping of imported eggs fails  to

alleviate the difficulties of our farmers, I shall

consider further action when the need arises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Can the Minister tell us how

it  is possible to stamp every one of the millions

of eggs that come into the Colony every month?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is not for this

Government  to  stamp  the eggs.  It  is  for  the

exporting countries to stamp their eggs.  We  will

only allow import of eggs which are stamped.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister  tell  us  what sort of  eggs  are  being

bought  by  hospitals, prisons  and  other  public

institutions?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> As far as I know, Sir, all

public  institutions demand local fresh eggs  when

they  call for tenders but I am aware that dealers

and   contractors  are  in  the  habit  of  mixing

imported  Chinese  eggs  which  are  much  cheaper

together  with  fresh  eggs  and  therefore   this

requirement  of stamping will show to  the  buying

authorities  what  they will be getting  from  the

contractors.

<div align="center"><b>(Safeguards)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce  and  Industry whether, in  view  of  the

Indonesian  situation, he is taking or  has  taken

steps to safeguard the Colony against depletion of

its  stock  of rice and against the  rise  in  the

price.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, there is no danger at

present  of  a  shortage  of  rice  in  Singapore.

Merchants  today are holding large stocks  in  the

godowns - a  considerable  quantity  of  which   was

imported for re-export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is always alert to the necessity

of  maintaining adequate stocks in the Colony  for

local consumption and therefore not only is a day-to-day  check maintained on imports and re-exports

of   rice  to  ensure  that  adequate  stocks  are

retained in Singapore but also, as the hon. Member

is  fully  aware, Government, in spite  of  strong

trade and also political opposition from the  hon.

Member  himself,  maintains a rice  stock-pile  so

that  the people of Singapore are safeguarded from

a sudden shortage of their staple food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of rice is beyond the control of the

Government.   It  is  dependent  on  the   surplus

available in rice-producing countries and  on  the

demand  from  consumer  countries.  The  indicated

exportable surplus available for this year in rice-producing countries in the East is less than  last

year  and as a result prices of all types of  rice

have increased.

do  not  consider it necessary or advantageous  at

present  to  establish a trade mission  in  China.

Since  it  is  the  Chinese People's  Government's

express  policy to trade on a basis  of  bilateral

agreements  thus purchasing direct from  producing

countries  rather  than through  an  entrepot  and

since  we have no products of our own in which  we

considers that no useful economic purpose would be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether he is satisfied that this monopoly

businessmen who were previously allowed  to

import  those  fruits freely and  that  the

prices  of  those fruits to consumers  have

not   increased  and  will   not   increase

consequent  upon  the  quantities  imported

being  smaller than the quantities imported

before the Committee was set up; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) what the Government has done and intends to

do  in the matter and in particular whether

the Government has made representations  to

now   comprises  12  members,  one  member  having

resigned some time ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that the existence of this

importers'  Committee not only causes hardship  to

the  dealers who are not on the Committee  but  is

also  not  in  the  best  interests  of  Singapore

consumers.  In fact, the Committee is designed  to

<div align="center"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an Address be sent to His Excellency the

Governor  expressing the thanks of  this  Assembly

for  his  speech  delivered on Wednesday,  9th  of

April, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nearly a fortnight has elapsed since the

Government's policy for this last session has been

made  known  in  the Governor's  Speech  and  this

traditional  motion is to give Opposition  Members

an opportunity to debate and criticise our policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the second session since I became

Chief  Minister. The first session began  on  29th

August, 1956, and much has happened since then.  1

need  not recount all the events which took  place

but there is one which I find it necessary to draw

attention to because the threat is still  with  us

although  much  diminished in venom.  I  refer  to

subversive  activities and the  Government's  firm

action  against  such elements.  The  Government's

stand  is  again reiterated in that  part  of  the

Governor's Speech which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will continue its vigilance in

countering  Communist infiltration and sub-version

and  will not hesitate to take whatever steps  are

required  to counter this threat to the livelihood

and well-being of the citizens of Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will soon be entering a new era in our

political  evolution. The new  constitution  which

the All-Party delegation brought back to Singapore

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



London  last  year in accordance with the  mandate

entrusted to the delegation by this Assembly  will

be   brought  into  operation  with  the   General

Election.  This new constitution is an  honourable

and  satisfying discharge of the mandate  of  this

Assembly.  This record, Sir, would not be  correct

if  I  did  not  mention that there was  one  hon.

Member  who is now no longer with us, who felt  so

heartsick  that he resigned and issued a challenge

to  a  by-election against another Member  who  in

honouring  his  acceptance  of  the  challenge  so

boldly  thrown out at him resigned,  contested  in

the by-election on the matter in dispute, received

the  support  of his electorate and is  now  still

with  us.  The  Member  who issued  the  challenge

resigned,  did not contest in the by-election  and

declared that he was giving up politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Constitution, Sir, is a challenge to the

people of Singapore who, I am confident, will rise

to  the occasion and uphold the democratic form of

government. This new Constitution opens the way to

a  richer  prize,  a prize worth capturing.  Hence

subversive elements are mustering their forces and

endeavouring  to open up new fronts,  having  lost

the  old  fronts through Government's firm action,

by  finding  stooges from among  persons  who  are

prepared  to prostitute themselves for  their  own

ends, or who are so blinded by their own evil that

they unwittingly lend themselves to be made use of

by these evil forces to the detriment of the well-being  of  the  citizens  of  Singapore.  In   any

community one is bound to find such persons, and I

hope  and  pray that their eyes will be opened  in

time  to the fact that they are playing with  fire

which will surely destroy them in the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, the new Constitution is a

challenge  to  the  citizens  of  Singapore.   The

Government  is pledged to wipe out the destructive

forces  in  our  midst,  and  there  can   be   no

relaxation in our vigilance; but this fight can be

hampered if the citizens of Singapore do not guard

themselves    against   evil    and    destructive

propaganda. During the last session the Government

had  an  uphill fight against the evil  propaganda

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



was  being disseminated by subversive elements and

swallowed  by  gullible  people  who  should  have

thought  better. This Government  was  accused  of

being   against  Chinese  education  and   Chinese

culture.  The  Government's  primary  duty  is  to

protect the well-being of the citizens, and in the

discharge  of  this sacred duty  we  had  to  take

action against certain Chinese middle schools  and

had  to  detain under the Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance a number of students from these

schools,  because their subversive  activities  in

these  schools were a grave threat  to  the  well-being  not only of their fellow-students but  also

of Singapore. It is from the student body that the

future  leaders of Singapore will  arise,  and  if

they  are  not  put on the right  track  while  in

school  to  become worthy citizens,  their  future

will be blighted, their outlook will be distorted,

and  they will be a liability instead of an  asset

to  the  country.  This action of  the  Government

taken  in  the best interests of the  citizens  of

Singapore was twisted by disruptive forces for the

consumption  of  gullible  people  as  an   action

against Chinese education and Chinese culture. Let

us examine the Government's education policy based

on the All-Party Report. For the first time in the

history  of  Singapore, Chinese education  has  an

equal  place. Teachers in Chinese schools are  put

at  par  with  teachers in English  schools,  thus

receiving  large  increases in  their  emoluments.

This  year the Government is spending $15  million

on  Chinese  education. This,  Sir,  we  claim  is

indeed  a proud record. In the short space of  two

years we have done more for Chinese education than

all the previous administrations put together, and

very  much  more than governments in  neighbouring

countries  having Chinese populations.  I  do  not

fear any contradiction on this. I have offered  to

send  a  small  group  of  students  from  Chinese

schools   on   a   visit  to  these   neighbouring

countries,  and even to the Chinese  mainland,  to

see  for themselves. I have received a good number

of  applications  and these are at  present  being

considered, and arrangements will be made to  send

a  group  on  the  tour during the  August  school

vacation. This is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



Government's  answer  to  the  evil  forces  which

preach  and  misguide people to foolishly  believe

that this Government is against Chinese education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang University, Sir, was recently

officially  opened by the Governor. I have  stated

on  several occasions during, the past few  months

that  the  Government  will  give  recognition  to

Nanyang University degrees, but before this can be

done, it has been proposed to appoint a Commission

of  Scholars to advise on recognition, thus giving

weight  to  such  recognition. The  delay  in  the

appointment of this Commission has been due to the

attitude of the Nanyang University authorities.  A

happy  change,  Sir,  has  now  taken  place,  and

proposals  for a Commission of Scholars to  advise

on  recognition are going forward. When  this  has

been resolved, the Government will grant financial

aid  if  required,  thereby helping  to  make  the

Nanyang University an institution of high learning

of  which we can all be proud. Can anyone honestly

and truthfully say that this Government is against

Chinese  education?  For the  first  time  in  the

history  of Singapore we have a multilingual  City

Council  and will soon have multilingual  District

Councils  and a multilingual Legislative Assembly.

The Chinese language is given due place in debates



in  these Councils and in the Legislature. And the

gates of this august Assembly are thrown wide open

by  our citizenship laws, under which some 300,000

Chinese  who  were  not  born  in  Singapore  have

registered as citizens. Their names will appear on

electoral   rolls  for  the  forthcoming   general

elections, and I look forward to seeing candidates

fielded  from  among  this group.  Thus,  Chinese-speaking  Chinese and China-born Chinese who  have

become  citizens of Singapore enjoy for the  first

time  the same rights and privileges as all  other

citizens.  I do not, Sir, for a moment doubt  that

in  enjoying these rights and privileges they will

not  forget  that  they too have  responsibilities

towards the State of Singapore which will soon  be

brought into being under the new Constitution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are actions on the part of the Government

such as I have recounted against Chinese education

and Chinese culture? Oh, citizens of Singapore, be

not  bluffed again! Listen not to evil propaganda!

Guard  against  this  and  let  us  march  forward

together,  and  fight subversive forces  and  rout

them!  Rout  them out and make this  Singapore  of

ours a happier and a better land to live in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess, Sir, that we would have lost our

fight  last session against subversive forces  had

we  not been endowed with the Marshall law  by  my

predecessor. I refer to the Preservation of Public

Security Ordinance. The people of Singapore should

be   grateful,  as  this  Government   is   indeed

grateful,  to  him for introducing  this  Marshall

law, which is a very effective weapon against  the

rampages  of  the  Communists  and  their  fellow-travellers.  This Marshall law emanated  from  the

mind  of  a  man  who was most vehemently  against

Communism, and among his other achievements,  this

is  the  most  outstanding one when he  was  Chief

Minister.  My  colleagues and I  thank  him,  this

Assembly  thank him, and above all the  people  of

Singapore thank him too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, a few words about our relationship

with  the  Federation of Malaya. I quote from  the

Governor's Speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government is happy to record the continued

cordial  relationship which  it  enjoys  with  the

Government of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government takes the stand that union with

the  Federation is inevitable, and will direct its

energies towards creating a climate and conditions

conducive to such a union."



<br>Sir,  the  Federation Prime Minister, Tunku  Abdul

Rahman,  is  a  man  of  great  understanding  and

appreciation of the ties between Singapore and the

Federation  of  Malaya. The  two  territories  are

inter-dependent.  One cannot prosper  without  the

other.  Any threat to the economic well-being  and

security  of  one  is a threat  to  the  other.  I

therefore hope and pray that the causeway



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



which  bridges the hopes and aspirations  of  true

Malayans  will not be turned into a real political

barrier detrimental to both territories. And  this

Government  is  directing its energies  to  seeing

that this does not happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Governor's Speech there is this

paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government intends to recommend to the

Assembly  the holding of elections for an enlarged

Assembly under the new Constitution as soon as  it

is  practically possible to do so. The  time-table

will  depend  on the preparation and enactment  of

the   necessary  constitutional  instruments   and

legislation  as  well as any measures  which  this

Assembly  may decide to adopt in order to  improve

the  electoral  procedure. The Government  intends

that   the  agreement  with  the  United   Kingdom

Government  on  the  form  of  the  constitutional

instruments  should  be  made  by  the   All-Party

delegation  which took part in the  Constitutional

discussion last year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, questions have been asked at this sitting on

the constitutional instruments, the date of coming

into  effect of the new Constitution, the proposed

trip  to  London, and the Member  for  Changi  has

asked  Government's  view on the  introduction  of

legislation for compulsory voting although he  had

very  much  earlier tabled a motion in support  of

compulsory voting - Motion No. 9 on the Order Paper.

All  these questions, Sir, have been answered this

morning and the motion will be debated at its  due

time.  The answers which I have given to questions

on the draft Constitution need not be amplified. I

would like, however, to say a few words more about

the  London trip. I hope to receive before the end

of  this month from the Colonial Office the  draft

Constitution  so  that copies  can  be  handed  to

members  of  the  All-Party delegation  for  their

study.  I  will  call meetings  of  the  All-Party

delegation  so that we can sort out our  ideas  on

the matter before proceeding to London to finalise

the  constitutional instruments.  The  discussions

will  begin  in  London  on  12th  May,  and   the

delegation  will  be  the  guests  of  the  United

Kingdom  Government to whom I wish  to  record  my

thanks  for  this  hospitality.  I  am  sure  hon.

Members  will  agree  with me  that  the  quickest

possible  way of finalising the draft Constitution

is by discussions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



around   the   table   and   not   by   protracted

correspondence  or telegraphic communication.  The

purpose of the London trip is clear, and yet there

are dishonest politicians who try to read into  it

motives  that are manifestly false.  I  have  been

accused of wanting to reach an understanding  with

the  Colonial  Office to appoint me  as  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  under the new Constitution.  Sir,

the  agreement reached in London with the Colonial

Office  bars  the  appointment as Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara of any person who is closely connected with

politics. How can I ever be, I wonder?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been accused, Sir, of trying to seek

Colonial  Office  approval to  extend  the  Rendel

Constitution so that I can continue  to  be  Chief

Minister. What utter falsehood. The job  of  Chief

Minister was thrust upon me in June 1956 at a time

of  crisis.  I  did not want it, but  duty  to  my

country  and  service to the people  of  Singapore

demanded that I should take it up. The carrying of

two  jobs - that of Chief Minister and  of  Minister

for  Labour  and Welfare - is a heavy one  and  my

health  has suffered in consequence, and the  only

sustaining factor in my job - my two jobs - is that  I

am  serving my country to the best of my  ability,

and  in the discharge of this duty, Sir, there  is

no sacrifice great enough or noble enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now turn to compulsory voting. This

is  the subject which has caused much gnashing  of

teeth and tearing of hair by some politicians  and

erstwhile  friends. As Motion No. 9 on  the  Order

Paper on compulsory voting is still to be debated,

I  do  not  propose to say much  on  this  subject

although  it  has a bearing on that  part  of  the

Governor's Speech which refers to the date of  the

general  elections. However, I would like  to  say

here  and  now  that it was at one of  the  civics

courses  that the view was expressed, not  by  me,

that  compulsory voting would be a good thing  for

the  people of Singapore. This was given publicity

in  the  Press and it brought forth comments  from

individuals and organisations and representations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



to    the    Government   from    certain

organisations.   I   met   representatives    from

organisations that had made representations to me.

I  informed the meeting that if compulsory  voting

was  introduced  at this stage, it  would  mean  a

delay in the general elections, but certainly  not

beyond  the  life  of the Rendel  Constitution.  A

report  of this meeting appeared in last  Sunday's

papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have touched only on the more important

aspects  of  the Governor's Speech  as  these  are

uppermost in the minds of hon. Members. I  do  not

propose  to take up the time of hon. Members  much

longer  by  elaborating  on  what  the  Government

proposes  to  do during this last session.  All  I

need  say is that we are continuing with our four-year  programme. We believe we have done much  and

are  still doing more for the people of Singapore,

and when we appear before them at election time we

shall   go   forward  with  confidence  and   with

satisfaction that we have not failed them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is now the pleasure and the privilege of

hon.  Members  of the opposition to unleash  their

criticisms. We will face them. Indeed we thrive on

them. Let us all on both sides of the House in the

fight  that  may  develop in the  course  of  this

debate not lose sight that the fight ahead  of  us

is a crucial fight for democracy in Singapore. Let

us  go  into the election arena, fight  hard,  but

fight  wisely,  so  that  subversive  forces  with

democratic  organisations as their front  may  not

succeed in stealing away the prize which the  All-Party  delegation brought back last year. May  all

subversive  forces  perish in  this  attempt!  May

democracy  flourish in the new State of Singapore.

Majulah Singapura!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> I second the motion, Sir, reserving my right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.53 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a non-Party man and a Back-bencher, I have not a great deal of criticism to

offer  on the speech made by the Governor  at  the

opening   of   this  session  of   the   Assembly.

Incidentally, Sir, as Backbenchers we used to have

some very nice little desks on which we could  put

our  notes,  but  now we have  not  got  them  any

longer.  So,  placed as they are  on  this  narrow

ledge, I hope the hon. Member for Changi will  not

knock over my notes with his head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only criticism which I would offer of the

speech is, on the whole, that I consider it to  be

a  little airy-fairy and unspecific; otherwise  it

is  the  type of speech one might expect  to  hear

from  a  Conservative or Liberal Government  which

works  in  a  well-established welfare state.  The

opening paragraphs refer mostly to historic facts,

though  one sentence stands out like a  beacon.  I

refer to the sentence which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore exists because of its trade."



<br>Because  of this very fact which surely  everybody

recognises, I myself feel fairly optimistic  about

the  future  of  this  great port,  and  I  cannot

believe  that  any Party would try to  wreck  that

trade.  Such  a  Party would  have  a  very  short

existence.   I   suppose  there  is   always   the

possibility  of a Party getting into  power  which

might  be  intent only on creating  chaos,  but  I

think  it  unlikely. Again, of  course,  we  might

expect  to  hear  the old tune about  blaming  the

colonialists, and the rights of the workers,  with

those  wearying  and repetitive emphases  on  that

very  subject - as if there were only two  types  of

men - workers and non-workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> There are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> The former, of course, being the

P.A.P.  But  I would remind the House  that  while

there is a great deal to be said for looking after

the  welfare of the worker, it is nevertheless the

gifted  individual  in  this  life,  through   his

initiative and genius, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



does things that in the long run advance the well-being  of  the worker. However, that is merely  in

passing,  Sir, I personally have always  disliked

the  term "worker" as such. When I was a young man

we  used  to talk about the "working classes"  and

the  "working  man". Somehow those  terms  sounded

less sinister than "worker"; "worker" suggests  to

me  the beehive or the ant-heap where the will  of

the  inmates  is entirely subjugated  to  that  of

their  leaders;  but  whatever  Party  comes  into

power, Sir, I have no doubt that it will be to the

chagrin  of the other side, and one can only  hope

that the confidence expressed in the final passage

of  His  Excellency's Speech - that he is "confident

that  when  General Elections are held the  people

and  the  new citizens of this island will express

in  definite  and unmistakable terms their  desire

for  a  stable Government" and so on - will  not  be

misplaced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am endeavouring to touch on one or two things

that the Chief Minister did not particularly refer

to  in  his speech - I am not dealing with education

or anything of that nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally believe that the establishment of

secondary industries in this island can never  and

will  never take the place of the entrepot  trade.

There are plently of people here, even in what the

Chief  Minister has just called this august  body,

who  believe  that  the  enormous  and  phenomenal

growth   of   population  presents  no  particular

problem.  They  seem to think that  jobs  will  be

found for them here, in Johore or in Jupiter,  but

I personally am not so sanguine about that, and it

is therefore refreshing to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government recognises the need to offer

incentive  to capital investment in the industrial

field in the initial stages and with this in  view

is  now  preparing `pioneer industry' legislation.

Government  Departments have been  instructed  and

subsidised  Boards  have been  requested  to  give

preference to locally manufactured articles."



<br>That, Sir, is a splendid statement and I hope that

every  Party  will  include  in  its  banner   the

device - "Encourage capital investment."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still touching on this line of country, I was

most interested to hear that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the Government's intention to reorganise

and  strengthen  the  industrial  section  of  the

Ministry   of  Commerce  and  Industry   and   the

possibility  of  the present Industrial  Promotion

Board actively assisting in the promotion of large

scale industries is being studied."



<br>This  is  good news. I have a lot of time for  the

Ministry  of Commerce and Industry. As a  business

man, I take a great interest in its functions  and

I  am  most interested to learn, as I am sure  the

whole business community will be, that it is being

reorganised and strengthened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Industrial Promotion Board, I think it

is high time that this pilot scheme developed into

something   bigger.  I  am  quite   certain   that

Government  could  offer  assistance  to  industry

which would be both helpful and profitable. A lead

actually by Government in this matter might induce

some  local  tycoons who have so far  not  greatly

interested  themselves in industry to invest  some

of their surplus capital in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing with the Governor's Speech, we have

another of those cogent and brief statements:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will continue to do everything in

its power to encourage entrepot trade."



<br>That,  I  think, is a splendid thing too.  Let  us

trade  with everybody, no matter who they are,  as

long  as  they can buy from us and we can sell  to

them. Sir, everybody knows that the coffers of the

rich  land  to  the south of us  are  very  nearly

empty,  but  they have goods to sell  and  we  can

supply them with their needs. Let us at least from

this  end  endeavour to iron out any  difficulties

that may stand in the way of that trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point, Sir, is on the question of banking

legislation. Those of us who have read the  Report

by   Mr  G.  M.  Watson  and  Sir  Sydney  Caine,

familiarly  known as the Watson-Caine Report,  are

aware  that it included draft banking legislation.

Most  bankers  in this city are agreed  that  this

legislation   would   have  to   be   considerably

modified.   The  Colony  banks - and   I   make   no

distinction between the branches of big overseas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



corporations and indigenous banks - understand

their   business   quite   well   and   are   very

conservatively  run. None of their depositors  has

ever   had   an  anxious  moment.  It  is   hoped,

therefore, that the proposed legislation will  not

be  unduly burdensome, but I agree that, with  the

passing  of  the  colonial regime, legislation  to

supervise  the licensing, control and  supervision

of banks in this city is highly desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of the discussions between this

Government and the Government of the Federation of

Malaya  on  the subject of central banking  which,

according to the Governor's Speech, is continuing,

is  anxiously  awaited by the business  community.

The  advent  of  a  central bank  is  inextricably

linked up with the future of this currency and the

pledge that the Government has given "not to  make

any  arrangement which might undermine  confidence

in  the currency in use in Singapore or jeopardise

its  stability"  is, to my mind,  the  outstanding

statement in the speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to dwell on all the fine

things the Government intends to do. The Ministers

of  the  Labour  Front  Coaliton  Government  have

learned  quite a lot in the last three  years  and

they  know  very  well  what causes  Singapore  to

prosper.  I  do not quarrel with their  programme.

The  "unworkable" Rendel Constitution  has  worked

surprisingly well for three years - three  memorable

years  in  which Singapore has not stood still  at

all  but  has grown and developed greatly - and  now

there  seems  to be a fair chance  of  the  Rendel

Constitution running its full four-year course!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the P.R.O.'s translation, the

opening  sentence of the editorial of  the  Utusan

Melayu of 17th April reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Speech of the British Governor of Singapore

at the opening of the Legislative Assembly meeting

last  Wednesday was actually prepared by the Chief

Minister   Mr   Lim  Yew  Hock.   The   Coalition

Government of the Labour Front and U.M.N.O./M.C.A.

Alliance made use of the Assembly meeting, through

the  Governor's report of what has been, is  being

and  will be done, to convince the people  of  the

necessity to re-elect the present Government."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  I  shall  not  be here myself  at  the  next

elections,  but if I were, by gad,  I  think  they

would have my vote!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think this is a convenient time to

suspend.  I will take the Chair again at half-past

two.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at four</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>minutes past twelve o'clock to 2.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 2.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the

curtain rises on the last act of the life of  this

Assembly, it should be recorded that there was  an

air  of  desolation and melancholy, heightened  no

doubt  by the enormously enlarged Chamber and  the

large number of empty seats. But, it is more  than

just  empty seats which made the Governor's Speech

sound  so hollow. I wondered on that day how  many

empty hearts there were.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give the M.C.S. and the expatriate civil

service one bouquet today. They are very good  for

the  stiff upper lip. The thing that impressed  me

most  about the Governor's Speech was his bouncing

demeanour, and his joyful confidence, which I hope

is justified by the confidential appraisal that he

must  have of the overall situation of the  Labour

Front Coalition Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House, Sir, I can only say

that  the mandate from heaven has passed from  the

hands of the Labour Front Coalition Government. We

did  not  come  to this Assembly to hear  all  the

piddling  little things that the Government  hoped

to  enact  in its last few months of office.  What

everybody  wanted to know was when are they  going

to hold the elections. When are we going to have a

new  Government under a new constitution. On these

important  subjects,  the  Speech  was  singularly

silent. It is the art of equivocation. All it says

is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Government intends that the agreement with

the United Kingdom Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



on  the  form  of  the constitutional  instruments

should  be made by the All-Party delegation  which

took  part  in the Constitutional discussion  last

year."



<br>It  can  mean  anything according to the  way  one

chooses to construe it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every Member in this House, if he were to

get  a dose of some truth drug that would make him

tell  the  whole truth and nothing but the  truth,

would  say  that what occupies him most  is,  what

now?  Will  I come back to this Chamber?  And,  of

course,   most  worried  of  them  all   are   the

Independents.   Hence  the  enormous   number   of

Questions  filed  today by the Independents.  They

must  find a bus or some vehicle before  they  can

find  themselves back. The Labour  Front  and  the

Liberal-Socialists have been so shattered  by  the

events  of  the  last  few  months,  events  which

anybody  could  have told them were  coming,  that

they have not quite recovered their balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to ask both the Labour

Front  Government and the Liberal-Socialists Party

is  this:  do  they  want early elections  now?  I

remember  so vividly the taunts of the Member  for

Telok  Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) about the Government

opposite being undemocratic and that the time  had

come  for  early  elections. Even the  Member  for

Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong), during the  debate

over  citizenship, insisted that there  should  be

early  elections. Now we know from the legislative

programme that the Government has planned, and the

conferences that it has planned for 1959, that  it

has  every intention of going on for its full term

of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question is: what will happen after the

District Council elections some time in the middle

of this year? It is not possible for us to pretend

that   this  Assembly  meets  today  in  the  same

circumstances as when it met in December last year

before the City Council elections. And it is  idle

for  us  to  pretend  that the situation  will  be

unchanged  by the results of the District  Council

elections.  The  ex-Chief  Minister  (Mr  D.   S.

Marshall) has suggested that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



London   trip   is   intended   to   enable    his

successor - his  one-time  articled   clerk   -   (I

understand he gets little joy in calling  him  Dr

Lim)  to arrange with Mr Lennox-Boyd to be a Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara, and to have  the  constitution

extended  for two years. I would like to tell  the

ex-Chief Minister that he should not give ideas to

his  old colleagues because they may actually take

the cue, except that with the P.A.P. participation

in  the last talks and our being in this Assembly,

they  are unlikely ever to succeed. But the  truth

is  that  early elections or no depends,  does  it

not, upon the chances of an electoral victory  for

the Labour Front Coalition Parties? That simply is

the  whole  position. If they  had  won  the  City

Council  elections as we wanted them to win - indeed

we did-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> -then there would have been more

bounce  in  them. We might well be on the  way  to

having  elections  in August,  perhaps  September.

Unfortunately,  partly  because  of  the  lack  of

organisation, and also partly because certain Left-wing  elements wanted to destroy the Labour  Front

and  used the Workers Party for this purpose,  the

Labour  Front suffered a catastrophic defeat.  Now

even  the District Council elections will  not  be

held,  in  the words of the Governor,  "until  the

middle  of  this year". Originally, I believe,  it

was scheduled for March. Now I say this advisedly:

we  are prepared to have the elections at any time

because we know that we will win them, be it  this

year or next year. And I say frankly to the Labour

Front,  "There will be no magic formula  that  you

can  concoct  that can bring back  the  secret  of

victory  other than hard work; that has  not  been

done,  the propaganda battle has been lost.  Those

are the hard facts of life."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing should be made clear: this issue of the

early  elections  is completely  unconnected  with

compulsory  voting.  I  know  that  the   ex-Chief

Minister  was somewhat agitated at the thought  of

early elections being postponed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



indefinitely  on  account  of   compulsory

voting. He is renowned for many qualities but  one

of  them  is  not clear thinking. Early  elections

have  nothing to do with compulsory voting. I  ask

the  Chief Minister two questions and, if he  were

honest,  he  would  give me a  reply  which  would

substantiate  what I said. If today all  the  laws

introducing compulsory voting had been passed  and

the constitution were ready, would he have general

elections  when  he knows that  he  is  likely  to

suffer defeat? The answer is no, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You are answering it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Put it in another way: if

there  were no need for compulsory voting laws  to

be  passed  and the constitution is  ready,  would

there be elections when he knows he is going to be

defeated? The answer again is no. And therefore if

it  were not the excuse of compulsory voting there

would  be some other excuse. What is important  is

not  the  question  of  compulsory  voting  or  no

compulsory  voting, but the new  constitution.  We

agreed  to a constitution for full internal  self-government. We know that a draft - or at  least  the

Chief Minister has admitted it as some kind  of  a

draft which is not really a draft - has arrived  and

that   he  has  circulated  bits  of  it  to   the

departments concerned. We have not received a copy

of it although he admitted that we are entitled to

it. Further, he wants to bring the delegation back

to London to settle the draft. Now, Sir, there has

been  considerable  press speculation  on  it.  It

might  well  be  that  some  of  the  leaks   were

officially  inspired,  that  there  will  now   be

written  into the constitution a number of  things

which  were not discussed at all, such  as  making

the   civil  service  sacrosanct,  preventing  the

allowances  as distinct from the salaries  of  the

civil  servants from coming under the  control  of

the  Legislature and the Government, building  the

Public  Service Commission into the  constitution,

making these allowances permanent or consolidating

them into basic salaries, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state my Party stand very clearly

on this matter. Nothing goes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



into  the constitution with our consent other than

that  which we agreed we would take in  London,  a

constitution   giving  us  full   internal   self-government,  that  is,  the  right  to   run   the

Government  within  Singapore  with  no   let   or

hindrance, constitutional or otherwise. I  do  not

think that the armour-plating complex - if all  this

rumour happens to be true, and I have more than  a

fair suspicion that a great deal of it may well be

true - can save the situation. It is utterly foolish

and  stupid  to  believe  that  you  can  make   a

constitution such that you tie up the hands of the

executive and paralyse it at the will of the civil

servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Hon. the Chief Minister rightly

pointed out, it was we who justified what  we  did

in  London  last year, if he cannot hit Mr  David

Marshall  himself, then we do not mind  his  using

the  P.A.P. for that purpose. We have a right more

than  any other Party to see that what we defended

is  what we will get and nothing less. As for  his

trip  to London, we will not be party to this trip

until  we have first received a draft copy of  the

constitution  for our study, and our agreement  to

it. If there are any parts of the constitution  to

which   we  cannot  agree,  then  there  must   be

agreement  between  the  Parties  to  delete  such

passages    from   the   draft.   Otherwise    the

responsibility for this new constitution will rest

on  those  who  will participate in bringing  back

something less than what we originally agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not really concerned today with what the

Labour Front will or will not do for its last year

of  office. Those of us who have had the privilege

of a front-seat view of what has been happening in

the last three years should think clearly and find

out  why  it  failed. I say this with no  rancour.

They  did  not expect to govern. For more  than  a

year,  they  did  not govern. And then  when  they

tried  to  govern, the position was too far  gone.

They  were inept, and they got themselves  into  a

mess.  That  briefly  sums up the  situation.  The

first thing they lacked - and we are reminded of  it

today in the morning press



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



- is   sufficient  integrity  and  drive   in   its

leadership  to give it the cohesion  required  for

the leadership of any movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park (Mr A. R. Lazarous),

the  Member  for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon  Eng),

the Member for Kampong Kapor (Mr Seah Peng Chuan)

who  is  absent - former  Labour  Front  Members - are

throwing  enormous stones at the Government  today

because, for multifarious reasons, the spoils were

not  shared  with them. The ex-Chief  Minister  is

running  around,  it appears,  with  a  "hammer",

large  as life, prepared to knock anybody  who  is

not  in  a position to knock back, and challenging

all  and  sundry.  But he is wiser  now;  he  only

challenges those whom he knows will not accept the

challenge. It is a sad commentary that the  Labour

Front  never grew up from what it was - a collection

of  individuals who got together to run  a  Party,

got   the  surprise  of  their  lives  when   they

unexpectedly   won   the  elections   and   became

Ministers.  They  got an even bigger  surprise  of

their  lives when they opened Pandora's Box and  a

jack-in-the-box  bounced up  at  them.  They  have

never quite recovered from the shock of it all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sight of Assistant Ministers boring

holes in a sinking ship to make sure that it sinks

faster  is a pathetic one, and this is not because

Assistant   Ministers  have  a  habit  of   buying

refrigerators  with $925 cash,  a  practice  which

Assistant  Ministers, or those who  aspire  to  be

such,  should  never adopt. But for  an  Assistant

Minister  to  call  a  meeting  and  condemn  your

Government  for not fulfilling the promises  which

they themselves made, and they themselves have not

carried out, I think takes the cake-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Firstly, I must warn the

strangers  in the Gallery that they must  try  and

contain themselves. Secondly, I think possibly the

hon. Member is contravening the Standing Order  by

attacking  the conduct of a Member of this  House.

He  can  only  do  so of course by  a  substantive motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I do not wish to condemn

the  conduct.  All I wish is to draw attention  to

the   condemnation  or  praise  which  the   facts

themselves  imply. I leave it to  those  who  have

read  the  morning papers to judge for themselves.

The  Labour  Front leadership must be sanguine  in

the  extreme if they believe that with  leadership

material  of  that calibre they  can  survive  the

stresses and strains which must inevitably be  put

on   any  government  taking  office  within   the

framework of the Rendel Constitution, and with the

political situation in Singapore as it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard the Hon. the Chief Minister today

complain bitterly that he had been misrepresented,

that  he  was really not anti-Chinese culture  and

not  anti-Chinese education. He said that  it  was

the  wicked people who made it appear that it  was

so.  But what did he expect? If he carries out  an

anti-subversive purge, does he expect to find  his

victims all docilely waiting to be picked up? Does

he  not  expect them to fight back?  Does  he  not

expect that part of the fight is the presentation - that  he  was  not  just anti the  Chinese  middle

school  boys and girls whom he wanted to pick  up,

but  anti-Chinese culture, anti-Chinese education?

Is  he so innocent? Did he not anticipate that the

moves  he  was making meant that it  could  be  so

construed - unless he was very careful to  see  that

it  could  not - that the Right would take advantage

of the situation, and that his Government would be

pushed  to  the Right? I have heard  nothing  more

damning  of the Labour Front Government than  when

the  nominated Member Mr Sutherland this  morning

stood  up and said with so much condescension  and

patronage, that it was not a bad speech at all-the

sort  of  thing one expects of a Liberal  sort  of

government  or a Conservative sort of  government.

That  from a colonial banker just about  puts  the

seal of death on any political party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us face the facts. That is what has happened.

Wittingly  or  unwittingly, he moved  against  the C.P.  Left  and  allowed himself to be  manoeuvred

into  a  position where he makes speeches  at  the

opening ceremonies of American insurance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companies, gets himself mixed up with

bankers who praise him and his Government as being

Liberal and Conservative. Eventually he finds that

he is no longer crusading on the Left, which might

have  been  his  original  intention  but  fellow-travelling with the reactionary Right to which  he

was  finally drawn. And he must know that this  is

not  the  politics  of  the pre-Rendel  days  when

people  had  pretty little speeches  prepared  for

them,  and  showed  them to  Colonial  Secretaries

before  they made them in the Chamber so that  the

Colonial  Secretaries could prepare their replies.

This  is  a tough business. Power is being  fought

for - power  to control the lives of the  people  of

Singapore,   power  to  shape  and  unshape   the

society.  One  of the most inept things  that  any

politician can do - and I had always thought that at

least  the Member for Havelock (Dr Lim Yew  Hock)

was  a  skilful politician, who has survived first

being  nominated, then being elected into  a  pre-Rendel  Legislature,  then after  sitting  on  the

Rendel  Constitutional Commission getting  himself

elected into the Rendel Legislature, I should have

thought   that   he  would  have  had   sufficient

political  aptitude - was to come  to  this  Chamber

this  morning and repeat all the rumours that have

been   circulating  against  him,  thereby  giving

credence to them. Any book on propaganda will tell

him  that  the last thing you should  do  about  a

rumour is to repeat it - worse still, repeat it  and

then deny it. Today he repeated the rumour that he

was     anti-Chinese     culture,     anti-Chinese

civilisation.  He  repeated  the  rumour  that  he

wanted   to   extend  the  life  of   the   Rendel

Constitution. He repeated the rumour that  he  was

going  to  settle with Mr Lennox-Boyd to  be  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Why such ineptitude?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the final reason, in my view, why this

Government  has failed and will fail, despite  all

the  flourish at the end of the Governor's Speech,

is  because it has not the capacity to govern.  It

had  the civil service run the Government for  it.

It  is  an open secret, is it not, that there  are

what is commonly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



known   in   the  civil  service  as   "PL.   D.W.

Ministers".  I am told that the "PL."  stands  for

"Please"   and  "D.W."  for  "Deal   With".   When

Government  servants send up enormous  bunches  of

files  to  harass Ministers who already find  that

their  constituents are bothering them  more  than

they  expected, with an urgent note at the  botton

"What shall we do? Shall we do (a), (b), (c), (d),

(e)  or (j)", the Minister puts at the bottom "PL.

D.  W."  and they go back to be "dealt with".  The

Labour  Front will fail as much because it  lacked

the  political aptitude, as well as the  political

touch  which  one  could not  expect  of  a  civil

service.  The  only thing that  saves  the  Labour

Front  from total rot is because there are a  few,

although  very  few, individuals  with  sufficient

integrity  and the will to resist a  complete  rot

from  setting  in. But for that, they  would  have

gone beyond redemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said, not as an idle boast, that the

P.A.P. will win the elections if they  were  held

tomorrow,   or  next  year,  short  of   something

catastrophic  happening or something very  foolish

that  we do. And we will win them, apart from  the

question  of  having  a  better  organisation  and

having better personnel, because the other Parties

do  not  attempt to understand the  meaning  of  a

social  revolution. Have they not ceased to wonder

why  in  the  last four months the Government  was

just  swept aside and the attention of the  people

of  Singapore  was focussed on the  City  Council?

Why?  Because it had captured the hearts and minds

of  the workers. [Interruption.] Yes, workers! Mr

Sutherland  does not believe that  men  should  be

called  workers. He thinks that there is  no  such

thing  as workers. He believes in a working class.

Well, that is a more Marxist way of putting it and

according  to  the Marxists - and I think  they  are

quite  right in this - there are two types:  workers

and those who live off workers-drones.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> What are you?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have always admired the

British for their aplomb, under the most difficult

of  circumstances. It rather saddens  me  to  hear

that he will be leaving us soon. To think that one

should  miss a bayonet target for practice  before

the  time is up is a matter for regret. But I also

wondered how much harm he was doing to the  Labour

Front  Government and the colonial system  by  his

most untimely interjections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish unduly to demoralise the Government

but  let  them ask themselves. Why is it that  the

Lorong  3  fire  had  a public  response  and  the

spontaneous  goodwill flowing in  which  no  other

fire in the past had evoked. True, this is an All-Party effort. This is just by way of illustration.

For  the first time they begin to understand  that

these  magnificent  institutions  like  the   City

Council, which they had viewed as institutions  of

bureaucracy and petty oppression could  be  turned

into  public  institutions for  their  protection,

welfare  and  benefit. Albeit,  they  needed  some

colourful  gesture like throwing out the  mace  to

drive the lesson home. But that is the lesson  the

Labour Front must learn if they want to know  what

is  going on, and have a chance to compete at all.

The  Labour Front leader in the City Council said - as it was reported in the last few days and with a

great  deal  of  silent praise  from  the  English

language  press - "Oh well, let's have the Mayor  of

Penang  here but let's have none of this  nonsense

about,  `Down  with colonialism  and  all  that,'"

because obviously by implication, his Party is not

in  favour  of  it. For the first time,  the  City

Council  is going to mean something to the people.

If  we - this year or next year - we are prepared  for

it any time, - cannot do the same transmutation for

the  institutions  of  Government  and  make  them

become   symbols  of  the  people's   rights   and

privileges   instead   of  symbols   of   colonial

bureaucracy and oppression, then at the end of our

five-year  term of office, we will be out  on  our

heels and deserve to perish.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in pursuit of a social revolution, never pay

the  slightest  attention to the  present  English

language    press.   Praise   from   them    means

destruction.  Decide what you have to  do,  decide

what  is  right and press on. The more  they  howl

against you, the more you can be certain that  you

are  on the right track. For that reason, I  would

like to say this for the benefit of the expatriate

officers in the City Council. We have the  courage

and  the  will,  to  govern. We expect  the  civil

service including the civil servants of the  local

Government to obey us and do our bidding. If  they

foolishly choose to enter the political arena  and

join political issue with us, as the President  of

their expatriate association sought to do, writing

letters to the press saying that the P.A.P. policy

is going to bring chaos and the whole City Council

to a halt, then they must expect that they are not

just  fighting  the Mayor and twelve  Councillors.

They are fighting the whole of the P.A.P. Although

we  may be in the minority in the City Council, at

the  latest  by the end of one year,  it  is  this

Chamber  which will determine what happens  there.

Any participation by civil servants who oppose  or

sabotage the political policy of a Party which  is

given  the  constitutional right  to  govern  will

bring swift and certain retribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, is briefly, why the P.A.P. has not

failed.  I do not say that if or when we form  the

Government we will succeed where the Labour  Front

failed.  But  we  will  certainly  make  a  better

effort,  and we have this one great advantage.  We

have  seen Pandora's Box opened and now know  what

is  inside.  Whoever  forms the  next  Government,

should  give this bouquet to the departing  Labour

Front Government. They charted a minefield. We now

know  where the booby traps are, and have  a  fair

idea  where a few more might be. They got hurt  in

the  process  of finding out the booby  traps.  We

hope  that when our turn comes we will not  be  so

badly  hurt;  more, we hope that we  will  make  a

success of it because we have seen how not to  win

an  election, and how not to not govern. We  ought

to  know how to win the elections, and having  won

them, how to set out firmly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



democratically  and wisely to  govern,  and  bring

about   the  social  revolution  that  we  promise

beforehand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, as a last parting shot to the

Liberal-Socialists  on this side  and  the  Labour

Front  on the other side of the House: do not  try

and out-P.A.P. the P.A.P. It is a very foolish and

unprofitable business. The ex-Chief Minister tried

it;  he  ceased to be the Chief Minister. He  came

back  as  the  Member for Cairnhill and  tried  it

again;  he  ceased to be the Member for Cairnhill.

We  told  the City Council workers that  the  City

Council could stand an extra 20 cents per day  per

worker. The Labour Front and the Lib-Socs who were

there for years and years and never gave them even

five  cents  more said, "Double you;  make  it  40

cents."  We  still  said  20  cents  and  we  were

outvoted.  But in the end it is they who  will  be

outvoted. We said, "Prepare for essential services

to  go  on  in  case  of a strike."  The  Liberal-Socialists said, -the Member for Tanglin (Mr John

Ede)  may  not know what is going on in  the  City

Council, and he may not be aware that his  cinemas

may close down without electricity - "Do not prepare

for  it." And the Straits Times in order to do  us

harm said, "P.A.P. are strike breakers."! Tomorrow

if the strike takes place in the City Council, the

ultimate   person  responsible  for  running   the

essential services will be the Minister for  Local

Government.  He  knows  it,  and  his  own   Party

abstained - at   least  they  had   the   sense   to

abstain - but  the  Lib-Socs and  the  Labour  Front

voted against preparing for essential services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, anybody in his senses knows that this

Assembly  has  outlived itself. It is  like  stale

eggs,  as  a  newspaperman who I  believe  was  of

American  extraction put it,  "Gosh,  there  is  a

smell  of  stench  around  here."  Looking  in  an

injured  sort  of  way, I said, "Where  from?"  He

said,  "Ah well, you know, some of these  chaps  I

still see around." Well, not wishing to breach the

privileges  of  this Assembly and not  wanting  to

besmirch  the character, integrity and  reputation

of my hon. Friends in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



House,  I  give  this last bouquet to  the  Labour

Front.  They tried but they did not have a chance.

They did not have a team to start with. They broke



up  before  it started. They kept on  breaking  up

after  it  started, and even before  it  is  over,

Assistant  Ministers are throwing  stones  at  the

Government.  By  the time it is over - I  understand

that the Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga)  is

a  good shot with a shotgun - I hope they do not  go

shooting each other as we bid them adieu.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  speak now since hon. Members  from  both

sides of the House are so reluctant to stand up to

speak.  I wonder whether they are shocked  by  the

speech  of the Member for Tanjong Pagar or by  the

speech  of  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister   this

morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recollect that as soon as the Governor's

Speech  was delivered, we adjourned to the  C.P.A.

Room for a cocktail party and one hon. Member from

the  Government side asked me what I thought about

it.  I  said, "No, I do not like it. It  is  weak,

bad,  just  like a painted doll and  if  you  will

allow  me to use a proper Chinese phrase,  I  will

call  it  "phoon  ser  kai  pin".  I  cannot  find

suitable  words to describe the Governor's  Speech

except   to   say  that  it  is  like  a   painted

doll - beautiful but not in place, smiling  but  not

appealing - bad  and  weak. I was very  disheartened

when  I heard the Member for Tanjong Pagar give  a

blab,  blah,  blah  speech. I still  remember  the

column  where  he said when debating the  previous

Governor's Speech - I quote "Hansard", Volume 2, No.

2 of 5th September, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But to ignore the political realities which

surround this whole Assembly, this Government  and

the whole country is political childishness."



<br>Never  so  true! I happily endorse every  word  of

this sentence by the Member for Tanjong Pagar, for

the speech he has just delivered is childish, Sir.

He tried to be smart by ridiculing every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



Member and every Party in this House. He was  even

so  sure that the P.A.P. will be in power  at  the

next  elections and he also warned all the Members

who  dared  to oppose the P.A.P. with  the  words,

"You will see, you will see."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether you will allow me to

suggest that we should all stand up and bow to the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar and say, "You  are  the

hero  of  Singapore. You are the champion  of  the

underdogs in Singapore!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It was Mr Marshall who -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I myself come here to

learn. Let us always be humble and also let us

realise that if nationalism is to be our first

achievement, we should try to get the support of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us talk about the real political

situation. I think we are now going through a very

dangerous  period in the history of Singapore.  On

one  side, we have the English educated class  and

the  middle  class of people who adopt  the  "tida

apa"  attitude.  On the other side,  we  have  the

political  fanatics who do nothing else  but  talk

politics, morning, noon and night. Then  there  is

the most extremist element in this country who try

to  introduce all sorts of "isms" and theories. If

China introduces land reforms, they want to follow

suit.  Just now, an hon. Member borrowed the  word

"Marxist". This word was used many years  ago.  Is

it   suitable   for   this  country?   The   third

element - which is the most dangerous  and  which  I

think  all  Members in this House can do something

about - is  the  clash  of political  personalities:

Harry Lee versus David Marshall!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I know that the hon. Member

is working himself up but he should still remember

his Standing Orders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I would like to comment

on  the clash of political personalities. I do not

know why they are fighting each other for. Both of

them  claim  to be champions of the  workers,  the

underdogs,  Socialism and leaders of  the  Chinese

school  students.  Sir, we heard  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  exclaim with conviction  that  the

next Government will be a P.A.P. Govvernment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> God forbid!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> He has commented many times

on  the recognition of the Malayan Communist Party

and  I do not want to see a Prime Minister styling

himself  as,  "I  am a Leftist.  I  am  a  genuine

Leftist  and I will arrest all opportunists."  Let

us  be  fair.  I have the utmost respect  for  the

genius  and  ability  of our  learned  friend  the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar. Why does he  not  think

that  it  is  time for him to stand up boldly  and

courageously to say, "I am a Rightwing leader  and

against   the   M.C.P. element  whether   secret,

underground or even within my own Party." He  must

admit, Sir, that he has already made himself known

as  a  Right-wing leader within the P.A.P. I still

remember  that the Left-wing leader of  his  Party

was  supposed to be Mr Rajah. Why can he not say,

"I am a nationalist leader. I am the leader of all

classes - workers,  farmers and merchants,"  instead

of saying, "I am the champion of the workers," and

ridiculing  Mr  Sutherland  as  the  "Member  for

Tanglin  Club" and everybody else.  Now  when  the

City  Council is short of funds, he says, "Let  us

think  how  to float loans on the London markets."

Why  can he not realise that if the Hon. the Chief

Secretary (Mr E. B. David) is instructed  by  Her

Majesty's  Government  to  reduce  their  military

commitments  in Singapore or withdraw their  Army,

Navy and Air Force within 24 hours, how we are  to

find jobs for the over 40,000 workers employed  by

these  Services? How are we going to  provide  the

livelihood  for  those  employed  by  these  three

Services?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> And I want to see how the

adviser  to the Naval Base Workers' Union and  the

Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



Sembawang  (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)  who  is  the

Secretary of that union are going to provide their

workers with new jobs. That is why we have to face

the  "political realities". The Member for Tanjong

Pagar should realise that it is high time for  him

to  decide  whether he is Right-wing or  Left-wing

and  whether  he believes that the only  Left-wing

Party  in  Singapore is the M.C.P. He  should  not

declare,  "I  am  a  champion. I  am  the  Leftist

element and the rest of you are all hypocrites and

opportunists.   We  the  P.A.P. stand   for   the

underdogs!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I can foretell the future, within five

years  or  three  years or  even  soon  after  the

General  Elections have been held, I will  not  be

surprised  to  see  the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

become  a  staunch Right-wing leader and  I  think

that will be a blessing for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let us come back to the Governor's

Speech  which I criticised as bad and weak but  at

least they have a very courageous Minister in  the

Minister  for  Commerce and Industry  (Mr  J.  M.

Jumabhoy)  who said some time ago that  those  who

scared  away  capital investment in  this  country

were "irresponsible" politicians. Sir, there is no

better  word than that. All of us including myself

are  irresponsible politicians in  that  we  never

gave the people of Singapore a clear-cut policy on

Merdeka  and we now find that we are to have  only

internal self-government. We say that Socialism is

best  for  our country and we say that as entrepot

trade  is  so essential, we must try to  encourage

more capital investment. But are we doing that? We

are  discouraging capital. Sir, I think it is high

time  to  consider the dangers which lie ahead  as

the  entrepot  trade has been on the  decline  for

many  months. Employment is decreasing day by  day

and   the   possibility  of  a  merger  with   the

Federation  of  Malaya  is  getting  further   and

further  away.  These are the  three  main  issues

which we should all try to solve and not the blah,

blah  political talks. May I ask, "Has  any  trade

union  leader or any champion of the labourers  or

any adviser to trade union workers in this country

ever  said,  `Look, chum, if you want to  increase

your living standards and your wages, you must try

at the same time to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



increase  the  industrial output.'?"  It  must  be

explained  to the workers that by their increasing

the   industrial   output  they   are   indirectly

increasing  the national income. The irresponsible

politicians and irresponsible trade union advisers

only  know  how to win votes. They are now  making

enough  but  they are not so sure  that  the  next

election  is  sure for you. Telling enough  lies - I

want  to  see how they are going to win and  rule,

Sir!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member used the second

person  and then followed it up with an expression

that  somebody is telling lies. I think  the  word

"lies"  is  unparliamentary with  reference  to  a

Member  of  the  Assembly. The  hon.  Member  will

withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I will change it to

untrue, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is the word "lies" that I

wish to be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I withdraw

it, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a merger with the Federation of

Malaya  has  again been repeated in the Governor's

Speech -  this  is  the  third  time  it  has  been

repeated. But I wonder how we are going to achieve

that. I do not know whether the rumour is true  or

not   that   the  Hon. the  Minister  for   Local

Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul  Hamid)

many  a  time has openly told the public that  the

Chief  Minister of the Federation of Malaya (Tunku

Abdul  Rahman)  is  very much against  the  merger

because  (1) of the labour unrest - in other  words,

the  existence of subversive elements and  (2)  of

the  Chinese population. Sir, I do not worry about

the  first point but I am quite worried about  the

second  point.  I hope the Member  for  Ulu  Bedok

(Inche Abdul Hamid) can be clear about this  point

because  it  is  quite harmful to  bring  up  this

racial  issue. It is all right to say that  it  is

for economic or political reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to criticise the Government

item by item especially as, I must confess, I have

always had a high



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



regard  for our elected Ministers during the  past

three  years.  Even the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

said that they tried their best but that they were

not ready for the task of governing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring up a very important point

in the Governor's Speech regarding gangster

activities:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will continue with its determined

efforts to combat crime, gangster and secret

society activities."



<br>Sir, it is also pointed out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The increased awareness by the public for the

need to give all possible assistance to the police

is encouraging."



<br>Further it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will maintain the established

high  standards of efficiency and  morale  of  the

Police .



<br>Sir, "efficiency and morale of the Police." I dare

challenge you the Chief Secretary (Mr E. B.

David) to come along with me-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is the first time I have

been  called the Chief Secretary. I think the hon.

Member should remember that he should address  the

Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I dare

challenge  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary  to  come

along  with  me  into  every nook  and  corner  of

Singapore  and ask the public how much  confidence

they have in the efficiency of the police. Sir, we

must  admit  that  they  have  very,  very  little

confidence.  They  have no  faith  in  the  police

especially  in the detectives. Sir,  this  country

has  achieved tremendous political advancement but

I  am  so  sorry to witness that the police  force

follows  the  old traditional way. When  Group  24

fights  Group 08, the latter uses the services  of

Group  36  to  fight Group 24 and this  makes  the

C.I.D. appear very busy against the gangsters - more

arrests  every  day, men detained  for  24  hours,

finger-prints, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will continue with its determined

efforts  to  combat  crime,  gangster  and  secret

society activities."



<br>Sir, I think it will not be a good thing if they

carry on with their present policy of engaging

detectives who were formerly gangsters and secret

society



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



men.   How   can  you  trust  them?   Under   such

circumstances,  how  can  our  police  force  work

efficiently?   The   inspectors   rely   on   what

information  they  get from  the  detectives.  The

Commissioner of Police relies on whom? On the O.C.

and  the  A.S.P.'s. So, to me, the C.I.D. is  more

harmful  than the subversive elements. It is  high

time   for   Government   to   formulate   a   new

revolutionary  policy, even though  they  have  to

wipe  out the whole C.I.D. The people do not  want

them.  They are irresponsible and corrupted.  They

use  Her  Majesty's  power  to  threaten  innocent

people. I think it is high time to check that. Why

cannot the Chief Secretary try to get advice  from

Hongkong, to recruit more Chinese into the  police

force,   to  recruit  more  intelligent,  educated

detectives?  If  Hongkong  can  do  it,  why   not

Singapore?   It   is  high   time   to   have   an

understanding and friendly police force. You  must

admit that not only the language barrier, not only

the  custom or the tradition barrier, but also the

whole  set-up is made of rock. It is not  made  of

wood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to touch on is the

importation of publications. Just now the Hon. the

Chief  Minister  said that the  people  blame  his

Government for being against Chinese education and

against  Chinese culture. I think he deserves  it.

Maybe  he  should  throw the blame  on  the  Chief

Secretary. The Chief Secretary is very  unfair  on

this  question. I have a lot of books sent  to  me

from  Hongkong and sometimes from China. Some  are

purely   pictorial  magazines  and  some   Chinese

fiction.  But  always I have a chit saying,  "This

publication  is  being  kept  in  custody  by  the

Chinese Secretariat. If you want to claim it under

section  so  and so of such and such an Ordinance,

you can; otherwise it will not be released."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the Sin Pao, Sir, they have banned

it.  Maybe  the Government have all  the  evidence

against  it of which I am not aware. But,  Sir,  I

want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



to  know  how many Hongkong sexy yellow newspapers

have been imported into the colony. Sir, the local

mosquito papers live on fabricating a lot of  sexy

stories  and  printing  nude  pictures,  and   the

Government just simply ignore them. Naturally  the

young  and  inexperienced Chinese school  boys  or

teachers  will be misled by them. Sir, we  do  not

like  such poisonous and undesirable publications.

The  Government not only banned the Sin  Pao,  but

they  brought its editors to court. Naturally this

Government  is  branded  as  not  being  able   to

understand  Chinese  culture. Therefore  they  are

anti-Chinese culture. Although they know that  the

Chinese  intellectuals are against yellow culture,

yet  they  allow yellow pamphlets,  magazines  and

newspapers published abroad to come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the last point, Sir, why do the

Government  not boldly say, "We want to  carry  on

with this Government until 1959. We want to finish

the  term."?  Why do the Government not  say,  "We

support compulsory voting."? Why do the Government

not  say,  "We have a lot of things to do,  so  we

have  to  carry on another few months."?  But  now

they  say  the  delay  is  because  of  compulsory

voting.  Without compulsory voting, they say  they

can  fulfil  their  promise to  hold  the  general

election  in August or September. I challenge  the

Chief  Minister to be so bold as to say  that  the

postponing of the general elections to  next  year

has  nothing to do with compulsory voting. He must

not  mislead  the public into believing  that  his

Government is sincere and determined to  have  the

general elections in September, but this damn fool

Member for Changi introduced-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must not

forget  himself. He is going a little beyond  what

is  order.  He is becoming really disorderly.  The

hon.  Member must remember that. In future I  will

take  a more serious view. Will he please withdraw

the expression?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I beg to withdraw the

expression.  I thought I could call  myself  that!

Sir,  I  want the Government to be bold.  Let  the

people  know exactly what the Government is  like.

Yes,  say  that  the Labour Front Government  have

confidence in their four-year programme; that they

must carry on their programme, but not because  of

compulsory  voting.  Sir,  I  think  I  have  said

enough.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one thing is very clear from the

speech of his Excellency the Governor. It is  that

the  Government  is well aware that  its  term  of

office  is nearing its end and that elections  are

around   the   corner - though  the  Government   is

reluctant to tell us how big that corner is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Excellency's speech begins with casual

references   to  the  forthcoming   Assembly   and

District Council elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ends with a not so casual reference to the

general  elections  and  to  the  time  when  this

Government will have "to lay down its office."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention these facts because I think it will

help  us  to understand a little more clearly  all

the  fine and praiseworthy sentiments which appear

between  the opening and closing passages  of  the

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appears in between is a shop-window display

for  the election season to remind the people that

the  Government is prepared to do  in  the  fourth

year of its office what it could have done in  the

three years that went before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, Sir, the programme appears a little

crowded. The Government is going to combat  crime,

gangsterism and secret society thugs. It is  going

to  carry  out a survey of the Colony's industrial

potential  and  markets. It is  going  to  promote

largescale  industries. It is going  to  encourage

entrepot  trade and tourism. It is going  to  grow

more  food  and promote rural development.  It  is

going  to  give every child the chance  to  get  a

primary education up to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



age  of  14.  There are going to be more  schools,

hospitals  and houses - in fact, more of everything.

It is going to introduce a social insurance scheme

based on the Caine and Brocklehurst Reports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not exhaust the list of good things to

come  but  all these are going to be done  in  the

next few months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, Sir, the fourth year is going to be

remembered  as a year of promise and a far  busier

year than all the other three years put together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may even leave the Government little time to

think  about  or prepare for the District  Council

and Assembly elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bothers me is why the Government has waited

until  the  last  few months of  its  life  before

trying to start its social revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government's programme is to be fully

implemented, it will involve great changes to  our

social and economic structure. It may be that  all

that  the  Government intends to do is  merely  to

pass  a  number of Bills proposing this  and  that

change - a paper social revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, the Government pledges itself,

to use its own words, "to safeguard the welfare of

the  people of Singapore, to raise their level  of

living  and  to  use  this  last  Session  towards

achieving these ends."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if it had more time at its disposal than

it actually has, it can only redeem this pledge by

fighting  those  who  have a  vested  interest  in

preserving the present order of things. It must be

prepared  to  plan its economy which means  seeing

that   there  is  a  greater  control   over   the

activities of private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its programme means finding the money to finance

these things. This means increased taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet all these years the Government has been

reluctant to do these things, much to the  delight

of  the  Liberal-Socialists  who  like  socialism,

provided  the wealthy remain wealthy and there  is

no  interference by Government with the  financial

activities of the wealthy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's programme therefore means

nothing,  because  it is a harmless  film  trailer

promising  "stupendous", "colossal"  and  "mighty"

things  which will eventually prove to be  nothing

of the sort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough to say that you are going to do

this  or  that during the few months left  to  the

Government. A government which really wants to  do

these  things  must have the will and  courage  to

meet the fierce opposition of vested interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent events in the City Council are examples of

how  local  reactionaries and expatriate officials

of  the  City  Council will join  hands  to  fight

progress where it hurts their privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Labour Front will do no more than

declare  their  pious intentions in these  things.

There  may  be a few people who mean well  in  the

Labour Front. But it requires more than just a few

well-meaning types to make the social revolution a

reality. That is the tragedy of the Labour  Front.

Too  many  bad  types,  too  few  good  ones.  The

ultimate  result  is a foregone  conclusion.  They

have my sympathies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing the speeches from the Member

for Tanjong Pagar and the Member for Changi, I  do

not  know where I am. I hear of the Right. I  hear

of the Left. And now I hear of the Left within the

Right, or the Right within the Left. As far  as  I

am  aware, we have the Rightists and we  have  the

Leftists. But now I come to know that there  is  a

Right  within the Left. What that means, I  really

cannot  understand. Now who belongs to this  class

of  people? The old saying goes: "Whoever the  cap

fits,  let  him  wear it." The Malays  say:  Siapa

makan chilli rasa pedas. (Those who eat the chilli

will  feel hot.) Really I would like to  know  who

belong to this category of people - who are in  fact

the Right within the Left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these speeches, instead of concentrating

on  the  Governor's Speech, are  more  or  less  a

challenge   to   every  Member  in  this   House - a

challenge issued by the leader of the P.A.P., the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Tanjong Pagar. He says  that  whoever

dare  go  against the P.A.P. in the  next  general

elections  will collapse. It would appear  to  me,

Sir,   from  what  he  says,  that  no  Party   or

Independent  should go against the P.A.P. in  the

elections - that  the Labour Front should  not  take

part;  neither should the Liberal-Socialists  take

part.  If  the P.A.P. contest the elections  alone

and  have  a walkover in all divisions, then  this

Assembly  will have nothing but 51 P.A.P. Members.

Then  where is the Opposition? Where is the chance

of  opposition? Is this a challenge to everyone of

us  here? After this challenge, Sir, I would  like

to  know  how many of the present Members of  this

House  are prepared to come forward and fight  the

general  elections.  The Member  for  Changi  says

there is only one hero in Singapore, and he is the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar. So if there  is  anyone

who  is prepared to accept that challenge,  he  is

more of a hero than the hero himself!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every candidate who stands for election

certainly  looks forward to winning. The  Liberal-Socialists fielded candidates in all the divisions

for  the  City  Council elections.  What  was  the

result?  They gained only a few seats. The  Labour

Front  was  also  confident of  winning  the  City

Council  elections. What was the result? They  had

only  three or four seats. How can we predict that

we  are sure of winning the elections? Let me  see

whether  that prediction of the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  will come true. If the prediction does  not

come  true,  I wonder what will be the consequence

for  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  since  he  has

boasted  that his Party will come into power.  Let

all   of  us  stand  for  the  elections  to   the

Legislative  Assembly. Let us hope  for  a  stable

government, irrespective of which Party comes  in,

rather  than  boast that it is the  Leftist  Party

that  will  come into power. Unfortunately  within

that  Leftist Party there is a Right. So where  is

the Leftist Party, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Governor's Speech, I will read

this paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore exists because of its trade. Under the

new  Constitution the Government of the  State  of

Singapore,  acting with the assent of  the  United

Kingdom Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



will  have  the  power  to  initiate  and  conduct

matters  concerning  trade and cultural  relations

with other countries."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is it necessary that we should have the

assent  of the United Kingdom Government regarding

trade?  Are  we not going to have self-government?

If  we are going to have self-government cannot we

consider  ourselves  fit to decide  on  our  trade

relations? Singapore is a free trading  port  and,

as  such, we should certainly be allowed to decide

on  our trading relations with anybody we want  if

it  is  in the interests and for the good  of  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was not a member of the delegation that

went  to  the constitutional talks. I do not  know

whether  this  clause was included  in  the  draft

constitution or not. If it was there, then I  have

very  little to say, because it was agreed by  the

All-Party delegation of this House. If it was  not

there,  I hope that the next delegation to  London

(the Chief Minister says it will be going soon)

will see that this clause is not in it and that we

have a free hand to decide on our trade relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the political Parties in this

Assembly want to kill the Liberal-Socialist Party.

Every  time a Member stands up, he says,  "Let  us

kill  the  Liberal-Socialist Party", because  that

Party is accused of being a capitalist Party. So I

am  of the opinion that, by including that clause,

you  will, in the first instance, kill trade,  and

if  you kill trade, you will kill capital, and  by

killing  capital,  you will  indirectly  kill  the

Liberal-Socialists - and   I   hope   the   Liberal-Socialists will wake up to that issue!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point is the mention of cordial

relations with the Government of the Federation of

Malaya. This is what the Governor said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Again, since the Second Session of this

Assembly, the Federation of Malaya has emerged  as

a  sovereign independent state. The Government  is

happy to record the continued cordial relationship

which  it  enjoys  with  the  Government  of   the

Federation of Malaya."



<br>Sir, the Chief Minister has said this morning that

he  has  not  received  any  indication  from  the

Government of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



Federation  of  Malaya  regarding  travel   passes

across   the   causeway.  Now   if   this   should

materialise,  then  it  is going  to  be  serious,

because   it  is  going  to  affect  that  cordial

relationship  which the Governor has mentioned.  I

only  hope that it will not materialise, but  from

the  publicity that has been given  in  the  local

Press,  I  think  it will. Now  with  the  cordial

relationship  not between the two Governments  but

between  the  Prime Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya   and  the  Chief  Minister  of  Singapore - because they have had cordial relations and drinks

together - I hope the Chief Minister will  carefully

look  into this question of travel passes and  see

that  the  Federation of Malaya  does  not  impose

them,  so  as to maintain the cordial relationship

between  Singapore and the Federation.  The  Chief

Minister  this  morning has said that  one  cannot

exist  without the other. Neither can one  prosper

without the other. Sir, if it is his view that one

cannot  exist or prosper without the  other,  then

let travel over the causeway be free. There should

be  no  bar.  Then we will have, in  fact,  actual

cordial relationship between the two countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the general elections, Sir, I think the

Member  for Changi is right. Whether we  hold  the

elections this year or next year, the question  of

compulsory  voting  does  not  come  in.  If   the

Government is serious in having early elections, I

am  quite  sure it could set up the  machinery  to

meet the deadline. Now, the Governor in his speech

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government intends to recommend to the

Assembly  the holding of elections for an enlarged

Assembly under the new Constitution as soon as  it

is practically possible to do so."



<br>"As  soon as it is practically possible to do so."

What a vague term, Sir! How long will this be? One

year,  two years, or three years? Whether you  are

going  to delay the elections, or whether you  are

going  to  have early elections, there must  be  a

target  date, and if there is one, then Government

can  work  towards it. Without a target date,  the

Government  can  give any amount of  excuses.  The

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar has said  this  morning

that any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



amount  of  excuses can be given if the Government

wants  to  carry on. If the Government is serious,

let  it name that target date and let it not  hold

the  public in suspense. Every Member on this side

of the House has asked for an early election and I

am  sure  that  we  are all  keen  to  have  early

elections.  But the Government has said  no,  just

because   of  compulsory  voting.  Let  compulsory

voting  be  one  issue  and  early  elections   be

another. As the Member for Changi has said, if the

Government cannot have early elections,  then  let

it  come out boldly and say, "We cannot have them,

not  because of compulsory voting, but because  we

cannot  complete  our  machinery  to  have   early

elections  this  year." But whatever  may  be  the

reason,  Sir, I still say that there should  be  a

target  date  for us to aim at. Without  a  target

date  you cannot aim at anything, and without  any

aim you get nowhere. Where can you get to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Tokyo!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Tokyo! Yes, quite a number

will be going there very soon!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of fishing, the Governor

said in his speech that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the Government's intention to take all

necessary steps to increase the supply of fish and

to assist local fishermen who are willing to be

trained in new methods of fishing."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how can the Government claim that it

supports the fishing industry when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



it  encourages foreigners to come in  and  compete

with  our  local fishermen? I see the Minister  is

nodding his head. As far as I can understand,  the

catch by our local fishermen is quite adequate  to

meet  the  demands of our local people.  Then  why

encourage foreigners to come in? I understand that

the Ministry is trying to encourage Japanese boats

to  come  in  to  compete. From what  I  was  told

sometime  back, four licences were issued  to  the

Japanese  to  come into Singapore to compete  with

our  local  fishermen. Now for the information  of

the  Minister, many shops which are in the fishing

trade  have closed down recently because  of  this

competition.  Is  this  the Government's  idea  of

trying   to   support  the  fishing  industry   in

Singapore, or trying to kill it? The Minister  has

always  given these slogans - "Support local goods!"

"Buy Singapore goods!" "Support local industries!"

(Lorong 3) started at about 4.30 p.m. on Saturday,

5th  April, 1958 and was brought under control  at

about  7.30 p.m., by which time over 100 huts  had

been  destroyed, rendering 379 families  or  2,050

persons homeless. An emergency feeding scheme  was

immediately  put into operation by the  Department

of  Social Welfare at Sims Avenue Community Centre

at  8 p.m. to feed those who were in need of food.

Coffee with milk was also served. In the meantime,

steps  were taken to establish a Relief Centre  at

Geylang  English  School to house  those  who  are

without  alternative accommodation. Blankets  from

the  Civil Defence store were distributed  to  all

the  families  in the Relief Centre.  This  Relief

Centre is run by the Department of Social Welfare,

whose officers are on duty day and night to attend

to   the  needs  of  the  fire  victims,  such  as

answering queries or calling for the ambulance  in

case  of sickness or birth. On Sunday, 6th  April,

1958  an emergency payment of $5 a person was made

by  the Department of Social Welfare. A total  sum

of $10,075 was expended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Cross Charitable Institution which has

always worked hand in hand with the Department  of

Social Welfare after a fire, swung into action the

next  day,  that is, Sunday, 6th April,  1958  and

assumed  full responsibility for feeding the  fire

victims twice a day. It also supplied tea,  coffee

and  cold drinks to the victims throughout the day

and  night.  In  addition, it  supplied  household

necessities  such  as  tooth brush,  tooth  paste,

soap, towels and so on to the victims.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the number of children, nurses from

the  Health Department of the City Council are  on

day  and night duty looking after the feeding  and

care  of  the  children. The St. John's  Ambulance

Brigade  (since  withdrawn), and the  British  Red

Cross  also  did day and night duty in the  Relief

Centre.  The  Civil Defence personnel  helped  and

supplied the necessary transport during the  first

and  second  day. The number of voluntary  welfare

workers  that  helped  were  too  numerous  to  be

mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response from the public to the appeal for

donations in cash and kind was overwhelming.  Rice

and  fresh  food  continued to be donated  to  the

Relief  Centre in large quantities and the  amount

of  clothing received was far more than  what  the

fire  victims  required. The total cash  donations

from  the public, so far as is known, have reached

about  $250,000 of which about $150,000 have  been

distributed  by the Singapore Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce, the Singapore Joint Relief Organisation,

Nanyang  Slang  Pau, the Buddhist Association  and

the  Rubber Packers' Association. With  the  $5  a

head  from the Social Welfare Department  included

each fire victim had now received a sum of $82. At

present,  296 families consisting of  about  1,050

fire victims are accommodated in the Relief Centre

at  the  Geylang English School. Cinema and  other

variety  shows are put on for their entertainment.

The  Franciscan nuns arranged games and handicraft

classes for the children during the day. The  fire

victims  are well looked after and no efforts  are

being  spared  to  make  them  as  comfortable  as

possible.  They all appear well and  happy.  Three

fire  victims  gave  birth at the  Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital to three babies, two girls and a boy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T. will give top priority to those who

wish  to  have  S.I.T. accommodation  at  the  old

Kallang  Airport site. It is expected  that  there

will be enough flats to house all the families. So

far, 196 families or a total of 1,100 persons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



have registered for such accommodation. Government

has made a declaration under section 5 of the Land

Acquisition Ordinance in Government Gazette No. 36

dated 16th April, 1958 declaring that the site  at

Kampong  Koo  Chye,  on which the  destroyed  huts

stood, is needed for public purposes and steps are

being  taken to acquire the land for the  building

of   low-cost  houses.  A  Committee  of  Trustees

consisting of the Chief Minister, the Mayor of the

City  Council, with the Director of Social Welfare

as  its  Honorary Secretary and the City Treasurer

as  the Honorary Treasurer, have been formed.  The

Trustees  will be responsible for the Kampong  Koo

Chye  Fire  Fund and for the building of  low-cost

houses on the old site. The P.W.D. Architect,  and

City Architect are jointly responsible for drawing

up the plans of the building. Those victims who do

not wish to have S.I.T. accommodation and who wish

to  stay in these low-cost houses will be given an

option: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to purchase the houses outright;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to purchase them by easy instalments; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to pay a low rent for the houses as tenant.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING SCHEME FOR POOR FAMILIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for

Local  Government,  Lands and Housing  whether  he

will consider implementing a new housing scheme to

house  those poor families who can only afford  to

pay a maximum monthly rental of $15.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> If the Member

for  Changi has any practicable suggestions for  a

scheme  to  house poor families who cannot  afford

more  than  $15  a  month, I  shall  be  only  too

delighted to give such suggestions my very careful

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of reducing rents to meet the housing

needs  of  the  lowest income group  is  one  that

constantly  engages the attention of  my  Ministry

and  of  the  Government as  a  whole.  It  would,

however,    be    extremely   difficult,    indeed

impossible, if we are not to increase greatly  the

subsidy for public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



housing, and if we are to build permanent  housing

in    accordance   with   present   standards   of

convenience,  amenity  and supervision,  to  bring

rents down to anything like $15 per month.

<div align="center"><b>REPAIRS TO KOH SEK LIM ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for

Local Government, Lands and Housing-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if he will give details of the expenditure

of  approximately $54,000 on repairs to  Koh

Sek Lim Road; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether he has received any complaints that

heavy  dust  rising from this repaired  road

is  endangering the health of the residents;

and  what  steps he has taken or intends  to

take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> I would

suggest to the Member for Changi that questions of

this  nature should more appropriately be directed

to  the Rural Board. The Rural Board is the  road-making authority as well as the Highways authority

for  the  rural  areas, and matters not  involving

policy  such  as  details of expenditure  on  road

repairs  and conditions arising from the state  of

roads clearly concern the Rural Board primarily.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for

Education,  in  regard  to the  salary  scales  of

teachers in Chinese schools:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether the Government is considering a

revision of the salary scales;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) since when has the question o a revision

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The Hon. Member for Changi

seems  to  be confused about the issue of salaries

of  teachers  in Chinese schools. The  problem  of

salaries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



of teachers in Chinese schools is not as clear-cut

as  it  is  suggested in the three  parts  to  his

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a revision of salaries for

teachers  in Chinese schools was mooted  when  the

full-aid scheme came into operation as far back as

December 1954. Since then the majority of teachers

in   Chinese  schools  have  had  their   salaries

revised, but there are still a number of them  who

have  claimed recognition in one form or  another,

such   as   those  with  experience  but   without

qualifications  and those with  academic  but  not

professional  qualifications  and  so  on.  It  is

difficult  to state exactly when the revision  can

be  completed but I want to assure the Hon. Member

that  I  am as anxious to get this matter  settled

early as anybody else.

<div align="center"><b>UNTRAINED TEACHERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if  he  will  consider  recognising  an

untrained   teacher  with  ten   years'   teaching

experience  as equivalent in status to  a  normal-trained teacher.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Obviously the Hon. Member for

Changi is not aware of the fact that this question

of  untrained teachers with ten years'  experience

has  been  settled  between  me  and  the  various

Chinese  educational bodies in one of our meetings

and  that  it is the details of implementing  that

decision that have to be worked out.

Chinese  schools who continued to teach  in  these

including their pre-war service in their record of

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Here again it seems that the

Hon. Member for Changi is unaware of the fact that

of teachers in Chinese schools will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



be   reckoned  for  incremental  purposes  in  the

revision  of  their  salaries.  A  great  deal  of

publicity  was given to this issue  in  the  Press

some  time  last year when the Chinese educational

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The Hon Member for Changi

seems to be interested only in post allowance  for

principals of Chinese schools. I want to emphasise

that  it  is  Government's  policy  to  treat  all

teachers alike as far as possible and although the

organisation  in  Chinese  schools   is   somewhat

different  from  that  in  English  schools,   the

principle  of  post allowances has been  accepted.

Indeed   the   Chinese  educational  bodies   have



submitted proposals for the allowances to be  paid

and  these  are being considered with  a  view  to

early  implementation.  Government  is  in  honour

bound to consider payment from the date the school

came into the full-aid scheme.

with  a sharp instrument - injury not serious -

motive unknown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On 8-3-58 a Laboratory Assistant who was in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In the General Hospital action has been taken

to  have  the barbed wire fence around the Nurses'

Hostel raised to 7 feet. Police whistles have been

given  to  the watchmen in the hostel. Police  are

patrolling  the  grounds  of  the  hospital   more

frequently.  Nurses  have  been  warned   not   to

frequent unlit areas at night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, the numbers of

Watchmen  have  been increased to  afford  greater

security to the hospital staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In the Tan Tock Seng Hospital increased

lighting  to roads and paths used by the staff  to

and  from  their quarters and the wards have  been

provided.  Increased  and additional  lighting  of

perimeter  of  quarters  occupied  by  nurses  and

residential  staff  living in  hospital  precincts

have  also  been  provided.  Windows  of  Nurses's

Quarters which have not the protection of a  chain
