   <b>(Use of contributions for purchase of private housing)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether he will allow Central Provident Fund contributors to make use of their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> balances for the purchase of private dwelling houses, and, if so, when the scheme will be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter has been raised several times in the House since 1971 and each time the request has been turned down. The Ministry of Labour and the Central Provident Fund Board have also received numerous appeals from members of the Fund to allow them to use their CPF savings to buy private residential properties. The Government has now decided to allow CPF members to use their savings in the Fund for the purchase of private residential properties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> The objective behind this decision is to help CPF members, who are either ineligible for public housing or who do not prefer to live in such publicly-built flats, to own private residential property. This will also enable them to invest their CPF savings in residential properties to hedge against inflation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this scheme, members who are not undischarged bankrupts will be allowed to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> use their CPF savings to buy one residential property regardless of whether members own commercial or other residential property. The scheme will be implemented in two phases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first phase, which will come into effect on 1st June 1981, a member will be allowed to use up to 90% of his CPF savings in the Ordinary Account to redeem the whole or part of the outstanding mortgage on one residential property. He will also be allowed to use up to 90% of the monthly CPF contributions paid for him to his Ordinary Account towards the monthly instalment repayment of the remaining mortgage loan. This scheme will, however, not apply to any mortgages which were executed after the property has been purchased outright by the member or where a previous mortgage on the property has been discharged by the member. This is to prevent members who have already paid for their properties from taking advantage of the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second phase, which will come into effect on 1st January 1982, the scheme will be extended to allow a member to use up to 90% of his savings in the Ordinary Account for the purchase of a private residential property. If a member's CPF savings are insufficient to pay for the purchase of the property, he will also be allowed to use up to 90% of the monthly CPF contributions paid for him to the Ordinary Account to meet the monthly instalment payments on the property.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property purchased with CPF savings may be used either for a member's own occupation or for rental. Members, however, will have to ensure that such properties purchased with CPF savings are not used for immoral, illegal or other unauthorised purposes. Failure to observe this condition renders the property liable to possession by the CPF Board. Such property possessed by the Board will be sold to ensure recovery of the amount withdrawn from the CPF plus interest. Further, a sum not exceeding 20% of the sale proceeds will be forfeited to the Board as a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who purchase properties under the various approved housing schemes will also be subjected to CPF rules governing the use of CPF savings in addition to those imposed by the respective housing authorities including those governing ownership and use of the properties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in the immediate family, namely, spouse, parents and children in any combination and children of the same parents who wish to purchase a property jointly will be allowed to use their CPF savings for the payment of that property. Any member who has used his CPF savings for the purchase of the property jointly with members of his immediate family will not be allowed to use his CPF savings to purchase another residential property.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properties qualifying for the use of CPF savings under the scheme must be on freehold land or where they are on leasehold land the lease must have at least another 75 years at the point of use of CPF funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properties purchased under the scheme may be sold at any time. However, to prevent speculation a member who has sold his property will be barred for three years from using his CPF savings again for the purchase of another property. The time bar of three years will, however, not apply to a member who has used his CPF savings to buy HDB or JTC flat. In such a case, he will be allowed to use his CPF savings to buy a private property upon the sale of his HDB/JTC flat. The time bar of three years will also not apply to a member who has used his CPF savings to buy a property jointly with other members in his immediate family. Such a member will be allowed to use his CPF savings to buy another property upon divesting his investment in the jointly-owned property.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the property purchased under the scheme is sold, the proceeds of the sale or the amount of CPF savings withdrawn plus interest, whichever is less, will have to be returned to the member's account if he is not yet qualified to withdraw his CPF savings.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether consideration will be given to allowing Central Provident Fund contributors to withdraw part of their contributions at least five years prior to their retirement from employment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the primary objective of the Central Provident Fund is to provide for old age. With increasing life expectancy and with more people working beyond 55 years of age, there is no compelling reason to allow members to withdraw part of their CPF savings before they reach 55 years of age. It is therefore regretted that the answer is no.

   <b>(Particulars)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many gang fights involving secret society elements have occurred since the beginning of this year; how many deaths have resulted and how this figure compares with the figures of the last three years; and what measures are being taken to control such incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must first make a distinction between gang fights involving secret society elements and other secret society incidents. A gang fight, as understood by the Police, is a clash between two rival groups of secret society members. A secret society incident is one in which one group of secret society members attack and assault persons who may or may not be secret society elements. The persons attacked would invariably be outnumbered and they would try to flee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period 1st January to 19th November this year, there were one gang fight and 11 secret society incidents. These 11 secret society incidents resulted in six deaths. The comparative figures for the last three years are as follows:-
  <br>
  <br>

1979    6        -         5           3
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures show that there is a decrease in the number of gang fights this year but the number of one-sided attacks by secret society elements has increased when compared to the last three years. This explains the higher number of deaths that have resulted from secret society violence. There is, however, no increase in the frequency of secret society violence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will continue to maintain surveillance on secret society suspects and those who are on record as having been secret society members or associates. They will gather intelligence in areas where secret society activities are reported to be taking place. Whenever it is necessary, an operation or other action will be taken to arrest and prosecute the culprits. Where prosecution is not possible because witnesses are not prepared to give evidence in court, the secret society elements are detained or placed under Police supervision in accordance with the provisions in the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a view to finding a long-term solution to the secret society menace, I have appointed a team comprising psychologists and sociologists to conduct an in-depth study of the problem. It is headed by the Senior Psychologist of Woodbridge Hospital. The aim of the study is to determine why secret societies should still exist in Singapore despite the tremendous economic, social and educational development that has been achieved over the last 20 years or so. The team is expected to present its report in March next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Hon. Minister enlighten this House the age group of those persons involved in these secret society incidents or fights?

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the majority of the secret society elements are between the age of 18 and 25 years.

   <b>(Measures to prevent speculation)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National Development, since he is aware of deliberate delay by developers who have obtained planning permission without the desire to develop their properties, what measures he proposes to take to prevent speculation; what other measures he will introduce to ensure the commencement of building operations as soon as plans are approved; and what leeway he will accord to bona fide developers who are unable to commence building operations for cogent reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, developers who deliberately delay construction after obtaining planning permission are invariably those who indulge in speculation. It is not unusual for such properties to change hands many times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has for some time now tightened up approval for renewal of planning permission which has lapsed. Any planning permission which has lapsed with no evidence of construction work in progress will not be renewed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also looking into the possibility of acquiring lands for which development has been approved but not implemented, for sale through the Urban Redevelopment Authority. However, consideration will be given to developers who are genuinely unable to proceed with their plans for development because of factors beyond their control.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>2.46 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my colleague, the Minister for Health, to move the Second Reading of the Bill on his behalf since he has to be away today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Abortion Act, 1974, abortions can only be carried out in institutions approved by the Ministry. On the other hand, medical practitioners do not require approval to perform abortions. From time to time, Government hospitals have been receiving
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> moribund patients due to complications arising from abortions performed by private medical practitioners. There have also been cases where approval given to a clinic has been cancelled but there is nothing in the law to prevent the medical practitioner from performing abortions in another approved clinic.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present only clinics where abortions are carried out are licensed. It is the intention of this Bill that there should also be proper authorisation of medical practitioners who wish to carry out abortions in the interests of patients.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 will enable an abortion to be performed on the holder, or the wife of a holder, of an employment pass or work permit pass even though she has not been resident in Singapore for four months. Such persons should not be compelled to resort to illegal abortions or wait till they complete four months' residence, thus increasing the risk of complications because of advanced pregnancy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses of the Bill make consequential and necessary amendments to the Abortion Act, 1974, and to relevant sections of the Penal Code.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was looking at some of the figures on abortion presented by the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board and was quite shocked by the magnitude of the figures. Between 1970 and 1979 the cumulative total of legalized abortions was 88,499. In 1970, the year that the Abortion Act was first brought into force, there were only 1,913 legalized abortions or 4.2% of live-births. In 1974, the year the second Abortion Bill was passed, there were 7,175 abortions or 16.6% of live-births. By 1979, Sir, there were 14,855 abortions or 36% of live-births. If cases of menstrual regulation are also included, the total number of abortions in 1979 was 16,999 or 41.7% of live-births. This means that in 1979 one unborn baby was aborted for every 2.4 born. This is a horrendous trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969 when the Abortion Bill was first introduced, it was envisioned that legalized abortions would amount to no more than 10% of live-births, In 1974, the then Minister for Health and Home Affairs stated in Parliament that (Hansard, Vol. 33, col. 1102):
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Contrary to the fears expressed in the original debate, our pregnant women have not been turning to abortions in great numbers.'
  <b></b>It appears, Sir, that his judgment was premature and that the 1974 Bill opened the floodgates to promiscuity and murder.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board reported in its Annual Report of 1979 that the mean gestation period of the unborn babies aborted was 10.9 weeks. It may interest hon. Members to note some medical facts:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) By the 21st day of pregnancy, the baby's heart demonstrates its first feeble beats, that is, before most women even know that they are pregnant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) By the sixth week, the adrenal gland and the thyroid are functioning.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) By the 12th week a child's fingerprints are indelibly in place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, abortion kills a developing human being. In the first trimester, abortion is done by vacuum aspiration and curettage, that is, literally tearing and scraping the fetus from the wall of the womb. In the second trimester, abortion is effected by prostaglandin injection to make the womb expel the fetus, followed by curettage, or scraping. Studies done in Canada indicate that abortions can lead to sterility. In fact, the younger the mother, the more likely it is that she will suffer sterility later, if she has an abortion. The percentage is as high as 30% for women between 15 and 17 years of age. Moreover, Sir, I am told, and this has been confirmed by the Minister earlier, that abortion in the second trimester is twice as dangerous as during the first trimester.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the hazards of abortion, Sir, we should realize that it is an act involving the taking of life, in other words, murder of the unborn child. Sir, God has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> clearly stated in His Word, His role in the creation of every baby. Permit me just to quote three passages from the Bible:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Jeremiah 1:5: Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Psalm 139:13: For thou didst form my inward parts; thou didst knit me together in my mother's womb.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Ecclesiastes 11:5: As you do not know how the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every baby is created in the image of God and is precious to Him. He has a purpose for each one of us. Sir, when we violate the commandments of God, we are the ones to suffer, for we wittingly or unwittingly place ourselves in the hands of Satan. I have met some women who have been traumatised by their abortions and their personalities are warped as a result.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no quarrel with the Government over the principle of birth control, though I do have some reservations over the extent of population control. Now we have other means, such as contraceptive devices and, even if need be, sterilization. This amendment seeks to extend coverage of the Abortion Act to employment pass and work permit holders. At the rate we are going, Singapore will soon become the abortion centre of South-East Asia. Sir, I appeal to the conscience of the Hon. Minister for Health and hon. Members to stop the murder of unborn babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply, may I say that as far as the Ministry of Health is concerned, and particularly the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board, they do not encourage abortion. This has been stated over and over again. Because there are other and better methods of birth control, they have therefore been doing their very best to propagate these various methods of birth control. But if, in spite of that, a woman still conceives, and if it is an unwanted baby, then she should be free to choose whether to have the baby or to abort it. That is the rationale of the Abortion Act. It is something that is voluntary, some-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> thing given to a woman who does not want the baby, to have an abortion as a last resort, of course, under certain conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I would like to answer the Member for Whampoa about abortion being murder. That has been debated long ago when I first introduced the Abortion Bill. In my training as a lawyer, I have never been taught that, in law, abortion is murder. The Member for Whampoa may use other definitions from other authorities which I do not consider as authorities. As I have said, this is a matter of free choice. It is a matter of your own personal belief, and on what principles you define murder and on what principles you define right and wrong. I have all the time been saying that on religious beliefs or moral principles, you should be free to choose what moral principles or what religious principles you want to believe in, and that you should not impose your moral principles and beliefs on another person unless, of course, it is against the law of the land.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was looking for certain figures which I could not find in the Ministry of Health's Annual Report, neither could I find them in the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board Annual Report. Perhaps the Hon. Minister could give his reply here. First, how many unmarried women had abortions in 1979? Secondly, how many of the abortions carried out were repeated abortions? And, thirdly, why were these figures not published?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, if I am in the Ministry of Health, I would be quite willing to give him the figures. Unfortunately, I am standing in for the Minister for Health who has just been called away. If the Member for Whampoa seriously wants the figures, I am quite sure the Ministry of Health will be prepared to give him the figures of the number of unmarried mothers, and so on and so forth.

  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks principally to amend section 46 of the Employment Act to give effect to the National Wages Council's recommendation that employers be allowed at their discretion to pay an annual wage supplement above the frozen quantum up to a maximum of three months' wages without seeking the prior approval of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members may recall that in 1972 the National Wages Council, in the interest of orderly wage increases and reduction of disputes on bonuses, recommended a policy to freeze the amount of annual wage supplements (AWS) that may be payable by employers. As a result, section 46 of the Employment Act was repealed and re-enacted to enable a trade union of employees to negotiate for the payment of either both an annual wage supplement and a bonus or both an annual wage supplement and annual wage increases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers were given a right to make an option between negotiating for the payment of both an annual wage supplement and a bonus or both an annual wage supplement and annual wage increases. An employer who could not afford to pay any of these combinations was allowed to negotiate for the payment of an annual wage supplement or bonus or annual wage increases. The amounts of AWS payable by employers were frozen. Where an employer has paid bonuses of a month's wages or more before 1st July 1972, the annual wage supplement should be the average of the bonuses of the last three years or the last annual bonus whichever was higher but subject to a maximum of three months' wages. However, where employers had not paid bonuses or paid
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> bonuses of less than one month's wages before 1st July 1972, the annual wage supplement should not exceed one month's wages. In December 1975, section 46 was amended to allow an employer who wants to pay above the frozen quantum of AWS to do so after he has sought the prior written permission of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present AWS policy has been in operation for a number of years. Circumstances have changed. More employers are now paying wage increases through the implementation of National Wages Council's recommendations, and disputes over payment of annual wage supplement hardly arise. We have also found that most of the applications for additional AWS have been made by the same employers year after year. From 1975 to 1979, there were 512 applications for approval from the Minister for Finance to pay annual wage supplement above the frozen quantum. Of these 512 applications, 464 applications or 91% were approved. In addition, we have also discovered that there is a need to relax it in relation to certain new companies. For example, it is the practice of the petroleum, banking and finance industries to pay annual wage supplements of 2 3/4 to 3 months' wages. New companies in these industries that were set up on or after 1st July 1972 were, however, restricted to paying annual wage supplement of up to one month's wages. A few of these companies have expressed their unhappiness over their inability to pay the same amount of AWS as their rivals in the same industry. They have pointed out that this would create difficulties in their attracting and retaining staff. There is, therefore, a case for allowing such new companies to pay at their discretion similar annual wage supplement as other companies in the same industry. In view of all these considerations, the Government has accepted the NWC recommendation that employers be allowed at their discretion to pay AWS above the frozen quantum up to a maximum of three months' wages without seeking the prior written permission of the Minister for Finance. This NWC proposal is now embodied in the Bill before the House.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to introduce a number of amendments to the Workmen's Compensation Act. A summary of the amendments is provided in the explanatory statement, I now propose to elaborate on some of the more important clauses in the Amendment Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Labour over the past years has been concentrating on the prevention of work accidents and diseases to provide a safer and healthier work environment for our workers. Safety and health standards have been improved. The Building Operations and Works of Engineering Construction Regulations, 1977, introduced new safety standards on the erection and use of scaffolds. The Factories (Amendment) Act, 1978, provided additional safety requirements for work in confined spaces. Two new health programmes were also introduced. One was the Hearing Conservation Programme launched in May 1976 to preserve the hearing of workers in noisy factories. The other was the Cancer Prevention Programme introduced in November 1978 covering the use of asbestos and benzene. Enforcement of safety and health standards has been stepped up. Penalties for violation of safety and health standards were enhanced in 1978 and 1979 to drive home the message to management and workers of the need to observe safety standards and procedures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also undertook education and advisory services to promote work safety. Campaigns to underline the importance of safety and health were organised for the shipbuilding, construction, wood-working and metal working industries. Training of workers and supervisors in safety and health was undertaken for the shipbuilding and construction industries. Safety and health personnel in industry were also trained.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result of this work, there has been an improvement in the industrial safety and health situation. Over the last five years, it is heartening to note that the frequency and severity rates of industrial accidents have significantly fallen from 6.8 accidents per one million man-hours worked in 1975 to five accidents in 1979 and 845 man-day loss per one million man-hours worked in 1975 to 405 man-day loss in 1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we still need to further improve. There were at the end of 1979 5,277 accidents with 57 fatalities. We must seek to reduce further the number of accidents and fatalities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the main amendments is the increase in the quantum of workmen's compensation. This increase is not only to meet the rise in the cost of living and wages but also to underline to employers the need to give greater attention to the prevention of accidents and diseases at the workplaces.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill seeks to raise the maximum compensation for death from $35,000 to $45,000 and that for injury resulting in permanent total incapacity from $45,000 to $60,000. It also provides for an increase in minimum compensation for death from $10,800 to $15,000 and for a minimum compensation for injury resulting in permanent total incapacity to be fixed at $20,000. The proposed increase in the compensation rates takes into consideration the substantial increase in the cost of living and wages over the last five years. Since the last revision of workmen's compensation in October 1975, the Consumer Price Index has risen by about 19%. The median monthly income of employees, according to CPF records, has also risen by about 25% from $332 in 1975 to $416 in June 1980.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from raising the maximum and minimum levels of compensation, clause 8 also provides for a revision in the age multiplying factors used in calculating compensation. Compared to those presently in use which fall abruptly at certain ages, the new multiplying factors fall more gradually with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> age for workmen between 40 and 65. The proposed multiplying factors for workmen between the ages of 40 and 59 are also higher than the present factors but lower for those whose ages are above 60. The reduction of the factors for elderly workmen represents a more realistic provision as their loss of future earnings would be very much less.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the present provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, employees employed in non-manual work are covered by the Act only if their monthly earnings do not exceed $750. However, employees employed in manual work are covered by the Act irrespective of the amount of their monthly earnings. The $750 wage ceiling was set in 1971 in line with the wage ceiling in Part IV of the 1968 Employment Act. The wage ceiling of non-manual employees for the purpose of coverage under the welfare provisions of Part IV and sections 33 and 144 of the Employment Act will be revised to $1,250 per month with effect from 1st December 1980, in consideration of the substantial increase in the wage level of our workers since 1968. Clause 2 of the Bill therefore proposes to raise the wage ceiling for employees employed in non-manual work under the Workmen's Compensation Act to $1,250 per month in line with that prescribed for the Employment Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in order to ensure that the scope of the Act will in future be commensurate with increases in the level of wages, it is proposed in the Bill that the Minister be empowered to adjust and raise the wage ceiling for employees employed in non-manual work by notification in the Gazette. Such a power has already been provided under the Employment Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Workmen's Compensation Act, an employer is required to pay compensation within 21 days from the date of service of the notice of assessment of compensation or the date of the Commissioner's decision at the conclusion of a hearing. If he fails to pay within this stipulated period, he is liable to pay to the Workers' Fund interest at the rate of 1 1/2% for each month or part thereof of the compensation payable. Despite this, some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> employers and insurance companies still pay compensation late. In 1979, there were 675 late payments. To make employers and insurance companies pay compensation on time, clauses 6 and 7 seek to raise the rate of interest to be charged for late payment in the following manner. For the first six months from the date of service of the notice of assessment or the date of the Commissioner's decision, the rate of interest shall be 11/2% per month or part thereof; and thereafter the rate shall be 3% per month or part thereof of the compensation payable. The amount of interest charged shall not in any case exceed 50% of the amount of compensation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill also provides that the interest paid by the employer or insurance company be payable to the workman or his dependants in the case of a deceased workman. Interest on late payment will be paid to the Workers' Fund only if the deceased workman has no surviving dependants,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present, an injured workman who refuses to submit himself for medical examination will have his right to compensation suspended until such examination takes place. Since a time limit is not provided, a case could be suspended indefinitely if the workman refuses to submit himself for examination. To prevent such an abuse and to provide for more efficient administration, clause 4 provides that where an injured workman without reasonable excuse fails to submit himself for medical examination within six months from the date of being required to do so by the Commissioner for Labour, he shall forfeit his right to compensation unless such injury results subsequently in his death.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, section 33 (2) of the Workmen's Compensation Act allows a workman to claim compensation, having failed in his claim at common law, provided he filed his common law claim within the time specified in section 11, that is, six months from the happening of the accident. A number of claimants have indicated that this period gives them very little time to decide whether
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to claim at common law or under the Act. Clause 3 of the Bill, therefore, seeks to extend this period from six months to one year.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The amount of interest to which the employer is liable shall not exceed fifty per centum of the assessed amount;
  <br>
  <br>Why should there be a limit and upper limit to the amount that is liable from the employer? Because at the rate of interest that is being charged, I think within 1 1/2 years this figure would be reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> We thought that the 50% limit is reasonable. Anyway never in the history of actions taken by the Ministry under this particular section has any insurance company or employer paid compensation so very late.

  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to make a number of amendments to the State Lands Act (Chapter 285) which are considered necessary for more effective land administration in present-day circumstances. I shall deal only with the major amendments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 enacts a new section 4A to empower the Registrar of Titles to amend a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> certificate of title issued in the name of a deceased person by inserting the names of his personal representatives in the certificate of title, when a grant or lease under the Act, or a certificate under section 8, 8A or 8B of the Land Titles Act, has been issued to such person who, unknown to the Collector of Land Revenue, was not alive at the date of such issue. This will remove the necessity of issuing a new certificate of title in the names of the personal representatives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an appeal arising out of the Government's acquisition of Pulau Tekong Kechil, the Privy Council held that an assignee of a State grant who did not have constructive notice of the provisions of an original Crown grant of 1860 is not bound by a covenant contained in the grant. That decision, if allowed to stand, will prevent the Government from enforcing covenants contained in State grants or leases except in those cases where the owner has actual or constructive notice. Clause 4 therefore seeks to enact a new section 6A to make it explicit that an assignee of a State grant or lease shall be bound by such exceptions, reservations or covenants contained in the grant or lease regardless of whether he has notice (actual or constructive) of such exceptions, reservations or covenants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to repeal and re-enact section 11 of the Act. The new section 11 will empower the President to accept the surrender of any title to any land for any purposes whatsoever and to re-issue new titles in lieu thereof subject to any terms and conditions which the President may impose for accepting the surrender of the titles. Under the existing section 11, the President has no authority to impose a condition that he will issue a title for a shorter term for the title surrendered to him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses provide for minor amendments, and deletion of sections which have become obsolete.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions in section 9 (1) of the Accountants Act (Cap. 212), the Minister is empowered to appoint a representative each from the University of Singapore and Nanyang University to be members of the Council of the Singapore Society of Accountants. Following the establishment of the National University of Singapore, it is necessary to amend section 9(1) of the Act for the National University of Singapore to be represented on the Council, instead of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to delete section 50 of the Act which gives the Society the status of an institution of a public character. Since the membership of the Society is confined to a particular group of people and their activities cannot be regarded as charitable and beneficial to the community as a whole, the Society does not satisfy the criteria laid down for the grant of such a status. In 1973, when the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 4) Act was passed to delete all references to fiscal exemption in various statutes, the necessary amendment to the Accountants Act was overlooked at that time. Tax exemptions are now given only under the provisions of the principal Acts, like the Income Tax Act or the Stamp Duties Act.

  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980 Budget Statement, a number of tax concessions were announced. This Income Tax (Amendment No. 2) Bill is necessary to give legislative authority to the concessions. The opportunity is also taken to incorporate other amendments to improve and streamline existing legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the tax concessions made in the Budget Statement was that double tax deduction will be given for expenditure incurred on or after 1st April 1980 by a manufacturer undertaking an approved research and development project. The manufacturer can also claim double tax deduction on his expenses if he assigns the project to a research and development organisation in Singapore. To qualify for the double tax deduction, the project must also be related to the business of the manufacturer. Clause 5 of the Bill makes provision for the concession by incorporating a new section 14(E) to the Income Tax Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concession allows a building used by a research and development organisation to carry out research and development activities to be considered as an "industrial building or structure", thereby qualifying for an initial allowance of 25% and an annual allowance of 3% of the capital expenditure incurred on the construction of the building. Section 18 of the Income Tax Act is amended by clause 7 to provide for the concession which will take effect from Year of Assessment 1981.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 19 (2) of the Income Tax Act to provide for the change in the basis of granting annual allowances for plant and machinery from the reducing balance method to the straight line method. A new schedule has also been drawn up to allow for more realistic rates of write-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Assets which promote automation and mechanisation are given faster rates. The concession will take effect from Year of Assessment 1981. An option is also given to a person who has been granted a certificate under the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act before 1st January 1981, or after that date where approval for the certificate has been given before 1st January 1981, to retain the reducing balance method as the basis of calculating the annual allowances during the period of tax relief.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill extends the accelerated depreciation allowance of 331/2% over three years to include expenditure on computers and research and development equipment incurred on or after 1st January 1980.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers are encouraged to improve existing, or to develop, new products and processes. In so doing, they may need to acquire know-how or patent rights from overseas. As the law stands, the manufacturer cannot claim tax deduction on his expenses incurred on acquiring the know-how or patent rights. With effect from 1st April 1980 such expenditure on approved know-how or patent rights may be capitalised and written-off over five years. A balancing adjustment will be made if the manufacturer sells off the approved know-how or patent rights. Clause 10 provides for this concession by legislating a new section 19(B) to the Income Tax Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill amends section 39 of the Income Tax Act to provide with effect from Year of Assessment 1980, a relief of $750 a year to a taxpayer who maintains a handicapped brother or sister in the same household. To be equitable, the concession will also be extended to a taxpayer who maintains a handicapped child, notwithstanding the child's eligibility for children's relief under the Income Tax Act, but with effect from Year of Assessment 1981.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, income derived from offshore reinsurance and inward direct insurance covering offshore risks is taxed at a concessionary rate of 10%. Clause 14 legislates a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> new section 43(D) of the Income Tax Act to provide for the extension of the 10% concessionary rate to include income derived by an approved member of the Gold Exchange of Singapore from offshore gold transactions as well as transactions with other members of the Gold Exchange of Singapore and Asian Currency Units. The concession is effective from Year of Assessment 1981.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 of the Bill provides for the reduction in the rates of tax of an individual or a Hindu Joint Family with effect from Year of Assessment 1980.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to other amendments which are intended to streamline and improve existing legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 defines the terms "research and development" and "research and development organisation" for purposes of the Income Tax Act. The term "research and development" is defined as any systematic or intensive study carried out in the field of science or technology with the object of using the results of such study for the production or improvement of materials, devices, products or processes. A "research and development organisation" is defined as a body or an organisation which provides research and development services for any manufacturing trade or business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill makes consequential amendments to section 14(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act as a result of the increase in CPF contributions from 16 1/2% to 20 1/2% payable by employers with effect from 1st July 1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the new definition of research and development, clause 4 of the Bill amends section 14(D) of the Income Tax Act by replacing the term "scientific research" with "research and development". Section 14(D) allows payments made to an approved research and development organisation to be deducted as revenue expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations to any institution of a public character under section 37(2) of the Income Tax Act are tax deductible. Clause 12 of the Bill seeks to extend the definition of an insti-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tution of a public character to include charities, and cultural organisations which are not operated primarily for profit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill amends section 68 of the Income Tax Act to remove the obligation of an employer to inform the Comptroller of Income Tax of the cessation of employment of his employees who are Singapore citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a few questions for the Hon. Minister. First of all, in regard to the definition of "research and development" in clause 2, I am wondering whether the definition provided in the Bill is not too restrictive in view of the diversified nature of Singapore's economy. In other words, it seems to me to be exclusively geared towards the manufacturing sector which only supplies about 21% of the GDP. For example, under the exclusion of that clause, quality control is left out altogether. It would seem to me that for a fledgling manufacturing economy like Singapore quality is of the essence if we want to develop long-term markets abroad. So maybe some thought ought to be given to see whether adequate incentives exist to encourage manufacturers to look after the quality of their products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, research in the social sciences, the so-called routine data collection, efficiency surveys of management studies, market research or sales promotion, some of these may be very significant and very important from the productivity standpoint, from the standpoint of enlarging the markets and even of manufacturing firms and also of the other service firms in the Republic of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "research and development organisation" is again exclusively limited to manufacturing trade or business. I can see a few problems here, Sir. First, you may have an R &amp; D organisation that may not provide services solely to manufacturing but may also have services in the service sector of the economy. Secondly, the exclusion
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> again of the service sector from enjoying any tax incentive in respect of R &amp; D seems to me to be a very serious omission.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to refer the Minister's attention to paragraph (b) of clause 9. There are four conditions which are stated in the Bill. In reading the Bill it was not clear to me whether all or some of these conditions must be satisfied before the organisation in question can qualify for the incentives on R &amp; D. Secondly, why is it that sub-paragraph (c) specifies the installation of a computer? I grant that a computer is a very useful kind of equipment to have because it enhances productivity but so do a lot of other machines which can be installed in any particular business enterprise. So why focus exclusively on a computer? Furthermore, Sir, in the matter of computers, I am given to understand that the hardware is becoming increasingly cheaper with new innovations and new products coming on to the market. At the same time, the software is becoming extremely expensive. I would have thought that it would be more logical to include some kind of incentives for the development of software in using computers. Fourthly, the incentives seem to be geared towards physical capital and again in the context of Singapore it would seem more logical for us to emphasize development of human capital. Maybe the Finance Minister would want to look into what incentives we need to encourage investment in human capital, i.e. encourage firms to send people abroad for training programmes which would advance their skills and so on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question in regard to this clause has to do with sub-paragraphs (1) and (ii) of paragraph (b) in page 8 of the Bill. Sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) say:
  <pre>
    '(i) on or after 1st January, 1965, on the provision of
         machinery or plant for the purposes of that indus-
         trial enterprise;

    (ii) on or after 1st January, 1973, on the provision of
         that equipment or device for the purpose of
         preventing, controlling or reducing air pollution or
         water pollution;'.
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> My question to the Minister for Finance is this. Why is he so generous in giving the incentive on a retrospective basis? I have never known him to be so generous in respect of other kinds of tax incentives. I would have thought that if a manufacturing enterprise had started as early as 1965, by now it would have written off most of its equipment many times over.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I refer him to clause 13 which provides a welcome relief of $750 a year to a taxpayer for maintaining any handicapped child or handicapped brother or sister living in the same household. Would the Minister consider extending the concession to the tax-payer if the child, or the brother or sister in question had to be confined to an institution but yet had to be supported by the taxpayer? It would seem to me quite logical for him to extend this concession because this will certainly encourage more people to look after their handicapped relatives rather than relying on the Social Welfare Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are a number of questions to be answered. On the definition of "research and development", the Member for Whampoa is quite correct that the intention is to give these incentives to the manufacturing industry, at least in the first instance. Whether we shall extend these incentives later on to the other sectors of the economy is a matter which can be considered in due course. His eloquence in pleading the cause of other research organisations will be taken into consideration. For the time being, since these definitions are really for the purposes of calculating double deduction, perhaps they can stand for the time being. If the economy of Singapore shifts to an emphasis on the service economy, then we can consider whether there should be more promotion of such service activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On research and development organization, he has said that perhaps the body may also provide services which are related to non-manufacturing industries. Again, as I have tried to explain, the incentives are for double deduction on manufacturing industries, and if services are provided for other
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> than non-manufacturing purposes, expenses can be deducted but not at the double expense rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now turn to clause 9. He does not understand whether or not all the conditions in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) are to be taken together and must be satisfied. The operative word is in paragraph (c) where, at the end of that paragraph, there is the word "or". So it is quite clear that not all these conditions are to be satisfied.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked why do we concentrate on computers. This is probably more in the way of emphasis for publicity purposes, emphasis on those aspects which computers stand for, that is, the modernization of processes. I agree that perhaps the computer of today is not quite as expensive an equipment as it used to be and that perhaps the emphasis is not justified or will not be justified over the next few years. As to the inclusion of software, that is probably more difficult because a lot of software is developed by the manufacturing industry inhouse so that there is no way in which we can calculate the expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also commented on sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) on page 8 of the Bill. Various dates have been cited. I do not suppose the date "1st January, 1965" has any real significance because if machinery has been put in since that date, a lot of it would have been depreciated. It is quite clear that we must set a date and I suppose "1965", being the year of our independence, might be a suitable date.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is on handicapped children. I believe that in giving this concession, instead of charity being the concern of the State and of the institutions, the intention was to promote the care of handicapped persons within the home. That is the reason why the concession of $750 has not been given to the home or institution. I do not say, of course, that they do not deserve support. Maybe that can be considered in some other concessions at some other time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Hon. Minister for clarifying the questions I have raised, although I am not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> entirely satisfied with some of the answers. May I just point to one of the replies which he gave in respect of clause 9, especially the four conditions which are required of an organization to qualify for the special incentives for research and development. If we look at paragraph (b) of clause 9, it says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'he has installed [that means the manufacturer must have installed] any equipment or device for the purpose of preventing, controlling or reducing air pollution or water pollution;'.
  <br>
  <br>What is the position if a manufacturing industry is a non-pollutive industry and therefore has no anti-pollution equipment? How would it fit into the scheme of things?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, in such circumstances I would congratulate the manufacturer for having set up an industry which is very desirable for Singapore. But in almost all cases there is some pollution. No doubt if a reward is intended for a non-pollutive industry, perhaps we can give some other concession at some other time.

  <b>The Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is to require motorists to have insurance cover for liability to their passengers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act, it is mandatory for all motorists to take out an insurance policy against liability for death or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> injury caused to third parties. Motorists are, however, not required to insure against passenger liability unless the passengers are employees or ride on public transport.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1974, passengers carried under car pool arrangements for the purpose of entering the CBD have been covered voluntarily by insurers as a gesture of their support for the scheme. But all other passengers, including family members and casual passengers of car owners and pillion riders are excluded. Car owners may pay an additional premium of $25 to cover their passengers. But since it is not compulsory to do so, not all car passengers are covered by insurance. On the other hand, motor-cyclists are not able to obtain passenger insurance even if they wanted to because insurers find there is insufficient spread of risk if passenger insurance is sold to the few motor-cyclists who volunteer to have it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of passenger casualties who have been unable to claim compensation due to lack of insurance is not available. However, the absence of passenger insurance cover means that not only the negligent driver and his victim but also their families will suffer financial hardship in an unfortunate accident.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an increase in our total motor vehicle population which grew by 21% between 1975 and 1979, there has also been an increase in the number of road casualties. Records from the Traffic Police Accident Unit show that the total number of casualties per 100,000 population has increased from 457.3 in 1974 to 569.6 in 1979. Total casualties per 10,000 vehicles increased from 366.5 to 397.3 for the same period. We will have to step up our road safety programmes but we must also ensure that accident victims are adequately covered by insurance so that they will be adequately compensated and do not become a burden to society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose to amend the existing Act to make it mandatory for all users of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> motor vehicles to take out insurance policies to cover liability to passengers. A provision has also been included in the Bill to ensure that the person using a motor vehicle does not avoid liability by making an arrangement with his passenger to negate or restrict his liability.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional premium will have to be paid by all motorists in order to have the benefit of passenger insurance. Premium rates are expected to be increased by 25% of the present rate charged for third party insurance or about $15 extra a year on average.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to introduce a number of amendments to the Sale of Commercial Properties Act, 1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sale of Commercial Properties Act came into operation on 20th July, 1979, in response to complaints about the inequitable manner in which some developers conducted the sale of their commercial units. Rules made under the Act prescribe the terms and conditions for the option and the sale of commercial units and generally the rights and obligations of vendor and purchaser.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Act does not apply to commercial properties sold before the coming into operation of the Act. There have been
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> numerous complaints by purchasers of these commercial properties of delays by developers in obtaining strata titles. At present, there are 34 commercial buildings whose developers have not obtained strata titles. Since the Act does not cover these old cases, the Ministry can only apply administrative pressure on the developers concerned. This is not satisfactory.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act is being amended to empower the Controller to direct developers inter alia to obtain strata titles by a stipulated date. This will apply to commercial properties sold before 20th July, 1979, that is, prior to the coming into operation of the Sale of Commercial Properties Act, 1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of commercial properties with certificate of fitness but without strata titles is not covered by the Act because under section 10 (b) such buildings which have been physically completed are exempted. Since strata titles are of primary importance to purchasers, the sale of properties without strata titles should be brought within the provisions of the Act. Section 10 (b) has therefore been amended to exempt only buildings which have both certificate of fitness and strata titles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controller of Housing will review all commercial buildings sold before 20th July, 1979, which are without strata titles and direct developers to obtain titles by stipulated dates or to take such other steps as may be necessary. In normal circumstances, the developer having obtained separate strata titles must, under the agreement, proceed to complete the sale. If this is not the case, the Controller of Housing may direct the developers to complete the sale.

   <h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>4.10 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980 Budget Statement, I announced a package of four tax incentives for promoting Research and Development (R &amp; D) activities in Singapore. Three of these incentives involve amendments to the Income Tax Act. These amendments have been incorporated in the Income Tax (Amendment No. 2) Bill, 1980, which the House has just considered and passed. The fourth incentive, namely, the granting of investment allowance of up to 50% of the capital investment in research and development made by a company, requires an amendment to Part VIA of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act. The purpose of this short Bill is to give effect to that incentive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing section 46B of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act provides that investment allowance may be granted to a company which carries out a project for the manufacture or increased manufacture of any product or for the provision of specialised engineering or technical services. The present Bill will extend the scope of section 46B to allow investment allowance to be granted to companies carrying out projects for research and development. A company may qualify for investment allowance in respect of an R &amp; D project if the project is approved by the Minister. Approval for investment allowance will be given on a case by case basis. The amendments to section 46A of the Act are of a consequential nature.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just ask a few questions of the Minister? First
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of all, in respect of the definition of "research and development", my comments which I made earlier on the Income Tax (Amendment No. 2) Bill apply here, namely, that they are exclusively limited to the manufacturing sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, under clause 3, the proposed amendment as stated would seem to imply that two out of the three conditions laid down there must apply. Sir, I am not a legal man and so I do not know the legal implication of a semi-colon, whether the semi-colon denotes and or or. As I read it, Sir, from the (a), (b) and (c) conditions which are laid down, it would seem to me that either the company has satisfied conditions (a) and (b) or (a) and (c) because if the intention were otherwise, there should have been an "or" after the semi-colon appearing at the end of the condition (a). Then it would be quite clear that one of the three conditions applies. The way it is set out, it would seem to me that the company has to manufacture and has to provide specialised engineering or technical services or else has to manufacture and carry out research and development. I am sure that is not the intention of the Minister or the drafters of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I would like to seek clarification from him as to his definition technical services" because nowhere in this Bill is that provided for. I am not sure whether a similar definition appears in the Income Tax Act. If not, maybe he would want to insert a proper definition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, he seems to have left out economic and management services altogether. It would seem to me that these services are very important in the development of Singapore, especially the manufacturing sector which he is trying to encourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has already given a reply on the definition of Research and Development to the question raised by the Member for Whampoa. I will therefore not give a reply because I share the sentiments of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister for Finance on this particular issue. That reply would therefore cover the observation of the Member for Whampoa on the economic and management services. The thrust of the incentives, as given in the Budget statement, was for the purpose of improving the manufacturing sector, in particular, research and development. As the Minister for Finance has pointed out, there are other incentives for improving human capital for economic and management services. If these are not adequate, improvements could be considered at a later stage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the observation of the Member for Whampoa on clause 3, the intention, as far as my Ministry is concerned, is for a single criterion to apply. In other words, it is not necessary to have a combination of two of these conditions before the incentives would apply. This Bill has been drafted by the Attorney-General's Chambers and, therefore, I take it that the correct interpretation of or is that only one of the three conditions needs to be satisfied. I myself am not a legal man, and therefore I do not wish to quarrel with the legal opinion of the Attorney-General. I do not have the audacity to quarrel with the Minister for Law either, who is here anyway, on this particular point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On technical services, I do not have the Income Tax Act with me. I therefore cannot give an answer as to whether "technical services" has been defined in the Income Tax Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his clarification. But has he not considered the possibility of a typographical error?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, it is not a question of a typographical error. It is a question of whether there is a mental error in the interpretation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

  </div>
  <br>4.20 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the octopus that squeezes competition out of this society must itself be squeezed out of society lest it gets destructive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it is high time, Milton Friedman or no Milton Friedman, that the invisible hand of the Singapore Government must come down harder on those associations and traders who are taking advantage of the world inflationary trend by insisting on increasing their prices under cover of these now well-known words today: "Well, everything has gone up, we must also up our prices too." The recent increase in prices of tea and coffee can be quoted as examples to my speech today. As you know, Sir, coffee and tea are to some people like pants are to them, and the moment we are unaware of this we will be caught with our pants down before we know anything.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arm-twisting tactics of some of these trade associations are a blatant act against the interest of consumers. Hence, we must rapidly act to destroy this octopus, which I have referred to, so that it will not strangle free competition. The question is: What are we going to do about it? If nothing is done, other establishments may be tempted to follow suit, with similar price increases. No doubt the five to ten cents increase seems rather small but this adds on and eventually it will affect the real income of workers, particularly those who are in the lower income
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> bracket. If we allow such a blatant disregard for consumers, we may be faced with even worse cases of profiteering in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE, the Consumers Association of Singapore, of course, is doing its best to discourage such practices. However, in order that CASE can succeed, consumers will have to be prepared to lend their support. The Government too will have to support CASE in its activities. As long as a suitable environment is lacking for CASE to act on it, then it will be a case of nothing but hot air. CASE will, to all purposes, be futile and ineffective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> No case!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> No case. So far no case. It is a very well known fact that the Singapore Government has been very successful in many things it has set out to do. Now, this is a simple problem and I think we will be successful provided we do not sit tight and allow such things to go on unchecked. I refer to the Kheng Keow Coffee Merchants Restaurant and Bar Owners Association and the Singapore Foochow Coffee Restaurant and Bar Merchants Association, and their blatant disregard of the advice of the Trade Department.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do? Two things we can do. One, we can pass laws to discourage profiteering. But, of course, without proper research and in-depth thinking, we should not move in this direction yet. The other is the one simple thing that the Ministry of Trade and Industry can do, and that is to encourage the NTUC to look into the possibility of tendering for coffee shops in HDB new towns or perhaps to approach the Ministry of the Environment to see if one or two stalls could be allocated to the NTUC in each hawker centre so that we can create some kind of competition, hence giving the consumer a choice. And if there is a free choice for the consumers, prices can be regulated easily. It is precisely because of wanting the absence of free choice that these two merchant associations have formed themselves into what I would call "a trade association" with an instinct for monopolistic dealings which can act against the interest of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> consumers. Before these dealings could develop into full-blown monopolies, the Government must act immediately to control their activities; otherwise they will take every opportunity to raise prices in agreement. These will be the people responsible for what I would call "creeping inflation in Singapore". They are just like those who sip in our cup; they dip in our dish; they sit down by our fire. We find them in the dye-vat, the washing bowl and the powdering tub. I suspect that when Sir John Culpepper said this of Monopolies, he too was beginning to feel that certain monopolies and cartels in those days were simply plaguing the people of the country and eating holes into their pockets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let these associations go free and you will see the next natural thing would be for the hawkers to come out and say, "As others have raised prices, we must also raise our prices because we have to buy their coffee", and so on. Then the fruit seller, the farmer and the baker will also raise their prices. And it goes on like a merry-go-round, except that it is not merry at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the NTUC can succeed in running coffee shops well, they can probably kill two birds with one stone. For one thing, the increased number of coffee shops will make for a more competitive market. For labour, the NTUC can look to the less severely handicapped people for their services, and I am sure these handicapped people will be only too pleased to work for NTUC for a reasonable salary and they will also feel that they are contributing towards the common good of society. Hence, we will be able to provide a useful source of employment for the not-so-seriously handicapped.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry must therefore probe very seriously into the thinking behind those who run trade associations like some form of cooperative, not for the good of the society but against the interest of society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is safe to say that the future years ahead will not be so bright and happy, especially in a shaky world economy and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ever-increasing fuel oil prices. I believe that a special committee in the Ministry of Trade and Industry has been formed to look into ways and means to fight inflation, what we call "imported inflation". I think this Committee should not only look at ways to deal with imported inflation but at the same time to look into "home-engineered" profiteering and such other bad words that describe the evil ways of businessmen. They want to make a quick buck and get away with it. We must deal with them summarily. Even if it means the formation of another committee, it will be worth the while to enforce this. Of course, prices of goods and services must rise, but when they do rise, then explanations in detail must be given. The Government can take the lead here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Public Utilities Board has in one way or another done so, as can be seen in the report in the Straits Times of 15th November, 1980, entitled "PUB fuel oil bill may rise to $975 million". Of course, by saying this I am not in any way suggesting on behalf of PUB or otherwise that there will be a rise in PUB charges, because I am not in a position to say so. But at least they have done something to explain the rise in fuel oil charges, and therefore their operation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated many times that Singaporeans are intelligent people, and I am saying it again and again that Singaporeans, being intelligent as they are, can understand explanations behind the rise of various charges. If this is done, therefore, it leaves behind the blatant profiteers who are not able to explain their rise in prices. They will be chased out of their wits for reasons to increase their prices, as they will then face greater consumer pressure and criticism. This will be an opportune time for the invisible hand of Government to stretch out, to feel and probe with unfaltering fingers and prescribe some bitter medicine to cure their profiteering itch.
  <br>4.31 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Mountbatten has touched on the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> fundamental of economics, i.e. how prices of goods and services should be determined. I am not at all convinced, Mr Speaker, Sir, that prices should be determined on the basis of cost plus a profit margin. If that was so, there would be very little incentive for business operators to cut down costs. They can pay more to their employees. They would not worry too much about the cost of imports because they can easily pass on, with the approval of some authority, the increased cost. Therefore, I am not convinced that prices should be on the basis of cost plus a profit margin. Neither am I convinced that prices should be fixed, whether by cartel or by the Department of Trade.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent some years of my working life in Fullerton Building drinking coffee supplied by the canteen operator. The canteen operator was given the canteen premises free of rent but the prices in which they could charge were controlled by the Ministry of Finance. The premises was tendered out to canteen operators and normally the operator that submitted the lowest price-list would be given the contract to provide beverages and food to the staff in Fullerton Building. Prices were, therefore, fixed at a low level. For example, a glass of coffee with milk, when I was there, cost 10 cents. Up to now, I am not sure whether the coffee with condensed milk that I drank tasted like Singapore River water or dish-water.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price determination of goods and services is therefore best left to market forces, i.e. to supply and demand. In this way, the consumer has almost as much power as the supplier in determining prices. If prices are too high, consumers can always withdraw consumption of that particular item or services or they can look for alternative forms of goods and services. But that does not mean that the Government has no interest in the level of prices of goods and services in Singapore, in particular, the prices of essential goods. There is a committee on Profiteering and Inflation in my Ministry, whose role it is to ensure that there are no restrictive practices to force up prices artificially. It is the primary role of the Committee on Profiteering and Inflation to ensure that no business
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> operators group themselves together to fix prices by artificially restraining supply in order to enhance their profits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two associations, the Singapore Foochow Coffee Restaurant and Bar Merchants Association and the Kheng Keow Coffee Merchants Restaurant and Bar Owners Association, informed the Department of Trade on 4th November 1980 that they were going to raise prices, the Department immediately asked for cost data. These data were submitted on 14th November 1980 and on that very day the two associations held a press conference to announce that the prices of coffee, tea and other beverages would go up on 15th November 1980. I am not looking now into the justification of whether the price increases were right or wrong. But I would like to register our displeasure at the almost blatant disregard of Government authority. Surely the two associations should heed the request of the Department to defer price increases until the Department could have a look at the data submitted by the two associations. Government authority must prevail and must be seen to prevail.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two associations, I understand, are registered under the Trade Unions Act, and under the Act they are permitted to impose restrictive conditions on trade and to fix prices. As I said earlier, I do not subscribe to the thesis that prices should be fixed either by the Department of Trade or by a cartel. Therefore, we would be looking into the feasibility and desirability of introducing legislation to prohibit such associations from engaging in price-fixing activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten suggested that one of the ways to curb price increases by the two associations was for the Ministry to encourage NTUC to take up premises in HDB estates to run coffee shops or coffee houses. That decision must rest with NTUC. But on my part, I would not encourage NTUC to go into the coffee business or into the provision of soft drinks to customers. That is not the role of NTUC. There are other means whereby we can curtail unnecessary profiteering. But NTUC should not depart from
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> its basic role of organizing workers to improve their welfare through better working conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the observation of the Member for Mountbatten that CASE has a useful role to play, and for CASE to play a useful role both Government and consumers must support its activities. In the ultimate, whether we can succeed or cannot succeed in curbing profiteering, consumers must play the role. CASE, together with the Department of Trade, can help by publishing and publicising cost data. As I said earlier, prices are determined by market forces but, nevertheless, cost data might be useful to the public so that they can judge for themselves whether the supplier is charging an unreasonable profit and, if it is, whether they, as consumers, would wish to deny that supplier the benefit of exorbitant profit by not purchasing that particular item.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would agree substantially with the observations and comments made by the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry. I think Government has no business in controlling prices. It is an impossible thing to do. In fact, if Government were to try to do so, the quality of coffee cannot be controlled. Neither can the quality of tea. And not only that, the size of the cup will have to be monitored from time to time to make sure that it remains the same.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago, CASE was after the hawkers for raising the price of a bowl of rice. I thought that was a silly thing to do because the hawkers can simply switch from 100% grade rice to a 10% grade, or mix the rice with something of a poorer grade, or put more water in the rice or reduce the size of the bowl. There are a number of things that they can do. So it is a self-defeating measure
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to adopt. At the same time, Sir, the case before us is one that surely must arouse the suspicion of the public because the cost conditions of the coffee shops are so widely divergent. Some of them are in rent-controlled premises, others are in the older HDB estates where the rentals are much lower and others are in the newer HDB estates where the rentals are much higher and yet they are asking for a uniform price for each and every coffee shop. Surely, even on the basis of cost plus pricing, it is unwarranted for each and every coffee seller to charge the same price. It smacks of cartelization and I would certainly urge the Minister to look into the possibility of breaking this particular monopoly and, also to be fair, to break other cartels that exist in Singapore. I have often wondered too, Sir, with all due respect to the Member for Mountbatten, why I should pay the same price for the same bottle of soft drinks, whether it be Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola, F&amp;N soft drink or whichever soft drink.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Just one concluding remark, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Member for Whampoa is, in fact, sharing the same sentiments as myself, that is, both of us are against price fixing because it is impossible to do so and both of us are against the formation of cartels to fix prices. As I remarked earlier, my Ministry is looking into the possibility of prohibiting cartels from engaging in price-fixing activity. They can have their associations. They can have their social activities. But they should not be allowed to fix prices.

  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> The Ministry has no plans to set up a medical clinic at the Airport to service passengers. The Department of Civil Aviation and the airlines themselves are responsible for air passengers. They are the proper authorities who know how many passengers will require occasional medical treatment and to organize medical facilities either for peak periods only or on a 24-hour basis. As Changi Hospital is located close to the new Changi Airport, the facilities of the hospital will be available. If an air disaster should take place, procedures have been drawn up to activate rescue and ambulance services and for patients to be treated in public hospitals. This was the case in the Spyros disaster in 1978.
