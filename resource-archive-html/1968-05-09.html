<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(First Day)</b></div>



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we of the P.A.P, have been given a mandate  as

great  as  the  responsibility that goes  with  the

task. We shall do our best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are a hard-headed people. If we

maintain  group discipline, if everyone contributes

his  fullest  share  of physical  and  intellectual

effort to the fulfilment of our plans, we shall not

fail.  We  can  and we shall build up  an  adequate

defence  force before the 1st of January, 1972.  We

can  counter  recession, expand our economy,  train

and   educate   artisans,   technicians   and   the

technocrats of our growing industrial and servicing

sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, as British forces withdraw

and  leave Singapore and Malaysia to make their own

arrangements  for  security,  we  shall  find   out

whether, as a community, we are like a creeper or a

tree.  Both  the  creeper  and  the  sapling   need

support.  But unlike a creeper, a sapling does  not

need  support  as it grows older and  stronger.  It

will  grow  into  a  tree  and  dispense  with  the

supporting  stake. No amount of aid and assistance,

grants and loans, technical assistance and training

can  do  the job which we must do for ourselves.  A

people  who are by nature creepers must,  when  the

stake  they  have been leaning on is removed,  fall

and  crawl on the ground. If we are that sort of  a

society,  then  even with all this  brave  talk  by

leaders  and  encouraging noises by  observers  and

commentators,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



and  all  the fine words of comfort and promise  of

aid,  we will still find ourselves crawling on  the

ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the manifestations of the last decade

point to a sapling growing sturdier and stronger as

it  matures into an upright tree. The stake,  which

the  British presence provided, has enabled sapling

Singapore  to grow straight and tall without  being

too  buffeted by the winds while it is still  young

and fragile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have that spirit of self-reliance and

self-respect  as  a  community  if  we  are  to  be

compared to a tree. To join the growing numbers  of

countries  who  beg  for alms  from  the  developed

countries,  would destroy our pride  and  undermine

our self-confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a number of countries, after gaining

independence,   have   failed   economically    and

collapsed   socially.  They  lacked  one  essential

quality:  self-discipline, either in their leaders,

or  more  often  both in their  leaders  and  their

people.  It requires self-discipline to budget  and

live  within  your means, when you can  just  print

more money. It requires self-discipline to maintain

the  integrity  and  efficiency of  government  and

administration  and  to  punish   and   keep   down

corruption,   especially  in  high  places.   Self-indulgence  would soon lead to personal wealth  and

security  for  the few, the political leaders,  the

military     chieftains,    and    the    principal

administrators.  Whatever  the  evils  of  British,

French,  or  Dutch  colonial administrations,  they

provided   firm,  rigid  frameworks  within   which

constructive  endeavour was rewarded.  Seldom  were

colonial  budgets ever in deficit. They  invariably

spent  less than what they got out of each  colony,

for  colonies were intended to provide profits, not

incur losses. They kept stern discipline and stable

conditions,  sound currencies, good sanitation  and

healthy  conditions. It is sad to see how  in  many

countries,  national heroes have let their  country

slide   down  the  drain  to  filth  and   squalor,

corruption and degradation, where the kick-back and

the  rake-off  has become a way of  life,  and  the

whole country sinks in self-debasement and despair.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the political leadership ever allows Singapore

to  degenerate into these conditions, then we shall

perish. For we have not got that agricultural  base

where  you can scatter seed on the ground, and  the

soil,  the  rain and the sun will produce  you  the

rice,  the corn and the fruits with which  to  feed

yourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, with imaginative and

intelligent  leadership  and  stiff  standards   of

honest and just administration, we can make maximum

use  of  our  resources  which  are  not  all  that

slender.   We  have  not  often  underlined   these

valuable resources. Let me enumerate them:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have more than average human

intelligence,  diligence,  skills,  knowledge   and

expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our superb geographic location at the

southernmost   tip  of  the  continent   of   Asia,

straddling  the  route between the Indian  and  the

Pacific  Oceans,  the  northern  and  the  southern

hemispheres. We have been important for  150  years

as  a great sea junction. And for the last 20 years

we  have  also grown in importance as a  great  air

junction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  may  remember  the  Maltese  Labour

leader,  Mr Born Mintoff, visiting us in  December

1967. A Rhodes scholar, he does not lack perception

or  articulation. After a few days in Singapore, he

said,   privately  and  publicly  over  radio   and

television,  that  Singapore was  better  off  than

Malta  because Singapore did not have to  face  the

stiff  competition that the Maltese face from their

neighbours. In other words, the Italians in  Naples

and  Genoa, the Greeks in Athens and the French  in

Marseilles, all have higher skills and work  harder

and so take business away from Malta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the passive into the active tense, it

means  that  we work harder, are better  organised,

and   more  efficient  than  many  others  in   the

neighbourhood. We sell the same things cheaper,  we

do  the same job for a lower price, and we offer to

buy the same produce at better prices than anywhere

else in the region.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third asset is the accumulation of 150 years

of  infrastructure  and  experience,  in  commerce,

industry  and  communications. This does  not  mean

just  the  physical buildings, the ports, airports,

warehouses,  roads, banks, shops,  power  stations,

water-works, telephones and cables. More  important

are  the invisibles, the accumulations of knowledge

and  expertise; how to run the port and the airport

economically  and efficiently; how to  keep  up  to

date  with containerised ships and jumbo jets; what

banking,  money, finance, stocks and shares,  bills

of lading, and insurance are about; how and what to

buy in bulk from the industrial countries and break

bulk  to retail in the area, and conversely how  to

buy  retail  and  package in  bulk  for  export  to

industrial  countries. This requires a well-trained

professional,   managerial  and  executive   elite,

supported   by   a  well  educated,   skilled   and

industrious working population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing can more emphasise the importance of

these  three factors than if hon. Members  were  to

consider  what  would happen if Singapore  did  not

have  these three assets: the human resources,  the

strategic  geographic location,  and  the  built-up

infrastructure both physical structure and the know-how.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what would happen if we towed Singapore

out and left it in the middle of the South Pacific.

Instead   of   two  million  active  and   vigorous

Singaporeans,  you  have South-sea  Islanders  with

flowers in their hair, dancing to languorous tunes.

Also,  instead of having the enormous sea  and  air

traffic,  and  the stimulus of people bringing  new

ideas, we have South-sea Islanders lounging on  the

beach,  watching  the occasional  cargo  ship  drop

anchor. Then we would never have developed what  we

have: three deep-sea harbours, Tanjong Pagar,  with

berthing   alongside  for  30   ships,   Sembawang,

servicing what was up till very recently one of the

greatest  navies in the world, the deepwater  berth

at Jurong, not to mention Telok Ayer Basin, Collyer

Quay and Kallang Basin, the earliest harbours in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



the  days  of the sailing ships. We would not  have

four  airfields,  Paya Lebar,  Tengah,  Changi  and

Seletar.  Nor a network of roads, probably  amongst

the  best maintained in South Asia, telephones  and

telecommunications that link us up with one another

and  with  all the major cities of the  world,  and

soon a satellite receiving station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if Singapore were in the South Pacific,

populated   by   South-sea   Islanders   and    not

Singaporeans,  it  would not  be  able  to  feed  a

population of even 20,000 people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not in the South Pacific, nor are we

South-sea Islanders. We do not put flowers  on  our

ears,  either as decorative ornaments  or  as  fads

like the flower people in the West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These assets constitute our inheritance. We must

maintain  and improve upon what we have  inherited.

Bustling commercial and administrative centres have

been known to sink into disrepair for lack of self-discipline,  often starting with the  leaders,  but

invariably infecting the whole population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a stable economic and political

situation.  We maintain sane, orderly  and  healthy

conditions. There was a time not so very long  ago,

particularly in 1964 and 1965, after the riots when

discipline  broke down, when it  looked  as  if  we

might slither down the slippery slope. Organisation

and  administration became tangled  and  discipline

slackened amongst our workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cows roamed the streets in the city, leaving dung

all  over the place. Some people died driving their

cars  into cows long before they could die  through

disease as a result of the filth. Stray dogs, sick,

mangy and wild, were becoming a nuisance, a menace.

We had the laws changed and enforced. Cows found in

the  city  limits  provided food  for  our  welfare

homes.  Stray  dogs were eliminated as  efficiently

and humanely as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not just maintain standards of public

health and cleanliness. We must go further and make

this the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



cleanest  and greenest city in South  Asia.  If  we

want  high morale, we must have high standards.  If

we  want  high standards, the law must be  enforced

fairly  and  firmly. There will be no squatters  or

beggars  sleeping  on  our  pavements  doing  their

ablutions in our drains. People will be housed  and

cared  for.  Hawkers  will not  clog  up  the  main

streets.   There  will  be  thorough   and   proper

cleansing every day of the year. Laws will have  to

be  passed to help rid us of the malpractices  that

have  crept into our work force. Only a year before

last,  malingering  and shirking  and  sabotage  to

create overtime and treble, pay for public holidays

was  a way of life. Discipline and efficiency  must

be re-established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children will grow up in healthy and clean

homes,  with adequate ventilation, sunlight, water,

electricity and modern sanitation. Many will go  to

kindergartens   even  before  they  begin   primary

education.  All  will have at least  six  years  of

primary   education  plus  another  two  years   of

vocational  training. Of the total number  admitted

to  Primary I every year, over 50 per cent go on to

complete   four  years  of  academic  or  technical

secondary   education,  over  10  per  cent   reach

University entrance standards; over 5 per  cent  of

the  best  go  on to University and other  tertiary

institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other community in South Asia offers its

people   these  standards.  Nobody  believed   that

Singapore   could  make  it,  except  Singaporeans.

Nobody  believed that we had the gumption  and  the

nous.  And we are proud of being Singaporeans.  And

that  pride and patriotism will grow over the years

as  we  add to our inheritance: improved and higher

efficiency   in   our   harbours   and    airports,

modernisation   in  containerised  facilities   and

landing  aids for longer runways to take the  jumbo

jets;  better  housing and more home ownership  for

our  workers,  better schools,  clinics,  community

centres,  gardens,  libraries for  their  children;

more factories and better jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall build up our defence capacity. We should

be   able   to  make  arrangements  for  continuing

security in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



conjunction  with  those  with  similar  interests.

There   are  possibilities  for  greater   economic

growth. The sea offers limitless prospects, some of

which we have already grasped in ship repairing and

ship-building.  They will grow  and  expand  as  we

develop  our  skills  and  expertise,  and  as  our

reputation spreads throughout the world.  We  shall

build  and  run a merchant fleet. We shall  go  for

deep-sea  fishing  and eventually  save  about  $30

million  we  spend every year in buying  fish  from

abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic growth will be accelerated if we

provide  ideal  conditions for the  siting  of  the

headquarters    of    international     industrial,

commercial and servicing enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the quickest way to reduce unemployment is

the  greater  inflow of tourists,  for  tourism  is

labour  intensive. With Singapore clean and  green,

exotic  and  efficient,  with  good  and  courteous

service,  and shops filled with the good things  of

life,  the  tourists  will flow  in  from  America,

Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and even Europe,  as

they  do  the  circuit Hongkong,  Angkor,  Bangkok,

Singapore, Bali and beyond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two and a half years since separation,

some  35,000 people have moved from Malaya, or West

Malaysia, to Singapore, as against some 6,000  from

Singapore to Malaysia. If our economy had  stalled,

this  could  not have happened. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

there  has  been  a great deal of  uninformed  talk

about  work permits. It is not, and has never been,

our   intention  to  withdraw  work  permits   from

professional,  skilled, or even  unskilled  workers

who do the hard jobs. These people help to increase

our Gross National Product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 45,000 work permits, more or less evenly

divided  between  Malaysian  and  Indian  citizens,

there are about 6,500 permits for what we call  the

"easier  jobs",  namely,  the  jobs  not  requiring

either  special skills or much physical effort.  We

need  these  jobs for our own citizens  who,  as  a

result  of  past education policies,  are  now  not

suitable  for  training to become skilled  workers.

They include a large proportion of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Malays.  They  have  in  the  past  been

educated  in schools like Malay primary schools  or

the   Arabic  schools  without  being  taught   the

subjects  that are necessary to enable them  to  be

trained as artisans or technicians. But they can do

these easier jobs which are now being done by  non-citizens. Over the years, through the operation  of

open  market  forces, employers may  find  it  more

attractive to employ our citizens for these  easier

jobs.  For  only  citizens are entitled  to  public

housing,  medical treatment, and health facilities,

social  benefits  and so on.  If  we  keep  up  the

momentum, far from going down, in the next five  to

ten  years  we will not only provide jobs  for  our

unemployed,  but  also  be  able  to  take   in   a

controlled   flow   of   the   professionally   and

technologically trained, the skilled and even those

unskilled workers prepared to do the hard and heavy

jobs.  This  has  been the experience  of  all  the

countries  where, with higher education and  higher

expectations  of  their  own population,  immigrant

labour  was necessary to fill in the lower  echelon

of  their  work force, whether it is in Japan  with

Formosan  and  Korean workers or  in  Germany  with

Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Turkish workers,  or

in  Britain with all the innumerable problems  that

Britain  now faces as a result of this  process  of

going  up  the social ladder. I do not  believe  we

will  face  any of these difficulties, because  the

people  we are allowing in are more or less already

very much like ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we shall have a prosperous, thriving and

multi-racial   Singapore.  And  nothing   is   more

infectious than success. In the longer run, it will

be  the light from Singapore that will radiate hope

throughout the region for similar success of  other

multi-racial communities not unlike us. By  example

and   precept,  our  success  will  influence   the

formulae  others  are  seeking  to  transform  old-fashioned  communities into modern,  industrialised

and affluent societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history is a long and unending process.

History bears witness to the ascendancy of the more

fit and the more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



adaptable.  Otherwise  today  man,  whether  he  is

European, Asian, American, Russian, British, French

or  Chinese,  they  would  not  have  fathomed  the

secrets  of  the atom and be reaching out  for  the

moon and the stars and beyond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capacity to learn has played an important

part in the ascendancy of man over all other living

beings  on this earth. It is the brain in man  that

gave him supremacy over larger creatures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from time to time in the history of human

civilisations,  more  civilised,  more   cultivated

societies,  with higher standards of  living,  have

been  over-run and subjugated by barbaric and  less

advanced  groups. So the Roman Empire fell.  An  so

successive  Chinese  and Indian civilisations  were

conquered  by  virile  warrior  races,   who   were

socially and culturally of a cruder order, and less

sophisticated  in  their social  organisations.  We

must  be  on  our toes all the time. We must  never

allow  this  to  happen  to Singapore  through  our

growing self-indulgent and soft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can predict what will happen around us in

the  region.  No one knows what will be  the  world

balance  of  power in the late l970s or  l980s,  or

whose   influence  will  prevail  over  South   and

Southeast  Asia. But whatever happens in South  and

Southeast  Asia and in the wider world  beyond,  we

must  use  the  time given us to  grow  sturdy  and

strong.  Our people have in abundance the  capacity

to learn and to adjust to changing circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future belongs to the most adaptable, the

most intelligent, and the best organised. We can be

counted amongst them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion*

standing in my name.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the speech of the President be agreed to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President

for the speech which he delivered on behalf ofthe Government at the opening of the First

Session of this Parliament".

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

speak  in support of the motion moved by the  Prime

Minister.  In  his speech, the President  described

this  Parliament as a "Parliament  which  is  faced

with problems of more than usual magnitude" and  he

finally   exhorted  hon.  Members  "to   speak   in

forthright  terms to reflect and more important  to

lead  thinking and feeling in the country". And  to

leave  our Republic more flourishing and secure  at

the  end  of  this  Parliament. I am  positive  and

optimistic that we all will give of our  best.  For

this   is  our  country.  The  people  have  almost

unanimously voted for all the 58 candidates of  the

P.A.P.,  of  whom  51  were returned  unopposed  on

Nomination Day, to make this Parliament a one-party

Parliament! This is not only unique in the  history

of   parliamentary  democracy  at  work;  but  more

important  still,  it manifests to  the  world  the

demonstration of absolute unity on the part of  the

people  in a multi-racial nation of two million  to

be  a people, to be a nation and to survive as  one

as   long  as  time,  in  this  part  of  turbulent

Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum to the speech by the President

and also the series of talks given by the Ministers

clearly  portray the crucial years ahead  and  what

positive  steps the Government will  be  taking  to

resolve  them.  Also, what the people  and  country

will  have to face in the next five years or  more.

With  the  absence of an Opposition,  it  does  not

necessarily mean that this Parliament will not make

any  contribution; in fact, it shall at the end  of

its  life  leave  Singapore  more  flourishing  and

secure.  Since there are many hon. Members in  this

Chamber  who  will be making solid and constructive

comments on the President's Speech, I shall  on  my

part  traverse a few topics and leave the rest  for

my  colleagues  to deliberate. In this  respect,  I

hope, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir, you will allow me latitude and  bear

with  me  if  I  were to be a bit too specific  and

detailed  in  the  course  of  my  speech,  because

details  are sometimes necessary to illustrate  and

emphasise a point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reassuring to note that a comprehensive

Employment Bill will be introduced and that some of

the  Ordinances like the Labour Ordinance of  1955,

the  Shop Assistants Employment Ordinance  of  1957

and the Clerks Employment Ordinance of 1957 will be

repealed.  In other words, the proposed  Bill  will

cut across all sections of the `so many schemes  or

agreements  of  employment and will  establish  one

single  comprehensive form of employment  Ordinance

that will regulate and curtail employment benefits.

Inevitably,  more  employment  opportunities  would

result  to take in a good number of the unemployed.

It is, therefore, opportune and timely to introduce

such a form of employment legislation, as Singapore

will  have to face and live up to the crucial years

ahead. The order of the day will be "sacrifice  and

more sacrifice" and every worker must put in a full

day's  work  for a full day's wage. It  is  both  a

commendable  and  ambitious  scheme  and  can  only

succeed  when the people bravely live  up  to  `the

challenge. I am positive we will. However,  neither

the number of jobs to be created nor the percentage

of the total unemployed to be reduced by this piece

of  legislation is indicated in the Addendum to the

President's  Speech. I am of the opinion  that  the

trade   sector  will  be  unable  to  take   in   a

considerable number, say, for example,  the  white-collar jobs. Admittedly this sector will not  be  a

good  job-provider.  This point  has  already  been

explained  by  the Finance Minister in  his  Budget

Statement in the last Parliamentary Budget session.

Therefore, if the introduction of the Bill were  to

bring  about more job opportunities in  the  fields

which I have mentioned earlier, then it might prove

inadequate  to resolve the unemployment  situation.

But I do not think the Government is so naive as to

introduce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



a  Bill to serve a particular purpose only. As  has

been   briefly   described,  it  is  to   "increase

productivity  and promote more industrial  growth",

therefore  the  scope  would cover  a  wider  field

definitely, and this must rightly be so. But  again

there  is  the question of how fast can  industrial

growth  be  generated or accelerated  in  order  to

provide   jobs   for  the  thousands   of   already

unemployed  and, at the same time, for some  20,000

secondary  school-leavers who will be entering  the

labour  market  each  year.  Therefore,  industrial

growth  must  take a new dimension  if  we  are  to

reduce this staggering figure of the unemployed  to

a  manageable number. In other words,  this  figure

must  somehow be reduced through industrial  growth

to manageable proportions so that social discontent

and  instability may not result. I am  particularly

happy  to  see  that with the expanding  hotel  and

catering  industry, courses will  be  organised  to

train  people  in  the know-how of this  particular

industry.  But again I would imagine  that  only  a

certain  number would benefit. I am  no  economist,

and  I  do  not profess to be one either.  However,

looking at the ever-increasing number of unemployed

in spite of the vigorous efforts the Government has

consistently put in, I would be credulous if I were

to  believe that unemployment could be solved  that

easily. This has been proved in countries which are

both more highly industrialised and well developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given the right thinking and approach, I

am  optimistic  that unemployment will  be  greatly

reduced  if real sacrifices are made and  everybody

plays  his  part  well. In  a  small  way,  if  the

retirement  age is limited to 55 years  instead  of

the   present   60  years,  the  chances   of   job

opportunities    would   increase,    though    not

considerably. Bearing in mind that more  than  half

our  population is below the age of 21, this  would

help   ease,   to  some  extent,  the  unemployment

situation  if  both the private and public  sectors

retire  workers who reach the age of 55.  With  the

younger  workers replacing those retired, recurrent

expenditure by way of salaries and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



other  emoluments  would  be  reduced.  This  is  a

possibility well worth looking into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance, over

radio  and T.V, on 30th March this year, talked  on

"How to beat the slump". He clearly elucidated that

the  gradual  withdrawal  of  the  British  defence

commitments  would  mean a  reduction  in  military

expenditure to the tune of $900 million between now

and  1971.  He then went on to explain  in  general

detail how the Government proposes "to prevent this

recession".  And  in his subsequent  talk  on  16th

April on "Economic Growth", he laid emphasis on the

increase  of  economic growth through the  entrepot

trade,  tourism,  shipping  and  the  manufacturing

industry.  These  two  talks  clearly  present  the

complexity and magnitude of the crucial years ahead

of  us.  As  I  have  pointed out,  Sir,  I  am  no

economist,  so  I  will turn to  the  next  heading

"Central Provident Fund".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the proposal to increase the range of

contributions towards the Central Provident Fund by

including both those employed in the Government and

the  Statutory  Boards  as a necessary  measure  to

mobilise domestic savings to be employed to counter

recession  strategy. This move is  both  sound  and

wise.  Not  only will it bring about  an  equitable

sharing of responsibility by both the employer  and

the  employee to make a must of compulsory  saving,

but in this case the Government is realistic enough

to  realise that, by introducing such a move,  both

the Government and people will benefit directly and

indirectly. Directly, it takes shape in the form of

compulsory  savings that will be reserved  for  the

member-contributor  until he reaches  retiring  age

when  he  will  have at his disposal a considerable

sum  that will continue to ensure him a more secure

future   in   spending  his  years  of  retirement.

Obviously, he may turn to voluntary social  service

to the Republic despite his retirement. This is the

direct benefit the employee, whether he is from the

private sector or public service, will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



get.  Indirectly, with the contributions, of  both

the  employee  and employer, the Central  Provident

Fund will be able to mobilise the use of such funds

to  counter  the  recession  strategy  and  promote

industrial growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest further

that with the introduction of such a proposal,  the

question of payment of other forms of benefits.  In

the  public service, like gratuities, be abolished.

In  the field of public service, a civil servant on

top  of getting his pension also gets his gratuity,

the  amount of which will depend on the  number  of

years of service he has put in. And if he should be

made to contribute towards the C.P.F., then he will

benefit  in  three  ways for his services,  namely,

pension,  gratuity  and C.P.F, contributions.  This

should  not  be the case. Therefore, a scheme  will

have  to  be  worked out whereby all those  already

emplaced  in  permanent service may be  allowed  to

draw  a  pension upon their retirement and made  to

contribute'   towards  the  C.P.F, up   to   their

retirement age; maybe a smaller proportion  of  the

gratuity  will  be  paid to  them;  also  those  on

probation will be made to contribute, say,  73  per

cent  to  10  per  cent of their  salary  or  total

emoluments  to  the C.P.F, and the  Government,  as

employer,  will  do likewise. Upon his  retirement,

the  employee will receive a lump sum instead,  and

this  will, of course, be bigger than the  gratuity

that   he  would  have  received  if  he  had   not

contributed   towards  the  C.P.F.  I   hope   this

suggestion will deserve consideration in  that  not

only will it help economic growth, but it will also

enable  a  compulsory saving scheme to' materialise

in which every employee is made to be a contributor

to the C.P.F.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I now come to the problem in

which  the  gap between "the' haves and  the  have-nots",  though considerably reduced, has as yet  to

be  bridged. In other words, the perspective, as  I

look  at,  is the provision of social amenities  in

the   rural  constituencies  like  Jalan  Kayu  and

Tampines, or Punggol for that matter. Although



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



much   has  been  provided  for  them  by  way   of

electricity and water supplies and better roads and

drainage, I am of the opinion that a lot more  will

have to be done so that the facilities as such that

are  being enjoyed by the urban population will  by

the  best possible means be also made available  to

the rural population. In this respect, I propose to

deal with the problem by items: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer first to electrification scheme. No doubt

a  good part of Punggol has been electrified; there

are,  however,  certain  remote  areas  where   the

population  is  sparse and for which such  supplies

are  not  available.  As I  understand  it,  it  is

because  of  the heavy costs that will have  to  be

incurred that they are prevented from enjoying this

facility.  I  suppose that several million  dollars

are  needed  to electrify these remote villages  or

kampongs  in the various rural constituencies.  But

if  I  may  ask,  what is several  million  dollars

compared to spending fifty million dollars to build

a  National Sports Stadium complex as Kallang where

I am sure, Sir, not all the two million people will

benefit.   Therefore,  I  would  plead   that   the

Government  do consider my point, as many  requests

have been made and some have yet to be acceeded to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to water supplies. I wish to make a

similar  plea  on  supplies of  water.  A  national

exercise  is  being carried out to remove  as  many

public  standpipes as possible. This, I understand,

resulted from public wastage and indiscriminate use

of  water and the Government has to pay as much  as

$1.5  million to $2 million worth of water consumed

at  these  standpipes  each year.  But  before  the

standpipes  are  removed, plans  will  have  to  be

prepared  for  the  laying of water  mains  to  the

kampongs  and connection of water supplies  to  the

homes  will  have to be encouraged. Again,  Sir,  I

must  emphasise that such supplies should  also  be

made   available  to  the  remotest  kampong.   For

example,  I have in my constituency several  remote

kampongs which up till today have yet to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



such  supplies,  let alone having a  stand-pipe  to

share.  Why  is  this  so? [Interruption]  That  is

because the hon. Member's constituency is urban and

he  does not need standpipes. In my area it is much

larger;   probably   ten   Stamford   parliamentary

divisions  can  be  put into Punggol.  Sir,  it  is

simply  because laying a water main to these remote

areas would entail high costs. Therefore, how  long

have these people to wait before they are given the

supplies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is indeed reassuring to note that

with   the   commissioning  of  the  Johore   River

Waterworks  and  the commencement  of  the  Seletar

Project,   water   supplies   will   be   immensely

increased. It is thus my hope that the rural  folks

in  such  areas will not have to wait too long  and

that their needs will not be forgotten. I would  go

on to suggest that a scheme be drawn up with a view

to  ensuring that water supplies be made  available

to  the  remotest village or kampong in  any  rural

constituency,  probably  Choa  Chu  Kang,  as   the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Finance, was trying to catch my eye. Now that he is

on  the Government Bench, he finds it difficult  to

bring  up such matters. This scheme or project  may

not  sound workable in view of the high costs,  but

if it is carried out, it will close the gap between

the "haves and the have-nots" by a step closer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary production takes my attention next. It is

also  reassuring  to  note that  the  farmers  will

continue  to be taken care of through the provision

of  services and advice to enable them to  increase

their farm products and reduce production costs. It

appears  vague in the Addendum, Sir,  and  I  would

like  to  know  how  this is to be  done.  As  land

availability is limited, intensive and  diversified

farming  becomes essential to sustain this part  of

our   economy.  Maximum  utilisation  of  the  land

available  for farming activities to increase  farm

products must result. The outmoded form of  farming

must give way to modern techniques. The building of

more  farm  schools  in  centrally-located  farming

areas for the training and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



teaching   of   correct   farming   techniques   is

essential.  Otherwise,  farming  as  a   means   of

livelihood   will  not  attract  those  handicapped

educationally, so to speak, to take to farming. And

in  that case the dependence on farm products  from

the  countries  outside the  Republic  will  become

greater.  Sir,  it is becoming more  apparent  that

more  and  more  land  which were  once  zoned  for

agricultural  purposes are today fast disappearing,

for  many  an area has given way to other forms  of

development. If such is the case, there will come a

time  when  farming will cease altogether.  I  hope

this  will  not come about and that every  possible

step  will  be  taken to preserve  such  lands  for

farming  activities, for their products  have  been

helping our national economy in no small measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the fisheries industry is being catered for

and   that  considerable  efforts  are  being  made

towards  the  training  of  a  new  generation   of

fishermen  both  off-shore  and  deep-sea   fishing

deserve  some comment. At present off-shore fishing

is  carried  out  mainly by otter-trawlers  ranging

from  five to 15 tons and manned by crews from five

to  10  persons. Whilst noting that steps are being

taken  in  this  direction, I  find  again  in  the

Addendum  no  safeguards  or  protection  for   our

trawlers; simply because marine patrols are lacking

and  neighbouring  countries  have  extended  their

territorial   waters  from  three  to   12   miles.

Therefore, some form of arrangement should be  made

between  these countries to allow free  passage  of

our   trawlers  in  their  fishing  pursuits,   not

forgetting   that  Singapore  is  a   small   State

surrounded  by water and also surrounded  by  other

countries.  This is a "fishy" problem,  because  we

have neither a Navy nor adequate marine patrols  to

patrol  satisfactorily  our territorial  waters  to

give the necessary protection for our trawlers  and

fishermen when they go out to the open sea to  make

their  living  and  to  make a  safe  return.  Hon.

Members  in  the last Parliament will remember  the

occasions  when  it was brought  to  light  that  a

number of our trawlers and fishermen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



had  been apprehended or held to ransom by  pirates

just  outside international waters. What then would

be  the safeguards and measures the Government will

take  to ensure our fishermen a free- from-hindrance

fear when they take to sea? This is the crux of the

problem.   Providing   the  necessary   know   how,

technique  and  training for a  new  generation  of

fishermen  is  not so much of a problem;  the  real

problem lies in what I have just pointed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heading "Primary Production and Urban

and  Rural Services", the second paragraph outlines

the  expansion  of  the  fishing  industry.  It  is

interesting  to  note  that a Fisheries  Wharf  and

Central  Fish Auction Market are being  constructed

to  provide a system of fish landing, marketing and

distribution at Jurong. To date, Sir, I would  like

to know of the number of deep-fishing companies set

up and the total capital invested. Also, how are we

to  make  full use of the facilities in  attracting

larger  fishing vessels to discharge their  catches

here?  In other words, what depth of study in  this

particular field has been made and what proportions

would  it  benefit  us? I am not being  pessimistic

about  the  project. As we are in  the  process  of

training a new generation of fishermen for both off-shore  and  deep-sea fishing which  no  doubt  will

ultimately  help  in the economic growth,  we  will

continue to have to depend largely on the import of

fish and maybe fishing vessels from other countries

to  discharge their catches at Jurong. If  this  is

the case, then we may envisage the need to build  a

fish-canning factory near the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since I have mentioned the

National  Sports Stadium earlier, I would  like  to

obtain  some  form  of  assurance  and  information

regarding  this  complex.  I  understand  that  $50

million will be needed to put up and complete  this

complex. Once it is put up, I hope I can be ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> For a rugged society!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Once it is put up, I hope I can

be assured that it will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



turn  out  to  be  a  "white elephant".  Also  what

contribution will this National Stadium make in the

field of sports? How often will it be used, and how

will  it help towards the building of a more robust

and  rugged society, as has just been mentioned  by

the  Member  for  Changi? Therefore,  justification

must  be  made "to get full value for every  dollar

spent".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, Sir, now come to my last point. I refer to

the  last  paragraph  in  the  Addendum  sub-titled

"Family Planning" under the Ministry of Health.  No

doubt  it is a short paragraph but if one  were  to

read  it carefully, one finds that "family planning

will  be  prosecuted with greater vigour".  I  have

already  expressed my views on this matter  when  I

commented on the Government's White Paper on family

planning and this is contained in the Hansard, Vol.

24,  No.  4, dated 15th December, 1965, in  columns

171  to  173.  I am astounded to know that  "family

planning will be prosecuted with great vigour"  and

will  be  "augmented  by  the  .  .legislation   to

legalise  abortions and the voluntary sterilization

of  persons". I am not in favour of it and I  shall

reserve my comments until the Bill is introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have earlier stated

that  I shall deal with only a few topics and leave

the rest to my colleagues, the Backbenchers. I have

also  pointed  out  at the beginning  of  my  short

speech  that we are one people, determined to  face

the  future in spite of the crucial years ahead and

to  be  a  nation.  I  am confident  that  we  will

continue to survive, come what may.



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  workers of Singapore are fully aware  of

the crucial years that are coming ahead. There will

be a lot of problems to be solved. We are confident

that  the  workers  will  be  able  to  face  these

problems  and to co-operate with the employers  and

the  Government  to solve them. Everyone  is  aware

that  the  British Government will  be  withdrawing

their military forces from the Singapore Base



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



by  the  end  of  1971, thereby causing  a  lot  of

unemployment.  About 30,000 of  the  workers  there

will   lose  their  jobs.  In  addition  to   that,

thousands  of  our young school-leavers  are  still

seeking  jobs.  In  other words,  the  unemployment

problem  will  be more acute and more  complicated,

and  unless  the  workers, the  employers  and  the

Government co-operate with each other, it  will  be

very difficult to solve this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all these difficulties and problems

that   are   coming   ahead,  the   Government   is

introducing  a  comprehensive Employment  Bill.  Of

course,  the  object of this Bill is to standardise

and regulate the terms and conditions of employment

of  all employees, to standardise working hours  of

44  hours  per week for all employees, to  regulate

overtime   work,  to  enable  a  wider  spread   of

employment,  to limit certain fringe  benefits,  to

lessen  abuses, increase productivity  and  promote

more  industrial growth. All these  objectives  are

quite acceptable. What we hope, before the Bill  is

passed,  is that representations from the  workers'

side  will be seriously considered and accepted  so

that  no one side will be favoured. The workers  in

Singapore  have,  during the past few  years,  been

very  co-operative with the Government.  Industrial

relationship between workers and employers has been

very  good  and  we are determined that  this  good

industrial relationship should carry on so that  it

will  be beneficial not only to the workers but  to

the employers as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we appreciate the importance of greater

economic  growth, higher productivity,  elimination

of  restrictive  practices  and  abuses  of  fringe

benefits  and more efficient management.  We  agree

that,  in the national interest, the workers should

sacrifice as much as possible. Also, we expect  the

employers to make sacrifices as well. The N.T.U.C.,

at its last Annual Delegates' Conference on the 7th

of April this year, unanimously passed a resolution

to give our full co-operation to the Government. In

other  words,  we are very sincere  and  we  openly

agree to co-operate with the Government, especially

with the coming of this new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



Employment Bill. But we are surprised that at  this

very  moment  the employers' side is still  keeping

very  quiet. We hope they, the employers,  will  be

able  to come out with a public statement that they

will  co-operate fully with the workers as well  as

with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is a well-known fact that the abuse of

fringe benefits, or whatever they may be, lies  not

only  on  the  side of the workers. Employers  also

abuse the fringe benefits. In other words, not  all

employers  are  saints  and  not  all  workers  are

angels.  Just  because  of a  small  percentage  of

workers who deliberately abuse the fringe benefits,

I  hope this new Employment Bill will not be  taken

as a punishment to the rest of the good workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that the increase in working

hours  to  a standard 44 hours per week, will  help

employers  increase productivity and  at  the  same

time  enable  them to engage more workers.  I  hope

that, with the workers agreeing to the increase  in

working hours, employers will not take advantage by

retrenching  employees, because in  every  company,

there  is  a  limited number of  workers  and  some

employers may take advantage of the new situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to increase in productivity, it is

not  merely  a question of increasing  the  working

hours. There are other necessary factors to achieve

increased productivity. For example, there must  be

good industrial relationship between employers  and

employees, good wages and conditions of employment,

good    management,   personnel    and    efficient

supervisors.  One  of  the  best  ways  to  achieve

increased   productivity   is   to   give   certain

incentives to workers, like incentive bonuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years of the N.T.U.C, leadership,

industrial   relationship   between   workers   and

employers  has  been  very  good.  There  are  more

enlightened,  intelligent  and  responsible   trade

union  leaders  who  are able to settle  industrial

disputes   and   negotiate  for   good   collective

agreements by knowing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



the  capacity  of  the employers to  pay.  The  old

techniques of slogan-shouting and wild-cat  strikes

are   now   out  of  date  and  not  practised   by

enlightened trade union leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers fully support regulation of overtime

because it is not good for some workers to score so

much  in over-time while there are many people  who

are  unemployed.  So  I  sincerely  hope  that   by

regulating  overtime, employers  will  be  able  to

engage  more  workers so that there  will  be  less

people unemployed in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a scheme to train workers in all the

services  in view of the withdrawal of the  British

military  forces. I hope that this kind of training

can  be extended to a selected number of unemployed

people,  because a good number of  them  are  still

unable  to  get jobs, although they have registered

their  names in the Labour Exchange for  years.  In

giving   them   a  chance  to  join  the   training

programmes,  a  person registered as  a  clerk  may

perhaps  be able to be trained as a technician  and

get a job as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the question of fringe benefits.

For a number of years, union leaders have struggled

for and managed to get whatever fringe benefits  we

now  have.  With  the coming of the new  Employment

Bill,  we  hope  that  there is  a  possibility  of

leaving  as they are whatever agreements there  are

between employers and employees if there is  mutual

agreement  on both sides. It is painful that  after

struggling  for so many years we have to  sacrifice

many of the fringe benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that it is most welcome to

know  that  the  Government  intends  to  encourage

workers  to  own their own homes. In  view  of  the

increase  in contributions to the Central Provident

Fund,  I hope that most of the workers in Singapore

will take this opportunity to own their own homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been told by the Prime

Minister  that  we have to establish  a  very  good

industrial climate in Singapore to attract  foreign

investors to establish their business here so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



more people will get jobs and our industrialisation

programme  will be more successful. Of course,  the

new  Employment Bill will be passed in  due  course

subject to discussions between employers, employees

and the Government, and after hearing the views and

recommendations of all parties concerned. With  the

passing  of the new Employment Bill, we  hope  that

more  foreign investors will come here  and  engage

workers   in  Singapore.  I  think  it   is   known

throughout  the world that Singapore  is  the  best

place   for   investment  due  to  its   good   and

incorruptible  government. There is  political  and

economic  stability.  There  are  intelligent   and

sensible  trade union leaders. There are facilities

available,  such  as shipping, banking,  insurance,

communications, etc. Such facilities, to a  certain

extent,   will   attract   foreign   investors   to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by

giving  the assurance that the workers in Singapore

will  fully co-operate with the employers  and  the

Government   to   build  a  happy  and   prosperous

Singapore. The people of Singapore have  the  will,

determination and capacity to succeed in  spite  of

whatever  difficulties that may arise. We are  sure

that we will be able to succeed.

<div align="center"><b>(First Day)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>4.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy

to   join  the  Prime  Minister  in  thanking   the

President  for his speech. The Prime Minister  and,

indeed, several other Ministers have spoken of  the

crucial years ahead and that they cannot afford  to

be naive nor ingenuous. The President in his speech

laid  emphasis  on three important points,  namely,

national  defence,  economic  growth  and  national

consciousness. In respect of the second point, that

is,  economic growth, both the Minister for Science

and  Technology  and the Minister  for  Finance  in

their   recent  speeches  stressed  the  need   for

managerial and technological advance in industry. I

agree  wholeheartedly with them. If these  advances

are  to  be fostered, it follows logically that  we

should  harness the natural talents of  our  youths

and  provide  them with the necessary  training  to

become    scientists,   engineers,   managers    or

technologists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the attention of

this  House  to the large sums of Government  money

being  spent on the training of medical  personnel.

It  is  generally known that, because of the status

symbol of doctors and because of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



the lucrative income of the medical profession, the

Medical Faculty of the University of Singapore  has

attracted  and  is continuing to  attract  the  top

layer  of  the  cream of our H.S.C, graduates.  The

Medical Faculty takes in about 70 to 80 of our best

H.S.C, graduates every year and we are spending  on

each  student  about $7,000 each year.  This  means

that  we  are  investing  about  $42,000  in  every

medical  student if he graduates within six  years.

While  I  hold a good doctor in the highest  esteem

and  while  I  agree that we need good  doctors  to

maintain  our high standard of health, I wonder  if

some  of  this  top  talent  could  not  be  better

utilised  in ship-building, engineering  and  other

industries of top priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unemployment is an urgent and

serious  problem that is constantly  troubling  our

minds.  Even before the British decided to withdraw

their  forces, we had tens of thousands of  school-leavers joining the unemployment ranks every  year.

Now  with  the impending withdrawal of the  British

Forces  from  Singapore, this problem  will  become

even more acute. In this respect, the Minister  for

Science and Technology has said that education must

now be regarded as a means towards increasing one's

usefulness  in society and as a means of  obtaining

rewarding  and satisfying employment. He  has  also

said  that  emphasis should move  from  the  white-collar  to  the blue-collar jobs. I agree  entirely

with him. But I would like to know how and when  he

is   going   to  implement  this  change.   Is   he

considering  changes  in the many  adult  education

classes  which  are preparing students  for  repeat

attempts  in the School Certificate and the  H.S.C.

examinations?   These  classes  are,   in   effect,

producing more white-collar workers while the  need

is  to  produce blue-collar workers. Many of  these

classes  are  being conducted by teachers  who  are

already  engaged  in  day schools,  thus  providing

earning  opportunities to those who are already  in

employment, whi1st the number of unemployed persons

is increasing by leaps and bounds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



every  year. Besides that, the employment of  full-time  day  teachers  in the adult  education  night

classes  deprives  younger  children  in  the   day

schools  of  effective teaching, for full-time  day

teaching followed by extramural activities and then

followed  by  night  teaching  hardly  leaves   the

teacher  any time to prepare his lessons  properly.

Further,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like  to  know

whether the Minister, in his efforts to resolve the

unemployment problem, is considering the withdrawal

of married women from employment. If so, perhaps he

should  spare  married women in  the  lower  income

bracket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to turn to the Finance Minister's

speech  on 30th of March, 1968, wherein he  gave  a

clear analysis of how he intended to counteract the

recession  created by the impending  withdrawal  of

the  British Forces. I must congratulate him on his

very   careful  and  exact  conclusions.   However,

although  he  was  aware of the  magnitude  of  the

import  leakage,  he did not elaborate  on  how  he

could keep this to the barest minimum. Obviously he

was  mindful of the need to encourage  the  use  of

local products in place of imported goods. Although

it is often said that the Singapore consumer market

is  small, yet the Minister disclosed that about 60

per  cent of consumer expenditure leaves for places

abroad.  That  is, it is spent on  imported  goods.

This   means  that,  despite  spectacular   capital

investment in industry, ranging from $20 million in

1961  to $404 million in 1967, only 40 per cent  of

consumer   expenditure  has  been   captured.   It,

therefore, seems that there is still plenty of room

for  industrial expansion in consumer goods  alone.

But  in  order  that locally-manufactured  consumer

goods can capture the local market, it is necessary

that  our  local manufacturers should convince  the

public  that their goods are comparable in  quality

to imported goods and that they are cheaper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to stress that whereas

the  encouragement of local industry will  conserve

foreign   exchange  and  create   more   employment

opportunities, it is essential that prices be kept



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



as   low  as  possible.  The  profit  margins  of

industrialists  should be closely examined  by  the

Minister.  I am aware that investors in  industries

expect the best returns from their investments, but

unless  their profit margins are kept to reasonable

proportions, the cost of living will go up and  all

our  efforts in encouraging local industries  would

seem to benefit only the factory owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance on 16th April, 1968,

disclosed  his plans to develop economic growth  in

four  main  fields,  namely,  the  entrepot  trade,

tourism, shipping and the manufacturing industries.

His  study of the tourist trade is most commendable

and  I  wish  him every success in his  attempt  to

establish Singapore in the Pacific tourist circuit.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, there are two types of  tourists

coming  into  Singapore. One type is  the  American

soldier from the Vietnam war theatre. He comes here

to rest. For him a comfortable hotel, good food and

good  recreational facilities would be all that  he

would  ask  for.  The  other type  is  the  average

tourist who comes here for sight-seeing. I am aware

that  the  Tourist Promotion Board has a  fleet  of

sight-seeing  buses to take tourists  on  conducted

tours.  But  I would like to know if the advantages

of  our multi-racial and multi-cultural society and

our natural vegetation, such as rubber plantations,

pineapple plantations and coconut plantations, have

been fully exploited and developed for sight-seeing

to  attract  foreign  tourists.  Promoting  tourism

abroad  is of no use, if, when a tourist  comes  to

Singapore, he finds nothing to see. Therefore,  the

Tourist  Promotion  Board should concentrate  their

efforts on promoting more attractive facilities  on

our island for the tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Hon.

Minister will take my remarks in good spirit, for I

was  indeed prompted by the Prime Minister  in  his

speech here on Monday to speak my mind. May I  once

again  endorse the Prime Minister's thanks  to  the

President for his speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  express my warm support basically  for  the

measures that this Government will implement in the

crucial years ahead, as outlined in the President's

Speech,  in  the  addendum to  the  speech  by  the

President,   and  in  the  Ministerial   broadcasts

entitled, indeed, "The Crucial Years".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also, however, enter some observations on

portions  of the documents referred to,  respectful

as  I  hope  I am of the President's injunction  to

speak  in  forthright terms. It is likely  that  my

comments   will  focus  themselves  on   particular

details  of implementation of Government's measures

in  respect of one or two Ministries, details which

may   have  already  suggested  themselves  to  the

officers of the Ministry concerned or the Ministers

themselves;  but I feel that certain problems  must

be  underlined  so  that the fullest  attention  is

given to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note, and I note with feelings of

congratulation,  that  in  education  one  of   the

targets  of  Government's  attention  will   be   a

reorganisation  of the secondary school  system  to

divert   a  much  larger  number  of  students   to

technical education and vocational training. It  is

hoped  that the selection of candidates, especially

for vocational training, will be on the basis of  a

scientific assessment of their potential  for  this

type  of  development. I make  this  point  because

customary  attitudes in the past have  resulted  in

drop-outs   from   the  academic   stream   finding

themselves  saddled with vocational training  as  a

rather  poor  and second choice. Such  outcome  has

been  somehow or other based on the dimly-conceived

assumption  that  if one is no good  for  a  white-collar  occupation, then why not give training  (or

so-called  training)  for  a  blue-collar   job   a

desperate bash?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the country needs in the field

of  vocational training, as much as in the field of

technical education, the optimum potential that  it

can  recruit,  not  pupils  who  will  enter  their

training tasks with a consciousness of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



their  having  failed  in  some  other  educational

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our factories and industrial workshops

manned  by  people assured of their capacities  and

confident of their skills - not by people  who  are

apologetic  about their academic short-comings.  It

is  hoped,  also, that the type of  training  given

will   be   sufficiently  flexible  to  allow   our

technical  workers and technicians to be  adaptable

to  quite certain scientific changes in the future.

Confident  as  I am of the far-sightedness  of  our

Government,  I am sure also that the creative  side

of the development of our workers will also be seen

to.  So  that  not only do we adapt technically  to

changes  imposed on us somewhat from  the  outside,

but   that   we   may  initiate  these  adaptations

ourselves for our own benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I express my view that the new direction of

emphasis  in  our  educational  policy  (from   the

academic to the technical-vocational) will  achieve

the  highly  desirable result of  largely  removing

from  our educational system the unpleasant feature

of  many  pupils  being,  in  the  final  analysis,

coached   for   failure   in   examinations.    The

diversification of our educational system  will,  I

hope,  provide  opportunity for pupils  of  varying

aptitudes  to develop those capabilities which  can

be  best  developed  to  the  satisfaction  of  the

individual and the welfare of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, it should also be hoped that

there  will be such qualitative improvement of  our

examinations   system  as  will   not   result   in

examinations being the principal, if neurotic, goal

of classroom endeavour. I remember reading a speech

several months ago by one of our Ministers who gave

it  as  his  opinion that certain subjects  in  the

curriculum   could   well  be  removed   from   the

compelling grip of the examination syndrome. In  my

opinion,  this is a most fruitful line of thinking.

Perhaps  we  could further exercise better  control

over  the effects of our examinations policy if  we

conducted all our examinations ourselves,  whenever

we have, at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



all, to conduct examinations. If we were to apply a

cost-benefit  analysis to the  suggestion  that  we

have our own school-leaving examinations system  in

the  English  stream, and if we were  to  take  all

factors  into  consideration (and  not  only  those

particularistic  factors  pertaining  to  immediate

financial     expenditure    and     administrative

convenience),  we  might find our own  examinations

system a more economic and educationally productive

proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of bilingualism in

schools,  I endorse the principle outlined  in  the

relevant  sections under the heading  "Ministry  of

Education",  of the Addendum to the Speech  by  the

President. I must emphasize, however, my view  that

knowledge  of  the principal medium of  instruction

must  be  carried  to  the  highest  standards   of

sophistication possible and desirable  in  relation

to   the  appropriate  levels  of  schooling.   For

example,  Sir, one of the reasons why many  of  our

English-educated youths are so hazardously  exposed

to  the fads and blandishments of the mass-media in

English  is  that their command of English  permits

them  only  to  respond to base  appeals  in  basic

English.  Many  of  such youths  are  not  able  to

assimilate  superior cultural  notions  that  could

come  through  the  English medium  simply  because

their  ability  to  use this  medium  is  just  not

adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of quality at all levels of

education,  may I suggest that every  encouragement

be  given  to  the  setting up  of  an  educational

research  organisation which,  while  it  is  in  a

responsible  way  sensitive to  the  needs  of  our

educational  situation, should  be  independent  of

administrative  control by civil  servants  in  the

education sector. May I hasten to add that I  have,

in  general, a profound regard for the professional

competence  of  our  educationists  who  are   also

administrative civil servants. And their  expertise

and   experience  would  be  valuable  in  research

projects.  But  their  resources  should  be   made

available  for  research purposes in  an  undivided

fashion,  and  they should not be  exposed  to  the

possibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



of bureaucratic considerations affecting the

direction of their research recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be feasible for our institutions of

tertiary   education  and  the  Teachers'  Training

College  to  be  jointly involved in this  research

enterprise,  by way of an Institute for Educational

Research, to which could be seconded officers  from

the  Ministry of Education and Ministry of  Science

and Technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Cabinet Committee will now exercise supervision

over  crucial  aspects  of  our  education  policy.

Whatever  the planning that is worked out,  I  must

say,  even at the risk of appearing trite, that  it

is  basically the teachers in our schools who  will

be  the  human operatives on whose performance  and

contribution will depend the success of  the  plan.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I wish to stress that I want  to

express  myself  as cautiously as possible,  but  I

must  say  that it is my belief that not enough  of

the  potential enthusiasm and zeal of teachers have

been  released towards the vigorous improvement  of

our educational system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When plans are laid, not enough of the opinion of

the  rank  and file has been solicited.  There  are

scarcely  any  devices  or procedures  whereby  the

feelings and views of those who are going  to  work

the   educational   system  are   sought.   Without

discussion   there   cannot  be   that   full   and

wholehearted  commitment, that  understanding  zeal

that  is  necessary  to galvanise  our  educational

system  into ever-ready responses to the  needs  of

our  society. Whenever decisions are made, whenever

plans  are  laid,  we  need more  than  a  resigned

acquiescence to these decisions and plans. We  need

the  participation of our teachers in the  thinking

out of our problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years I have had occasion to

receive   feedbacks  about  the  quality   of   our

teachers.  I  must  say that  where  those  of  our

teachers  are  concerned who  have  finished  their

training  and  have  had experience  enough  to  be

matured in the process of exposure to the joys  and

tribulations  of  teaching, they  are  adequate  in

their knowledge,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



competent  in  their practice (where  circumstances

allow  scope  for  pedagogical  application),   and

potentially   alert   to   the   possibilities   of

improvement.   In  other  words,  our   experienced

teachers   would  compare  favourably  with   their

counterparts in other societies which have  a  more

sophisticated educational set-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved remarkable progress in the

provision  of  educational  opportunities  for  our

children.   This   is   a   matter   for   profound

congratulation. I am sincere and I do not  wish  to

be  taken as being condescending in this matter. In

quantitative  terms the target has  been  achieved,

but  in  all  the tremendous drive to achieve  this

physical   triumph,  have  we  jettisoned   certain

important  psychological considerations  pertaining

to the need of teachers to feel that they are given

adequate   recognition  of  their   role   in   the

educational  progress  of  our  society?   Do   our

teachers feel mere cogs in the educational  machine

that  has  been  grinding out  more  schools,  more

laboratories,  more equipment, more students  even?

Are  they  just being fed and perhaps fed  up  with

directives  and  expected  to  respond   to   these

impersonal instructions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that in the near future we may

want  to  make further demands on our teachers,  in

the  national interest. Let our planners enter into

a  dialogue  with those who are going to  implement

plans.  When  an  idea,  for example,  strikes  our

planners   that  senior  members  of  the  teaching

profession  require civic or political orientation,

do  not let these teachers be gathered indoors  and

lectured to for hours with little respite, and with

even  less  respect  for the  fact  that  they  are

teachers  who  have  been taught  to  make  lessons

interesting and pupil-centred - and here  they  are

in a situation where scant consideration is paid to

basic canons of teaching practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wish to change attitudes, then we must have

discussion. Exhortation, purely and simply as such,

is  going out of fashion even from the pulpit. Over

the  past two or three decades especially,  studies

in social psychology have very plausibly and, to my

mind, quite conclusively indicated that when people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



participate in discussion, they are more  ready  to

change  their behaviour when they move out of  this

discussion   context  than  when  the  channel   of

communication  has been a one-way process.  Because

also  in  a  discussion context,  people  have  the

opportunity  for  their human  worth  to  be  given

recognition.  Therefore,  I  say,   Sir,   let   us

structure devices and generate the mood and  style,

as   a  result  of  which  our  teachers  can  have

opportunity  for  discussion among themselves,  and

transmit  thoughtful proposals to  our  educational

planners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned what I consider to be

the   necessity  for  an  independent   educational

research institute. It may be possible for there to

be   attached  to  this  institute  an  educational

liaison  council which would be responsible,  on  a

continuing  basis for the reception and  processing

of   memoranda,  which  could  ultimately  indicate

fruitful   lines   of  practical   and   productive

educational investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish all our citizens to be habituated to the

democratic  procedures  of  thoughtful  discussion,

wherein  respect  for  the opinions  and  potential

contribution   of  others  may  be  a   significant

feature. Why not act with our teachers who are  key

people  in the inculcation of healthy attitudes  in

our children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, measures should be taken to see

that  in  the classroom our pupils are  not  simply

being  made  recipients of information  from  their

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of education, perhaps not given

sufficient  consideration  in  the  past,  is   the

necessity to get our children to ask questions, and

not  simply lap up devotedly what the teacher  says

as   the   last  oracular  word.  That   discussion

techniques  seem  to  be notable  rather  by  their

absence from the educational scene has been brought

home  to  me  with some force on several occasions.

When  discussion  time comes up,  for  example,  in

adult  education classes, there is  a  vast  sticky

silence.  On  one occasion when I had a  chat  with

some senior teachers and I suggested to them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



that   perhaps   they   could   institute   certain

discussion  procedures  in their  classrooms,  they

agreed that it would be a good idea, but said  that

the  cultural  shock to their pupils  would  be  so

great  that they would not know how to handle their

classes after that!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now, Mr Speaker, carry the point I am

making   about   the   necessity   for   discussion

opportunities  a little further. I have  said  that

our  teachers need discussion opportunities and our

pupils  need discussion opportunities. I would  say

that our citizens need discussion situations to  be

structured for them. We read in the Addendum to the

President's Speech, under the heading "Ministry  of

Culture":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To get our people better prepared and to

participate  more  in the immense  national  effort

required in the crucial years ahead, the mass media

of  Radio,  Television  and  publications  will  be

improved and expanded.'



<br><br>It  is intended that our mass media "will not  only

inform,   entertain  and  educate  but  will   also

stimulate patriotism, public-spiritedness  and  the

importance of increased productivity."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that an important ancillary to

propaganda  through the mass media  -  and  I  must

stress that I am using the term "propaganda" in its

neutral  sense, without any pejorative implications

-  is adult education. In conjunction with the mass

media,  listening  and  viewing  groups  could   be

encouraged  in  our  community  centres,   in   the

premises of voluntary organisations, in schools  in

respect of teacher-parent gatherings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other aspects of systematic public education

could  also  be encouraged. Sir, we are inculcating

in  our  children in schools various attitudes  and

mores  which we feel will help our national effort.

At  the  same time, many children get little social

reinforcement of these attitudes in  the  home.  We

want  our  children  to exercise  wisdom  in  their

vocational  choice.  Yet parents  with  traditional

views    may   insist   on   their   own   outmoded

predilections. I hope the following may not be  too

trivial  an  anecdote  for  the  House,  but  in  a

conversation with a school's dental officer, I  was

told



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



that  while our dentists are teaching our  children

healthy  care of their teeth, some parents  do  not

provide    their   children   with   tooth-brushes.

[Laughter]. I am not intending to strike a note  of

levity, Mr Speaker, Sir, because I notice that  in

the  section  devoted  to  "Health",  there  is   a

paragraph  referring to dental  care.  This  little

anecdote which I related just now has some  bearing

on what we intend to do. While we urge our children

to  help  to  make our city beautiful,  these  same

children  may be living in circumstances which  are

far from being aesthetic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is highly desirable, to my mind, that

continuing educational opportunity be afforded  the

parents  of  our  children so that any  discordance

between home and school may be eliminated; not only

this,  but  that indeed an understanding of  public

issues may be generated. In order to achieve  this,

more  devices must be resorted to, besides the mass

media.  I would like to enter a mild caveat against

exaggerating the effectiveness of the mass media as

a   means  of  communicating  a  specific  message,

especially in the circumstances of a free and  open

society like ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher will be able to say that at any

juncture of a teaching activity, it may not be  the

information  that he is trying to impart  which  is

percolating  through.  The  pupils  may   be   more

interested in distracting background items, such as

the  way he dresses or the unerased diagram on  the

blackboard.  In  the case of the mass  media  also,

full  attention is not guaranteed, and  it  may  be

that  other features are coming across besides  the

intrinsic information that it is desired to convey.

Where any medium of communication is concerned,  it

is the whole medium that is the message.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult education, therefore, has to come to the

aid  of  the mass media to stimulate awareness  and

committed concern for our problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to see from the experience and history

of  other  countries how adult education  has  been

brought to the service of national construction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, for example, adult education as a

national  movement  for the  education  of  workers

contributed  towards the redressing of  balance  of

national  and  political  influence  in  favour  of

workers.  In  Denmark, the folk high  schools  were

created  (and I am quoting learned authority)  "for

the  express  purpose  of refashioning  a  national

culture". In the Soviet Union adult education  (and

I quote again):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`has served as an instrument of State policy

directed  at  producing loyalty to  the  state  and

developing   technical  competencies  required   by

national plans.'



<br><br>In  the  process of changing China, adult education

has   had  two  functions,  namely  (and  I   quote

different authority now):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) breaking down the class barrier and

fostering the union of workers and peasants and the

patriotic intelligentsia, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) contributing to the construction of the new

China.'



<br><br>Chou  En-lai  has  himself  issued  "Directives  on

Increasing Peasants' Spare-Time Education".  Israel

is   also  an  outstanding  example  of  how  adult

education,  in the Kibbutzim, in the Histadrut  and

in  the  universities, has contributed to  national

development. Mr Speaker, Sir, the lesson is  quite

clear  that  whatever the hue and complexion  adult

education has assumed in other countries, different

national  and social circumstances have  thrown  up

peculiar,  specific and indigenous adult  education

responses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own adult education scene has also been

characterised by a gratifying ebullience, but  more

imaginative  forms  should  be  encouraged  by  the

Government towards striking roots more deeply among

the  masses of our people. Remembering,  too,  that

the better educated our people are, the more firmly

we  can  make assurance doubly sure of our survival

in the crucial years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude, Sir - probably much to the

gratification  of  hon. Members -by  expressing  my

particular  endorsement  of  the  various   details

related  to education in its different aspects,  in

several places in the Addendum to the speech by the

President.  I  was happy to read the paragraphs  on

training in the section devoted to the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



Labour.  The  Ministry  of Culture's  statement  is

welcome  that "an appreciation for dancing,  music,

art   and   other  cultural  activities   will   be

assiduously encouraged". May I suggest  that  there

be  not  only presentation of cultural  forms,  but

that  explanation of their meaning and significance

be also entered into more extensively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note also that "the Museum which

will  now  come under the Ministry of  Science  and

Technology  will  be  modernised  to  serve  as  an

educational centre displaying in vivid  manner  the

rich  political,  social and economic  history  not

only  of Singapore but of the whole region of which

we  are  the  fulcrum."  Up to  now  the  permanent

exhibition in the Museum seems to have taken on  an

aspect of immutability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, in this my maiden

speech,  express  my  respect  for  the  House  and

reiterate my support of Government.



<br><br>5.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the people in

Sembawang  Constituency, I fully support the  Prime

Minister's motion. The speech made by the President

in this House on the 6th of this month at 7 p.m, is

undoubtedly  historic.  It  is  a  very   important

document  for nation building. It clearly  outlines

the  three great objectives in our nation building,

namely,   the  building  of  an  effective  defence

capability  and  the promotion of greater  economic

growth    and    the   enhancement   of    national

consciousness,  in  order to overcome  the  various

problems  that  will confront us. These  objectives

clearly  show that the Government is determined  to

launch  out in the task of nation building  in  the

coming   five  years,  namely,  to  build  a   more

prosperous,   more  stable  and  more   progressive

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present our people attach

much   importance  to  the  problems  of   how   to

strengthen our national defence and how to speed up

tour economic growth. These are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



major issues affecting our national survival. If  a

country  is  weak in its defence and is not  always

prepared, then it will not be able to safeguard its

independence and sovereignty, because at the moment

we  are still in a predatory world and the ideal of

having  one world in the future, which is cherished

by all mankind, is still far ahead. Therefore, as a

newly-emergent country, in order to  safeguard  and

protect  our territorial integrity and sovereignty,

and  also to protect the right of survival  of  our

two million people, we have to build up our defence

force.   We   have  to  consolidate   our   defence

arrangements in order to achieve internal  security

and   defence  capability.  Sir,  we,  of   course,

understand that since we are a country of only  224

square  miles,  it is not possible to  spend  large

sums  of money and most of our resources on defence

expenditure.  If  we  do  so,  then  our  cultural,

educational and social welfare programmes  will  be

greatly   curtailed.   Therefore,   we   are    now

implementing national service which stipulates that

all  those citizens of 18 years of age will receive

two years' full-time training or part-time military

training.  Thus,  we  need maintain  only  a  small

regular  army  which would be responsible  for  our

major  defence  task. On the other  hand,  we  have

quite  a large reserve force which ordinarily would

carry   on   with  their  work  in  their   various

capacities.  But when there is an emergency,  these

well-trained reserves will receive instructions  to

regroup  and will be organised speedily  to  defend

our security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition to the organisation

of  our Army, we should also, at the same time, set

up an Air Force and a Navy to protect our air space

and  territorial  waters. On this  aspect,  let  me

quote  what the Prime Minister said on the occasion

of  the Military Officers Commissioning ceremony at

the  Istana Negara on 20th March. He said  that  in

the  next four years we must speedily build up  our

air  defence  capability jointly with Malaysia  and

other countries so that we may have a reliable  air

defence system and, at the same time, it should  be

one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



that can withstand any test and will live up to its

reputation. This shows that the Government is quite

determined to build up its air defence capability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we examine what we have achieved in our

military  build-up in the past two years  and  nine

months,  we can be proud of the fact that  we  have

not  only organised and trained military personnel,

but   we   have   also   achieved   good   results.

Furthermore, we have successfully built an  armoury

which is producing bullets, hand grenades and other

weapons.  This is a very good example of our  great

achievements in self-reliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of economic development, according

to  the analysis given by our Finance Minister, our

economic growth mainly depends on four sectors:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Import and export trade;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) tourism;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) shipping and communications;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) manufacturing industries.



<br><br>Ever  since we won our independence and became  our

own  masters,  we  have been  implementing  a  non-aligned  foreign policy and have also set  up  good

trading  relationships with  many  countries,  both

Communist  and non-Communist. Thus we have  greatly

increased our foreign trade. For instance, in  1967

our  foreign  trade amounted to $7,886,510,000,  an

increase of $440 million on the figure for 1966. At

present  many countries are trying to set up  trade

relationships with us. This is a good sign. If  the

commercial  and  industrial sectors can  co-operate

closely  with the Government to promote  our  trade

and  commerce, I believe that we will  be  able  to

increase our foreign trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of tourism, last year about 200,000

tourists came here. It would appear from this  that

the tourist trade has great hopes of expansion.  We

can now see many first-class hotels being built  to

receive tourists from other countries. I hope  that

in  future more consideration will be given to  the

allotment  of  expenditure to promote  tourism  and

that the Immigration Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



and   other  Government  departments  dealing  with

tourists  should accord them better facilities  and

extend them every courteous service. These are very

necessary conditions in promoting tourism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of shipping and communications, we

know  that  we are geographically at the centre  of

South-east Asia and also that we are at the  cross-roads  of  communication lines between  Europe  and

Asia.  Recently  we have seen much  development  in

this  field. According to statistics, there are  21

airlines operating regular flight services  through

Singapore. Last year 964,244 air passengers  passed

through  Singapore.  This  is  about  25  per  cent

increase over that of 1966. This is a great help to

our economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is even speedier development in the

manufacturing  industry. The Minister  for  Finance

has said that total investments in 1961 amounted to

$20,400,000.  But  in 1967 they  had  increased  to

$400,600,000, a twenty-fold increase. In 1961  only

330  persons  were  employed in  the  manufacturing

industry.  In  1967, 16,400 people  were  employed.

This  was  an  increase of 55  times  the  original

figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were at the initial stages of

industrialisation,   some  people   with   ulterior

motives   and   certain   reactionary   politicians

criticised and ridiculed us, saying that  we  would

surely  fail  in our industrialisation policy.  But

today,   seven  years  later,  we  are   witnessing

industrial   prosperity.  More  and  more   foreign

investments are flowing in constantly.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This not only earns us more foreign exchange but

also    provides    us   with    more    employment

opportunities. The success of our industrialisation

programme  shows  that if we  have  the  verve  and

determination,  any  sort  of  difficulty  can   be

overcome.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the various Government

departments.  There  is  one  matter  which  should

receive our attention, i.e., the Government has set

up  two  new  Ministries, namely, the  Ministry  of

Science   and   Technology  and  the  Ministry   of

Communications.  As  a matter of  fact,  these  two

Ministries are vitally necessary as they fulfil the

need  of  national  development.  The  Ministry  of

Science and Technology will have the function of co-ordinating  the  two Universities, the  Polytechnic

and  other  tertiary educational  institutes.  This

Ministry is now headed by Dr Toh Chin Chye, who is

concurrently the Vice-Chancellor of the  University

of Singapore. When the appointment was made, he won

the  acclaim of the academic world of the  Republic

and  the Press. I believe that under his leadership

the tertiary institutions in our Republic will make

greater  progress and more orderly improvement  and

that  more talented and capable nationals  will  be

trained for nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications will have the

stupendous  task of solving our traffic congestion.

According  to  statistics,  the  total  number   of

vehicles  last year was 578,855. Of these,  116,000

were  private  vehicles. With a population  of  two

million people, it means that there was one car for

every  four  persons.  On the other  hand,  traffic

congestion has also resulted in an increase of road

accidents. The 1966 statistics show that the number

of  people who died in road accidents was  251  and

the number who were severely injured was 1,646, the

number  slightly  injured was  7,576.  In  November

1967,  the  number  of  people  who  died  in  road

accidents was 207 and the number who were  severely

injured  was  1,575, while those who were  slightly

injured was 7,769. These figures are shocking.  The

Ministry of Communications, under the leadership of

Mr Yong Nyuk Lin, in conjunction with the Ministry

of  National  Development,  will  have  to  find  a

solution to our problem of traffic congestion so as

to reduce the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



number  of road accidents and to minimise the  loss

of lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to say some-thing about the

work of converting the Naval Base at Sembawang into

a commercial dockyard. According to the Addendum to

the President's Speech, the work of conversion will

be  carried out this year. As the representative of

Sembawang,  I have reason to be glad about  such  a

project,  because  it  will not  only  provide  job

opportunities  for more than 11,000  people  in  my

constituency and their families, but it  will  also

play  a  very  important  role  in  promoting   our

economic prosperity. As a matter of fact,  this  5-mile  long  Naval  Base is a  great  asset  to  our

country.  It  is the greatest naval  base  for  the

British  Empire. But as a result of the  change  in

circumstances, the British will be withdrawing  its

entire  forces  at the end of 1971  and  they  will

leave   behind  all  the  facilities   there.   The

Government  has  now decided to convert  the  Naval

Base   into   a   gigantic   commercial   dockyard.

Therefore,  after 1971 the Naval Base will  not  be

dead. On the contrary, it will be a busier and more

active dockyard and bring greater prosperity to our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me touch on education. From now

onwards  the  emphasis will be switched  over  from

academic education to technology and science so  as

to fulfil the need of industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been great improvement and

reforms in the fields of culture, health and social

welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the President's policy speech is a very

important  document because it  lays  down  correct

directions  in national construction for  the  next

five  years.  It will enable us to achieve  greater

prosperity.  With  political  stability,   economic

security  and other favourable factors for economic

expansion,  I  believe that if the people  and  the

Government can work closely together in the crucial

years  ahead,  they  will not  be  daunted  by  the

formidable challenges facing them. On the contrary,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



they will be able to surmount all difficulties  and

succeed in the great task of nation-building.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Sir, I wish to join

the  House in thanking the President for his speech

when  he  opened Parliament on Monday  evening.  In

spite  of  everything, the President had graciously

come  to  this  House  and  honoured  us  with  his

presence, and to state the Government's policy  for

the  crucial  years  ahead. He  has  correctly  and

succinctly diagnosed a possible malaise to which we

may  succumb in the next few years if we  are  less

robust  and less prepared. He charted a course  for

us  in  the  field  of  defence,  anticipating  the

British  withdrawal of their Armed Forces in  1971.

He  told us that we have very little time indeed to

build  up  our military muscles. He also warned  us

that  our  military muscles are built, and subsist,

on adequate economic health. Thus, unless we can in

the  next  few  years consolidate  and  expand  our

economic well-being, our security will rest on weak

ground.  In  order  that we have adequate  military

might  underpinned by adequate economic  resources,

the  President  informed us that we  will  have  to

galvanise  our people into a closely-knit  society,

each conscious of his own, his neighbour's and  the

collective  response of citizenship and nationhood.

Indeed,  living  as  we are a  comparatively  small

group  of two million people compressed in an  area

of 225 square miles, we can only survive, let alone

prosper,  if the people are absolutely  united  and

act  consciously  as  a  single  body  towards  the

national goal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Addendum to the President's Speech, various

Ministries  have outlined the programmes  by  which

they  anticipate  that the problems  posed  by  the

President will be adequately met and solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance has the task of not only

providing  the  economic  sinews  to  our  military

muscles   but   of  solving  the  more  fundamental

problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



of  economic expansion and the enhancement  of  the

economic  welfare of the population.  The  Minister

for Finance has correctly assessed the position  in

his  two  speeches  in  the series  of  Ministerial

broadcasts. The basic problem, of course,  is  that

we   have   right  now  a  grave  and   substantial

unemployment   problem.  This   problem   will   be

aggravated and magnified by the British pull-out in

1971. It is also aggravated by the annual output of

school-leavers seeking employment between  now  and

1971.  The  basic solution to this problem  is,  of

course,  a simple one of providing more jobs.  But,

as  is  usual,  simple answers to problems  require

complex methods to effect. The first difficulty  in

this  apparently simple solution  is  to  find  the

necessary funds for capital investment. The Finance

Minister  has proposed schemes for the mobilisation

of  both domestic and foreign capital. One  of  the

ways he proposes to mobilise domestic capital is to

increase Provident Fund contributions from both the

employee  and  the employer. Detailed workings  are

yet  to  be  announced. But at this  stage,  it  is

necessary to draw the attention of the Minister  to

grave  and  adverse repercussions if  the  detailed

workings are not adequately thought out.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.01 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, a good thing for an employee to

contribute more towards the Fund which will  either

yield  him better security in his old age  or  will

permit  him to own his house which, in view of  the

land  shortage  in Singapore, will  undoubtedly  in

time get an enhanced value. The difficulty here  is

to  draw a line separating those who can contribute

more  towards desirable objectives, and  those  who

have  to pay an additional levy which, however well

meant,   will   cause  immediate   and   unbearable

hardship.  I should, therefore, like to  appeal  to

the  Finance  Minister to give serious  thought  to

where  this  line  should  be  drawn.  It  is  also

undoubtedly a very good thing for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



employers to play their part in contributing to the

Fund which, as I have said earlier, will serve very

desirable  objectives. Here again,  the  difficulty

will be to determine whether there will or will not

be  a  class  of employees from whom any additional

levies may mean the difference between survival and

bankruptcy. Nobody in this House believes that  our

Finance Minister wants to mobilise capital even  at

the  expense of killing it. But it can well  happen

if  detailed  workings are not  adequately  thought

out. Arising from this, a further point is that  an

additional  levy on the employer for the  Provident

Fund  is,  in  fact,  a  statutory  rise  for   the

employee.  This means that the cost  of  production

will rise varying with the amount of labour content

in  the  product.  On the one  hand,  we  need  and

solicit both local and foreign investment.  On  the

other  hand,  we  are, as it were,  passing  a  law

compelling  higher wages. Whether the  higher  wage

cost  will  deter  investment  is  something  which

economic experts in the Finance Ministry will  have

to  work  out  with great care. Not  equipped  with

sufficient  data  to make my own analysis,  I  will

content  myself  by drawing the  attention  of  the

Minister to the possible adverse effects which this

highly commendable scheme may induce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour legislation is to be introduced, as it

were, to back up the economic policy of the Finance

Minister. It is intended that there shall  be  less

abuses  by  labour, higher labour productivity  and

longer working hours. As I have said earlier, it is

desirable  and  even commendable  for  us  to  gird

ourselves  for difficult times ahead. But,  at  the

same  time, it is not amiss here to sound a warning

that when trying to galvanise ourselves, we do  not

sacrifice  our human dignity and human  values.  We

have  to  bear this very much in mind  whenever  we

legislate  and we have also to convince our  people

that the measures we think are good for them do not

take  away  from them those human values  which  we

cherish.  For instance, when applying  the  uniform

rate of 44 working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



hours per week, a large number of people will  have

their working hours extended. It is true that  some

of  them  have  acquired the advantage  of  shorter

working  hours  not because our  society  or  their

employers can afford it, but because they  happened

to  be  in a union that was strong enough to secure

an  advantage over workers in other enterprises  or

in  other industries. Such people must be convinced

that  the  unpleasant medicine prescribed  will  be

good for them as well as for our whole society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the economic policies proposed by

the Finance Minister, I cannot help feeling that in

his proposals lie a depth and width of thought that

will  command  confidence. For instance,  for  some

considerable  time  in the past, vociferous  voices

were  heard  in Singapore on how our tourist  trade

could  be developed. There were proposals  to  have

gambling joints, striptease acts and the like.  The

thought  was  that if Singapore could provide  such

facilities,  tourists would flock to Singapore.  No

doubt,  the exotic and the unique may attract  some

tourists,  but in this field, we are in competition

with  places of high living scattered all over  the

world.  The  real  answer  to  attracting  tourists

really lies in what the Finance Minister has lately

proposed, and that is if only we can move the focal

point or turning point of air routes from Singapore

to  Bali which has all the natural attractions  for

tourists,  then  they  cannot  help  but  come   to

Singapore on their way to Bali. This, to  my  mind,

indicates very forcefully the depth of thinking and

true answer to the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I should like to refer briefly

to    the   Prime   Minister's   speech   when   he

congratulated you, Sir, on your election as Speaker

to   the   House.  He  referred  to  a  number   of

parliamentarians who have not experienced the rough

and tumble of elections, or the nasty intrigues  of

inter-party  warfare.  As  a  Backbencher  in  this

House,  I  should like to take this opportunity  of

assuring him that though we lack the battle  scars,

we have the intelligence, the will and the capacity

to learn from the old war-horses,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



albeit  in  a  second-hand  manner,  the  traumatic

experiences, of fights in the Thai boxing style, so

that if and when the situation demands, we will  be

no  less  prepared  than those who  have actually

fought.



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to express

my views in support of the Address of thanks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore is a small island and a young

nation, its population has progressive ideas and is

active  in all fields, especially in the  field  of

politics.  As  a  nation  practising  parliamentary

democracy, our Government is elected by the  people

who  will feel its rule for another five years. All

Government  planning  and  development  will  prove

whether the Government is sincere or insincere. The

people  will  then be able to judge when  the  time

comes  for  fresh  elections. The  victory  of  the

P.A.P, in the last elections proves that the people

are  confident that  the P.A.P, will discharge  its

responsibility to the people and lead the nation to

prosperity.  Prosperity will not come  about  until

the rural people's problems can be solved. In rural

areas   like   Geylang  Serai,   plans   for   road

improvements,  street lighting and drainage  cannot

be implemented if the sum allocated by the Projects

Committee  for  Geylang Serai is for only  $13,200.

This  sum  is inadequate to meet even the  cost  of

improving  one road. The Projects Committee  should

have  reviewed the minutes of meetings of the Urban

and  Rural  Services Committee in order to  improve

all  the  roads  in  Geylang Serai.  "The  Projects

Committee will then know how much it will  cost  to

improve  one  road  in Geylang Serai.  I  hope  the

Minister will investigate and review the allocation

for each project in Geylang Serai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to public cleansing, it is usually

found   that   workers  from  the   Public   Health

Department  are not giving satisfactory service  to

the public. In fact, some workers adopt an arrogant

attitude and do not work satisfactorily.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



Similarly, the anti-malarial workers do  not  spray

all  the drains. Most of the anti-malarial sprayers

were  given  to  children to be sold.  I  hope  the

Ministry  will investigate the matter  and  improve

the  working conditions of the workers for the sake

of  the  public.  I  believe and,  in  fact,  I  am

confident  that  this  matter can  be  successfully

dealt  with by the Ministry and that the people  of

Singapore,  whether they be in the rural  or  urban

areas, will enjoy prosperity in the future.



<br><br>6.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like, at the outset, to

express  my  appreciation  and  gratitude  to   the

President for delivering a policy speech laying out

his  Government's clear intention and dynamic plans

to ensure the nation's defence and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eve of a decade of government by the

People's Action Party, the people of Singapore find

themselves   politically  consolidated,  culturally

integrated, socially cohering, economically  sound,

innovating  for  continued  viability  and  further

development,  poised  to  withstand  the   economic

impact  of  the  British withdrawal  and  ready  to

surmount  the  problems that will arise  therefrom.

Problems  of  the  coming  decade  will  test   our

capacity  to  respond as a nation.  Some  of  these

problems,  putting  it  briefly  and  simply,  will

require our people to sacrifice within their  means

today  to  ensure a better life for their  children

tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am heartened by the

President's call to hon. Members of this  House  to

speak  in  forthright terms on the speech  and  the

Addendum  thereto, and without further  preamble  I

shall now begin to avail myself of the opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, irrevocably committed as we are to

industrialisation upon which our  economic  destiny

will   largely   depend,  the   Addendum   to   the

President's   Speech,  outlining  the  Government's

intention to refashion the secondary school  system

so  as  to  make  it  keep to  manpower  needs  and

employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



opportunities, is indeed reassuring.  The  placing,

by  an  education system, of about 21,000 Secondary

IV  students of 16 to 17 years, without the special

skills  or  knowledge required  by  industry,  must

cease  if  we  are  to bring about  the  industrial

acceleration which is required to help sustain  our

economy  in  the  difficult years ahead.  Secondary

schools must place in the employment market instead

that  number of craftsmen and technicians or  their

potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While crediting the Government for having made

the  proper evaluation of the human resources which

our    programme   for   economic   viability   and

development  require, I sense that  the  Government

contemplates  only  a  partial  and,  in  my  view,

insufficient committal of education to commerce and

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganisation of the secondary schools to

secure  a larger output of vocational and technical

skills  without  also  the  reorganisation  of  the

primary  schools  to  secure the  appropriate  bias

towards  commerce  and industry is  a  half-hearted

measure.  With deference to the thinking  that  has

produced these proposed changes, I see ourselves as

a commercial and industrial society committed to an

economic  destiny whose course is  charted  by  the

successes  or failures of commerce and industry  in

our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intended diversion of large numbers of

students  to  technical  education  and  vocational

training  should  be a diversion of  technical  and

vocational    potential.    This    entails     the

reorganisation of the primary schools as suggested,

so  that  at the point where diversion is intended,

preferences  and inclination for, and  ability  in,

technical  education  and vocational  training  are

reasonably definite and become evident by a process

of assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, diversion of academic potential, which is

the  end product of six years of primary education,

to  technical education and vocational training  is

short  of  what  is ideally correct.  Diversion  of

primary  school students to vocational training  as

it  is  being  done  today  must  cease.  It  is  a

diversion of primary school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



students  who  have  failed in the  primary  school

leaving  examination,  notoriously  abbreviated  as

P.S.L.E., and who are over-aged. It operates on the

inscrutable  theory  that the over-age  rejects  of

this  examination have an aptitude  for  vocational

training.  I  would  suggest  that  the  Government

consider   making  the  diversion  at   the   early

secondary school stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the creation of the Ministry of

Science   and   Technology  indeed  announces   the

Government's recognition of the indispensability of

science and technology in economic development  and

its  intention  to fashion our human  resources  to

serve  commerce  and  industry.  Planning  in  this

direction   calls   for   increasing   numbers   of

graduates, in science and engineering and  the  re-ordering  of  the  priorities in  learning  at  the

secondary  school  level to provide  the  necessary

mathematical  and  science  teaching  followed   by

technical    college   or   university    training.

Initially,  to  harness the human resources  for  a

sizable   impact  of  science  and  technology   on

economic  development, there must be a considerable

option  for science and technology on the  part  of

the  parents of the students. Effective  persuasion

to  achieve  this  option would be  the  increasing

demonstration and its advertisement of the prestige

that, this Government and commerce and industry are

prepared  to  accord to science and  technology  by

reflecting  the economic importance  of  scientists

and technologists in their salary structures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that the intended reform

in  examinations as stated in the Addendum  to  the

President's Speech will modify or abolish  in  toto

the Primary School Leaving Examination. As long  as

this examination becomes the arbiter of the destiny

of  the  Primary VI student, when its  computations

decide  that he is either' academically fitted  for

secondary  academic or technical education,  which,

as  he  understands  it, holds promise  of  gainful

employment  at  the end of it, or  that  he  is  an

academic  failure,  a reject or a  mere  vocational

probable,  with, as he understands it, an uncertain

future; and as long as this examination remains,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



the  kind  of examination it is, requiring  of  the

student   only  abundant  knowledge   without   the

facilities  of verbal and written expression  which

are   its  necessary  concomitants,  so  long  will

primary  school teaching be focused on  success  in

the  Primary  School  Leaving Examination,  at  the

expense of the development of the skills in verbal

and  written  expression which  are  the  requisite

mechanics of articulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secondary schools, teaching becomes

focused  on the need to pass the School Certificate

Examination.  The urgency of this  makes  secondary

school  teaching impatient of the need  to  develop

the skill to compose or to articulate orally or  in

writing  other  than the minimal ability  which  is

required   for  examination  purposes.   Only   the

brighter student excels on his own effort. The non-retention  policy by which the student  of  maximum

age for that class is promoted to the next grade at

the  end  of the year, despite his failure  in  the

terminal  examinations, progressively  worsens  his

inarticulateness  apart from his  overall  ability.

Sir,  this  is  a  decline which must  be  arrested

immediately. For one thing, if we are to  hope  for

the   emergence  of  a  responsible  and  effective

Opposition  as suggested by the Prime  Minister  in

his speech offering sound alternatives to help work

the  machine  of  parliamentary democracy  in  this

country, there must be opinion in our society,  and

the   initial  pre-requisite  to  opinion  is   the

articulateness of the knowledgeable  elite  of  the

populace.  In  addition, there must  be  a  climate

which  positively  encourages  the  expression   of

opinion. The elite in this country is a rich  human

resource  with considerable capacity to  contribute

to  the  nation  but  which  unfortunately  remains

intellectually unagitated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as suggested, the Primary School Leaving

Examination  may  be  suitably  modified  or   even

abolished  and  in  its place a  system  of  annual

assessment  set up. Perhaps the School  Certificate

Examination  may be broken up into  two  stages  so

that the secondary student



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



offers a number of subjects at the first sitting in

Secondary III and the other half in Secondary IV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg your indulgence if I descend into

these  details but I do so by way of commenting  on

the  policy  of the Government. This  would,  to  a

certain  extent,  dilute  the  examination  urgency

which   tends  to  pervade  the  secondary   school

atmosphere and make room for additional subjects in

the  time-table  also.  The  practical  problem  of

examination-paper  marking for the  Primary  School

Leaving Examination is recognised. Change is urged,

but   change  is  urged  without  sacrificing   the

efficiency  of  the system or the  teacher  through

sheer overloading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reform in the field of teacher-training and re-training is a necessary undertaking in the effort

to achieve qualitative improvement. This would also

be  the  necessary measure to take  in  conjunction

with  the  reorganisation of the secondary  schools

towards  an industrial re-orientation. It is  hoped

that  the  extent  of  the  intended  reform  would

include an examination of the basis of selection of

student  teachers  for  training  with  a  view  to

formulating  the basis which would in some  measure

ensure that student teachers selected thereby would

manifest,  or  contain a potential to manifest,  in

some   degree   the   natural   teaching   ability,

selflessness   and   the   dedication   which   the

profession  demands. I am given to understand  that

the  selection of student teachers for training  is

done  by  the  computations of  a  computer.  While

almost  every  student teacher with  the  necessary

academic    qualifications   can   instruct    upon

graduating from the Teachers' Training College, not

every graduate can teach. Teaching is a personal or

personalised  activity motivated by  considerations

of  concern, interest, professional pride  and  the

desire to give of oneself. All these considerations

may  be absent in academic qualifications no matter

how  impressive they may be. In this regard,  I  am

sure  that I am also voicing the sentiments  of  my

constituents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now, I have been wont to regard a

large number of our schools as hardly anything more

than   centres  of  instruction  and  teachers   as

instructors.  Qualitative improvement  in  teacher-training  and re-training, together with the  other

comprehensive  reforms intended,  would  eventually

restore  the  school and the teacher  in  place  of

centres of instruction and instructors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be pertinent for the Government to

consider  also  the desirability of  decentralising

certain  facets  of school supervision  and  school

administration, and to enhance the answerability of

the  school  head and his staff for all affairs  of

the  school.  This suggested trend may  succeed  in

achieving that total committal of the head  of  the

school  and  his staff to the school, its  prestige

and its overall performance which, in the course of

time, sets -the school tone and tradition. However,

achievement  in this direction is unlikely  if  the

frequency  of  the  transfer of  school  heads  and

teachers  from school to school is not  reduced  to

minimal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of qualitative improvement in

matters  educational is that of  a  research  body,

preferably  an  education research council.  It  is

significant instruction for those interested in edu

cation  that at this stage of education development

in our country the only research unit in the field,

as  I  understand it, is in the Teachers'  Training

College,  which  is  hardly satisfactory.  I  would

suggest the initiation of thinking in the direction

of  an  Education  Act  which would  incorporate  a

national   science  and  educational  policy,   the

structure  and administration of education  in  the

country,  and  which would set  up  an  independent

educational research council along the lines of the

research  council in the English Education  Act  of

1943.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of the Sports Division has been

timely.  The numerous sports bodies in the Republic

would expect the Sports Division or, in particular,

the  Sports  Promotion Office in  the  Division  to

formulate and execute a comprehensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



programme of sports promotion. It is  hoped

that this activity may be undertaken unobtrusively,

for  I  believe that the Sports Division, as it  is

constituted,  is  intended  to  function   in   co-ordination  with  the voluntary  effort  of  sports

bodies in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Stadium at Kallang when completed

will,  it  is  hoped,  be a, pride  to  all  sports

enthusiasts  in the Republic. And  I  am  sure  the

Division has plans for an Asian or Southeast  Asian

Games at the Stadium to inaugurate its opening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to physical education, if our school-leavers are intended to constitute the industrial

human  resource and a military potential  with  the

physical   stamina  and  ruggedness   which   these

occupations  demand,  then the  Physical  Education

Department  would require to take more manpower  in

order  to execute a programme of physical education

in  schools  with the necessary stress, vigour  and

continuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I only wish to say that I

support the motion before the House.



<br><br>6.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  the  President's Speech to  the  House  he  has

outlined  the objectives ahead which, to  my  mind,

are  a  logical sequence to the events taking place

during the past years. In -the past five years, one

of  the most significant developments has been  the

dynamic  outlook  of  our political  leadership  in

maintaining   and   improving  the   infrastructure

necessary  for greater economic growth. The  skill,

ingenuity and persistence demonstrated by those  in

office  in  the formulation of policies  have  been

matched   by   the   same  skill,   ingenuity   and

persistence of our people in -their response and in

the  implementation of such policies  both  in  the

public  and private sectors. Within a comparatively

short  span  of  time, we have achieved  what  many

sceptics  consider to be impossible in our  attempt

to  strengthen  and  diversify our  economy.  Today

Jurong is a thriving industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



estate of more than 50 factories. Our port and  air

travel  facilities are far more  superior  to  what

they  were  five years ago. What is  more,  we  are

already getting ready for -the container ships  and

the jumbo jets. Instead of higher wages and a wider

range  of  fringe benefits, our union leaders  have

taken to talking in terms of productivity. The pre-conditions,  both material and social  for  greater

economic growth, have thus been set.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking forward we have, however, no cause for

complacency. We have been warned of external forces

at  work  which  are  likely to  have  far-reaching

effects   and  repercussions  upon  our   sensitive

position,  politically and economically, and  which

will  render our tasks ahead more difficult. If  we

are  to  survive  and prosper, the dynamic  outlook

will have to be maintained and sustained. It is not

sufficient  that those in power alone  continue  to

provide  the  lead, as unless all  the  people  are

geared to a continuous process of adaptation  in  a

changing  world, we shall soon be left behind.  The

timely and welcome change in the attitudes of union

leaders has signified a healthier climate conducive

to  greater economic growth. It remains  for  these

attitudes to be applied and practised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to see that a comprehensive and

undoubtedly revolutionary Employment Bill  will  be

introduced  aimed  at increasing  productivity  and

promoting more industrial growth. However,  as  has

been  pointed Out by the hon. Member for  Bukit  Ho

Swee, productivity is the concern not only of those

who are managed but also of those who manage. It is

imperative, therefore, if the congenial  atmosphere

is  to  be maintained at all, management in general

should   equally  play  their  part.   Apart   from

developing more efficient management techniques and

expertise,  it  will be their duty to  ensure  that

appropriate incentives are devised and  offered  to

the  employees. Greater appreciation of life in and

around  Singapore is important,  and  it  would  be

disastrous for all concerned if employers  were  to

exploit the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, it occurs to me that as

the  major part of our national savings are in  the

hands  of  financial institutions, this  particular

sector,  although  by  the  very  nature  of  their

business must be international in their outlook and

operation,  should  perhaps  begin  to  divert  and

harness a greater part of the substantial wealth in

their  hands  to  the  more  pressing  needs   and

requirements  of the country, particularly  in  the

context   of  industrialisation.  These   financial

institutions  will  soon have -the  opportunity  of

demonstrating their patriotism or their support for

the  Government's policy by subscribing to the  new

and   attractive   Government  securities   to   be

introduced by the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In perusing the outlined policy of each of the

Ministries,  one cannot but sense the  cohesiveness

of  purpose in the planning. The overhauling of our

educational   system  with  greater   emphasis   on

technological   and   vocational   training,   the

expansion   and  improvements  proposed   for   our

transportation and communications, and the numerous

other  plans  envisaged by the  various  Ministries

will,  I  feel  sure,  jointly  contribute  to  the

economic well-being and security of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as a Member from a constituency

essentially  agrarian in nature, I  am  pleased  to

note  that particular emphasis will be laid by  the

Primary  Production Department of the  Ministry  of

National  Development on the promotion of intensive

and  diversified farming to make maximum use of our

limited  land  resources. I  will  watch  with  the

closest   interest  the  efforts   made   in   this

particular  direction  by  the  Primary  Production

Department, particularly in Jalan Kayu in the  next

five years.
