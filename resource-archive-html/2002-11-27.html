<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>SALE OF STATE LAND FOR DEVELOPMENT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Arthur Fong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  in  view  of  the  limited  residential  and

commercial  land  in Singapore, will he require  HDB  and

URA,  when inviting tenders from developers to  buy  land

for   development   in   built  up  residential   estates

particularly the HDB heartland, to consider the views  of

residents who will be affected by the development.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, State land sold through tender is

developed according to the Master Plan.  The Master  Plan

indicates the intended land use of all parcels  of  land.

In  preparing the Master Plan, the URA will,  as  far  as

possible,  ensure  that  the adjoining  developments  are

compatible   with   one   another.    Extensive    public

consultation is also carried out before the  Master  Plan

is finalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For major development proposals in HDB estates, the

HDB   will   also  brief  the  Advisors  and   grassroots

organisations  of  the  future  developments  within  the

estates.   For  example, the redevelopment  proposals  in

Clementi Town, which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>

include  new  developments within the  Town  Centre,  are

exhibited so that the public can express their views  and

provide feedback on these proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, there are mechanisms in place to

inform and consult the public on our plans.  However,  it

is  not  possible nor practical to consult  every  single

neighbour  or  stakeholder for  each  individual  project

before  development.   Where  we  do  consult  and  where

competing  interests and views are expressed, ultimately,

the  Government will have to make a decision on the final

land  use, taking into consideration the larger interests

of the community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, the redevelopment

of  towns  undertaken  by  the  HDB  is  communicated  to

residents.   What about for land that has  been  tendered

out to private developers, which the HDB might know about

its use?  Should the information  not be communicated  to

the residents who will be affected?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regardless

of  whether  it  is  for private or  public  development,

wherever  possible, the HDB will inform the Advisors  and

the  grassroots organisations of the impending use of the

land.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MEDISAVE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Arthur Fong</b> asked the Minister for Health if

the Government will consider allowing Medisave to pay for

the  hospitalisation  and delivery cost  for  the  fourth

child,  as  there  is  a growing number  of  Singaporeans

affected  by  the  current ruling, and falling  fertility

rate, which currently at 1.48, is among the lowest in the

world.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish  to  clarify  that  Medisave  is  primarily

intended  for  inpatient hospitalisation  expenses.   For

maternity purposes, Medisave may be used for the delivery

of a woman's first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>

three  children.   This  is in  line  with  the  national

population policy of encouraging couples to have three or

more  children only if they can afford it.   Couples  who

decide to have a fourth child or more must rely on  their

own  finances  rather than on Medisave  to  pay  for  the

delivery expenses.

<div align="center"><b>JUNIOR COLLEGE/UPPER SECONDARY EDUCATION</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of Debate on Question

[25th November, 2002].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House, having noted the Report of the

Junior  College  (JC)/Upper  Secondary  Education  Review

Committee  2002, contained in Paper Cmd. 8 of  2002,  (1)

supports the new JC curriculum which will better  develop

thinking,  communication  and other  process  skills  and

engage  students in greater breadth of learning; and  (2)

endorses greater diversity and opening of new pathways in

JC/Upper  Secondary education to cater to  the  different

strengths  and  interests of students.". - [Minister  for

Education].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, my

parliamentary  colleagues  in  the  last  two  days  have

debated  on  the  merits  and demerits  of  our  existing

education  system as well as the recommendations  in  the

proposed new model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among some of the pertinent points brought up in the

debate   were   concerns  with  implementation   of   the

recommendations, in particular, how can  we  ensure  that

teachers  are able to deliver effectively.  Other  points

pertain  to  the further stress that will  be  loaded  on

teachers,   parents   and   students   because   of   the

introduction  of new subjects as well as  the  danger  of

creating an elitist society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard through the debate, I am reminded of a

Sunday  school song that I used to sing and used to  feel

very troubled when singing it.  The lyrics of the song go

this way:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look all over the world,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes me,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look all over the world,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one exactly like me,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are short and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are tall,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But God loves them all.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to feel very troubled singing these lyrics

until one day, I ventured to ask my mother why is it that

"no one likes me", and that was when my mother gave me  a

lesson on the reality of the world that we are living in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me to put out my 10 fingers and to note

that  the  10 fingers are of different lengths  and  they

also  bear different  fingerprints.  However, each finger

is  unique  in  itself and they are all precious  to  our

Creator.   So, it was about being different and not about

being liked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going by this illustration, at home, our siblings

can  be  very different from one another, yet we are  all

loved  by our parents.  Extend that to the nation  state;

the  citizens are all different individuals, yet they are

all  loved by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of what NMP Dr Jennifer Lee has

mentioned  about  the 400,000 potential  workers  at  the

bottom rung of the ladder.  In fact, I would say that 75-80%  of  the  student cohort will not  benefit  from  the

revised  recommendations for the Upper Secondary  Schools

and the JCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotally, this is similar to putting nail polish

on  the  two middle fingernails.  When we hide  away  the

other  eight  fingers, the fingers with nail polish  look

very  pretty.  However, when you put up the  other  eight

fingers,  the  two middle fingers with nail  polish  that

happen  to  be the longer ones will stick out  like  sore

fingers  amongst  the other eight fingers  with  no  nail

polish.   This pair of hands will not look as  pretty  as

another pair of hands with nail polish on all the  finger

nails.  So, the way to close the gap between the top  20-25%  and  the other 75% is really to level up  the  lower

cohort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is where Dr Jennifer Lee's and

the  other MPs' point about the need to take care of  the

other  75%  or  so of the student cohort begs  attention,

lest  we  inadvertently cultivate students who feel  that

"no one likes me".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted the fact that resources are limited and that

it is only natural that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>

resources are allocated to investments that give the best

payoff, no one begrudges that we ought to concentrate our

resources on the top 20- 25% of our student cohort.  This

is  one way that we can ensure that our creme-de-la-creme

are  nurtured to continue to lead our nation and  economy

into the future.  Nonetheless, it is necessary that there

must be some leftovers for the other 75% or so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted that the schools cannot afford to give equal

resources  to  the  other 75% and  the  fact  that  going

forward,  our  economy depends also on the input  of  the

other 75%, how can MOE ensure that this 75% will be given

the opportunity for that life long learning?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by my parliamentary colleague, Assoc.

Prof.  Koo  Tsai Kee, education is a life  long  journey.

Preparing  our  students for the new society  requires  a

long-term plan where we will need to continually  educate

knowledge  workers.   This is because knowledge  workers,

unlike the traditional workers, no longer work with their

hands,  and knowledge gets obsolete very rapidly  because

it  is made irrelevant by advanced improvement in science

and technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, what the Ministry is doing in terms of

providing the foundation and fundamental training for the

general  cohort of our students is correct.   However,  I

would  like  to urge that the Ministry thinks beyond  the

schools to ensure that the majority of the product of its

system is given an opportunity to level itself up when it

is  in  the real working world.  In this way, this  lower

cohort   can  continue  to  contribute  to  the  economy,

although they may not be at the helm of leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I would like to compliment the Sub-Committee of the Economic Review Committee on Enhancing

Human  Capital.  The Sub-Committee has come up  with  two

very pertinent recommendations that I feel the MOE should

make a point to support, although I reckon that it is not

in  the  charter of the MOE to bother itself  with  adult

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the directions and long-term plan of

the MOE to churn out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>

knowledge workers of the economy cannot be formulated  in

an  ivory  tower.  The determinants of MOE's  policy  are

very much grounded in the working world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two recommendations of the Sub-Committee of the

ERC  on  Enhancing Human Capital make important reference

to  educating  and  nurturing our students  for  the  new

society.   We are aware that the new society  will  be  a

society populated by knowledge workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is unlike traditional skills, which change

very slowly.  To give an example, a museum near Barcelona

in  Spain  contains a vast number of hand tools  used  by

skilled  craftsmen  of the late Roman Empire,  which  any

craftsman  of  today would recognise immediately  because

they are very similar to the tools that are still in  use

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purpose of skill training, it is therefore

reasonable to assume that whatever that has been  learned

when  you  are  17 or 18 years of age would  last  for  a

lifetime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, knowledge becomes rapidly

obsolete  and  knowledge workers have to  regularly  come

back to school.  Continuing education of already educated

adults will become a big growth area in the future.   The

information  revolution  which already  has  an  enormous

impact  on  education  and  on  traditional  schools  and

universities will probably have an even greater effect on

the continuing education of knowledge workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the recommendation on stimulating creativity

and innovation by the ERC Sub-Committee.   I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our prime engines of growth will need to be fuelled

by  capabilities that are indigenous, knowledge-based and

services-oriented  with  a  greater  emphasis  on   value

creation,  innovation and international orientation.   We

need our organisations to be places that consciously  and

intentionally enable workers to be at their best and,  at

the  same  time,  build and expand their capabilities  to

become more productive, more resilient, able to tap their

creativity   and   initiative,  and   bring   forth   new

innovation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can our schools partner the corporate world for

this bigger game plan?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>

Here,  I would like to recommend that our schools partner

the  corporate world to develop a virtual creativity  and

innovation  centre.   The  whole  idea  is  to  encourage

students  to  upload their creative ideas  and  the  best

ideas could then be rewarded publicly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support perhaps could be given to the contributors

of these ideas through adoption by an interested company,

for  example.   Such initiative can  go  a  long  way  to

benefit  the other 75% of our student cohort.  To nurture

a  bigger  cohort  of  students  for  more  creative  and

innovative    contribution,    the    environment     and

infrastructure must be all-encompassing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second recommendation of the ERC Sub-Committee

on   Enhancing  Human  Capital  is  on  transforming  the

education institutes into suppliers of knowledge workers.

It  was stated in the recommendation that "we need to re-position schools and universities, so that in addition to

teaching  and  educating,  they  serve  as  creators   of

knowledge,   engines  of  innovation   and   cradles   of

enterprise".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, schools can explore the possibility of

tying  up with the corporate world to run a KBE-Readiness

Enhancement  Project,  which the objective  would  be  to

ensure   that  education  institutes  supply  operational

knowledge workers to the corporate world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a project, representatives of education

institutes  and  representatives of the  corporate  world

could  meet,  to assess which key knowledge,  skills  and

traits  the business organisations most urgently  require

of   their  employees  but  feel  are  not  yet  properly

encouraged/developed by the education sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties can then identify how the corporate

world  can most efficiently help the education sector  in

developing these knowledge, skills and traits, and  which

third  party may help with this project.  Such  help  can

actually  be  done  through lectures, provision  of  case

studies  and other materials, internships, exchanges  and

interviews.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the suggestions outlined so far attempt to

close a gap between the top 25% and the other 75% of  the

student cohort, which if left unattended, will only widen

the divide.  All that MOE needs to do to make this happen

is  to  take a more flexible approach in extending itself

beyond the schools and link up with the resources in  the

corporate world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the good and timely work put in by

the  Committee,  I  would like to  highlight  four  other

issues for review by MOE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area of concern which MPs have talked

about  pertains to having enough supply of teachers.   My

parliamentary   colleague,  Mr  Chew  Heng   Ching,   has

suggested  that we should look to taking in more  foreign

teachers.   I would propose that we also should  look  to

the  pool of retrenched executives who would be  able  to

take  on  a  second  career  as  teachers  because  their

commercial  and real life experiences will  put  them  in

good   stead   as   non-academic  character   development

programme specialists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education, RAdm Teo Chee Hean, has

stated  in  his  speech  at  the  Ministry  of  Education

Investiture  of the 2001 National Day Awards  in  January

2002  that one of the key challenges for the Ministry  of

Education in the years ahead is to continue to build high

quality teachers.  He had acknowledged that good teachers

are  the  foundation  of  a good education  system.   The

challenge, he said, was to ensure that we maintain a high

standard  of teaching profession even as the  profile  of

the teaching force changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 3,500 of our experienced teachers will be

retiring over the next five years.  This lot needs to  be

replaced.  With the revised syllabus, we know that  there

is an additional load on existing teachers and we need to

beef up the pool.   Besides, MOE also has to recruit more

teachers  in preparation for the larger student enrolment

at  the secondary and junior college levels over the next

few  years.  Student enrolment at this level is projected

to  increase by 25,000 from 220,000 today to  245,000  in

year 2006.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry was expected to recruit 3,000 new

teachers  for  the  recruitment cycle  which  started  in

August last year to July this year.  This recruitment was

supposed  to replace those who are retiring and  also  to

set  up  recruitment in advance for secondary school  and

junior college teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder to what extent the Ministry has met its

target.   We  are aware that, apart from the  traditional

source  of fresh graduates joining the teaching  service,

the  Ministry  has also been recruiting those  with  some

working experience as teachers.  This is very encouraging

and  opens a window of opportunity and hope for the  many

retrenched executives today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that the Ministry consider a conversion

programme that will put the professionals, executives and

managers  who have been retrenched through a non-academic

teaching diploma course within this 3-year window  before

2006.  This group of retrenched executives constitutes  a

fairly  high  percentage of the retrenched  employees  of

100,000 in Singapore today.  They can be converted to  be

economically active and gainfully employed again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may lament that the issue really is that we can

have such a scheme but there would be no takers.  Well, I

reckon  that in this aspect, we need to champion for  the

fruition  of  such a scheme and even launch campaigns  to

bring about awareness of a second career in teaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, perhaps the MOE could partner the National

Job  Task  Force  and other agencies  such  as  SPEC,  to

identify   suitable  candidates,  design  the  conversion

programme  for  character  development  and  deliver  the

programme.   Such  effort and new  opportunities  in  the

education  industry will give a boost to these retrenched

executives  who  will be able to find hope  in  a  second

career in this industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern has to do with the

broader  range  of subjects that students are  now  faced

with and would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>

have  to make a choice.  Independent counsellors  may  be

needed  because of the much wider choices to be  made  by

students in the Integrated Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students have had little experience of free and

wide  choice.  So far, they have been channelled  through

the whole education system almost totally on the basis of

their  various  scores.  They and their parents  are  not

ready  for  freedom  of  choice to  this  extent.   These

independent  counsellors could be  trained  up  from  the

ranks   and   file   of  the  retrenched   professionals,

executives and managers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third area of review, I would advocate that

we  integrate  project work into the  real  life  working

environment.   As  project work gives an opportunity  for

nurturing  EQ  and  character  development,  as  well  as

leadership,  we  ought to think in  terms  of  internship

during school vacation for students in the working world.

Therefore,  arrangement  should  be  made  to   encourage

employers,  as good corporate citizens, to  help  nurture

the   future   manpower  of  Singapore  by   being   more

forthcoming in their internship programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, experience has shown that if there is no

proper  monitoring of this type of programme, very  often

these   interns  end  up  as  mere  hands  and  legs   in

organisations.  This is really a waste because  it  would

not  provide  these students with the necessary  learning

that they are looking for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, it would be good for MOE to think

in  terms  of how they can work out a suitable  programme

with  employers  to  enhance  some  of  these  internship

programmes for project work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth issue I would like to raise is that the

Review  Committee's  proposal is not  clear  as  to  what

percentage  of  the  learning will be  on  nurturing  the

student in the EQ and character development aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of EQ, besides the innate characteristic

of an individual, I believe a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>

certain  amount  of nurturing and exposure  can  actually

create   awareness  in  an  individual  to  realise   and

understand the importance of developing strengths in this

area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal has recommended that one way to do it

is  to  allow  the nurturing of these characteristics  to

reside in the non-academic area.  It would appear  to  me

that  a  paradoxical situation could arise  for  a  young

teenager  in  the  JC because he would  be  torn  between

focusing his energy in the academic pursuits rather  than

striking   a  balance  simply  because  the  non-academic

pursuits  may not be given equal weightage  in  terms  of

measurement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fine provided that there is a campaign to

create  understanding and awareness amongst our teachers,

parents  and  students, that though not as measurable  as

the academic pursuits, the non-academic pursuits will  be

recorded as track record and experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due recognition for such pursuits should include

appropriate and meaningful proportionate weightage in the

admission  into  university programmes  as  well  as  for

appointments  in  their  careers.   It  is  necessary  to

establish a quantitative measure of non-academic  or  co-curricular work in order to incentivise pursuit  of  such

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the top universities like Yale, Harvard

and   the  other  Ivy  League  universities  place  great

emphasis  on students' co-curricular activities in  their

admission  criteria.   Of course, the  applicant  has  to

fulfil  the basic requirements but it is common knowledge

that the student's non-academic activities have important

weightage.    In  our  case,  the  university   admission

criterion states a bonus 5% on CCA, which for all the big

bang  on  promoting  non-academic  pursuits  as  in   the

recommendations, would be insignificantly effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with project work which encompasses a big

chunk  of  EQ quality and integrating skills,  would  MOE

consider increasing this aspect of learning and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>

development,  ie,  CCA and project work  to  15%  of  the

university  admission criterion?  This  is  approximately

equivalent  to the credits earned in one subject.   Since

much  time  is spent on such pursuits, we ought  to  give

some   credit  here  and  not  because  many  Singaporean

students  adopt  the attitude of "if you give  me  points

then I'll do it".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we know that in truth, there may be little sport

done  by these students for pure enjoyment.  CCA  is  not

imparting  mental strength in many of our  students.   It

does impart a scoring mentality.  This happens because we

have  yet  to  be able to deliver a system,  which  would

motivate students to pursue purely for the love of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating for a materialistic approach but

being   practical  about  things,  in  my  opinion,   the

idealistic philosophy of "I do it for the love of it" has

got  to be cultivated.  It takes time to do that, and  in

the  interest of time, let us begin by buying in as  many

as  possible,  with an approach that can win  big  scores

among Singaporeans.  Once we have achieved a culture  for

the   non-academic  pursuits,  we  can  then  throw  away

measurement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, co-curricular activities of a person are

given high weightings by multinationals corporations such

as  Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Mars Chocolates.  They have  a

value-add   contribution  in  determining  the   holistic

individual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I ask what should any system of

education set out to achieve?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent study conducted by Towers

Perrin,  the  attributes most sought after today  include

creativity, the ability to learn, versatility,  awareness

of  the  business  environment and the ability  to  think

beyond   functional   and  cultural  boundaries.    These

attributes  encompass a combination of knowledge,  skills

and  mindsets  or  attitude.   In  a  sense  this  model,

attitude, skills and knowledge, the ASK model,  gives  us

something  to  start with but we need to think  carefully

about how we go about to achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying philosophy of any competence-based

initiative is based on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>

the  perceived  need to help individuals  respond  to  an

environment, which is becoming increasingly  diverse  and

unpredictable.  The revised JC and upper secondary course

syllabus  should  incorporate a  competence  approach  to

development  and learning to learn for all and  not  just

the top 25%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should be looking at is a broader definition

of learning - one that is process orientated, integrated,

holistic  and ongoing for all.  And that also takes  into

account  the wider environment, as well as the  learner's

personality  traits.  I believe that the  recommendations

of  the  Review Committee would ultimately drive  towards

these objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry or the Committee to be

responsive  to suggestions for improvements made  and  to

initiate  a  whole  new discussion on the  implementation

follow up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I would like to support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank

you, Speaker, Sir, for letting me join in the debate.   I

rise  in  support of the motion and also to raise  a  few

concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the Education Review Committee's report on

the Upper Secondary/Junior College curriculum well-placed

in  wanting  to give students a breadth in  knowledge  as

well as depth in subjects that they hold dear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly excited by the subject 'Knowledge

and  Inquiry', seeing it as an opportunity  to  introduce

modules,  such  as  certain  aspects  of  university  101

courses,   such  as  anthropology,  sociology,   cultural

studies,  management skills, or perhaps  best  practices,

and mass communication skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am keen on this widening of the curriculum as long

as  long  as  it  holds  true to what  I  see  as  a  key

operational  phrase in the report - giving  students  the

"space  to pursue".  I think it is pivotal that  we  give

them the space and the time to learn, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>

redefine, to review, and the whole process repeats itself

again.   That is part of the initiative to which I  think

individuals can pick up those skills to become  confident

in  coming up with new ideas.  On a larger scale,  I  see

this  initiative as something that is very  important  to

our  society  because it is giving a  clear  signal  that

perhaps from maybe 2006, or from now on, we are placing a

larger emphasis on the value of learning, the process  of

learning,  rather than just the facts.  So I commend  and

congratulate  the Committee for coming  up  with  such  a

proposal.   It is going to take some time for  people  to

shift their gears into understanding what it all means at

the ground level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the concerns, primarily, I would have

been most comforted if the report had also engaged itself

on  the ranking scheme, the university admission criteria

and the appraisal scheme for teachers.  These have to  be

in  tandem  and  aligned with the outcomes  of  this  new

review  where  the curriculum is concerned.   If  we  are

expecting  our  students to perform  according  to  these

indicators,  whatever the outcomes be, then  likewise  we

should  be  following  that  through  with  an  appraisal

scheme,  whether it is appraised in schools,  whether  it

means  admitting students into university  or  appraising

teachers in tandem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just go back to an old issue that has come up

in  Parliament many, many times, in the media and,  I  am

sure,  in  many  feedback sessions -  the  great  ranking

scheme.   It  has  always been based on  pure  academics,

whether it is the value-added side, or whether it is just

the  schools  or  JCs, they are ranked according  to  the

academic achievements of the students.  Perhaps this  has

led to, at the ground level, a lot of us sacrificing what

is the learning process and going just for the score.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give an example. As a former teacher

trying  to  persuade students or coming to that  kind  of

conflict, whether I should persuade a student to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>

drop  Literature  because the grades are  not  there,  or

whether I should let the student continue, it is a  tough

scheme  to  be  up  against  the  system  that  does  not

encourage the breadth that we are right now seeking  when

we  are interested only in the scores.  So I am heartened

by  this  recommendation.  But I also  wish  the  ranking

scheme can be reviewed as part of that recommendation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to see, and this has been

suggested  before,  is the schools  and  junior  colleges

listed in alphabetical order with perhaps five stars  for

particular   strengths,  be  they  in   Sciences,   Moral

Education  or  whatever, and three stars  for  internship

programmes.   Such a resource library of information  for

parents  to choose and for students to choose  what  they

would  like to pursue will be a clear signal that we  are

giving to society as to what we are putting emphasis on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another side effect of the ranking scheme, at

present,  is  that a lot of polytechnic students  end  up

having remedial classes in additional Mathematics because

they  have  been encouraged to drop it,  or  it  was  not

offered.   So the breadth is important if we want  things

to happen according to this Review Committee's proposals.

And  ranking, in my opinion, is a stumbling block and can

also  subvert what the Ministry is trying to do.   So  it

becomes quite ironical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, university admission criteria. Changes are

already  happening and it is heartening.   However,  like

Mdm  Ho Geok Choo, I too wonder whether the project  work

could  have  a  higher  weightage,  and  the  'A'  levels

themselves, instead of 75%, should come down a bit lower.

The  interviews at universities should play an  important

role so that we can assess whether the student is capable

of whatever the outcome that we are trying to measure the

student for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, teachers' appraisals. It is common knowledge

that  teachers are appraised on the kind of results  that

they  bring back where their students are concerned.   It

is  quite  a  major criterion, talking  to  teachers  and

principals.  They do tell you that it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>

plays  a  part and, in some cases, a big part.  Appraisal

of  teachers  is then linked to performance  bonuses  and

teachers themselves are drawn into this scheme.  If we do

not  change the appraisal scheme, making it perhaps  even

an  open appraisal scheme whereby teachers and principals

negotiate  what  they mean by teaching a  student  to  be

creative,  what  they mean by teaching a  student  to  be

critical, these are intangibles in a lot of ways, how are

we  going to measure that and give due credit to teachers

so  that they do not get demoralised for the efforts that

they  put  in but can continue and buy in into what  this

recommendation is all about?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, for this aspect of what I am talking

about,  I  feel that I would have been most comforted  if

there is an assurance that these three areas are going to

be  in  sync, in tandem or aligned with what this  report

sets out to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the others, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Iswaran and Dr

Jennifer Lee, I too feel that, while tackling the top,  I

have  got  no quarrels with making the system better  for

the  top  25%.   I feel that it is equally  important  to

handle the lower primary.  I wish that, in the same  nine

months, this same Committee, or another, could look  into

reviewing the curriculum, etc, for pupils from Primary  1

to  Primary 3.  They are the years that really  give  the

child   the  fundamentals  in  language  skills  and   in

Arithmetic.   There  are  good programmes  like  LSP  and

ENABLE.   But still, where language skills are concerned,

for  the  demands that are coming up, can  we  equip  our

children  well enough?  So this has to be in tandem  too,

that we try and fix the lower primary classes as well  as

the  upper end.  So I am hoping that that too is  on  the

cards and will surface perhaps quite soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Minister of State, Dr Ng Eng Hen, and

also Minister Teo Chee Hean, on how we have come very far

and  how we have helped our students to come along.   90%

is a good, big average that we have looked after, as what

was  said,  and that a lot of our students now  are  well

equipped to converse in English.  This is laudable.  I do

feel that while it is a good place to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>

arrive at when we are in a global world with demands that

are  becoming  greater, we also have  to  relook  at  the

quality and think about, besides the numbers appearing at

'O'  levels  and the numbers who are passing through  the

language courses, the quality of our students.  One trend

that  I  personally  find disturbing  is  the  number  of

students  who  are  now ending in the  Normal  (Academic)

stream, not to say that that is a wrong stream.  But when

we  first started with small numbers, I think, today,  it

is  three  out of every eight students.  And it begs  the

question that, while we review and do better for the top,

offering choices, etc, should we not go further back  and

try  and  see  what  are  the  trends  where  quality  is

concerned?   So  I am hoping that the review  will  cover

that  because, like what was said before, fixing the  top

is  well  and good and needs to be done.  But  the  group

that  is  feeding  the top too needs to be  given  better

vitamins, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this whole issue on the importance of the mother

tongue, again, back at JC curriculum level, a lot of  our

students  have  become, through 10  years  of  education,

quite  well  emplaced in their proficiency  where  mother

tongue is concerned.  May I suggest that perhaps it is  a

better idea that we offer a second language, with not the

high  rigours  of a mother tongue at the JC  level,  that

makes  them  become  a  global  citizen,  whether  it  be

something for the region, or something across,  and  that

should  give them more language-based skills as  well  as

not  to  overload  them with the mother tongue  emphasis.

Likewise, the university admission criteria will have  to

be readjusted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Centralised Institutes. There are 1,063

students  who  attend the Centralised  Institutes.   They

have  a  good record of being able to send quite a number

of  their students to university.  My fear here is, under

the present 2006 curriculum that is supposed to come, can

our  students from these Centralised Institutes cope with

such high demands?  It might be a better idea to take the

lower  end of the junior college intake, perhaps  the  19

pointers and the 20 pointers, fill them with the students

from  the  Centralised Institutes and put  them  under  a

college

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>

programme whereby these efforts are intensified, and they

have a better chance of surviving the 'A' levels which we

all  know is going to get a bit more stressful, and  make

it  to  university.  Because, by 2006, in my opinion,  it

can be quite out of sync for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few concerns where implementation is

concerned.  One of them is the revised curriculum that is

to  be written.  I have some questions.  Who would be the

planners?   What  is  their expertise?   What  are  their

specialist  areas?  And what kind of  training?   On  the

training  of teachers, much has been said - Dr  Amy  Khor

has  spoken on it and I am echoing that - quite a  number

of  the teacher trainees, who now go through the National

Institute  of  Education,  are  students  who  have  come

through  this programme of being quite examination-smart.

How  are  we going to retrain them within the  next  four

years  such  that  we can open up their  minds  to  start

thinking more creatively and critically?  Could  we  have

some assurance on both the numbers as well as the quality

where teacher training is concerned?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue of the teachers and students, those

who are already in the classrooms right now, how are they

going  to  be  trained  where  the  training  hours   are

concerned,  because we have just got our first  group  of

'A'  level  students who are sitting for their 'A'  level

examination under the revised syllabus?  And the teachers

have  just  adjusted  to  the  revised  syllabus.   I  am

concerned  about  who is monitoring  this  and  how  will

teachers  cope  with  trying  to  vacillate  between  two

systems,  the  revised syllabus for  the  'A'  levels  at

present as well as the 2006 curriculum that is coming.  I

would  like  to hear some kind of a plan or programme  in

this aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wonderful to have specialised tools to cater

to  students who want to excel in sports, the arts,  etc.

But  I also wonder, if by this proposal, we are very keen

in opening the window and letting students come up with a

path  that  suits them best, why are we not  opening  the

sports school

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>

to  students  from the Normal (Academic)  stream  or  the

Normal (Technical) stream?  Such students will learn much

from  the  discipline  of sports to  excel  also  in  the

academic  curriculum with much help from such  a  school.

So  it  is a little bit beyond me to understand.  On  one

hand,  in  summary, there is this proposal, a  very  good

exciting  one, and yet there are these few things  around

this  proposal that can run the risk of subverting  these

good intentions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, such a proposal, to be successful - and I

personally  hope  that it will succeed -  cannot  act  in

isolation.   Society too needs to embrace this  proposal,

understand  what  it  means for  them  as  individuals  - parents,   students  or  teachers  -   and,   with   that

understanding, force themselves not to be over-eager, not

to  be so kiasu, as we normally call it, and to give this

a chance to breathe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I would say that sometimes our obsession

with  saving face and not wanting to make mistakes, as  a

cultural  norm  too, can thwart the progress  of  such  a

proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, this motion to

debate on the White Paper on education in the name of the

Minister  for Education, RAdm Teo Chee Hean,  has  caused

two  different  reactions.  On one level,  that  includes

most,  if  not  all  of  us  in this  House,  the  stated

intentions of the recommendations of the education  White

Paper are so positively constructed that no one can  find

fault  with.   On the other level, some Singaporeans  and

some  of our foreign friends overseas are befuddled  with

the  White  Paper.   They wonder  is  it  that  when  our

students   keep   coming   out  tops   at   international

mathematics and science tests, we are still not satisfied

and have to try and change it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I initially had some thoughts along these lines

too.   I  had  the  benefit of a local  education  in  my

formative  years and a good overseas tertiary  education.

When I returned from the US in 1988, I compared and found

our local curriculum too stacked up in terms of knowledge

acquisition.  My colleagues, who were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>

local   graduates,  were  extremely  competent   in   the

technical  aspects of their work and found it interesting

when   I   shared   with  them  the   US   system   where

undergraduates must take courses other than classes  that

are  required to satisfy the major that they are  taking.

Such   classes   include   Holistic   Medicine,   Speech,

Communication and Rhetoric.  I was also required to  take

courses  for  both  an  Arts and  Science  cluster  as  a

Business undergraduate.  Without the completion  of  such

university  requirements  of  the  clusters,  a  Business

undergraduate may not even get a degree, if the  Business

classes  are  completed.  The Arts  cluster  may  include

subjects like Social Psychology, German Language, Russian

Literature,  or Geography.  Examples of Science  clusters

include  Physics  of Light, Astronomy or Fluid  Dynamics.

This   gives  students  a  broader  knowledge  base  and,

certainly,   some  competence  in  participating   in   a

discourse that is outside their major field of study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a nagging thought that something needed fixing

then,  and  again thought to myself, our system  had  met

Singapore's national needs for the longest time.  So,  if

it  ain't  broke, don't fix it or, rather,  if  it  isn't

broken,  leave  it, to emphasise support  of  RAdm  Teo's

point  that we do have a good standard of English.  Also,

it  was a system that let me stay well above others at  a

good university in the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, then to now, a lot of water had gone under

the  bridge, to borrow the often-used phrase, "the  world

has  changed".  We are indeed in a very different  world.

Education reform has now become a global trend and is now

discussed   and   has   taken   centre-stage   at    many

international conferences.  Part of the reason  for  this

is  the  rapid and drastic socio-economic change that  is

taking  place on a global scale.  In an era of  increased

economic  competition, it is critical to have  a  trained

and  qualified workforce to support, sustain and  advance

the  scientific, technological and economic  capabilities

of our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education reform, as an integral part of a nation's

strategic policy, is not something new.  The US  and  the

UK have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>

promoted improving the quality of education as a means to

strengthen international competitiveness since the 1980s.

France   has  integrated  educational  reform  into   its

policies  for the development of the country.  China  has

been using the slogan "Invigorating China through Science

and  Education".  In Japan, two years ago the  government

has pledged to make educational reform the foundation  of

all social systems in this century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these countries, which are richer and better

endowed in terms of natural resources than us, are giving

such  a  high  priority to educational  reforms,  we  too

should look at how else we can build upon and improve our

system.   We  cannot  stand still.   In  resource-limited

Singapore, we not only cannot afford to stand still,  but

we  need  to run doubly fast.  I mentioned in one  of  my

speeches during the Budget debate earlier this year  that

Singapore  is  like  an  airplane  navigating   in   very

turbulent and difficult airspace.  I said that we  needed

to  snap on new engines that will take us through.  To do

that, we need to look at our education system so that  we

have the innovative ability to conceptualise to make  the

tools that will help us build that kind of engine to take

us through for years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the importance of education and

educational  reforms enjoys very high level support.   In

fact, almost every US President in the last 20 years  had

put   their   mark   on   improving   education   through

legislation.  We are no different in Singapore.  In 1997,

the  idea  of  "Thinking Schools,  Learning  Nation"  was

introduced.  In this regard, we have appended much of our

resources  to  the PRIME initiative.  From the  completed

PRIME  schools that I have visited, I must say,  even  at

this  middle  stage  of  the programme,  it  is  a  great

success.   Similarly, a lot of effort and  resources  had

been   put  into  getting  honest  and  useful  feedback,

practical  suggestions and to lay down these  suggestions

and  recommendations in the form of the  White  Paper  on

education.   This  will certainly  be  one  of  the  most

important blueprints in the remaking of Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that having a good education is an

important  factor, not the only, but certainly  a  strong

contributor  towards economic success in life.   This  is

especially  true  in  a meritocratic and  academic-driven

Singapore.   If you have good academic results,  you  are

almost certain of a good employment which, in turn, would

provide a good and comfortable life.  Thus, having a good

employment  is  a  motivating  factor  for  almost  every

Singaporean in their academic pursuit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the area of employment, the civil service

sends  the signal on what is important.  In most  of  the

senior positions in our civil service, the minimum  entry

requirement is at least an Honours (Second Upper).    For

a  student in Singapore, studying hard and aspiring to be

amply compensated, his or her work is cut out for him  or

her,  and the route to be taken clearly marked out.  They

will   be  singled-minded  and  study  to  sit  for   the

examination subjects that will count towards entering the

university, never mind that the intent of the White Paper

on education calls for a thinking person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many fields, compensation does drive

behaviour.   Am I going to spend much time in  other  co-curricular  activities, such as sports or music?   Maybe.

And  only  if I have some spare time left after  studying

the rest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the most important determinants that

drives   students'   performance   must   be   university

admission.   Since  the  White Paper  leaves  it  to  the

university/campus to decide on the weighting to be  given

to  co-curricular activities and, at the same time, calls

for  a  downgrading to a 15% SAT, the university/campuses

must  review  their  admission criteria  too.   It  would

appear  that when the recommendations of the White  Paper

come into play, the admission criteria would be outdated.

University admission criteria will have to be redrawn, in

line  with  the  proposed changes  in  the  White  Paper.

Perhaps, there will be another debate then.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation to allow for private schools is a

step  in  the right direction.  In the area of  knowledge

acquisition and the quest for wisdom, no one can claim to

have  the right of monopolistic hold on it, not the least

the Government.  It does not do any good to have only one

system  of  education  in a country.   The  existence  of

private schools would spur greater performance all round.

In  the  US, on a standardised achievement test, ie,  the

National  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress,  private

school  students  generally  perform  higher  than  their

public  school  counterparts.  We already  have  a  high-quality  public  school system.  Certainly,  the  private

schools  will also add to setting new benchmarks that  we

may  at  some stage consider for yet another White Paper.

I  would  urge  then for the Ministry to  govern  private

schools with a light hand and to let the market find  its

own level in terms of operations, pricing and curriculum.

The private schools will then play a value-added role  in

promoting Singapore as an education hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper calls for a reduction in the

teaching hours for the students to be reduced by 10%, but

with  an  increase in the intensity of the curriculum  of

25%.  I understand that the teaching staff in the schools

that  applied  for IP is ready to take on the  prescribed

load.   This is not surprising, considering those schools

such  as  the Raffles cluster and ACS(I) had  been  doing

their  IP-similar programmes for some years.  My fear  is

for  the  readiness of the teachers -  whom  some  of  my

parliamentary colleagues have talked about over the  last

two  days  - whether those who are expected to teach  the

increased intensity subjects as recommended in the  White

Paper,  although  at  a  reduced 1,300-1,700  hours,  are

prepared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that, presently, a secondary

school  teacher spends more than 50 hours on average  per

week on teaching and related activities.  In a year, they

spend   close  to  500  hours  on  non-teaching   related

activities, such as Sports Day or Speech Day.   I  wonder

if  we  had thought about over-stretching our teachers  a

little  bit  too  much.  The teachers  are  an  important

resource; in fact, very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>

important  in  achieving the goals set out in  the  White

Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is a key to having a competitive and

highly  qualified workforce.  One thing  is  certain:  as

sure as there are jobs that have vanished forever, it  is

also  correct  to say that there are jobs that  have  not

been  configured yet.  It is vital, then, to prepare  our

nation  and  our  people  with a  wide  exposure  through

education, so that the fit into tomorrow's job  evolution

is  possible.  I think this is very important,  where  we

can  add to the talent pool that is culturally connected,

especially for our leaders-to-be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Singaporean, I urge all to support this

initiative to ensure that we stay ahead of the curve,  in

order  that  we  may  survive  in  a  fast-changing   and

uncertain  world.  As a parent, I urge all to  understand

the  importance  of  these  changes  in  order  that  our

children may have an opportunity to enjoy a more  diverse

and broader education, and for our country's survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>1.25 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in

this  debate.  At the outset, let me declare that,  as  a

university  educator, I am very interested in the  motion

for obvious reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the Review Committee in the

White Paper, when implemented, will have a direct bearing

and   significant  impact  on  university  education   in

Singapore.   It will have major significance on  how  the

universities will carry out their mission, as well as  on

how university faculty members like myself will discharge

our  responsibilities.  I am therefore delighted to  rise

in support of the motion in principle and, like my fellow

parliamentarians who have spoken before me, wish  to  see

the  successful transformation of these and other changes

that  will  make JC and the diversified secondary  school

education truly meaningful and fulfilling for generations

of students to come.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to congratulate the Review

Committee  for  its  bold  views,  vision  and  ideas  to

transform  part of the education system.   In  any  major

change effort, there is always the danger that a gap will

emerge   between   policy  intention  and  implementation

action.   Hence, it is necessary, indeed vital, for  pro-active  consultation, feedback and revisions to occur  at

the  conceptual and planning stages, and not  wait  until

implementation  time before improvements  will  be  made.

Fortunately,  we  have heard many thoughtful  and  useful

comments  and ideas in this House on what can and  should

be  done to bridge or narrow the gap between system ideal

and  action realities.  It is in this spirit and with the

welcoming invitation of the Minister for Education that I

offer my take on the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said in the past two days, and I will

not   belabour  some  of  the  same  points  that  I  had

originally  thought of but which have since been  brought

up.   Some  of  my friends said that this  should  be  my

maiden  speech.  But I feel that actually I am  making  a

page-boy  speech, since I am only left with a little  bit

to  say,  so  as  not to repeat myself and  those  of  my

colleagues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I would like to touch on the bigger picture

about  our educational reforms.  The revision to  the  JC

curriculum  and the inclusion of the three new  types  of

secondary school structures are not all there is  to  the

educational reforms we need for our country.   They  form

but  part  of  the  bigger picture  called  the  learning

revolution,   in  which  active  learning  and   lifelong

education  are  the  key  words to  signal  the  type  of

education required in an innovation-driven and knowledge-based new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard, and sometimes robustly explained,

that   MOE  has  actually  been  overhauling  Singapore's

education  system over the years, the latest  being  this

set  of  recommendations.  As such, the Review  Committee

came up with this new JC curriculum, the additional types

of  secondary  education structures so as to  offer  more

choices  for students to receive an appropriate education

at a pace suited to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>

their learning abilities and aptitudes.  Clearly, this is

in   response   to  past  criticisms  about   our   rigid

educational structure and system.  Nor in my  mind  would

this  be the last of the series of major changes  to  our

education system. Given this background, Sir, I think  it

is  important that the public should understand where the

changes to the JC curriculum and secondary structures are

coming  from.  Unfortunately  - this is not the fault  of

the  Review  Committee - the White Paper did not  provide

this larger backdrop of how the proposed changes will fit

into the overall education system for Singapore.  That is

why  we have a lot of ideas that sometimes touch on areas

which  are  not fair for the Committee to have  commented

on.  I do not think that was in their terms of reference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to explain to the public, and even to

Members  of  this House, since we all may not  have  been

keeping up with all the changes.  Whenever we think about

education, we tend to recall what we had gone through and

use  that  as part of the reference point.   We  need  to

understand  what should be the overall educational  goals

for  the  whole  education system and  in  this,  I  even

include  the pre-schools and not just primary, secondary,

JC  or  tertiary institutions.  In the light of this  new

world  economic  order, we have to find out  whether  the

desired outcomes of education that MOE has spelt out some

years  back  do  need  revisiting and  updating  in  this

globalised  world.   I  would say  that,  whilst  we  are

mindful of the need to have thinking students, a learning

nation,  the  kind of education that we are striving  for

should  not  negate those earlier concerns we have  about

what a true education should be.  And I recall many, many

years  back, SM Lee mentioning that we can be a  literate

nation,  but  not necessarily an educated one.   I  think

that  also needs restating.  In this regard, I have three

main concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the education outcomes of this revamp on the

curriculum  and new secondary school structures.  We  are

trying to redress some of the over-emphasis

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>

we  have  on  rote learning so that now we  can  be  more

creative, we can be thinking more imaginatively, we would

have the means to be able to be adaptable and flexible in

the  new  workforce, and so on and so forth.  However,  I

would like to caution that in doing so, we do not go  for

form  over  substance as a result. We have heard  how  in

comparison  with overseas graduates, our local  graduates

are  good  in following or executing orders, that  is  we

have  content knowledge.  But we are not so good when  it

comes  to  the  showmanship, the ability to present,  the

ability  to  bring issues up, debate them, discuss  them,

and  so forth.  But I hope we can retain the best of both

because  we need both work horses as well as show horses.

So  it  is  important that students should be  given  the

opportunities in this new revamped curriculum to be  show

horses  but not at the expense of being able  to  do  the

work.  An example of some of the dangers we have of  form

over  substance  would  be, as my  colleague,  Dr  Maliki

mentioned yesterday, the danger of students wanting to be

spoon-fed  and not being original in their  answers.   In

fact, they just 'cut and paste' from the Internet.   They

plagiarised.  This is becoming an increasing concern  for

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we get them to be able to craft essays well

and  project work well?  So the communication skills  are

important.   But  I think some aspects of literature  and

the  humanities should also be grounded in  our  students

even  though  they  are  in the  Science  or  Mathematics

stream.   In  this  regard, having to  cross  disciplines

would be very welcoming.  But more importantly, Sir,  how

would  different groups of stakeholders  -  the  parents,

principals,  teachers,  students and  employers  and  the

public  at  large  - take to all these proposed  changes?

There would be differential impact among the stakeholders

here   for   the   different  types  of   recommendations

mentioned.   I  think  MOE needs to look  into  what  the

various  stakeholders would feel and understand in  terms

of the various recommendations.  The JC curriculum change

is  one;  having the through-train is another;  and  then

having specialised schools.  Probably, you will not  find

a uniform consensus on all the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>

changes.   It will differ.  I think we need to look  into

that.   For  instance, can there be room  for  more  life

skill subjects to be taught, to be incorporated into  the

new  curriculum  for  the JCs and the  various  secondary

school  structures?   Even though they  are  specialised,

private  or through-train, can we ensure that  they  form

part  of  an  all-rounded  education  -  life  skills  on

interpersonal     relationship    building,     effective

interpersonal   communication  skills,   problem-solving,

mediation,  negotiation, etc?  I know  that  elements  of

these are taught in the primary and secondary schools  at

different stages, but we should ensure that they continue

and, in fact, go on even to the universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said that we need to have a

mindset   change  for  us  to  comprehend  the   profound

implications  of  such  changes for  the  future  of  our

children.  In this regard, the changes that we see around

us,  the new global effect of terrorism, the need for  us

to  go regional and to go global, require us that we also

have  a  good  understanding  of  our  neighbours,  their

history,  their  literature,  their  culture.   In   this

regard,  some of these should be incorporated, especially

for those who are going on to JCs and universities.  Even

for those who do not, if we want to create entrepreneurs,

they  will  also  need to have a good  knowledge  of  the

market  conditions in the neighbouring countries and  the

world,  and these are subjected to social, political  and

economic forces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thread I would like to emphasise, and I

share  this with many of my parliamentary colleagues,  is

that  we  should  look at how, at the pre-primary  level,

kindergartens  and  child  care  centres  have   actually

incorporated project work.  If you look at  some  of  the

child   care   centres'   curriculum,   they   are   very

imaginative.  Can we continue to ensure that this kind of

active learning will not be stifled at the primary level?

In  this, I share the sentiments of my colleagues that we

should not just stop with the IP and JC changes.  We have

heard that it is easier to start at the JC level and  the

upper  secondary rather than to revamp all the way  since

we have resource constraints.  Nevertheless,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>

we  need  to build up our cadre of expertise, we need  to

have  the experience and we need to change mindsets  from

educationalists all the way down to the employers and the

public.   I would like to emphasise that we have  started

something that is needed, and it is something that we are

grappling with.  In some respects, we are going into  the

unknown  as to how we can transform our education  system

whereby  multiple intelligences would be  recognised  and

nurtured and not just focusing on a uni-dimension concept

of intelligence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, the "streaming" and

"stress"  issues that we have, in a way, with  all  these

changes going on, will force a rethink, hopefully in  the

parents'  minds  of  the misplaced importance  that  they

place on just academic achievements.  Hopefully, we  will

take pains to explain to the public how a common tool now

on  ranking  will no longer be relevant.   New  forms  of

ranking  will, in fact, take place.  How do you  evaluate

someone who comes through on a specialised school  system

or  a  private school and rank him lineally from  top  to

bottom?  Probably, you will have different categories and

we  will have to include efforts for project work and co-curricular activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably a way to force a crisis in the

parents' minds.  So they will say, "I need new guidance".

That  is  where the role of MOE  and the schools  becomes

very  important now. We have to take pains to  guide  the

parents   along.   We  need,  in  fact,   some   steering

committee, some coordination, a better network of schools

with  the grassroots bodies and the VWOs coming  in.   In

fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, I dare venture that even for  some

of  these new types of schools, a closer, more deliberate

attempt  to involve the community should be made  by  MOE

and the schools so that all these very useful suggestions

that we have made will not just end up as records for  us

to  look  through, but actually, where we  will  put  our

words  where  our mouth is and get us involved  with  the

schools  in making sure that some of those ideas that  we

champion could actually be realised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I realise that when we create a

more  thinking  population, it is a  double-edged  sword.

There  are  also other societal changes that we  must  be

prepared  to  put  up with because a  more  thinking  and

creative educated citizenry of the future might also mean

a  certain  amount of critical feedback and  action,  and

demand  for  more  individual  choice,  more  freedom  of

action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all part and parcel of fostering a climate

of  intelligently thinking citizens so that  even  though

there is divergent thinking, we have convergent interests

that will propel Singapore as a first-world nation and we

will  continue our stride, and we can take  our  rightful

place  in this new world order.  As Mr Chan Soo  Sen  has

mentioned  yesterday, there are many roads to  Rome.   In

this   set  of  recommendations,  we  are  allowing  some

students  to take the road less travelled. We  wish  them

well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although the 30 MPs before me have

touched  on most of the topics concerned, it is still  my

duty  to rise and address these changes, especially  from

the non-PAP perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I speak in support of this motion in principle.

Although more can and should be done to make education  a

learning  and enjoyable experience, the proposed  changes

are a good start and a good sign of more positive changes

to come, especially and hopefully for the lower secondary

and  primary  levels.   To that, I credit  the  Education

Ministry and the Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman and

his  Committee,  for taking the effort  to  identify  the

shortcomings  of  our  education  system  and  make   the

necessary  changes  to make learning  more  relevant  and

enjoyable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has built its reputation on an open

economy  and free trade. To that, let us work  towards  a

third  reputation,  and  that is "creative  spontaneity".

Senior

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>

Minister  Lee  had said that there is something  in  Hong

Kong  that  causes  it  to have  more  "buzz",  and  that

something  missing in our Singapore society  to  give  it

more   buzz   is  this  element  that  I  term  "creative

spontaneity".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to reduce the number of rules in our society

and  allow our citizens and our young to generate greater

spontaneity in their actions.  We also need to  free  the

minds of our young and give them lots of room to explore;

to  allow them to think out of the box and identify other

dimensions  and  angles to a problem.  That  is  creative

thinking  at work.  Together with the spontaneous  action

to experiment and try, it will create greater buzz as our

society  develops.  Our current education  system  churns

out   a   production  line  of  workers,   managers   and

instruction  takers.  This used to satisfy the  needs  of

our  industries  during our development  years,  but  not

anymore.   We have reached a First World economy  and  no

longer  in the league of those cheap manufacturing bases.

The   road   ahead  is  unclear  and  paved  with   stiff

competition.  Singapore businesses must compete on ideas,

innovation and originality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality and standards of our future workforce to

be churned out through our current education system is no

longer  going  to  be adequate.  We need  more  thinkers,

creators  and  innovators.  We do not  need  more  order-takers.   We  need them to be spontaneous and gung-ho  in

spirit  and  in  action.   We also  need  to  remove  the

standard  pathways for future generations.   As  what  Mr

Chan  Soo Sen said yesterday, there is more than one road

that  leads  to  Rome.  And the road less  travelled  may

bring  more  meaning  and fulfilment  to  life  than  the

congested  highways  that  every  graduate  seems  to  be

scrambling to get on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be clear also in the minds of the students

and  their  parents  that  having  a  degree  or  even  a

Government  scholarship may not be the best  career  path

for  them  anymore.  If they are that good, they  do  not

need  a  scholarship to chart a future for them.   To  be

very  successful,  they  may  even  need  to  follow  the

footsteps of Bill

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>

Gates   -   leave  school and follow their  dreams.   The

nature   of   careers  has  evolved  so   radically   and

dramatically that there is no longer one standard  career

pathway.   For example, a person can be very highly  paid

just by playing and testing computer games.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it also be clear in our young children's minds

and  their  parents' that they do not need  a  degree  or

scholarship  to  be successful in society  and  in  life.

What  they need is this ability to free their minds  from

the  standard pathways set by the Government and society,

and  take  the gung-ho spirit of "can-do, just-do-it  and

never-say-die" spirit.  It is no longer what  degrees  or

scholarships  you  have  that  are  important,  but  what

innovative  ideas  and patents you  own  that  make  your

future.  We need to be creative and to be spontaneous  at

that too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the proposed Junior College and Upper Secondary

education review is fully implemented across all schools,

I  hope this new cohort will be the generation that  will

bring  about  more buzz and vibrancy into our Singaporean

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I first mentioned in the debate on the

Budget Statement in May, there is a great need to develop

"thinking creativity" in our young.  We need to inculcate

the  inquisitive spirit in them.  They need to  learn  to

ask tough questions like "why" and "why not", and develop

the  courage  and tenacity to explore and  give  it  many

tries.   By  asking  "why", they  learn  to  explore  the

fundamental concerns surrounding that issue, and  develop

their  own justification that they will internalise  into

their  being.  So, questions asked by Senior Minister  of

State Dr Vivian Balakrishnan's son like, "Why must I  die

for  Singapore?" is highly relevant and important to  the

psychological and character development of the child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To survive and prosper in this knowledge economy, we

need  to  free  our minds.  The revised  JC  emphasis  on

thinking and communication skills is a good start, but it

is  not enough.  Like what Dr Jennifer Lee mentioned  the

day before, the Education Ministry needs to bring it all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>

the  way  down  to  pre-primary and primary  level.   The

children  in  the  schools need to be encouraged  to  ask

questions,  and tough questions too.  The  teachers  need

not  have  all the answers to these tough questions  like

"why"  or "why not".  But at the very least, the teachers

should  encourage these questions, and force the students

to  go home and think about it for the next few days, and

ask their parents or their friends.  We will be surprised

by  the  range of replies that could be thrown up by  the

children in their search for answers.  Participation  and

answers  with wit or originality should be given  greater

assessment credits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such processes will also build up the communicative

skills  in  our  young  children  to  communicate   their

thinking  and  ideas to the class and  authorities  in  a

benign  setting.   This will be the key to  their  future

success, and has to be done starting from primary  level.

It  will  be  too late to turn the engine of thinking  on

only when they reach the JC level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I see it now, if there is one skill that

international    talents   have   in    abundance    over

Singaporeans, it is their ability to talk their  way  out

and  argue convincingly.  Singaporeans are often  tongue-tied and stuck when confronted.  And this has nothing  to

do with genetics, mind you, but how we were brought up in

our education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When young, students are constantly told to shut up

and  do  not  make too much noise, nor to  ask  too  many

questions  in  class.   This suppression  has  become  so

strongly internalised in our young, so much so that  they

grow  up  learning to keep quiet and shut their mouth   - to the detriment of a creative society at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Ministry needs to break this bad

practice.  Stop stopping the asking of questions  by  our

children  in primary and lower secondary level.  Instead,

make  them  ask questions, and force them  to  think  and

search for their own answers.  Then, when they reach  the

upper   secondary  and  JC  level,  encourage   them   to

articulate it out and defend their answers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>

When  that is successfully done, there will be more  hope

for our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate greater interactions between

students and teachers, the class size needs to be cut.  A

big  class  is  useful  for the  one-way  impartation  of

knowledge.   However, it is not going to be effective  if

we  are  going  to encourage more speaking  up  and  more

interactions.  When classes are too big, there is no  way

a  teacher  can handle a class of 40 talkative  students.

The  only  way to control such a big class  is  to  order

everyone  to  keep quiet, and punish those that  do  not.

This  is  not  going  to  help in teaching  our  students

communicative skills later on in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a young age, the students will have

internalised  into their sub-conscious that  speaking  up

will  bring  about negative consequences and  punishment,

and  will  resist all attempts in speaking up.   This  is

operant  conditioning  at work.  The  Education  Ministry

needs to recognise this aspect and work hard to eradicate

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children and future leaders must be equipped

with the right thinking skills to reinvent themselves and

acquire specific work skills to stay relevant.  There  is

no  job security these days.  The fact is that, globally,

we  are  moving towards a free agent nation   -   towards

contract and self-employment.  Having a degree or even  a

scholarship is only useful for those who want an easy and

well-paved life, and may even be a psychological  barrier

towards greater personal achievement in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the second part

of  the  motion   -   having greater  diversity  and  the

opening  of  new  pathways  to  cater  to  the  different

strengths  of  students.  As several MPs before  me  have

raised,   there  is  concern  about  these  new  pathways

becoming another form of streaming and a higher  form  of

elitism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is room for genuine concern. While I

applaud  this move to open up more pathways, I  hope  the

new privately-run schools will not be a gathering place

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>

for the average sons of the rich, famous or connected.  I

hope the Ministry will put sufficient checks in place  to

ensure that only the top per cent in each cohort will  be

admitted   -  based on intelligence and academic ability,

and not on family backgrounds, links or contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, with the introduction of the Integrated

Programmes in selected schools, I expect greater emphasis

to  be  given  in  the area of co-curricular  activities,

values  upbringing,  character  building  and  leadership

training.   It is one thing to channel our best resources

to  train our brightest students for their future.  It is

another  when  the  desired outcomes of such  specialised

training  fail to deliver a future generation of  leaders

who   are  committed  to  Singapore,  and  improving  our

Singaporean society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a failure of our education system if we

are  to  train  our  best  and brightest  with  our  best

resources  only  to be told that they  are  going  to  be

quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion

for  the  weak  and the down; or that they  behave  in  a

snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to

their  peers and followers; or that the elites only  care

about  their  own  self-interests.   The  elites  in  our

society  must  appreciate the opportunity  and  resources

given to train and develop them, and seek to return  back

to  society  -  more than what they have taken  from  it.

This will be the way for our society to grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, values of integrity and character building

should be a key emphasis in these IP schools.  As it  is,

I   have  come  across  very  bright  scholars  and  very

brilliant individuals  -  the elite among their cohort  - who  lack the values of integrity and honesty; who behave

condescendingly  to  their peers and think  themselves  a

class above the rest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such is the end result of these Integrated

Programmes, we would have failed in our education process

and  as a society in teaching our young the values of our

society.  It is useless to train our students to  be  the

best  and  brightest in the world if these common  values

like patience,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>

kindness,  gentleness, compassion, integrity and  respect

for  others  are  not  internalised  into  the  character

building process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the Education

Ministry  in these proposed changes, I hope the Education

Ministry will also give greater emphasis to the character

building process of the individual.  Let us not  build  a

city  without  a  soul, nor develop a  person  without  a

strong character.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  the  motion  in the name  of  the  Minister  for

Education.  Let me start by making a few observations  on

the  process by which the recommendations of  the  Review

Committee were formed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a consultative process, drawing on a diverse

constituencies.   The  Review  Committee  itself  was   a

diverse one, with politicians like Ahmad Khalis, Chan Soo

Sen    and   myself,   educationists,   private    sector

entrepreneurs,   scientists and a few  senior  officials.

We  also  consulted  widely with parents  and  employers,

besides  educationists themselves, ie  the  teachers  and

principals in our schools.  The major directions that are

recommended in the Report were strongly supported amongst

all  these constituencies - the university academics, the

teachers in our schools, parents and employers.   It  was

not  a  situation where people outside the Ministry  were

challenging the MOE to change the system and the MOE  was

doing  the  defending.  I must say that my colleagues  in

the  Ministry  were  themselves amongst  the  boldest  of

vision  and  amongst the most anxious to get  ahead  with

changes  that will prepare our students well for  a  very

different future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a common recognition that the Singapore

system has strengths that we would not like to erode.  It

is  a  system that provides a rigorous education,  and  a

system  that  encourages  every  student,  regardless  of

ability and talent, to aim

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>

high and to work hard to achieve something more than what

he can achieve easily.  It is a system that stretches and

challenges every student, and that is a strength.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was also a common perception that our

past   and   current  achievements do not  assure  us  of

success  in a future that is going to be quite  different

from  what  we  are used to. We have to  change  to  stay

relevant to the shifting demands of an innovation  driven

era  and an environment that will, in one way or another,

place  an increasing premium on flexibility - flexibility

in  the  workplace, as well as the ability to  adjust  to

ensure that we remain a strong society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot say precisely how we have to prepare for

this  more  fluid innovation-driven future.   After  all,

there is no direct means of training innovation, there is

no  direct  means of producing flexibility.  There  is  a

certain  amount of buzz-words and catch-phrases  that  we

all use - you will find some of it in the Report, and  it

has been repeated in the debate.  And sometimes the catch-phrases assume a certain precision  in what we are trying

to do.  But there is no precision .  We know that we have

to  make  major shifts in direction, but  a  lot  of  the

substance and details will need to be worked out as we go

along, intelligently and carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have been struck by is the freshness and

boldness of perspective that we derived from everyone  we

have  consulted,  and in this debate itself. There  is  a

desire  to  push forward, make the major shifts  now,  so

that we can stay ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensity of the debate reflects the importance

which Singaporeans, and which Members of the House, place

on  education, for Singapore's future.  Education is  our

most   important   strategy  for   long   term   economic

competitiveness,  and it is our most  important  strategy

for  building a strong society.  But there is recognition

that  there  is no single formula for preparing  students

for  the  future,  no optimal path, no  golden  mean,  no

unique set of skills and talents that will secure our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>

future.  There is a recognition that we need more diverse

talents,  more diverse Singaporean talents, and  we  will

not get this unless we nurture, groom and train our young

along  diverse  paths, each no less  important  than  the

other.  And all Singaporean students, regardless of paths

they  go through, ending up Singaporean in character  and

in  spirit.  Or as Dr Ngiam says , we can have  divergent

thinking, but we must have convergent interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad directions have been well supported. But

at  the  heart  of the debate, we really  have  questions

about balance in education, in four respects.  First, the

balance  between depth and breadth of study, particularly

in  the  junior college years; second, a balance  between

structure and flexibility of choice; third, preserving  a

rigorous  and challenging education, without  overloading

our  students;  and  fourth, achieving  diversity  whilst

preserving  a  sense of commonality amongst Singaporeans.

These  are  inherent  tensions in education.  The  debate

reflects  these  tensions, and it  is  as  well  that  we

address these squarely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reached the stage of advancement where there

are  no easy models for us to borrow or  import.  We have

outgrown the UK system of "A" level education, and  there

is  no  new UK model that is satisfactory for us, or  any

other  foreign model that we can import and implant.   We

have  looked  carefully  at other  foreign  systems,  the

various  Baccalaureate systems, the US system  and  other

Asian  systems.  They all have their strengths  but  they

also have their weaknesses.  And they are all looking  to

reform their systems with the same considerations that we

have  - to prepare for a rather different future.  We can

learn  lessons from them as we go along, but we  have  to

chart our own destiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address some of the key issues of balance

that I have just mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, concerning the JC curriculum. The key issue

is one of depth as against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>

breadth.  It  is  a non-trivial issue.   There  is  broad

support  for greater breadth of learning amongst  our  JC

students.  We have been moving in that direction  at  the

universities,   we  have  a  fairly   broad   "O"   level

curriculum,  but as Ahmad Khalis said, there  is  a  coca

cola structure,  in which the JC education we provide  in

between  is  too highly specialised.  So there  is  broad

recognition  that we have to broaden out.   There  are  a

number of reasons why this  is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, of course, it is important for students who

are  going  to  be  citizens in a modern, knowledge-based

world  to  have a grounding in different areas, different

disciplines.   It is intrinsic to a good education.   And

as  Warren  Lee  pointed out, it  is  important  that  we

provide,  especially  for students from  less  privileged

homes,  this  ability to receive a broad exposure   which

they would not always receive very easily at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and this is a significant change in

environment,  it  is becoming more difficult  for  us  to

predict  the  type of specialisations  that  will  be  in

demand  in  future.   Job definitions are  changing  more

frequently,  people  are having  to  shift  careers  more

frequently.   Even our fresh graduates, if  you  look  at

recent years, our fresh graduates in various disciplines,

especially   the   engineering   disciplines,   a    very

substantial number move on to different vocations, either

the  moment they graduate, or within two or three  years.

So  early  specialisation  is not  helpful  in  preparing

ourselves for an environment where there will be frequent

change  in  specialisations,  continuous  change  in  the

nature of skills that are advantageous in the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and most importantly, the reason why we

need  a  broad  education is that we need to  expose  our

students  to  different  methods of  thinking,  different

methods  of  learning, different methods of training  the

mind.   A  breadth of education in the sciences  and  the

humanities  is  one way of achieving this.   The  present

situation is not optimal.  There are some details in  the

Report,  but  40%  of our "A" level candidature  do  only

Science and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>

Mathematics subjects.   Of course, they have got  General

Paper,  project work, mother tongue, on top of that,  but

as  far as the content  disciplines are concerned, 40% do

only   Science   and  Mathematics,  and   that   is   not

satisfactory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me address an alternative view, which has

been,  I think, quite well articulated by Prof. Low  Seow

Chay.  Prof.  Low's argument is that the  knowledge-based

economy needs individuals with specialised knowledge that

will give us an edge over others.  And the broadening  of

the  curriculum, he sees as lowering standards.  Lowering

standards where it counts.  His view is that the thinking

skills  that  we are talking about are best  achieved  by

changing  teaching methods and learning  methods,  rather

than  changing the specialised curriculum that  we  have.

It is a coherent view and  worth addressing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I agree that it is important to retain a

certain  depth of learning in core disciplines.  This  is

our  strength and we do not want to lose it.   We  should

not  lose  the  advantage of a strong grounding  in  core

disciplines.  It has held our students very well wherever

they   go  -  including  top  UK  universities,  top   US

universities.   But  the  present system  of  specialised

training  at  an  early  age  -  and  this  is  what  the

university  academics  and  those  who  are  involved  in

research   -  is not well geared to future  demands  even

within  the core disciplines.  In other words, if we  are

to  encourage innovation in the sciences and engineering,

for  instance, we need a broader education to begin with,

before  you  finally  go  on at the  graduate  and  post-graduate  stage  to  specialise.  This  is  an  important

shift.    The  British  have  been  a  little  later   in

recognising  this than the Americans, but they  are  also

now  moving in this direction. It is a  recognition  that

early specialisation is not necessarily the best route to

developing   the   innovative  abilities   and   research

abilities  required as you move up the  value  curve,  in

manufacturing or in services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the key question is: how do we best train

innovative  minds during the school and   junior  college

years?   Do  we  do  it  best by specialising  in  a  few

disciplines or by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>

exposing students to a range of disciplines?  And  I  ask

this   question  whilst  recognising,  of   course,   the

fundamental  truth,  that teaching methods  and  learning

methods  are  critical, whatever you study.  Whether  the

curriculum is specialised or broad, teaching methods will

be   critical, probably most important at the end of  the

day.  But it should not distract us from important issues

of  structure  in curriculum, within which  teaching  and

learning take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some depth is necessary because to train your mind,

whether  rigorous conceptual analysis, logical  thinking,

or innovative thinking, you have to study something to  a

certain  level  of  difficulty, whatever  it  is.   So  a

certain  level  of  depth in any subject,  in  your  core

discipline, is necessary in order to train your mind.  It

is also important to know some content.  Education is not

just  about  skills  as distinct from  content.   Without

content,  you  have a vacuum in which you would  find  it

very difficult to shape your skills.  That is why we have

chosen  not to import wholesale, features of some foreign

curriculum  systems  that  we looked  at,  including  the

International  Baccalaureate  and  in  large   part   the

American High School System,  which have the strength  of

providing  a  broad education but  are not  renowned  for

rigour   of   training,  particularly  in   Science   and

Mathematics.   Well  suited for some  students,  but  not

suited for all.  And in refashioning a JC curriculum  for

a  large 25% of cohort, you have got to make sure that it

has  features which meet the needs of the majority of  JC

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So depth is important and we do not want to dilute

it  too much.  But we are going to need more breadth  for

the  future than we have had in the past, to groom future

scientists, bankers, managers, anyone who wants to  be  a

good  specialist  eventually  will  be  advantaged  by  a

certain breadth of education early on.  We are no  longer

importing knowledge, but having to create knowledge.   We

are   moving  up  the  value  curve  -  innovating,   not

replicating.   It  would  require  an  ability  to   spot

opportunities, see connections and patterns in  disparate

events and phenomena, and make decisions in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>

situations of uncertainty and ambiguity.  None of this is

new,  but it will be much more present with us in  future

than  it  has  been  in the past.   And  it  will  be  an

advantage  hto have multiple perspectives, and habits  of

minds  that are shaped from having gone through  learning

in multiple discliplines .  We need many faceted minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip Yeo is right - to succeed as a biomedical

hub  we  need many more Masters and PhD graduates amongst

our  Singaporeans.   But the question  is:   what  should

their  earlier education look like?  What should   school

and  junior college education  be to best groom   Masters

and  PhD graduates of excellence in the sciences  or  any

other  field?  We cannot specialise too early if we  want

to  develop multiple frames and habits of mind  that  are

necessary to do well in an innovation-driven climate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, I accompanied Minister Teo Chee

Hean  to  the UK.  We were  studying how they are coping,

how  they are trying to reform their system to cope  with

similar demands of the future.  One of the people we  met

was  Prof.  Peter  Goddard, Master of St John's  College,

Cambridge, and Chairman of UCLES (University of Cambridge

Local  Examinations Syndicate). He was, by profession,  a

Professor of Theoretical Physics.  We asked him what were

the  attributes that he and his colleagues in  the  field

looked for at the  'A' level stage,  that they considered

important  in  grooming or in producing  future  research

scientists  in  the area of Physics.  He  thought  for  a

while - he did not give us a pat answer - and then  said,

first, Mathematics is important.  He wanted to make  sure

the  person is good at Mathematics and has learnt it with

a  certain  degree of rigour.  Second, he said  reasoning

skills,  an ability to think differently and to transcend

disciplines, to think outside the box.  So I  asked  him:

what   about  Physics?   My  question  was  really  about

training research scientists in Physics.  He said,  well,

it  is  optional, not strictly  necessary.  Helpful,  but

not really necessary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this illustrates the point - the importance

of  a  multi-disciplinary orientation to breed  reasoning

skills  and learning skills that are not uniform and  not

singular, a range of learning skills and thinking skills.

So  we have got to shift focus, broaden the curriculum in

order to develop these skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sciences and Mathematics provide very useful

training, as Prof. Low Seow Chay says, provide very  good

grounding   in   logical  thinking  and  in  experimental

method.  But it is not satisfactory that the majority  of

our  Science students at JC do not take humanities.   The

humanities,  by and large, are better placed at  training

an   ability  to  appreciate   ambiguity  and  deal  with

ambiguity.  There are no right answers in the humanities.

There  is  a range of possible interpretations  on  every

question.   Every  time, you read  the  Mahabharatha,  or

Dream of The Red Chamber, you get a different lesson  and

a different meaning.  Almost every economics question you

ask   does not have a deterministic answer.  There  is  a

range  of  possible answers and a  degree of uncertainty.

There  is  no  linear  fashion in which  monetary  policy

determines a certain rate of inflation or shapes economic

growth.  There is no one way to balance a budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to look at what the specialised

schools  in  Science and Mathematics abroad do  in  their

curriculum.   These are schools aimed at gearing  budding

scientists,  and  I  am referring here  to  schools  like

Thomas  Jefferson High School for Science and Technology,

in  the Washington DC area.  There is a similar school in

Illinois   and  you  have  got  Bronx  High,  Stuyvesant,

Brooklyn  Technical High in New York.  We have spoken  to

their  curriculum designers and they are  very  clear  in

their  minds  that they want to ensure that students  who

aim  to  be  budding scientists must have  a  breadth  of

learning  at that age.  Thomas Jefferson is  the  typical

case  of  a Science and Mathematics school.  They require

that  students  take  credits to the  advanced  level  in

Languages,   Social   Studies,  Fine  Arts,   Humanities.

Otherwise,   you  cannot  graduate.    Typically,   these

specialist schools

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>

will require that at least 20%, but usually more, of your

credits are in a contrasting area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise for schools of the Arts, there are a few

that you find internationally, and I visited one recently

in  San Francisco - broad curriculum, strong emphasis  on

Mathematics and Science, although it was a  School of the

Arts.   They  distinguish  themselves  from  the  average

school  by  putting  an added emphasis  on  the  area  of

specialisation  that  they were known  for,  often  going

beyond  regular  curriculum hours, and more  importantly,

adopting a different method of learning.  So the  Science

and Mathematics school adopts quite a different method of

learning in Science and Mathematics.  And the Arts school

likewise  - different ways of experimenting with methods,

different  activities  for the students  rather  than  an

altogether different curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think the proposed JC curriculum framework

achieves  the  right balance.  We have tried  to  take  a

holistic  view  of  how best we can develop  a  range  of

thinking  skills.  We have to broaden out,  but  we  must

avoid  a  shallow exploration of subjects that  does  not

develop  the  mind.  We need to study a few  subjects  in

some  depth  but  within  a stronger,  multi-disciplinary

orientation.  It is not just the core subjects that  will

achieve this. Project work, GP and the new Knowledge  and

Inquiry  subject  will  enhance  this  multi-disciplinary

orientation.  They will also enhance our ability to build

up communication skills amongst our JC students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, finally, training of conceptual thinking skills

has  to  take place across the curriculum, regardless  of

subject.    This  is  where  teaching  methods,  learning

methods  are quite important and changes in our  mode  of

assessment, which I will come to briefly later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so keen on some of the other suggestions

for  the types of disciplines we should introduce at  JC.

Ms Braema Mathiaparanam mentioned sociology, anthropology

and  a  range of others.  Mr Gan Kim Yong and some others

mentioned management studies.  These are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>

interesting subjects.  At the university level, there  is

usually  opportunity  to take an elective  or  option  in

these  subjects, if not to specialise  in  them.   But  I

think  we  should  keep  our  JC  curriculum  focused  on

fundamental  disciplines,   disciplines  where  you   can

develop conceptual thinking abilities as well as a  basic

appreciation of the core areas of knowledge, and then  go

on  from  there to specialise when you are in university.

I do not want to say this in a doctrinaire fashion.  But,

as a matter of priority and balance, I would say we stick

to the fundamental disciplines for now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the non-academic curriculum which

several  Members  have  spoken on quite  eloquently,  and

which   I   agree  on  completely.   CCA  and   Character

Development Programme (CDP) - we have not spelt it out at

great  length in the report.  But it is a very  important

component of the  broader and more rounded education that

we  would  like to see our JC students go  through.   Not

just  because  it provides you with the skills  to  be  a

useful  citizen,  or to raise a strong family,  but  also

because these are the life skills required to succeed  in

even  your career, in any endeavour.  Ms Indranee had  an

example  of an international law firm that looks  at  the

candidate's   CV to see what team sports he  has  played.

It  is  one  that  is replicated in many sectors  of  the

economy when you talk to firms that think hard about  how

they  select their people.  They will often look at  what

you  did  in CCA.  It may not always be team sports,  but

they  look at what you did to see whether you might  have

acquired instincts and habits that are different from the

rest.  So the non-academic curriculum is integral to  the

JC  education.  We make some recommendations as to how we

can  increase  emphasis  on it,  including  a  change  in

weighting at the university admission system.  But a  lot

will  depend  on  how  principals and  school  leadership

actually conduct their programmes in the school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the issue of structure versus flexibility of

curriculum.   We  have debated this  extensively  in  the

Review  Committee  and in the consultation  process:  how

much should we prescribe and how much we leave to choice,

especially in the JC

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>

curriculum?   Dr John Chen says, perhaps we should  leave

it to "moral suasion" rather than prescribe that you must

take a contrasting subject.  I do not agree with that.  I

think  we are quite clear that a broader education  is  a

necessity  and we should make that a requirement  of  the

curriculum.  But we should retain flexibility of choices.

Which  contrasting subject you take can be  left  to  the

student.   We  have decided, after extensive  discussion,

not   to   go   down  the  route  of  the   International

Baccalaureate, or the American High School system,  where

you are mandated to take a wide  breadth of subjects.  It

is  quite a noble aspiration, but it has some of the side

effects  I  mentioned earlier, a certain  shallowness  in

areas where you rather have more depth.  It does not play

to  Singapore's  strengths  and  what  we  need  for  the

foreseeable future.  So let us allow a range of options - provide students the flexibility of choice and give  them

these  three levels of subjects - H1, H2, H3  -  so  that

they can go for configurations that suit their individual

preferences and talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have the JCs offering more combinations of

subjects,  as  well,  more than they  have  done  in  the

pastThere are a fair number of combinations you will find

in  our junior colleges, both in Sciences and Humanities.

I  think it was Dr John Chen who said you cannot do  both

Literature and Biology.  It will be possible to  do  that

in  future.   But  it  is  not a situation  of  more  the

merrier.    It   is   important  that   students   choose

combinations  that are meaningful and that  expand  their

opportunities.   And as many Members  have  pointed  out,

schools  will need to engage in counselling  of  students

and  advise  on how they can choose subjects  that  match

their  talents,  match  their  interests  and  match  the

opportunities they could have in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, workload. This is an important and valid

issue that came up most frequently in the debate.  If you

want greater breadth while retaining a certain amount  of

depth in all disciplines, something has to give.  As many

have pointed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>

out, breadth is intrinsically a little more difficult for

the student to handle.  It requires more time on the part

of  the  student.  As Mr Cedric Foo has pointed out,  you

also  need  more  time to provide for  a  learner-centred

education.  It takes more time to learn independently and

in curious ways, as distinct from listening to a lecture.

As  Mr  Iswaran has also pointed out, you need some  down

time  in the system for students to reflect and to detect

inter-linkages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE agrees with this. We want to see what we can do

to reduce total curriculum load.  First, however, we will

also address  the JC calendar which has some inefficiency

built  into  it, a large amount of wastage in  the  first

three  months.  So we will implement a  system that  will

have   a  single  JC  intake,  therefore  reducing   that

inefficiency and expanding the length of the real  school

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the curriculum itself, we will have to prune the

size   of  each  subject,  prune  down  content,   whilst

retaining  the  rigour of learning that  is  entailed  in

learning  that subject.  It has to be a careful exercise,

which  MOE  will  do  in  close  consultation  with   the

universities, to make sure that our students continue  to

be well prepared for any discipline that they take in our

universities.  It is not a simple issue of chopping off a

subject  halfway and thinking that makes  for  a  lighter

load.  We have got to make sure that we avoid shallowness

of  treatment.   It probably means we have  fewer  topics

within a particular subject, but you still need to have a

certain depth of treatment of each topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are clear about our intention to reduce the

curriculum load.  We will work out the details  carefully

to  make  sure that we do not just end up with a  smaller

curriculum  load, but one that retains this rigour.   How

far  should we go?  The report says that from  330  hours

currently  per  subject, let us move down to  270  hours.

There  is no magic in the number.   But it is  a sensible

objective.   It  is  higher than what  the  International

Baccalaureate  would  have for a typical  subject,  or  a

typical US High School subject, but that is because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>

they take more courses.  They have a broader curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What perhaps is more important is the total amount

of  curriculum hours, and some Members have  pointed  out

that  we  may not be going far enough.  We are  expecting

that  total curriculum hours over the two years  will  be

between  1,300 and 1,700.  For the top end, for  students

who are currently doing four 'A' levels, particularly  in

Science subjects, there is a significant reduction.   For

those  who  are doing just  three 'A' levels, there  will

not  be  much reduction under this proposed system.   But

1,300 hours for these students is not an overstretch.  It

is  not an overload.  It is not significantly higher than

what   exists   in   the   UK,   or   the   International

Baccalaureate.  And if you speak to some educationists in

the  UK, they will tell you that their students are still

under-stretched, and they are concerned about it.  In the

US, although the minimum you will find in High School  is

typically between 1,300 and 1,400 hours, most of the best

schools  have a curriculum that is between the  range  of

1,500  and  1,700, not very different from  what  we  are

proposing.  So although Dr Wang Kai Yuen noted  that  our

proposal of 1,300-1,700 hours was higher than the  US,  I

should   clarify   that  that  refers  to   the   minimum

requirement in the US, rather than what the best  schools

provide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reduction, as I said, will be for students

who  take   more  subjects.  For them, they  will  see  a

significant reduction in curriculum time.  For those  who

take just three 'A's, they will not see much reduction or

any  reduction  at all.  But the problem is  not  one  of

overload of the curriculum for students taking three A's.

Some  of  them  may  find problems  with  the  curriculum

because  it  is an intellectually challenging curriculum.

But it is not one of curriculum overload as such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran is right that this is all about the front-end of curriculum time, and not what happens at the back-end or outside the formal curriculum - self-study,

research,  and  a lot of things students  do  to  try  to

improve their performance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>

and  how well they will do in their examinations.   There

is  not very much we can do directly to reshape how  much

students do outside of the curriculum, outside of what is

necessary.  And we are not unique in that respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a competitive system where parents and

students  see education as a path to future success.   We

are   still  a  society  in  momentum,  where  no   one's

background  pulls him back from a better future.   Social

mobility  is still there in the system, and that  is  the

source of competition.  And we have equipped students  to

compete, much better than we have done in the past  -  to

compete  at increasingly higher levels - so that at  each

level  that you look at, there are far more students  now

competing to get ahead than  used to be in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look around East Asia, we will find exactly

the  same  phenomenon.  If we look at China,  Taiwan  and

Korea, I would say there is more stress, more overload in

the  system.   These are the reports we  get.   Singapore

expatriates who send their children to  schools in  China

or Taiwan tell us it is  more stressful.  In Korea, there

is  a  saying  that they drum into kids at a  young  age,

`Sleep   five  hours,  fail.  Sleep  four  hours,  pass'.

Richard  Lim,  who runs Majullah Connection  in  the  US,

told  me  recently over the email that he was talking  to

some   students  from  China who had the  opportunity  of

studying  in  Singapore along the way, who  spent  a  few

years  studying  in  Singapore. They told  him  that  our

Singapore  system struck them as being much more  rounded

than the system that they had gone through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have a problem, but let us look at it in

perspective.  This is in large part a social  phenomenon,

not  an  educational  one, and it  is  in  large  part  a

positive  phenomenon  of  a  society  that  is  still  in

momentum.  Our students probably work too hard  at  their

examinations.  I agree with that.  And our parents should

set  more realistic expectations for their kids.  But the

solutions are not obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taiwan attempted to change the situation two years

ago.  They had a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>

commission  that  was  set up  in  1996,  that  was  very

concerned  about  rote-like preparation for  examinations

and  the  stress in the system.  They devised  what  they

called  a  multi-path education system.   Admission  into

senior  middle school from junior middle school  will  no

longer be determined by a common examination, but will be

determined  by recommendations by the school,  interviews

and   the  candidate's  own  proposals  for  his   future

education - a range of criteria will be used.  Similarly,

a quarter of the places in colleges for those from senior

middle   schools   are  now  to  be  reserved  for   this

qualitative means of entry - -  -  instead of by   common

examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, two years later, surveys are being done of

parents  and  teachers to see how they  feel  about  this

system that was aimed to relieve examination stress.  The

result - situation more stressful.  Parents and teachers,

the  majority  are saying that students are more  unhappy

now.    Students  are   stressed out by  having  to  take

interviews,  write applications to different schools  and

write  proposals about their future education.  Many  are

now   calling   for  a  return  to  a  universal   common

examination,  with  all the stress and  unintended  side-effects that that will entail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan tried - Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee went into

this  at  some length - a very interesting experiment  by

cutting down on content, seeking to reduce the stress  in

the  examination system.  Prof. Koo has covered  some  of

the  unintended  effects of what was  done,  eg,  reduced

rigour, reduced depth of learning in key core areas,  but

there  was another interesting side-effect. Not only  did

the  students need to study less hard, but they are  also

less interested in their studies, and less interested  in

each  other and in society.  So, there has been a general

decline  in intensity of education, not just with  regard

to  examinations, but  intensity of education in all  its

aspects.  There is  reduced interest in  education  as  a

whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was speaking last week to the Chairman of Fuji

Xerox, Mr Yutaro

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>

Kobayashi, an eminent Japanese industrialist, and he said

that this is now of great concern to Japanese businesses,

ie,  the  fact  that  students are  not  taking  learning

seriously  and  they are not interested  in  each  other.

They  are not interested in society.  It is not a problem

for  the  top  end,  the top 20%.  If you  cut  down  the

curriculum,  they just spend more time  in  private  juku

schools and, in fact, that has been happening.  They  are

advantaged because their parents know what they  have  to

do  to  get ahead in life.  But there has been a widening

dispersion   between  the  top-end  and  the   bottom-end

precisely because education has become less intense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, one merit of our system - where we put it all in

the  education  system, ensure that every  student  works

hard  within the system and aims high - is that  it  also

reduces  this dispersion that comes about when you  leave

it to market forces to determine which parents urge their

children to take studies  seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to shift focus, shift balance, encourage non-academic pursuits and encourage students to take a

subject  which they are interested in to as far  as  they

can  go  and have a passion in it.  But let us  keep  the

overall  intensity in place.  Let us change what students

do  within  education, but not reduce  the  intensity  as

such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examinations and teaching methods are clearly

critical.  We will continue to change the nature  of  the

examination system.  It is an evolutionary process, not a

sudden one-off break.  We are attempting to place greater

emphasis   on  testing  the  understanding  of  concepts,

students'  ability  to  reason and  to  evaluate  subject

matter  critically,  ie, greater  emphasis  on  students'

ability  to apply what they have learnt, rather  than  to

reproduce what they have learnt.  It is being done across

a  range of subjects - eg, in literature, history and  in

the  science subjects.  In science, for instance, we  are

moving   towards   a   school-based   science   practical

assessment,  ie,  a  form of continuous  assessment  that

looks  at students' laboratory investigation skills,  the

ability to design

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>

experiments,  as  distinct  from  a  one-off  end-of-year

science laboratory test.  This process will continue, and

it is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a perception on the part of many hon.

Members  that some subjects are easier to score  in  than

others.   Dr  John Chen and a few others  have  mentioned

that literature seems harder to score in and that is  why

students  shun  it.  I think it is not a situation  where

some subjects are easier to score in than others, but the

fact  that  Singaporean students  are  stronger  in  some

subjects  than in others.   All over the world,  students

take  subjects that they are strong in.  In  the  UK,  in

fact, preferences are exactly the reverse.  Students shun

science  and  mathematics  because  they  think   it   is

difficult.  So, there is nothing wrong in taking subjects

that  you are strong in.  We must want to make sure  that

you do not over-specialise and that you have some breadth

of learning, particularly while you are in school and JC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the data on literature. We have to look

at  the data quite carefully.  If we look at students  of

the  same  ability group, we will not find a big  gap  in

performance  in literature and the other  subjects.   For

instance, if we look at schools like RI and RGS, we get a

higher   proportion  of  students  who  take   literature

obtaining  distinctions, compared to  the  proportion  of

students    taking   chemistry   or   biology   obtaining

distinctions.Any student who has an interest and  passion

in a subject will be able to do well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Ms Braema Mathiaparanam raised

the issue of the university admission system, whether  we

should  give greater weight to CCA, project work, and  so

on.  The  entire university admission framework would  be

studied  carefully.    Dr Ng Eng Hen chairs  a  committee

that  is  looking at this, and we will have to make  sure

that the intent of the new JC curriculum is reflected  in

the new JC admission system.  We should  move away from a

single  formula for university admission, and  we  should

move  towards a system where each university evolves  its

own   system  of  admission  and  perhaps,  even   across

faculties, different criteria will be taken into account.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the challenges faced by our teaching force

are  going to be central to this whole exercise.  We will

put more teaching resources into our junior colleges,  so

that they can confidently deal with this broader and more

flexible   curriculum.   There  are  some  specific   new

requirements.   Knowledge and Inquiry is a  new  subject.

It  will require a new set of skills and we will probably

train  new  teachers  as well as some   of  our  existing

teachers.  We  may even import a few foreign expatriates.

For  instance,  those with experience in  the  IB  system

where  they have a Theory of  Knowledge subject, we might

import a few of them to help us out in the initial years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be working closely with the NIE to ensure

that  teachers develop a broader repertoire  of  teaching

approaches,  and we will be retraining our existing  pool

of  teachers.   But  none of these  is  new.   It  is  an

evolutionary process.  We are not shifting from one  mode

to a completely new mode of teaching or learning.  So,  I

am uncomfortable with some of the references to having to

"remake"  our  teachers or "remake" Singapore's  teaching

force.   They  are  not  as  rigidly  captured  by  their

background  as  we  make them out to be.   In  fact,  the

distinctive about the Singapore teaching force  has  been

its willingness to change, particularly if you compare it

to  teaching  forces  elsewhere.  If  you  look  at  some

countries  where  they  attempted to  introduce  IT  into

education,   they  ran  into  many  teachers   who   were

passionately  against change.  We have very few  teachers

who  are  passionately against change, and we  have  many

teachers  who are passionate about change.  This  is  our

strength.   It  is a strength of our system.   So,  I  am

quite  confident  that  if we size  up  the  requirements

carefully,  put  resources and energy into  training  our

teachers, they will respond well and respond confidently.

Let us not caricature the teaching force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A diverse education landscape is the second major

limb of the White Paper, and I will not be as long in  my

responses  on  this issue.  The key issue that  has  been

raised has been whether we are building elitism into  the

system by introducing the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>

Integrated Programme schools, and I think this is a valid

issue.   The  Minister  for  Education,  RAdm  Teo,   has

addressed this substantively in his opening remarks.   My

colleague,  Minister of State for Education,  Dr  Ng  Eng

Hen,  has  spoken  yesterday  about  the  resources   and

energies that go into ensuring that all our students  are

equipped to go as far as they can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add a further perspective on this. We all

accept that we need to have a more differentiated system.

It  is necessary to spur innovation, including innovation

in  education  itself,  and  it  is  necessary  to  groom

diverse  talents.  The question is how we do it.   Do  we

have greater differentiation within the mainstream of the

state  education  system, or do we have  it  outside  the

mainstream?  That is the key question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are almost unique internationally in attempting

to   bring   differentiation  and  diversity   into   the

mainstream, with the principle of meritocracy  continuing

to  apply,  so  that everyone with the determination  and

ability  can  benefit.   Affordability  will  not  be   a

criterion  for  taking  any of  these  diverse  paths  in

education.  So, this is what distinguishes us from  other

countries that have differentiated systems,  that we  are

providing  differentiation  within  the  system.  We  are

keeping education relevant for the future while  ensuring

it  remains a social leveller, as Mdm Halimah put  it,  a

tool  for  social mobility,  with equal access  based  on

merit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look around the world - and many countries

have  now  moved  towards highly differentiated  systems,

some very innovative ones - we will find that, generally,

the  differentiation  takes  place  outside  the  system,

because  of the failure of the state school system.   So,

there  may be an  egalitarian posture in  public  debates

in  the  UK, US and elsewhere, but it obscures a thriving

private  school system, which is where the  bulk  of  the

innovation  takes place in their education systems.   The

UK  had   a big furore about equality of access to  their

public schools.  They got rid

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>

of  their  grammar  schools, got rid of  the  ability  of

schools    to    select   by   merit,   and    introduced

comprehensives.  But  very little was  being  said  about

their  thriving "public school" system or what are really

private  independent  schools  where  parents  with   the

resources  and  the  motivation  send  their   kids   to,

including even  many of those who were  themselves  arch-advocates of the changes in the state school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, private schools are at the pinnacle of

the system.  The US probably has some of the best schools

internationally, but they are private, expensive, and you

have  to be able to afford their fees.  Except for a  few

specialised   public  schools,  the  Bronx   Highs    and

Stuyvesants,  most public schools are  unable  to  select

students  on  merit.  They select students  according  to

where  they  live. Admission to school is  determined  by

neighbourhood.  I was recently told by a principal  of  a

public school in the Bay area of the US that there  is  a

saying  amongst  the  principals  that  the  higher   the

altitude of the school, the better the performance of the

school.  Because schools that are in the higher altitudes

are in the better neighbourhoods where the professionals,

scientists and engineers  stay.  And because they have  a

system where the local community funds a fair bit of  the

expenditures  of  the school, especially  its  enrichment

programmes, it is really a system of social elitism, even

in public school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan, a very egalitarian society, has had a

thriving private education system, from pre-school up  to

university,  for many decades now.  It is so  competitive

that  to  get  into the system, parents have  to  subject

themselves to interviews to get their kids into the elite

private  pre-schools.   And the system flows all the  way

up. Once you are into the right nursery, you get into the

right primary school, the right secondary school and  all

the way up.  It is a very egalitarian society but that is

the  way in which they have accommodated differentiation.

And we are choosing a different path.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few advanced countries that still

have a largely public school

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>

system.  Some of the European countries have it - Holland

and  Sweden.   And  there too, they  have  differentiated

their  system.  In Sweden, in the upper secondary  school

system, they have 14 different programmes, of which  only

three  are  geared towards eventual university admission.

In  Holland, they have four quite distinct streams.   But

because they stream their students relatively late,  many

of  their  weaker  students  are  not  well-equipped  for

continuous learning and not well-trained in core  skills.

Today's Straits Times has an article on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even China has no compunction in creating special

paths  for  different  talents, be it  academic  talents,

musical  talents,  gymnastic  talents.   They  have  many

experimental schools now which go much further than  what

we are proposing in our Report. Take for instance Beijing

Jingshan School, one of their experimental schools,  from

primary  school  all  the way up  to  senior  middle.  It

provides  a  through-train for  all  its  primary  school

students  to go on to junior middle school. And  the  top

junior middle students, the top 10% or so, are provided a

through-train to go on to senior middle.  If you look  at

some of their other experimental schools, they provide  a

through-train  for  the  top  students  in  Science   and

Mathematics to the top universities.  Again, we  are  not

proposing  this,  but I raise this as an illustration  of

how  even  China,  a relatively egalitarian  society,  is

providing  these differentiated paths and  not  shrinking

from  it.  Because they know that in the  knowledge-based

environment of the future, they need outstanding talents.

That  is  the  basic  point.  We  need  more  outstanding

Singaporeans  in all fields - Science, Mathematics,  law,

diplomacy, arts. We need more outstanding Singaporeans to

take  us  forward.  We need to groom them as best  as  we

can,  nurture  a spirit of Singaporeanness  in  them  and

maximise  their  contributions to society.   So,  let  us

build  this  diversity into the mainstream  and  seek  to

contain social elitism as we do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Programme schools will actually offer

us  more  opportunities to guard against  social  elitism

than our existing school system does.  They will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>

have  more time.  If you look at the proposals that  have

been put forward by the schools that are applying to  run

the Integrated Programmes, they indeed intend to spend  a

lot more time on developing leadership and commitment  to

the  community.   So,  this  is  not  a  change  that  is

intrinsically going to lead to a more elitist system.  If

anything, it offers  an opportunity for the top  academic

talents  to develop stronger instincts of Singaporeanness

and commitment to their fellow citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should clarify, because a question was asked about

the  GEP programme, that we see this also among  the  GEP

students.   We have done a longitudinal tracking  of  our

GEP  students,  although they are still quite  young;   I

think the first batch is only 30 years old.  A far higher

proportion of GEP students do community service  compared

to the population average for their cohort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked the question of whether

we  should extend the Integrated Programme beyond the top

10%. Again, I must say that there was no magic in the 10%

number.  It was a matter of judgment, because we have  to

decide which students the Integrated Programme was  going

to be suitable for.  It does not suit all JC students and

we  have to accept that.  Some students will be confident

of  doing  well  in  their "A" levels and  proceeding  to

university  and getting into a faculty of  their  choice.

And  others  will  be  a  little  less  confident.   Some

students would relish an unstructured environment in  the

middle of their secondary school years, and others  would

prefer  a  more structured environment. And many  of  the

parents  would  prefer a more structured environment,  to

make  sure he gets the "O" levels in hand before he  goes

on to the "A" levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be realistic about this. In fact, Mr Ang

Mong  Seng  and  Mr  Zainudin have  themselves  expressed

concern  about  whether some of the Integrated  Programme

students  will not do so well, and about  what will  they

end  up  with.  I think we will minimise the risk  of  IP

students  not doing well if we are stringent in selection

of students into the IP schools.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>

That is the main policy strategy - make sure that we  are

selective and do not just channel people into IP  because

it  sounds  like  a  better path to education.   We  have

looked  at  the data.  If we look at the top 5%  of  PSLE

cohort,  92% of them eventually do well enough to qualify

for  our  local  universities.  If we go  to  the  6-10th

percentile,  it  already begins to drop  significantly  - only 86% of them qualify for our local universities.  So,

we have to be realistic.  If we go beyond 10%, I think we

will  have a higher rate of error, and we will face  more

of the problems which Mr Ang Mong Seng was talking about,

of  students who go in quite confident but end up not  so

confident, because they have not done so well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Programme schools will themselves be

in  the  best position to assess suitability.  Once  they

have  taken  in their pupils, they will be  in  the  best

position  to assess in the first couple of years  who  is

really  suitable to stay on the Integrated Programme  and

who  should, in fact, opt for the "O" levels. Some,  like

ACS, are proposing to offer both the Integrated Programme

and  the "O" level stream, so that students will be  able

to switch. But RI has said that  within a matter of a few

years  it  is  going  to be  a pure Integrated  Programme

school.   So, if you want to switch, you move to  another

mainstream school. I think that is a reasonable scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki, Mr Zainul, Ms Braema and a few others

have raised the issue of what can be done to improve  our

3-year  pre-university programme.   It  is  an  important

issue.   I must tell Members that we deliberated at  some

length   in  the  Review  Committee  on  the   issue   of

Centralised Institutes, because one perspective  is  that

we should not actually provide for them within the system

but  let  private  schools take care of them.  These  are

students  who  typically could not  get  into  the  right

faculty in polytechnics and also cannot make it to junior

college  -  why not let the private sector take  care  of

them?   We  decided  against it.   We  decided  that  the

Centralised  Institutes should remain part of  the  state

system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tharman, you have got about five

minutes of streaming time left.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Yes, thank you. Every

student benefits from a state subsidy for 12-13 years  of

education and from the resources and quality improvements

that we keep putting into the system.  We want to see the

Centralised  Institutes (CIs) not just as a  residual  of

the  system but as a quality component in its own  right.

MOE   has  been  discussing  this  with  the  Centralised

Institutes to see how we can improve their programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked a question of what would

happen  to the Gifted Education Programme (GEP) with  the

introduction  of  the Integrated Programme.   The  Gifted

Education Programme will have to be restructured  at  the

secondary  level with the introduction of the  Integrated

Programme schools.  Four of the existing Gifted Education

secondary  centres - RI, RGS, Chinese  High  School,  ACS

Independent  - have applied to the Ministry of  Education

to   run  Integrated  Programmes.   If  their  Integrated

Programmes are approved, as I expect they will, three  of

these  schools  - RI, RGS and the Chinese High  School  - will  cease to be Gifted Education Centres and will offer

the  Integrated Programme only.  Under ACS  Independent's

proposal,  it  is  somewhat different because  they  will

decide  on  Integrated  Programme students  at  Secondary

Three  rather than Secondary One.  So they will  continue

to  run a Gifted Programme.  For students who do not  end

up  on the Integrated Programme, they can continue to  be

in  the  Gifted Programme while pursing their "O" levels.

Gifted  Education  pupils who opt to join  an  Integrated

Programme  that  does  not  offer  the  GE  Programme  at

secondary  level  will compete, like all other  students,

for  places  in  Integrated Programme schools;  in  other

words,  RI,  RGS,  Chinese High, based on  the  admission

criteria  of  those schools.  And pupils who  join  those

schools,  who  have  come from the  Gifted  Programme  at

primary school, will join those schools as part of  their

mainstream  classes. What the IP schools will  do  is  to

apply some of the techniques and programmes of the Gifted

Programme across the board to all their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>

classes.  The Gifted Education Branch at MOE will support

them  in  doing  so.  We will continue to offer  funding,

support, advice on the design of such programmes and  the

curriculum  that  is  best suited  to  the  top  band  of

students.   They will still need to have some  programmes

that  are specific to the very top end of students.   But

we  should  have some flexibility in this and  allow  the

schools  to shape programmes that best meet the needs  of

their pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have the Integrated Programme schools in

place,  MOE will discontinue the supplementary  selection

exercise   for   admission  into  the  Gifted   Education

Programme   at  Secondary  One.  This  is   because   the

Integrated  Programme  schools  and  the  new  specialist

Mathematics  and Science School, once it is formed,  will

open up opportunities for more pupils who are not already

part  of  the primary school Gifted Education  Programme.

So,  there  will  be ample opportunities  to  join  these

schools and there is no need for a supplementary exercise

to  select students for the Gifted Programme at secondary

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cedric Foo and a number of others have suggested

that  we should provide Government scholarships for needy

students to attend private schools.  I do not think it is

necessary  or  desirable for us to do  that.  Anyone  who

qualifies  for a place in our national schools, including

our independent schools and any of our best schools, will

not  be  deprived  of  a  place on account  of  financial

difficulty.   With diversity in place in  our  mainstream

system  and with innovation and quality in place  in  our

mainstream  system, there is really no  need  to  provide

incentive or financial assistance for students to  go  to

private schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On foreign system schools, some Members have

questioned whether we should ease up on some of the rules

for Singaporeans to attend the foreign system schools  in

Singapore.   Currently, MOE considers this  case-by-case.

We  will review the guidelines, particularly with respect

to children of Singaporeans returning from abroad. But we

should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>

bear   in  mind  that  the  international  schools   were

established  for the purpose of catering to  children  of

foreign  expatriates working in Singapore and  they  will

have  their  character  shaped  by  that  objective.  The

children  in these schools will not experience  the  same

social environment that our national schools provide, the

environment that makes them uniquely Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, very quickly, the issue of whether

diversity  is  being restricted only  to  the  specialist

schools  and Integrated Programme schools.  This  is  not

the case.  Diversity is not just for the top 10%.  It  is

being spread throughout the system.  Look at our existing

independent   and  autonomous  schools.    We   have   23

autonomous   schools  now.   19  of  them  have   already

established  substantial niches  and  specialisations  of

their  own in the arts, in sports, in Science, in special

areas of learning.  Some of them, very recently, but some

for   several  years  now.   Look  at  our  neighbourhood

schools.  Through the cluster system that we have set  in

place,  our  neighbourhood schools now have available  to

them  the  opportunity to develop special  talents  in  a

broad  range  of areas.  Take arts. For example,  EastOne

Cluster  Art  Centre  at Siglap Secondary  School,  which

caters  not just to students at Siglap Secondary  but  to

the  whole  cluster.   It has three arts  galleries,  one

graphic  design centre, one ceramics room  and  one  arts

resource  library. That is the hardware.  It has teachers

who    are   being  continually  trained,   and   sharing

experiences in how to engage students in the arts.   This

is  something which is spreading throughout the system in

our  neighbourhood schools.  Anyone with a special talent

will have an opportunity to develop it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are at a turning point. We have not painted

an  end  destination, but I think we are confident  about

the  direction  that we are proceeding  in.   And  if  we

implement carefully,  ensure that our teachers  are  well

provided  with training, and keep them well motivated,  I

am confident we will achieve our objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  after listening to the comprehensive speech by  the

Senior  Minister  of State, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,  I

can  only  say that I rise to speak in strong support  of

the  motion  standing  in the name of  the  Minister  for

Education.   Over 30 Members of this House  have  already

expressed  their views and Members present here  will  be

relieved  to know that this has considerably reduced  the

length of my speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I listened to the speakers, it struck me

that  the search for a perfect education policy is rather

like  searching for the Holy Grail.  It is unlikely  that

one  would  eventually find it, but  in  the  process  of

travelling  down the roads and the pathways, which  seems

to  be the buzz word these days, we will be enriched and,

in  some cases, even ennobled.  But, of course, some  may

stumble  and fall but the quest goes on.  In this  House,

for the last couple of days, we have been embarking on  a

journey  to  search  for a better  education  system  for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, I think that our educators deserves

credit  for  the  many  achievements  of  past  education

policies.   These  policies  have  enabled  Singapore  to

propel itself to first world status within three decades.

Singaporeans  owe a debt of gratitude to educators,  past

and  present.  As a parent of two children who have  gone

through the system, I for one would like to say thank you

to them for providing my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>

children  with  an  education  that  is  hard  to   beat,

especially if one were to consider the costs of providing

for  such  an  education.  I am one of those parents  who

accept  that  stress  is a necessary  part  of  life  and

education,  and  that  the  development  of  intellectual

rigour  is  of  utmost  importance in  the  education  of

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading Command Paper No. 8, I searched, first, for

the  vision that must ex hypothesi be different from  the

one that had held good for nearly three decades.  The old

vision,  if  one  can  call it that,  was  one  that  was

designed  to  produce  "high  levels  of  achievement  by

international   comparison,   and   prepared   successive

generations  well  for  the  workplace,  citizenship  and

responsible adulthood."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new vision is stated in paragraph 26 of the

White Paper as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Going forward, we face the challenge of preparing

students  for a future of innovation-driven  growth,  and

frequent  and  unpredictable changes in the economic  and

social  environment..  The focus of education must  shift

from  efficiency to diversity, from knowing to  thinking,

and  from  fitting people to specific jobs  to  equipping

them  for  lifelong  learning  and  creating  their   own

opportunities.'



Nice, eloquent phrases.  But how true is this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a bold vision, a borrowed vision or a

blurred  vision?  As I understand it, the old vision  had

to  do with educating our students for specific jobs, and

for  training  them  to work efficiently.   Emphasis  was

placed on knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new vision, in a world subjected to the

demands  of  globalisation and the knowledge economy,  we

should provide our students with a diversified education,

with  thinking skills rather than knowledge and with  the

ability   to  be  extremely  mobile,  and  to  re-educate

themselves,   if   need   be,   when   their   employment

circumstances change.  This is the new vision.   If  this

can  be achieved, I think the Minister for Manpower would

no  longer  need to worry about structural  unemployment,

because workers will re-educate themselves for new  jobs.

And that would be a wonderful scenario, which would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>

make  a lot of sense in the current circumstances,  I  am

sure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vision assumes that developing thinking

skills  and  acquiring greater breadth of learning  would

meet the needs of the knowledge economy.  The White Paper

states that "in the knowledge economy, an ability to draw

on  different disciplines will be at a premium."  Sir, my

first query really is:  how true is this?  Will depth  of

learning  be sacrificed for the breadth of learning?   As

Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,  has

fully  addressed this point, even though this is  not  an

unimportant question  -  and he had said so himself  -  I

think that his answers more than satisfactorily cover the

points  that  I  want to make about the  fact  that  even

though  we broaden the curriculum, it will not be at  the

expense  of  the shallowness of learning.  And  I  assume

that  this will be very important when the new curriculum

takes effect.  But I think parents and their children may

still  be  at  a  loss  as  to  how  to  deal  with  this

interdisciplinary   approach.   They   ask   simple   and

immediate   questions,  such  as  what  would   the   new

curriculum mean in terms of the chances for my  children,

for  example,  to  secure a place in the  university,  in

medical school, in engineering or in accountancy or  law.

Diversity  in curriculum may bring uncertainty  and  even

unhappiness to many, particularly in the years that  such

a  new curriculum start because not many people would  be

sure as to how it would go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I am all for the diversity in the

curriculum.   I  hope  that there will  be  some  serious

attention  given  to  working out exactly  what  sort  of

workers  are  needed  in a knowledge-based  economy.   We

pride ourselves in the past for providing education  that

would  fit our people into different jobs.  And  a  large

part of that success has been due to manpower projections

about  how  many  engineers, how many doctors,  how  many

lawyers, how many accountants are needed.  How will  such

projections now work in the age of uncertainty?  I  think

this  question  needs  to be addressed  and,  so  far,  I

believe,  has  not been quite addressed  by  the  answers

given.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn next to a problem already referred to by

some  Members  of this House, namely, resources.   It  is

true  to  say  that  when we shift the balance  from  the

acquisition of knowledge to the acquisition of analytical

or communication skills, we are talking of a very serious

increase  in the number and quality of teachers of  these

skills.   As  we  found  out  in  teaching  advocacy  and

lawyering skills in the Law Faculty, staff-student ratios

have  to be drastically reduced in order for such  skills

to  be taught effectively, because the emphasis would  be

on  each  individual student and his or  her  ability  to

analyse and communicate.  We found out, for example, that

a   staff-student  ratio  of  1:8  would  be  just  about

manageable.  Do we intend to increase staff resources  to

that  level?   Can  we train sufficient teachers  in  the

short  space  of time available in such skills,  and  not

only  in  such  skills but in imparting  such  skills  to

hundreds or even thousands of JC and secondary students?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasise the words of the

motion that "the curriculum will better develop thinking,

communication and other process skills ."   Whether  this

will  actually achieve the result or not depends  not  so

much  on  the curriculum per se, which only provides  the

opportunity for the acquiring of such skills, but on  the

teachers  and  the  time given to the  training  of  such

skills to their charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not to say that the new vision and

approach  does not promise much.  It does.  It  has  many

good  elements  in  it.  The development  of  independent

thinking,  teamwork spirit and social  consciousness  are

critical objectives.  They are worth developing for their

own  sake.   It  seems, however, that a balance  must  be

struck,  and  the  Senior Minister of State  Tharman  has

addressed some of the problems.  A balance must be struck

between  knowledge and skills - which  he  has  addressed

very  thoroughly - diversity and specialisation, teamwork

and  individual development.  Working out these  balances

will take time, and as he so properly pointed out, if the

balance is properly addressed and worked out, it will  be

a  system  that  the world has never seen before,  and  I

doubt if any other country

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>

can  lay  claim to having worked out such a  system.   So

instead  of a borrowed vision, Senior Minister  of  State

Tharman has convinced me that we can say that this  is  a

bold vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if it is wrongly balanced, we would see an

increase  in  workload and stress, and  decrease  in  the

effectiveness of the programmes and a lack  of  focus  in

the  education  given  to students.   So,  of  course,  I

sincerely hope that we will succeed in working  this  out

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting the motion, Sir, I would like to

raise  a  problem  that  does  not  seem  to  have   been

mentioned, and that is whether the implementation of  the

new  curriculum  would require not just  an  increase  in

human  resources in terms of teachers and  trainers,  but

also   infrastructural  facilities,  such   as   language

laboratories,  recording studios, what have  you,  needed

for  the  teaching of communication skills and the  like.

Has  the Ministry already got the plan in place to  build

such  additional facilities in schools selected for  this

new curriculum?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to make the point about

competition  among  colleges  and  schools,  the  ranking

system in this new setup.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranking of colleges according to their students'

performance  records,  and  the  like,  appears  to  have

created  an atmosphere of competition among the  colleges

and  schools.  However, what I would like to ask is:  has

this  so-called competition caused schools to lose  their

collegiality, their sense of cooperation with each other,

their willingness to share resources and experiences with

each other?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the diversified curriculum would impose a

demand  on  resources, the like of which has  never  been

experienced  before.   The new curriculum  will  bring  a

period of uncertainty too for the schools.  There may  be

a  tendency to hoard expertise and experience rather than

to  share  and  weld  a collegial spirit  among  all  our

colleges.   So I would like to ask what are  the  current

measures and future

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>

measures that are necessary to build up this collegiality

in  the  schools and colleges that hitherto we  have  not

promoted.  Sir, in the new age of diversity, we must  all

the  more  look for collegiality, among the  schools  and

colleges, among the teachers and students, and among  the

students themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the diversification also in terms of private

schools and public schools, we are entering into  an  era

of what one might call an embarrassing richness of choice

and  opportunity  for students compared to  the  relative

poverty of choice under the old system.  I hope that  all

in  this House will of course agree that we must make  it

work.   But  in order that the new curriculum  and  setup

will  work, educators and manpower planners must provide,

I believe, more guidance and direction than that given in

the  White  Paper.   Only  then  would  there  be  public

confidence that this sea-change of policy into  uncharted

and uncertain waters will end up in a safe harbour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the motion.

I will go straight to the three areas of my concern and I

will make it short as all the points have been said,  and

well said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point one concerns the potential of the module-based

JC curriculum for the lower and upper secondary education

system.   I  commend  the Committee  led  by  Mr  Tharman

Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister of State  for  Education,

for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>

introduction of the module-based system for the provision

of  breadth and depth of the subject contents of  the  JC

curriculum.   It provides diversity and yet allows  depth

of  knowledge.  I was so excited when I read this section

of  the  report as I see the potential.  I would like  to

urge  that  the module-based system be implemented  on  a

wider  basis, from the lower secondary, and not  only  at

the  JC level.  With this implementation, the flexibility

of the module-based system, we should try to do away with

the streaming of children at the secondary level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I was concerned recently of the ills of

streaming  and banding of the secondary school  children.

I  was at a secondary school prize presentation ceremony.

When  you  put the children together, you will  note  the

difference of the children's mannerism, eg, the sounds of

the  children's footsteps coming forward to  receive  the

school  awards  becoming  softer  and  softer,  from  the

Express student, to the Normal (Academic), to the  Normal

(Technical)  stream  of  students.   This  difference  in

boldness, and in confidence, was highlighted by  some  of

the  teachers  and  parents  after  the  ceremony,  which

confirmed my observation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree that the concept of streaming has

very  good  intention - to maximise our human talent  and

resources - I believe what we did not anticipate was  the

side-products of social stigma and the fear  of  failure.

To  allow  the  breadth and diversity  of  the  education

system,  the  different  modules  of  subjects  could  be

grouped  into the various fields of studies,  and  within

the  fields, allow the depth of the subject that has been

introduced, like the H1, H2 and H3, in the JC curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the module-based system could be

designed  to  have a few sets of core studies,  with  the

breadth  and  depth of knowledge within  it.   But,  most

importantly, to allow the children to have the confidence

to  take  the  world, as the stigma  or  banding  of  the

secondary  schools  would not be with the  children,  and

allow the flexibility to climb the education ladder.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My two other concerns are mainly on the

implementation details.  For any changes of the education

system,  it must start with the teachers first,  who  are

the  leaders  and will be implementing  the  changes.   I

quote  this  real example of a comprehension  test  of  a

Primary 1 child.  The comprehension is about the story of

a  match-box girl, who eventually died from the  freezing

cold  with  a  joy in the heart.  The last  comprehension

question was:  "What happened to the little girl  in  the

end?"   The child answered:  "The child died with a smile

on her face".  I thought it was quite good that the child

was  able  to  grasp the concept of courage and  love  in

adversity,  and at Primary 1 would have expressed  it  in

the  simplest way.  However, the answer was marked  wrong

because the child added the phrase "with a smile  on  her

face".  This phrase was not in the comprehension article.

Well,  I presume the parent should have taught the  child

to  be examination-smart, to follow the text strictly and

should not be creative and imaginative, or at least  that

creativity had its limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my recent contacts with teachers, their concerns

have  always been that there were too many and  too  much

changes  in the curriculum, and the teaching skills  that

many  are  ill-prepared.   One reason  is  the  speed  of

implementation, the other is the length of  training  and

the  learning  curve needed.  This review requires  major

training in the teaching skills.  Training would  require

time and effort for the change to be realised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is too little and too late. My

final concern is that we may want to take a short cut, in

view of our limited resources, to introduce knowledge and

inquiring  skills to the top 25% upper secondary  and  JC

students  for  independent thinking,  analytical  skills,

innovation  and  creativity.  But if, in  the  course  of

primary  and lower secondary education of eight years  or

more, the mode of teaching had been one of rote learning,

and if the majority of our students are frowned upon,  or

worse, punished for displaying independent thinking,  the

asking  of  whys,  the asking of hows, sometimes  due  to

their young age,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>

may  sound  like challenging, then how can our  students,

who  excel in that kind of rote learning environment  for

eight  years of more, now be able to turn around  and  do

the  reverse in the upper secondary level?  The  argument

of  the  Review Committee is that Singapore  is  changing

from  an  industrial  economy to one that  is  knowledge-based.   Hence,  to prepare our young to  be  our  future

leaders   and  contributing  citizens,  the   revamp   is

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this as the background, why then limit the

review  to  the top 25% students?  I urge that the  other

75%  students in the secondary schools should  be  within

the  benefit of this change of the core curriculum  under

this  review.  In other words, since we need  to  develop

conceptual  thinking and other knowledge  process  skills

across   the   curriculum,  especially  on  communication

skills, knowledge and inquiring skills, which are  needed

in a globalised economy and the service industry, why not

introduce  these  lifelong learning  skills  to  all  our

students from the primary level onwards, and not limit it

to the top 25% upper secondary school children?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Dr Ng Eng Hen has argued and told us that

the  resources  spent  on the lower stream  students  are

higher than the pre-university students, these are  basic

lifelong skills and it should be implemented as widely as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, implement some of the recommendations

to  a wider student population, to allow our students  to

develop  their  own  talent, their own interest,  without

being banded or differentiated downward by the school and

the society.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, first of all, let me thank the 34  Members

who  were not from the Ministry of Education and my three

colleagues for their views and contributions during  this

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman, has dealt

with most of the questions and comments raised by Members

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>

over the last three days.  I am very gratified to see the

strong  level  of support which this motion has  received

from Members of this House.  When you vote later, and you

express  your  support for this motion, I think  it  will

send a strong signal to the parents, the teachers and the

students,  that this House supports this  reform  and  we

will  be  able to carry it through steadfastly  and  well

into the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened carefully to all the points made by

Members  of  this  House.  Let me take a  step  back  and

address   the  key  issues  raised  by  the  Members   of

Parliament  in  the last few days, not  just  about  this

review, but also about education in Singapore as a  whole

- how do we make improvements to various parts of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the main issues raised can be collected into

five major areas.  First, why the JC level?  What have we

done  for  the  rest  of our kids?   That  is  the  first

question.   Second question is one of elitism,  and  more

streaming.   The  third question is about the  curriculum

itself - broadening.  Will it lead to more stress?   Will

it lead to heavier workload?  The fourth question is that

of  teachers.  And the fifth question, one which has been

touched  on by various Members, is how do we measure  the

success of our education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not touch on all these issues because several

of  them  have been addressed adequately by  Mr  Tharman.

Instead,  let  me take a slightly different approach  and

answer  some of these questions as I go along.   I  would

like  to  ask  Members to go through with me  my  thought

process in the last five to six years as I have been with

the  Ministry  of  Education and how we have  implemented

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first things I decided to do was not to

stay in Singapore all the time and visit just our schools

in  Singapore because then you get locked into a  system.

You  begin  to think that this is the only way  of  doing

things.   And  so  I  had  spent  quite  a  lot  of  time

travelling and visiting school systems around the  world.

In the East - Korea, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and all the

ASEAN  countries.   In  the West -  in  Europe,  Britain,

France,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>

Sweden, Finland, Germany and Switzerland; and in the  US.

I  have  been  to  the US many times.  And  also  a  very

interesting  education system in Israel.  I have  learned

many things from these visits.  One of the most important

things that I have learned from all these visits is  that

we  have  an  enormously strong education system.   I  am

always  a  little  amused that, whenever  I  visit  these

countries,  we get a lot of compliments.  That  fortifies

me  for when I come back to Singapore and come into  this

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we have such a strong system, then why do we

want  to  change it?  I think we have heard many reasons,

and  Members  agree.  We want to be in time to  meet  the

future.   We  have  a strong system for today,  and  that

strong  system was based on the reforms that were put  in

place  in  1979,  courageously supported by  this  House.

This  brought about streaming, catering to the  different

abilities  of our students, much maligned today,  but  it

has  in fact led to high levels of achievement not  found

anywhere else in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked for this one sheet from the Third

International  Mathematics  and  Science  Study   to   be

distributed.   It shows not just a point where  Singapore

stands,  but it shows a band where Singapore stands.   It

shows  a  band  of  achievement of Mathematics  at  about

Secondary 2, from the 5th to the 95th percentile  of  the

students.   And we stand out there in front of the  world

beating   every  other  country.   It  is   an   enormous

achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students at the Normal (Academic) level perform

near  Belgium's  average,  who  ranked  6th  out  of   38

countries.  Our Normal (Technical) students perform  near

Italy's  average,  just below the international  average.

There  is  no  reason at all for our  students  to  "walk

softly",  or to feel disadvantaged.  They have  benefited

from  an  education system that has put them up there  on

top of the world able to compete with others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing our education system is a bit like changing

the tyres on a car that is moving down the road.  It is a

hazardous business.  It is a bumpy ride for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>

passengers,  very  dangerous for the  driver,  even  more

dangerous for the one trying to change the tyres.  So why

have  we  started to change at the JC level?   Basically,

there  are three reasons.  Firstly, the JC level  is  the

level   at  which  change  is  most  needed.    We   have

substantially  a strong primary education system.   There

are  improvements that can be made.  I concede  that  and

accept that.  And we have been making improvements as  we

go  along.  We have the LSP for children who are weak  in

English  Language when they come to school.  We have  the

ENABLE  programme to help students along.  By and  large,

we  have  achieved  high standards, high  levels  in  our

primary   school  education  which  have  made   a   firm

foundation for the secondary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary school level, we also have high

achievement  levels.  You can see that  for  Secondary  2

from  the  Third  International Mathematics  and  Science

Study.   Completion  rates  are high,  articulation  into

higher  education is also high.  We are at  levels  which

Britain  hopes  to  reach  -  85%  having  post-secondary

education beyond Secondary 4.  That is quite a remarkable

achievement.  And that achievement is possible because of

the strengths in our education system, laid down with the

foundations  of the Goh Keng Swee Report.  Without  those

foundations, we would not have been able to move forward.

We would not even be able to make the changes that we are

proposing to do today, because the foundations would  not

have been there for us to make these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why at the JC level? The JCs, as I said, are the

area where the changes are needed most.  I have looked at

schools  in various parts of the world.  And one  of  the

most  attractive schools that I went to, early in my term

as  Minister  for  Education, was Thomas  Jefferson  High

School  in  the Washington DC area.  It is a  Mathematics

and  Science  school  and the students  were  doing  very

interesting  projects,  our equivalent  of  Secondary  3,

Secondary  4,  JC 1 and JC 2.  And I was  very  enthused.

There was a very enthusiastic principal, and so on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was turning over in my mind why is it that we are

not  able to do this.  And it suddenly struck me that one

of  the reasons is that, during the same four years,  our

students of the same calibre are spending a lot  of  time

studying  for their 'O' level and 'A' level examinations.

Some  of  these students will require that  structure  in

order for them to proceed.  But some of the students  can

do  without that structure, and that structure is  really

holding them down and stopping them from blossoming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like you to look again at this Table that I

have distributed.  It is an interesting Table because, as

I said, it contains the 5th to the 95th percentile.  What

is interesting is not the students who were there.  It is

quite  clear that our education system has provided  well

for the mass of the students.  And my responsibility,  as

the  Minister  for  Education, is to make  sure  that  we

provide  for all our students as best as I can  from  the

resources voted to me by this House.  And there is  proof

that,  in  fact, we have done well for the  mass  of  the

students.   But  the students who are not there  are  the

ones  who  are  interesting.  We are one of the  smallest

countries   on   that  list  -  3.2  million   indigenous

Singaporeans, 270 million Americans.  We have about 5% at

the  bottom  end, 5% at the top end who are not  on  that

list.   The numbers are small.  It allows us to see  what

we  can  do  for these students.  We have many programmes

for  the students at the lower end.  I have described our

Learning  Support  Programme, and so  on.   And  we  have

achieved  high levels.  Our Normal (Technical)  students,

as I said just now, are at the international average.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about the students in the top 5%? Many of

the  good models of education that my colleagues in  this

House have spoken about are actually models of education,

whether  it is MIT, Brooklyn High, Bronx High, which  are

really  for students who are not on the chart.  They  are

in  the  top 1/2%, 1% maybe, of the population.  We  have

maybe  5%  or  2,000 a year.  If you look at  the  United

States, they are about 90 times our population, ie, 5%  x

90 is 450 of our percent.  They have 4.5

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>

times more students not on that chart than we have in one

whole  cohort.   They provide for them in  a  variety  of

ways.   We need to provide for them too in order  to  get

the most out of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this an elitist system? My colleague, Dr Ng Eng

Hen, has shown from his data yesterday that, in fact,  we

do  provide  a very good education for all our  students.

The  JC  students academically are the top 25%.  Our  ITE

students academically are in the lower quartile.  But  we

provide for them very adequately, and we will continue to

provide  for  them as much as they need to  have  a  good

education.   So  we  must not short-change  ourselves  by

failing to provide for our good students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is the two points that I have made

earlier  in  my opening speech.  The first  is  that  the

principles  of  meritocracy continue  to  apply.   As  Mr

Tharman said, in the United States, many of these top  5%

are  in  private  schools - at high  altitude,  breathing

rarefied  air.   Our  schools take in students  from  all

backgrounds,  whatever  their socio-economic  background,

provided  they can make it.  And our primary schools  and

secondary  schools are strong enough to  make  sure  that

students from all backgrounds, provided they can do well,

can benefit from the best that our education system, that

our  country  can  offer  them.  That  is  a  fundamental

difference  between our system and the  US  system,  when

much  of  the top end, or the top 5%, is provided  really

out  of  the private sector for people who can afford  to

pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to change our JC/upper secondary system

in  order to provide different paths for our students  so

that  they can develop.  And this is one of the important

things that we need to do.  But one of the dilemmas I had

to  face  -  and why it took me so many years, because  I

visited Thomas Jefferson School in 1997 and this is 2002,

and almost 2003 - is that I could not resolve in my mind,

perhaps I am an Engineer, as Ms Indranee said, and I  was

looking   for   a   clean   solution   which   could   be

systematically  applied  to  all  our  students  and  was

searching  for  one.  We have a very neat  system  today.

Six years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>

of  primary  school,  four  to five  years  of  secondary

school,  and  after  that,  people  disperse  to  various

institutions.   I was trying to look for  a  neat,  clean

solution, a system, a basis like that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, I have to think of the students

who are going to polytechnics and ITE.  To cause them  to

go  through 12 years in school I think would be the wrong

thing to do.  I have looked at the US system too, not the

top  end,  but the middle band.  And I think 12 years  of

high  school,  12 years of education, is  not  the  right

thing  to do in school.  By the time the students are  17

years  old, they are getting very restless and  they  are

not  going  to stay in school and learn more Mathematics,

Geography,  History,  or even English  Literature.   They

want  to  do something else which has relevance to  life,

which has relevance to their work in the future.  That is

one  of  the  reasons why at the upper  secondary  level,

Grades  11  and  12, the drop-out rates  are  high.   The

alternative of trying to bring a vocational and technical

education into the high school does not work.  I have not

seen it work satisfactorily anywhere, because a school is

the  wrong  kind of environment for this.   Our  ITE  and

polytechnics provide a much better education for students

of this type than trying to bring it into high school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other consequence, of course, is that if you

bring  it into a high school, then you will end  up  with

stratified high schools, streamed high schools, where all

the children will "walk softly" and they will not be able

to  mix with each other.  You will have a different  kind

of  problem.   So  I  had  a  tussle  between  these  two

requirements.   My  own  feeling was  that  10  years  of

education  was  about  right  for  the  majority  of  our

students.  We need 12 and, possibly, a through-train  for

those students who can do well.  But how to put it into a

system  that is neat, and which you can draw  on  a  two-dimensional chart, rather than a three-dimensional chart.

Unfortunately, I could not find the answer.  That is  why

some  time last year, after thinking it through,  I  felt

that  the way forward was to allow for a system which  is

much  more diverse with many more choices but, of course,

a system which is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>

not  as  neat  and as clean as the system  that  we  have

today.  One of the reasons why it has been difficult  for

hon.  Members to understand the system is because  it  is

not so easy to draw a two-dimensional chart.  But that is

because  if  we want to introduce more opportunities  and

more variety for our students, this is what we should do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondary school system, the primary school

system,  can benefit from many of the concepts and  ideas

but,  as Dr Ng said, we should not have a parity in terms

of  solutions, or we may be giving the students the wrong

thing.   But  certain principles, such  as  communication

skills,   lifelong   learning,  the  right   values   and

attitudes, these are things which we pass to the students

throughout the education system anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put computers in the schools. The first students

to   get   computers  in  the  schools  were  our  Normal

(Technical) students when we started in 1994, not the top-end  students, because we felt that these students needed

something hands-on to excite them, to keep them in class,

to  help  them to learn.  So, we gave it to them.   I  am

glad  many  hon. Members came with me.  They accepted  my

invitation  to  visit the ITEs.  They saw for  themselves

how exciting the learning environment is in the ITEs, and

how  engaged the students were.  This is something  which

we will not find in an education system in any other part

of the world for this group of students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we come to this reform, the critical area

really  was  in  reforming the  upper  secondary  and  JC

system.   What are the other reasons why we have reformed

the upper secondary and JC system?  The second reason  is

because it is faster to do it this way.  If we start from

Grade  1 and move up, it would take us many, many  years.

It  would take us three or four years to develop a  whole

curriculum,  12 years for it to flow right  through.   It

will take us a very long time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I come to the third reason. It may be even more

difficult  to  do,  if we start from Primary  1.   In  an

education  system, what motivates teachers, students  and

parents

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>

is the end point.  If they cannot see what is at the end,

they  are  not  going to change their  behaviour  at  the

beginning.  So, if we do not change the end, it  is  very

hard  to change the beginning.  If we start at Primary  1

and say this is what it is going to look like roughly  at

the  end  but,  in the meantime, for the next  11  or  12

years,  the students there are doing what they did before

because  we have not changed it yet, it is very  hard  to

get  people to envision the future and to be prepared  to

change.  Already, as it is, by putting a small change  in

the university admission system to say project work would

be  included,  as Dr Ng said, I think all  those  parents

with  primary school-going children will know that  their

children are doing their projects and doing various kinds

of  things.  The signalling is almost instant through the

system.  And when we want to make a change later  in  the

system,  in the rest of the system, it is much easier  to

do.   In  any case, in the meantime, the correct  signals

are being passed down the chain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of education system are we trying to

design?   This is something which some hon. Members  have

asked.  When I look at the eastern education systems, ie,

in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, we are high

on conformity, high on structure and high in achievement.

When I look at the systems in Europe, much of it has been

affected,  if  I can put it neutrally, by  socialism,  by

political   correctness  and,  as  a  result  of   which,

standards  have  not been maintained because  the  system

tries  to  pretend that everyone is the  same  and  gives

everyone  the  same diet, which leads to  not  very  high

standards.   That  is why people escape from  the  public

system and go into private education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States, in a sense, is the opposite end

of  the East Asian education systems.  It has some of the

most excellent schools I have seen anywhere in the world,

but  it also has some of the most dreadful schools I have

seen  anywhere in the world.   It is a system of enormous

contrasts, and I am always surprised that, in  a  country

that  prides itself on equal opportunity, they  have  not

had a revolution yet.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what is it that we are trying to build. I went

to  the  United States earlier this year and  I  met  the

Secretary for Education, Roderick Paige.  I also met some

education  reporters and they all asked me, "You  are  so

high  up  on  the  Third  International  Mathematics  and

Science Study, what is it that you hope to learn from the

United States?"  My answer was, "We are a system of  high

averages in Singapore, but in the United States you  have

a  system that has been able to produce high peaks."   We

want  to  try  to  marry those two  parts  together.   To

maintain  the  structure and the rigour of what  we  have

which  has  given us those high averages and  put  us  up

there  on the top of the list.  But we must also try  and

put  into our system a path which allows our people,  the

very  few people that we have, to reach those high peaks.

By  having  this  merger, this hybrid  of  what  I  would

characterise  as an Eastern and the US education  system,

avoiding  the worst parts but pulling together  the  best

parts,  I think we will have a very good education system

in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we succeed? I think, yes, we can succeed,

because  we  are somewhere in between both systems  today

anyway.  We are neither on one end nor on the other,  and

I believe that in our system, which is small enough, with

people  forward-looking enough and people,  including  in

this  House, courageous enough to say, "Yes, we  will  go

for such a system", we can make it work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that of elitism and I think, to

some  extent,  I  have dealt with that  already.   It  is

important, as we move towards a system like this with  IP

schools and so on, that the students in those schools  do

learn  that  they have a responsibility  to  society  and

their  fellow citizens.  But it is not so simple,  as  Mr

Steve  Chia  would have it, that the schools have  to  do

this and do that.  The society has to do it, ie, parents,

all  of us, by word, by deed, have to show to these young

people  that this is the right thing to do: "You  have  a

responsibility   for  your  fellow  man,   you   have   a

responsibility  for  your fellow  citizens,  you  have  a

responsibility for your country, particularly if you  are

better off, brighter, more able."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened also to note that all Members who

have  spoken  on the issue have come out  in  support  of

private schools.  Freeing up the private school sector is

a   departure  from  the  meritocratic  practice  in  the

education system that we have today, since admission will

depend  in  part  on the ability to pay.   These  private

schools  will  be  privately  funded.   Well-run  private

schools  can  contribute  to  our  education  system   by

providing   an  added  source  of  ideas  and  innovative

practices in education.  They can also cater to  children

whose parents might otherwise have sent them overseas for

a  secondary  or JC education for a variety  of  reasons.

This  is again an issue which I have tossed about  in  my

mind  and wrestled with for a while, because of the  very

same  reasons that some of the hon. Members of this House

have also raised this issue of private schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, it is reasonable to allow two to three

privately-funded schools to be set up.  We  will  put  in

place  certain requirements to ensure that  such  schools

will  offer  an  essentially  Singaporean  education  and

encourage them to make sure that their students will  mix

well.  They will have to adhere to key national education

policies and have a majority Singaporean enrolment.   But

we  will regulate them with a very light touch, otherwise

it is no point having privately-funded schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that as long as our national

education  system continues to be innovative and  remains

vibrant and responsive, and that we do not dumb it  down,

our   national   schools,   with  merit-based   admission

criteria,  will  continue to remain the mainstay  of  our

education system.  As Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam said, the

Government will not be offering scholarships to privately-funded  schools, as any able student will always be  able

to secure a place in our best state schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to commend hon. Members once again for

weighing  the  issue  of privately-funded  schools  in  a

considered manner and supporting their establishment.  It

reflects  the  growing maturity of the  society  and  its

readiness to extend greater choice to people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue was one of broadening versus

workload, stress, and so on.  I do not propose to address

this   issue  in  detail,  because  I  think  Mr  Tharman

Shanmugaratnam  has  addressed it sufficiently.   Suffice

for  me  to  say  that I believe that our  students  will

continue to work as hard, and that is not a bad thing.  I

would  prefer our students to work hard, rather than  not

to  work hard, and then to have to persuade them to  work

less  hard rather than to have to push them along to make

them work harder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by changing the curriculum structure,

assessment  system and what counts, we can influence  the

motivation  of  teachers, students and parents,  and  how

students  spend their time and energy, and move  them  in

the  direction that we want them to.  This  is  what  the

review will do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth issue is the question of teacher

readiness.   Are our teachers ready?  The first  point  I

would  like  to  raise  is that  our  teachers  are  much

maligned.   They  are  really  quite  a  good  lot,  very

enthusiastic and prepared to do many things.  And they do

a  lot.   I  hope that hon. Members will continue  to  be

encouraging to our teachers, and speak to them and  treat

them  the  way we would want them to treat our  children,

ie,  encourage them rather than criticise  them  all  the

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are our teachers prepared to deliver the new

curriculum  with  its  greater  emphasis  on  skills  and

breadth?  We have a strong forward-looking teaching force

which  is  not unfamiliar with change.  In fact,  when  I

first  came in to the Ministry of Education, Mr  Lawrence

Sia,  an  hon. Member of this House before, told  me  how

many  Ministers for Education he had survived  and  said,

"We have seen all these changes, we are used to all these

changes, and we have been changing all the time."  So  he

wanted to see what this new Minister for Education  would

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system has been changing and adapting

all  this  while, and so have our teachers.  They  are  a

remarkably resilient lot who have been very adaptable  to

change.  One example is when we introduced computers,  as

Mr Tharman

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>

Shanmugaratnam  said.  We only did that five  years  ago.

Initially,  schools were not wanting to be first  on  the

queue to be computerised.  But after a year or a year and

a  half, when I visited schools, they were asking,  "When

is  it  our  turn?  We want to go."  And  this  is  about

teachers across-the-board.  I went to one school where  I

was  very  pleasantly surprised to find that the  Chinese

Language Department in this very neighbourhood school was

the first in that school to have gone computerised.  They

saw it coming, they got the computers, they got together,

trained themselves and moved forward.  So, they were more

ready  than  anybody else in that school with  computers.

These are the kinds of teacher that we do have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers enjoy opportunities for professional

development  throughout  their  careers.   The   National

Institute of Education - I think hon. Members may not  be

aware  of this, but some Members are more active  in  the

National  Institute  of  Education  -  has  undergone   a

complete revamp in the last five years.  Perhaps I should

also  invite hon. Members to come and visit the  National

Institute of Education to see what has happened.  We  run

now  one  of the best courses for principals anywhere  in

the world.  It is a 6-month executive-type programme.  We

take  the principals through not just the education  side

of   it  but  how  to  manage  people,  how  to  run   an

organisation for change.  We attach them to companies  in

the  private  sector,  we  take  them  to  visit  schools

overseas,  and they go back to the schools  with  a  very

different approach and attitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIE has restructured its courses. One of the key

things that NIE stresses now is values education.  One of

the  reasons NIE stresses on values education is  because

we  have  seen an enormous transformation in our teaching

force.   In  the last five years, we have recruited  more

than  10,000 teachers.  Our whole teaching force is  only

25,000  strong.  As Mdm Ho has said, we are  losing  many

experienced teachers.  We are taking many new teachers in

and it is important that the values of the teaching force

are maintained.  Values education is one of the key areas

that NIE is now focusing on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be happy to know that for assessment of

schools,  we do not just do ranking by academic  results.

We  already have SEM in place.  It is, basically, a self-assessment of the school and, from time to time, we  will

have  an external validation board come in to have a look

at  how the school is doing.  I think academic ranking is

still important, because it is a matter of accountability

to you.  If we do not have ranking, you would ask for it,

which  is  what  happened in the United  States,  in  the

United  Kingdom  and other jurisdictions.   The  parents,

taxpayers  and Members of Parliament wanted to  know  how

their schools are doing, in relation to other schools  in

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been to school districts in the United

States.   They pulled me aside and proudly told me,  "You

know,  in  TIMSS, we beat Singapore."  They are  watching

their  ranking.  We  will be silly to  give  up  ranking,

because  it  is  an important tool of accountability  for

schools.   We  can  rank them on a  number  of  different

areas.  That I agree.  But to stop ranking them, I  think

it  would be to give up a tool of accountability to  you,

something which our schools and educators owe to you.  Of

course,  in  any jurisdiction in the world, I have  never

been  to  a  school  district  where  the  teachers  like

ranking.  Of course, they do not.  Why would you want  to

be  held  accountable if you can get away  without  being

accountable?   I  have never met a school district  where

the  teacher  said, "Yes, ranking is a wonderful  thing."

But  I am surprised that Members of this House should say

that  we  should  stop  ranking.   Because,  if  we  stop

ranking, we would have no instrument of accountability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the personnel management system, we are

introducing a new personnel management system  to  assess

our  teachers.   It is an open system.   It  will  assess

performance  and potential but it also has a very  strong

developmental element in it.  We have been working on  it

for  the last 2-3 years with Hays Management Consultants.

It  is  defined in terms of what teachers need to  do  to

improve  the  quality  of education for  their  students.

Certainly,  it is not based on absolute scores  of  their

students.  It has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>

never  been.   What  we are doing  now  is  that  we  are

beginning  to implement it in our schools. We will  start

with   the  management  level  in  the  schools   -   the

principals, the heads of departments, subject  and  level

heads - so that they understand the instrument very well,

and  we  can fix whatever problems there are,  before  we

apply it to the teaching force as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have enough teachers and teaching resources?

We  have  managed to improve pupil-teacher ratios  across

the  board - primary, secondary and JCs - over  the  last

few years. This is because we have strong recruitment and

strong retention.  And with the changes that we have done

with  EduPac,  the  salary structures and  the  retention

bonuses,  we  hope that we will continue to  have  strong

retention when our economy turns up as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the JCs and CIs, we had a pupil-teacher ratio of

16.4 in 1990.  It has come down gradually, and it is  now

13.2.   That  is the pupil-teacher ratio.  We  have  also

given  resources  to our JCs, with school administrators,

operations  managers and so on. Each JC has a  budget  of

about  $144,000 a year - $12,000 a month  -  to  hire  in

administrative help if they need to. They can  do  it  in

whatever  form they want.  When we implement the  system,

we do intend to give the JCs the resources that they need

to do their job properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me address this issue of measuring

success.  I could not help a smile escaping from my  lips

when  the subject came up on assessing success.  Measures

such  as  the  performance of our students in  TIMSS  are

almost  taken for granted and dismissed as irrelevant  by

this   House.   Or  even  more  strangely,   success   in

Mathematics  and  Science is seen as a  negative.   In  a

delightful little speech yesterday, Ms Indranee Rajah, in

a lovely leap of logic, ascribed poor road habits and not

knowing  right from wrong, I suppose, to our emphasis  on

Mathematics   and  Science  and  lack  of   emphasis   on

humanities.   I think this is really going a  little  too

far.   In practically every country that I have been  to,

my colleagues have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>

complimented me on the achievements in TIMSS, and  lament

that  they  have  serious shortages of people  adequately

trained and prepared in Mathematics and Science in  their

schools - serious shortages.  And the more developed  the

country,  the  more  serious the  shortage.   The  United

States  lives on imported engineers from abroad and  they

know that this shortage will affect their competitiveness

in  the  future.  They also lament that they are under  a

lot  of  pressure  from their public  and  electorate  to

explain  why  their students did not do  well  in  TIMSS.

They  are somewhat bemused when I tell them that  I  have

the opposite problem in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an excellent system today because of the

changes and adaptations that we have made over the  years

-  the  vision  and  courage of my  predecessors  in  the

Ministry of Education, who introduced those changes,  and

the  Members  of this House, particularly  in  1979,  who

supported them. We have not shied away from making  major

and  difficult decisions to help our students  do  better

and  address  the social and economic challenges  of  the

day.   We  have made real improvements in education,  not

whitewashed the problems away or try and make people feel

better  and then, 5-10 years later, they find  that  they

are really worse off, rather than better off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result has been a resilient, rugged people,

equipped  with  the  basics  for  economic  survival  and

employability.  We know that our education  system  is  a

good  one  because, to-date, we have  done  well  by  all

international  measures and ranking that serve  as  proxy

measures of how competitive our people are, how strong we

are  as  a nation, and how well-prepared we are  for  the

future.   Singapore  has passed various  tests  that  the

developments  in  global politics and the  world  economy

have  thrown at us.  Against all odds, we have  prospered

and grown as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the proposed changes will build

on  our current strength and result in a better education

system  capable of producing the leaders, innovators  and

citizens Singapore needs in a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>

globalised,  innovation-driven  future.   We  will   know

whether  this  latest  set  of  educational  reforms   is

successful  when future cohorts of Singaporeans  are  put

through  the crucible of world competition.  The  market,

not us, will decide what the criteria for success are. We

do  not  know what the future tests are, what the  future

challenges are and what the future proxy tests that  will

be used to measure whether or not our education system is

successful  or  not.  We do not know.  But  what  we  are

trying  to  do  here in this House is to  look  into  the

future  and  try and make sure that our Singaporeans  are

there  to  meet it.  Singaporeans must be  able  to  hold

their  own and forge ahead, not just as individuals,  but

as  a  cohesive united people.  The education system must

be  able to equip them with the knowledge, skills and the

values to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House would have had the opportunity

to  study the recommendations carefully in their totality

and  make  an assessment of whether the proposed  changes

are what we need to face the challenges ahead of us.  The

road  will not be a smooth one. There will be bumps along

the  way  in implementation and so on. The Whip has  been

lifted,  and  I hope Members will vote with  courage  and

conviction  and  give their full support to  the  changes

proposed.  A

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>

clear  parliamentary  vote  of  support  will  show  that

Members  acknowledge that the changes  point  us  in  the

right  direction and are committed to seeing through  the

challenges and issues we will face as we implement  them.

It  will  send a clear signal of the broad-based  support

and    commitment    necessary   for    the    successful

implementation of the recommendations. [Applause.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, having noted the Report of the

Junior  College  (JC)/Upper  Secondary  Education  Review

Committee  2002, contained in Paper Cmd. 8 of  2002,  (1)

supports the new JC curriculum which will better  develop

thinking,  communication  and other  process  skills  and

engage  students in greater breadth of learning; and  (2)

endorses greater diversity and opening of new pathways in

JC/Upper  Secondary education to cater to  the  different

strengths and interests of students.
