<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>MALAYANISATION OF CITY COUNCIL POSTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister

(a) how many expatriates are still holding posts in

the   City  Council;  (b)  when  these  posts  will

eventually   be   Malayanised:  and   (c)   whether

experienced  local officers are receiving  training

locally  or abroad to prepare them for taking  over

from the expatriates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, at

the  moment there are 10 expatriate officers in the

Departments  of  the City Council which  have  been

integrated  with the Departments of the Government.

Two of the expatriate officers are on the permanent

service, having been offered guaranteed employment

by the former City Council under its Malayanisation

scheme,  one up to 1964 and the other up  to  1966.

Eight  expatriate  officers are  on  contracts,  of

which  four will expire during the course  of  this

year:  two  in 1963 and one in 1964. One expatriate

officer is on a month-to-month basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local officers in City Council Departments which

have  been  integrated  with  the  Government   are

receiving  training locally and  overseas  or  have

been   earmarked  for  further  training  and  will

replace  expatriate  officers  as  planned  for  in

Government   service.  There  are   27   expatriate

officers  now  holding posts in  the  City  Council

Departments  that  will form the  Public  Utilities

Board.   Twelve  of  these  officers  were  offered

guaranteed  employment by the former  City  Council

under its Malayanisation scheme as follows:-



<pre>



    4    up to     1964

    2    up to     1966



</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



<pre>



    1    up to     1967

    4    up to     1969

    1    up to     1976



</pre>



Two  other expatriate officers are on the permanent

establishment, hut their services are subject to  a

six-month  notice of termination  on  either  side.

They will attain the retiring age of 55 in 1968 and

1969.  Thirty expatriate officers are on contracts,

of which one will expire this year, one in 1963, 10

in  1964,  one in 1969. Local officers in the  City

Council  Departments  that  will  form  the  Public

Utilities Board are being given training locally as

well as overseas to enable them to qualify for  the

higher  appointments at present held by  expatriate

officers. Eight of them are studying for electrical

engineering   degrees,  and   five   for   chemical

engineering   degrees  in  Australia.   The   final

selection   of  all  local  officers   for   higher

appointments,  including those held  by  expatriate

officers,  will  be   made  by  the  Public  Service

Commission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MALAYANISATION OF GOVERNMENT POSTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  (a) how many expatriates are still holding

posts in the Government; (b) when these posts  will

eventually   be   Malayanised:  and   (c)   whether

experienced  local officers are receiving  training

locally  or abroad to prepare them for taking  over

from the expatriates.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There were 509 permanent

expatriate  officers  in  the  Government   service

before  Malayanisation. Today  there  are  only  13

permanent expatriate officers still in the service.

Therefore,   Malayanisation  has  been   proceeding

faster than scheduled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Malayanisation programme, there

should  still be 113 permanent expatriate  officers

in  the  service. There are, in addition to the  13

permanent   expatriate  officers,   54   expatriate

officers on short-term contracts in the Government.

Of  these,  47 are either technical or professional

officers whose services are required because of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



shortage   of  local  professional  and   technical

officers.  Suitable  local officers  are  receiving

training  locally  or abroad to  prepare  them  for

taking  over from the expatriates. We now  have  no

less  than 105 persons studying abroad on  training

courses    at    Universities   and    professional

institutes.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I wonder whether those local officers who  are

sent  abroad  for  training are chosen  because  of

experience  in their work or seniority,  or  is  it

because   they   are  new  people  just   receiving

training.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The persons sent abroad for

training  can  be conveniently grouped  into  three

grades.  First, there are serving officers who  are

sent  abroad  on short-term training  courses;  for

instance, the staff of Civil Aviation who were sent

either   to  Australia  or  New  Zealand  to   take

specialist courses in Airport Management, in  radar

control,  and so on, and when they come  back  they

will be more efficient after having undergone these

training courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are specialist professional courses

which  we  offer  to  serving officers  in  certain

senior  technical grades. Most of these really  are

courses  leading  to  post-graduate  or  specialist

qualifications which are offered to doctors, and  a

fair  number of doctors are studying in the  United

Kingdom and Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are first professional training

courses  or first degree courses which we offer  to

young   persons.  Under  the  previous  Government,

recruitment for such training courses has been from

serving   officers  in  the  junior   grades;   for

instance,   P.W.D. architectural  or   engineering

technicians or Telecommunications technicians  have

been   given   the   opportunity   to   take   full

professional courses, say, in England.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that this policy is wasteful

because quite often these junior technical officers

have  not either the intellectual capacity  or  the

academic  background to benefit from these courses.

They  either just scrape through with  a  very  low

pass  degree  or, as happens only too  often,  they

fail    in    their   professional   or    academic

examinations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



So for such courses - for instance, we are having any

number  of  persons doing professional  degrees  in

Engineering   or  Science  or  Quantity   Surveying

etc. - we  are getting them straight from  those  who

have   passed   the   Higher   School   Certificate

Examination, and each year we are getting  some  of

the   best  of  these  persons  for  these   higher

professional training courses.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, is it true to

say  then  that at the top where there  are  senior

officers serving under the expatriates, the  senior

officer   is  being  trained  to  take   over   the

expatriate's job, apart from the junior officers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the question may give

the  impression that expatriate officers are always

above  the local senior officers. In fact, all  the

top  posts,  i.e, the highest posts  in  the  civil

service, like the post of Permanent Secretary, have

already  been  Malayanised, and the expatriates  do

not  occupy them. Take the P.W.D., for instance. The

Director  of Public Works and his Deputy are  local

officers.  That is the case too in the Ministry  of

Health. But we need bodies - that is the main  thing.

You  have  to  have a doctor, or a surgeon,  or  an

engineer. Because we ate so short of these persons.

and  if  they are expatriates and willing  to  work

here. I would say it is all for the good if we  can

get an extra body to carry the load.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry

I  did not make it clear to the Minister. I did lot

mean that the expatriate is always at the top. What

I  meant is that if a serving expatriate is  to  be

Malayanised,  is  the  local  officer   immediately

beneath  him,  irrespective  of  whatever  post  he

holds, being trained to take over his post?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would say that is the

general   position.  But,  of  course, there   are

exceptions.  For  instance,  in  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister's portfolio there are Departments such  as

the  Marine Survey Department where you just do not

have  any local officer, or very few of them,  with

the requisite professional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



qualifications.   But  apart   from   such   rather

exclusive  services,  the position  is  that  local

people are being trained to take over.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>HARI RAYA PUASA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs whether he would consider giving  two

days'  holiday to Muslims for Hari Raya Puasa  when

Hari Raya Puasa falls on the day after the gazetted

holiday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on occasions

when  Han  Raya  Puasa falls on the day  after  the

gazetted  holiday, the practice  has  been,  after

consultation with the Muslim Advisory Board, not to

declare   an  additional  holiday, but   for   the

Government to give Muslim Government servants  time

off  in the morning to perform their prayers. Under

merger, public holidays other than State  holidays

will be  a Federal responsibility.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BUSINESS OF THE ASSEMBLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the House

is  aware,  we have four motions more on the  Order

Paper  to deal with in this sitting of the Assembly

and  the  House is also conscious that  we  have  a

number  of  Bills to be proceeded with  next  week.

Now, it is necessary that the work and business  of

the Government must be  proceeded with expeditiously

and  without delay and therefore it is  our  desire

that these four motions on the Order Paper must  be

completed within this week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we have no desire to stop any Member

from  speaking  on these motions, I therefore  give

notice  to  the House that it will be the intention

of the Government to extend the sitting time of the

Assembly  to 12 midnight from tomorrow. I  am  just

giving the Assembly due notice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The statement is open to questions.

There will be no debate, but questions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, if the

Assembly could dispose of one or two more motions

on the Order Paper would it not be better for the

suspension to take place tonight instead of

tomorrow?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> If the House so wishes, I will

have no objection.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> On the contrary,

Sir,  since it is Government's intention to  finish

all  business  by the end of this week,  I  see  no

reason why we should rush like that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question being?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The question then being: would

it  not  be  better for tile Government to  suspend

Standing Orders either on Wednesday or Thursday, if

it should reach that stage?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I do not think it would

be  possible,  because I am giving  the  House  due

notice, and, as you know, some of the motions  here

are  very  controversial. I am making due allowance

so  that in four days' time, that is, from tomorrow

to  Friday, we should be  able to finish these  four

motions  if we were to extend the sitting to  12.00

midnight.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Further to the explanation of

the  Leader of the House, today is only Monday.  He

wants  to  make sure that all the motions  will  be

finished  by  the end of the week. If it  comes  to

Wednesday or Thursday, and if the motions are still

not finished, would it not be better then to extend

the time to 12 o'clock?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Member for Queenstown

suggests Wednesday. I suggest Tuesday.

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL UNREST</b></div>

<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of proceedings on

Amendment  [16th  March, 1962]  to  Question  [16th

March, 1962],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House views with grave concern the

mounting  of  industrial unrest and  calls  on  the

Government to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure

industrial  peace with justice in the interests  of

the   economic   well-being  of   the   people   of

Singapore.". - (Tun Lim Yew Hock).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To leave out "views with grave concern the

mounting of industrial unrest" in lines 1 and 2 and

insert "takes note of the public manifestations  of

industrial    dissatisfaction".' - (Mr David Marshall).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The debate now must be confined to

the  amendment. Any Member wishing to speak on  the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Only on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I cannot accept the

amendment proposed by the Member for Anson.  It  is

my  submission  that this House  views  with  grave

concern  the  mounting of industrial  unrest, have

quoted  facts and figures to show beyond any  doubt

that there has been mounting industrial unrest, and

surely,  Sir, as representatives of the people,  we

cannot  but  view this with grave concern,  because

such  a  situation is detrimental to  the  economic

well-being of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now examine the amendment proposed by

the Member for Anson. He does not view the mounting

industrial  unrest  with  grave  concern.  By   his

amendment,  he  wants this House not  to  view  the

mounting  industrial  unrest  with  grave  concern.

Strange,  Sir. But is it really strange, especially

as  this  comes from the Member for Anson?  in  his

short speech last Friday, he made reference to  the

time  when  I  was Minister for Labour and  Welfare

when  he  was Chief Minister. When he took  office,

there  was  too a spate of strikes, some  of  which

were of a political character. He did not view this

with  alarm.  He  did  not  view  this  with  grave

concern, in  fact, when he was surrounded  by  the

Press, who were anxious to hear from him what plans

he had to meet this challenge, he said with a broad

smile.  "I  love strikes." He loves  strikes,  Sir.

indeed, it might be that it is because of his  love

for  strikes  that  the Hock  Lee  strike  in  1955

culminated  in  a bloody riot and  the  then  Chief

Minister became



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



a  sick  man. One would have thought, Sir, that  he

would   have  learned  something  from  his  bitter

experience.   But   it   would   seem   from    his

manifestations last Friday in this House that he is

incurable,  in  so far as this particular  economic

ill is concerned. He wants this House to take note.

Take  note! Surely hon. Members of this  House,  as

well  as the public, have been taking note for some

months past of the mounting industrial unrest.  And

we,  having  taken note of the mounting  industrial

unrest  now feel grave concern for such a situation

as  it  has created havoc in the economic field  in

Singapore. There may be some hon. Members  who  may

not view this mounting industrial unrest with grave

concern,  but if there are such Members, they  have

failed  in  their  sacred duty to  look  after  the

economic well-being of the people who elected them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what does the Member for Anson want us to

take  note? He wants us to take note of the  public

manifestations of industrial dissatisfaction. I say

there has been mounting industrial unrest and there

are  facts and figures to bear me out. This  simple

statement  of absolute truth appears to have  stung

the  Member for Anson into attempting to  interpret

the   present  lamentable  situation  as  a  public

manifestation  of industrial dissatisfaction.  High

sounding words indeed, Sir. Behind them is  implied

the  attitude of the Member for Anson. By  his  own

words, he takes the stand that all the strikes that

have  bedevilled  the country are  just,  and  that

trade unions should be given free rein to do damage

to the economy of the country and thus to do damage

to  their  own  members. I have not  in  my  speech

condemned  the  trade  unions  for  the  industrial

unrest. What I have sought to do in my motion is to

call on the Government to do everything possible to

bring  about industrial peace with justice, because

without industrial peace the economic well-being of

the  people  of  Singapore will be  jeopardised.  A

sober  speech of mine seems to have made the Member

for Anson see in it a touch of hysteria. Sir, it is

only one who has been on the fringe of hysteria who

can see hysteria



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



where  there  is no hysteria. This  is  a  sort  of

illness which one would call a hallucination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson says that lie has put

in  his amendment with a view to restoring a  sense

of  balance into the industrial picture. A sense of

balance indeed! The hon. Member wants us to  accept

something that is not borne out by facts  in  place

of  something that has been borne out by facts. And

he  calls  this as "restoring a sense of  balance".

Sir, I cannot accept this because I refuse to allow

my mind to be unbalanced by this senseless sense of

balance.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> He is gila!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Anson

in  his  short  speech  took  it  upon  himself  to

ridicule  me when I made mention of the  strike  at

the Oversea-Chinese Bank in relation to Part VII of

the  Industrial Relations Ordinance. When  I  heard

him   raise   the   objection.  I   listened   more

attentively  to his speech and tried  to  find  out

from  him  the reasons for his objection.  I  heard

nothing  at all, Sir. This would make me feel  that

the hon. Member was speaking through ignorance. For

his   benefit - although  he  is  not  here  at   the

moment - and for the benefit of Members who may share

the  same  view  as the Member for  Anson, let  me

explain  in  greater detail what Part  VII  of  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance is meant to do.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Is this part of the hon.

Member's speech in relation to the amendment? If it

is  not,  then  he  will have  the  opportunity  of

answering  that argument at the end of  the  debate

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I feel that it will be better

if I reserve this. I brought it in just now because

it  was referred to in the speech of the Member for

Anson.  I  think  he brought that up  in  order  to

explain away his sense of a touch of hysteria in my

very sober speech. I would prefer, Sir, if I may to

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any Member who wishes to speak on

the  amendment? If not, I will put the Question  on

the amendment.



<br><br>The original Question was.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House views with grave concern the

mounting  of  industrial unrest and  calls  on  the

Government to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure

industrial  peace with justice in the interests  of

the   economic   well-being  of   the   people   of

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out "views with grave concern the

mounting of industrial unrest" in lines 1 and 2 and

there   to   insert  "takes  note  of  the   public

manifestations of industrial dissatisfaction".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out," put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment falls. We are now back

to the original motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  surprised  that  a subject of  such  importance

should not evoke a greater response from the  other

Parties.  Perhaps that shows that all  the  Parties

represented in the House are agreed that the  state

of  industrial unrest in Singapore is such that  it

causes  grave concern to all who are interested  in

the welfare of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a time when the general public

would read a report of some industrial trouble with

a  smile,  with  passing interest, and  make  it  a

subject of conversation at tea parties and  so  on.

Today  we are all conscious that when we view  this

problem, we view it against a sombre background  of

an   ever  increasing  number  of  unemployed.  The

problem  is  not merely a question of getting  fair

wages and increasing wages, of which we are all  in

favour,  hut  it is a question of encouraging  more

industries  and encouraging traders to  expand  and

employ  more  people,  so that  this  grave  social

problem of unemployment can be solved. It is  quite

frequent  coming across a family  of  five  or  six

depending  just on one member. I was visiting  some

families in an attap house area and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



came  across  a family with about five  able-bodied

young  men,  and a widowed mother. Of  these  five,

only  one  was  employed. This one  had  taken  his

Senior  Cambridge examination and, after a year  of

unemployment, had at last got a job as  a  watchman

at $4.75 a day. When he looked at me wondering what

my  opinion was, I said, "You are very lucky to  be

employed.  Never mind false pride. Take it  on  for

the  sake  of your family." I asked the  young  men

around  him. One said, "I too applied for the  post

of watchman, but there were so many applying that I

could not get the job." What about the others,  who

were not highly educated? They would not be able to

get jobs even as casual labourers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a case of another man, who had a good

job and then was retrenched. He has a large family.

After a desperate search for a job, he gave up  and

his  young son who had just left school managed  to

get  a job as an apprentice at a salary of slightly

over $100 a month. The whole family, about five  or

six  of  them,  are  dependent on  this  particular

youngster.  Naturally, he cannot  make  ends  meet.

Meanwhile,  the schools are producing thousands  of

youngsters. Youngsters are leaving the  schools  by

the  thousands  looking for jobs,  and  instead  of

finding  more  jobs  in  Singapore,  they  find   a

situation where jobs are decreasing in number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have read out statistics to prove that

since 1957 there are probably something like 15,000

to 17,000 jobs less than before. It is against this

background  that you have to study this problem  of

industrial  unrest. Yesterday in the  Sunday  Mail,

Sir, we had almost a full-page article entitled "In

Search  of  a Job". The article describes  how  the

writer  in 1945 found he could choose any  of  four

jobs. Today there is just a scramble. There are the

job-seekers, but there are no jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance was optimistic that

his  industrial plans could be effected and he went

to  Japan optimistically trying to attract Japanese

capitalists.  When he came back, he  admitted  that

the  Japanese investors were worried because of the

possibility of more labour troubles when they had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



invested  their  capital in Singapore  enterprises.

The  question now is this: who are responsible  for

these   labour  troubles?  Some  people   say   the

Communists are responsible. When I spoke to some of

these   workers,   they   admitted   that,   viewed

selfishly, they liked these labour troubles because

at  the  end  of  every strike they  gained  higher

wages. One cannot but view sympathetically when  we

look  at  the problems simply from that angle.  But

they  have  to see that if by getting  an  increase

they  thereby  penalise their unemployed  sons  and

daughters,  that price may be too high.  I  suggest

that, instead  of  viewing this problem  from  two

sides - we  usually  talk  about  two  sides   to   a

question - we  should  view it this  time  from  four

sides.  There is the viewpoint of the  workers.  We

are  all very much in favour of giving them  higher

and  higher  wages.  The Government  has  a  grouse

against  me  in particular because I have  kept  on

digging at them because of the pay-cuts. We are all

in  favour, if the Government earns more, it  gets

more revenue, and we want better treatment for  the

employees.  In the same way, if the employers  earn

more  and  make more profits, we want higher  wages

for their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look at it from the point of view of the

merchants, the investors, the capitalists. If  they

dump  money  into  Singapore, they expect  returns.

Just  two weeks ago, a man was telling me  that  he

was  building a factory. I asked him, "Where?" "Not

in  Singapore," he said. Where? Johore Bahru.  That

means  more  employment for the people  across  the

causeway  and not enough employment, for  us  here.

Naturally, the investors look at it from the  angle

of profits themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at it from the point of view of the

unemployed. I sometimes wonder whether they  should

not  be allowed to organise themselves into another

trade  union in this situation where in  their  own

interests,  if  industrial unrest  reaches  a  high

proportion,  they could demand that the  Government

should  step  in  and compel every  dispute  to  be

submitted to arbitration. Perhaps when we  look  at

it  in  that  light from the point of view  of  the

unemployed, we see reason, we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



see that there is need for another approach to this

problem,  not merely for ourselves, but of  service

to the unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what about the other people the general

public?  The  general public suffer inconvenience.

The  general public are made up of not only  people

who  are unemployed, but they are also made  up  of

the  wives and children of the strikers. I remember

talking to one trade union leader who led a  strike

in  the  Singapore Traction Company for  over  five

months  and the Communists supplied him with  money

to enable him to go on with the strike. But he said

a  year  after that when he had seen the sufferings

of the wives of the strikers and their children, he

decided that thereafter if he could find a  way  of

solving  a deadlock without a strike, he  would  do

it.  The  strike would be  the last weapon  and  the

last  resort, because innocent people would be made

to  suffer.  I  hope, Sir, that  we  look  at  this

problem  of industrial unrest therefore not  merely

from  the  view  point  of  the  workers  and   the

businessmen, but also from the point of view of the

unemployed in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say it is natural that in a strike

there  is a clash of interests. Any political Party

must  be  on the side of the workers, it is agreed.

But  let  us  look at it from another angle,  using

another approach. Why should the interests  of  the

workers and the employers clash? Are not these two

like  the  wings of a bird? If we damage one  wing,

what  happens to the bird? It cannot fly any more.

if  we can look at it in that way, that workers and

employers both play important parts, that both  are

like  the wings of a bird, and if both are  equally

strong and cooperating, the bird can fly to greater

heights  and Singapore can reap greater prosperity,

and  this  prosperity  can  be  shared  among  more

people.  The unemployed will have a chance in  life

and  the young people coming out from schools  will

have  a future they can look forward to. If we  can

look  at  it from that point of view, Sir, then  we

can  have  a  hope  of  solving  this  problem   of

industrial unrest. But if we look at it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



from the point of view of a political struggle,  if

one  Party must outbid the other Party, then,  Sir,

God help the unemployed.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, industrial unrest is

not  peculiar  to  Singapore. It is  a  feature  of

industrialised  or  industrialising  societies  all

over the world, in England today, the Government is

faced with balance of payments difficulties, and to

offset  inflationary  pressures  for  general  wage

increases,  has  refused civil service  claims  for

improvements in pay and conditions, with the result

that teachers, local government employees technical

staff, postal clerks and civil service clerks,  who

are  the  traditional moderates of the trade  union

movement  in  England, have been  forced  into  the

front line of the industrial battle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strike can arise for a variety of reasons and

not  necessarily because of a dispute  about  wages

and  conditions  of  work. In the  B.O.A.C. strike

which  took place last July, the engineering  staff

were   up  in  arms  against  the  reorganisational

programme  of the management with which  the  union

disagreed,  even though the management could  prove

that  in  the  reorganisation, not a single  worker

would  lose  his  job.  The P.A.P.  Government  has

consistently  been pro-worker. The first  thing  we

did  as  a Government was to amend the Trade  Union

Ordinance to give the Registrar of Trade Unions the

power  to  cancel the registration of trade  unions

who  were  splinter or yellow unions and to  refuse

registration to dissident groups who sought to  set

up    breakaway   unions.   This   prevented    the

manipulation  of  the  trade  union   movement   by

unscrupulous employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing we did was to ensure that the

labour  laws  were  enforced.  All  employers  were

required  to send in returns of their employees  to

the  Ministry  and  whenever a report  reached  the

Ministry  that  the  labour  laws  were  not  being

observed, an inspector was sent round to make an on-the-spot enquiry. If the enquiry disclosed that  an

employer   was  not  observing  the  labour   laws,

immediate action was taken to compel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



compliance.  The Labour Court was strengthened  and

employees who were wrongfully dismissed or who were

denied the benefits of the labour legislation  were

given  every facility to claim payments in lieu  of

arrears of overtime pay and annual leave which  had

been denied to them. A sum of more than $1½ million

was  recovered  from employers for the  benefit  of

their employees in this way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the unions, legislation was enacted to

make it obligatory for all collective agreements to

be registered with the Industrial Arbitration Court

and   every  registered  collective  agreement   is

published  in  the  Government Gazette.  Where  the

parties  fail  to reach agreement,  the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court,  which  is  constituted  by  an

independent Chairman and two members, each of  whom

is  drawn  from  a  panel of  employers  and  union

nominees,  is empowered to take evidence  from  the

disputing  parties and to make an award.  Both  the

award  and  the  registered agreement  are  legally

enforceable by the Court. The Court has  the  power

in   trade   disputes  to  fix   wages,   salaries,

allowances  and  other remuneration by  prescribing

time  rates, piece work rates, salary scales, bonus

payments, severance pay, retirement benefits, or to

make  other prescriptions which it considers to  be

appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the same legislation provides ample

machinery for conciliation when a trade dispute  is

threatened  or  arises and recourse to  arbitration

can  be  had  by a joint request by the  contending

parties  or  by a reference of the dispute  to  the

Court  by  the  Minister and, in the  case  of  the

Government  service or the essential  services,  by

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period 15th September, 1960 to 31st

December,  1960,  eight awards  were  made  by  the

Industrial Arbitration Court in industrial disputes

and a total of 121 collective agreements covering a

total  of  36,269  employees  were  certified   and

registered  by  the Court. Up to  date,  there  are

eight  cases pending before the Court, two of which

are considered to be major disputes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates that the machinery for

conciliation and settlement of industrial  disputes

is being used by the bona fide union leaders in the

non-Communist unions. But these facts by themselves

do  not give us a true picture of what is happening

in the trade union field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 45 strikes and lockouts in 1960

involving  5,939 workers and 152,005 man-days  were

lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The split in the trade union movement between

unions affiliated to the S.A.T.U group of Communist-controlled  trade unions and unions not so  aligned

took  place in July last year. From the  1st  July,

1961,  to  the  31st  January,  1962,  there   were

altogether  96 strikes as compared to 27  only  for

the first six months of 1961. Of the 96 strikes, 69

were called by the unions affiliated to the S.A.TU.

group,  24  by unions not so aligned and  three  by

employees  not presented by any union.  Of  the  69 strikes  called  by  the S.A.T.U. group  of  trade unions,   25  strikes  involved  expatriate   firms whereas only six of the 24 strikes called by unions not   aligned   to   the  S.A.T.U. group   involved expatriate employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty of the 31 strikes against expatriate

employers  were  called by the  Singapore  Business

Houses Employees' Union, two by the Singapore Motor

Workshop  Employees'  Union and  one  each  by  the

Singapore  General Employees' Union, the  Singapore

Spinning  Workers'  Union and  the  Singapore  Shoe

Employees' Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The larger number of strikes called against

expatriate employers by the S.A.T.U. group of trade

unions is clearly indicative of an intention on the

part  of  the  leaders of this group of  unions  to

create dissatisfaction against foreign capital.  It

has been noticeable that whereas the pickets in the

strikes  called by the non-aligned group  of  trade

unions   were   comparatively  well  behaved,   the

behaviour  of  strikers in strikes  called  by  the

S.A.T.U. group  was  aggressive  and   offensive.

European   executives  of  the  firms  were   often

assaulted  and  subjected  to  various   forms   of

humiliation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison of the strike action taken by the

S.A.T.U. group of trade unions in the same  period

that the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



machinery for conciliation and settlement of  trade

disputes has been working for the benefit  of  bona

fide  trade unionists .shows clearly that there  is

ample  machinery provided by law for the settlement

of  trade disputes where these disputes spring from

genuine grievances; hut where the industrial unrest

is  simulated  and created for political  purposes,

the  Communists invariably resort to direct  action

by-passing the conciliation machinery available  to

them  and  forcing  settlements by  way  of  direct

strike action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is done in defiance of Government policy for

the  promotion of industrial peace with justice and

lends support to the forecast of the Prime Minister

in  this  House  on the 20th July,  1961,  when  he

pointed out that after the open split of the P.A.P.

there  was  a  possibility that the  pro-Communists

would   mount  an  offensive  in  the  labour   and

industrial  and  other fields. I would  refer  hon.

Members to Legislative Assembly Debates, Volume 14,

No. 23.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the question of industrial unrest,

we  must  therefore be very careful to  distinguish

genuine  industrial unrest from  industrial  unrest

simulated or created for political purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the S.A.T.U. group of pro-Communist trade

unions  are always seeking to do is not to  advance

the  interest  of the workers per  se  as  this  is

always  to them a subsidiary consideration  hut  to

convert genuine grievances into political campaigns

against  the Government. For instance, in the  case

of   the   Robinson's  strike  there  was   genuine

provocation offered to the workers by the  employer

but  Messrs. Dominic Puthucheary and company  never

intended   to  take  the  dispute  to  the   Labour

Ministry. Strike Acton was taken, the main business

entrance of the company was obstructed and when the

police  had  to  remove  the  picketers  who   were

illegally   obstructing  the  entrance  under   the

pretence  that they were picketing, a demonstration

was  mounted against the police and the Government.

There were many witnesses of this demonstration and

when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



the  police  vans  turned up  for  the  purpose  of

removing  those who were illegally obstructing  the

main entrance. Dominic Puthucheary was seen by mans

to  urge  all the strikers to get into  the  police

vans to go to the police station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prosecution was brought against those who were

guilty  of  obstruction but  this  prosecution  was

later  withdrawn by the State Advocate-General  as,

on  a  closer  examination of the case,  the  State

Advocate-General thought that the strikers had been

misled   into  their  foolish  actions  by  Dominic

Puthucheary and company.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> To save the Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Sir, it was not to save the Prime

Minister.  There  were a lot of  witnesses  to  all

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the new situation created on the

industrial  front by the leaders  of  the  S.A.T.U.

group  of  Communist-controlled trade  unions,  the

Ministry  of Labour has strengthened the Industrial

Relations  Department by increasing the  number  of

experienced  conciliation  officers  from  4  to  9

officers as on 8th January this year, and,  at  the

same  time, new rules are being devised to regulate

peaceful  picketing  so that workers  will  not  be

victimised if they wish to work and not participate

in  such  strikes. Labour officials arc  posted  on

duty  at  establishments affected  by  strikes  and

police  assistance is sought whenever  violence  is

resorted  to  either  by the picketers  or  by  the

employers. As a result of the close watch  kept  on

these  establishments by labour officials, a number

of   prosecutions  have  been  instituted   against

employees  who  have  been  involved  in  acts   of

violence whilst picketing, and an employer has also

been  charged for assault of an employee  during  a

strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some employers, too, have failed to learn that

their disputes can be processed in accordance  with

the   provisions   of   the  Industrial   Relations

Ordinance.  We  have seen recently  a  bad  example

which the members of the Exchange Banks Association

have set by refusing clearing facilities to members

of the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



whenever there was an industrial dispute in one  of

their  associated  banks. This was  done  to  bring

pressure on the union to get a settlement on  their

terms  without  any  regard to the  merits  of  the

union's  claims. They would have been the first  to

complain  that  the union was acting  irresponsibly

and  unreasonably if it decided to call out all its

workers  whenever  there was an industrial  dispute

with any member of the Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has drawn the attention

of  the  House  to Table IV of the  Report  of  the

President  of the Industrial Arbitration Court,  in

which  eight  pending  cases  are  listed,  and  to

section 29 of the Ordinance which requires cases to

be  heard  expeditiously by the Court.  The  latest

information  I have received in a letter  from  the

President of the Court dated 16th March is that the

number  of  pending cases has been reduced  as  the

least  important of these cases are presently being

dealt with. No new cases have been notified to  the

Court and he expects the Straits Times case to  end

within  a fortnight and the only other big case  is

the  Standard  Vacuum  Oil Company  case  which  is

expected to begin on the 19th May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has also referred to the

strike  of  the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation

and  suggested that if a Board of Enquiry had  been

appointed  under  section 7 of  the  Ordinance  the

strike might have been avoided. This strike, as  he

very  well knows, was not over wages and conditions

of service but because the management had attempted

to   deal  with  some  of  their  employees  on  an

individual  basis  at  a time  when  the  bank  was

negotiating  new  terms  with  the  Bank  Employees

Union.  The union had come to know about  this  and

had  asked  for  an expression of regret  from  the

management  and  an undertaking by  the  management

that  it would in future deal exclusively with  the

union.  But this request of the union was  refused,

with the result that the strike was called.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no question which could have been put

to  a  Board of Enquiry for determination. The bank

eventually saw



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



the error of its ways and it has been reported that

a  sum  of  $30,000  was paid to  the  union  by  a

Director of the Bank to compensate the workers  for

the  period  when they remained away from  work.  I

cannot see how a hard-headed businessman could have

made  such a settlement with the union if the  bank

had been without blame.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has said that all trade

disputes  which are dead-locked should be  referred

to  the  Court for arbitration, but the Member  for

Anson has mentioned in this House that when he  was

Chief  Minister  and the Member for  Cairnhill  was

Minister  for  Labour and Welfare, the  Member  for

Cairnhill  had advised his Chief Minister  that  he

was  opposed to compulsory arbitration, because  he

was  of the view that nothing should be put in  the

way  to  prevent  the  unions  reaching  negotiated

agreements  with their employers even if industrial

action had to be resorted to for the purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill also referred to a

case  where a secret ballot was held but the  party

that   lost  in  that  secret  ballot  nevertheless

continued  to  strike. Sir, the  Labour  Department

concluded a total of 21 secret ballots since August

1959 to settle the question of union representation

in  all cases, the employers accepted the result of

the ballots and gave recognition to the union which

won  a  majority vote. Only in one case, the  union

with  a minority of votes continued to strike after

a  secret ballot had been conducted. This  was  the

Hwa  Heng  Rubber Company case and  eventually  the

company duly recognised the union that won  in  the

ballot.  The  strike was nevertheless continued  by

the  union representatives of the minority  of  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson referred to the loss of

earnings of the workers. He made the point that the

workers  got  a better deal when he was  the  Chief

Minister  than they get now. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

average  daily earnings of manual workers  in  1955

was  74  cents  as  against  65  cents  in  1954 - an

increase of nine cents. In the last six years,  the

hourly  earnings  have  increased  by  another  six

cents, that is, up to 80 cents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



per  hour.  Sir, there is a reason  given  for  the

increase  of  9  cents average hourly  earnings  of

workers from 1954 to 1955, and our economist  tells

us  that  this  is  probably due  to  the  economic

effects on wage earnings felt as late as 1955 after

the boom in trade as a result of the Korean war  in

1951-52.  Sir,  reasons have  been  given  for  the

gradual  increase of the hourly rate from  1955  to

1961, and it is suggested that after 1955 there was

a   gradual   decline  in  trading  conditions   in

Singapore  resulting from the  world  recession  in

trade which reached its height in 1958. This caused

many   establishments  in  Singapore  to   retrench

workers, others to close down and workers were  put

on  a  rotation basis. There were also restrictions

on   trade   imposed  by  neighbouring   countries,

particularly Indonesia, which affected  the  rubber

milling industry and the copra industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we as a Government have implemented our

policy of industrial peace with justice, and  since

we have been in Government, we have done everything

to advance the cause of the workers without killing

private  enterprise, on which the entrepot  economy

of Singapore is based. We have not been able to put

an  end  to  the  exploitation of  the  workers  by

unscrupulous  employers, but we  have  reduced  the

opportunities  for  their  exploitation  and   have

ensured  that all workers get the benefits  of  the

labour  laws  which  have been  enacted  for  their

protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to take immediate action to plug the

loop-holes  in  the  present  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance which enable the had employers as well as

the pro-Communists in the S.A.T.U. group to by-pass

the lawful channels of conciliation, settlement  or

arbitration which have been placed at the  disposal

of  all bona, fide trade unions and good employers.

The   recommendations  of  the  President  of   the

industrial Arbitration Court are now being  closely

studied  by Government and action will be  taken  to

give  effect  to  the  improvements  which  he  has

suggested.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Anson said earlier on, in moving his amendment

to  the  motion,  that he wanted  to  restore  some

semblance of balance to the industrial picture.  On

this    we   heartily   agree   with   him.    But,

unfortunately, the Member for Anson has now  helped

the  Member  for  Cairnhill in exciting  a  hit  of

hysteria in this industrial unrest, as he calls it.

By  enumerating a whole list of strikes, lock-outs,

man-days   lost,  and  what-nots  the  Member   for

Cairnhill as well as the Member for Anson have been

trying  to  give  us a picture of grave  industrial

turmoil  in  Singapore. In a way,  Sir,  we  cannot

blame  the  Member for Anson for  saying  that  the

speech  of the Member for Cairnhill had a touch  of

hysteria,  because we do know the  forces  and  in-wrests that he represents. The Member for Anson has

called the Member for Cairnhill a capitalist.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> A born capitalist.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> A born capitalist. But in

truth,  Sir, he is more a capitalist agent  than  a

real  capitalist, although we also know that  since

he has acquired some wealth, he has also become  a

capitalist of sorts.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If the hon. Member will show

me  where my wealth is, I shall be very grateful to

him. I could then have three meals a day instead of

two.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I did not know whether he

wants  me  to  tell  him  right  now,  Sir,  but  I

understand he has acquired some shares in a housing

estate. I do not know how true that is - he can  deny

or confirm it [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Cairnhill wish

to rise further on a point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In fact, the Member for Anson

was  quite surprised because he knows that  in  our

present  society, workers are defenceless,  and,  I

quote  him,  Sir,  "in the face  of  the  power  of

capital  can only seek protection in the  unity  of

their trade union movement." Sir, how true that is.

But apparently this self-evident truth has now been

forgotten  by  the P.A.P. Government. That  workers

have   to  struggle  at  heavy  odds  against   the

capitalists is a painful fact known to all workers.

The  workers  know  from their own  experience  the

difficulties  they  have  to  face  and  the  class

struggle  they have to undergo in order  that  they

may earn enough to keep themselves, their wives and

their  children from starvation, and in order  that

they may raise their standard of living. Getting  a

small   increase  in  wages  from   the   rapacious

capitalist  who  is making a huge profit  sometimes

can be as difficult and as impossible as trying  to

squeeze blood out of a stone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless the struggle goes on unceasingly and

unremittingly.  As  has been  pointed  out  by  the

Member   for  Anson,  it  goes  on  in  all  modern

countries - in  the  United States  of  America, the

United  Kingdom.  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Japan,

France; all over the world. And it goes on also  in

Malaya and in Singapore. Thousands and thousands of

man-days  are  lost,  usually not  because  of  the

workers  wanting  it  but because  of  the  stupid,

unreasonable   and   stubborn   attitude   of   the

capitalists  and  the employers  in  resisting  the

legitimate demands of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, because of the struggle of the

workers,  we  now  have  the Member  for  Cairnhill

expressing grave concern, as he calls it,  for  the

so-called  industrial unrest, and which the  Member

for   Anson   has   earlier  on   called   "public

manifestations  of industrial dissatisfaction".  Of

course,  Sir, "public manifestations of  industrial

dissatisfaction"   is  an  ingenious   phrase   and

certainly   is  a  phrase  more  appropriate   than

"industrial unrest". Because when one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



talks  of  industrial unrest, one is  automatically

led to think of quelling the unrest, and this would

suit  the P.A.P. very much and lots of other people

besides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, there is undoubtedly a large

section of workers bubbling over with their pent-up

dissatisfaction. This is not a difficult  thing  to

recognize.  All  we  have to do  is  just  to  look

around. Neither is this the thing which we all need

express  grave concern or alarm about. And a  false

alarm,  Sir,  is  not  only  mischievous  but  also

misleading to all concerned, and it will  certainly

do  nobody any good. Except, of course, people  who

want to suppress the legitimate aspirations of  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is easy to paint a horrifying picture of

the  labour turmoil in Singapore today. All one has

to do is to point an accusing finger at the workers

and  their  trade  unions,  or  their  trade  union

leaders, and then start listing the crimes and  the

sins  of  the  workers, the number of strikes  that

have taken place, the number of man-days lost,  the

damage  done  to  the economy of  the  island,  the

fright  and  the  flight of capital  on  which  the

workers  depend for their employment and  survival,

and  so  on  and so forth. The vicious forces  will

perhaps be quick to say - and on this the Member  for

Anson  has joined in in quickly mouthing  the  same

platitude - that  this  is all caused  by  subversive

elements  and the Communists. From this  reasoning,

Sir,  it  would  appear  that  had  there  been  no

Communists and such people, there would  have  been

no  strikes and no industrial unrest. What a simple

solution it would be if only it were true. All  you

have to do is to finish off the subversives and the

Communists  and  you  get rid of - according  to  the

Minister for Finance - the labour plague. The trouble

is  this:  this sort of simple formula simply  does

not  exist,  and  it  can never work.  Whether  the

Communists and the subversives are finished off  or

not,  labour will forever be in ferment,  at  least

until we get a more equal and just society.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Member for Cairnhill and

also  the  Member  for Anson  both  called  on  the

Government to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure

industrial   peace.  What  are  these   "reasonable

steps"? According to the Member for Cairnhill, the

rule of law must replace the rule of the jungle -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Correct.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and that is achieved by

improvement   in   the   conciliation    machinery.

Conciliation,  he  says, is the biggest  factor  in

ensuring industrial peace, and towards that end  he

suggests giving additional stair to the Arbitration

Court,   introducing   amending   legislation    as

suggested   by  the  President  of  the  Industrial

Arbitration   Court,  and  getting   more   trained

conciliators  in the Labour Department.  I  do  not

doubt  that all these measures would help to remove

the  present delay and dissatisfaction in the  work

of arbitration and conciliation in labour disputes.

But   will   these  measures  really  bring   about

industrial peace? If the Member for Cairnhill is so

naive as that, what is the correct approach?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Register S.A.T.U.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> How do we bring about

industrial  peace? Conciliation only  relieves  the

symptom. It will not cure the disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the correct approach to this problem is to

try  to  find out the real root cause of  what  the

Member  for cairnhill in hysteria calls "industrial

unrest",  and  what  the  Member  for  Anson  terms

"industrial dissatisfaction". Only then can we hope

to  arrive at a sound and .sane solution as to  how

industrial  dissatisfaction may be  diminished  and

ultimately   done   away  with.  Diagnosis   before

treatment has always been our guiding principle  in

medical  practice. This axiom similarly applies  to

what  we  are  discussing today.  That  the  motion

asking for industrial peace is moved by none  other

than the Chief Minister of the previous government.

who was also its Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



for  Labour and Social Welfare, cannot but make one

doubt  the real motives behind this motion. For  we

must  ask, what is the ulterior motive behind  this

motion?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Prosperity for all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Does the Member for Cairnhill

imply that the workers of Singapore should go  down

on  their bended knees and thank the gods that they

now  have the jobs that they are holding?  Does  he

imply  that they should not seek or fight for their

rights through their own trade unions with all  the

legitimate means at their disposal? Does  he  imply

that  it  is not the capitalists and the  employers

but  the  workers who should be blamed for the  so-called troubles in the industrial field!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that when the Member for

Cairnhill  was  in power, he had pursued  a  policy

which  was  pro-capitalist  and  anti-worker   with

unprecedented  vehemence.  He  was   then   perhaps

greatly  inspired by the Concept of  the  so-called

affluent democracy of America and West Germany, not

unlike  our  present Minister for  Finance  who  is

inspired by the militarist capitalists of Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member has referred to the

militarist capitalist system in Japan. We know  who

the  capitalists are. Could the Member say who  the

Japanese militarists are, how strong they are,  and

to   what  extent  they  control  policy  in  their

country?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised that the

Minister  for  Finance should ask a  question  like

that.  He  just went to Japan only a  little  while

ago. He should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



know  all  the answers. It is best that  he  should

tell us rather than that we try to tell him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this policy of the previous Government

was   translated  into  practice,  with  the  tacit

agreement,  at  that  time, of  Lee  Kuan  Yew  and

company, it came to mean legalised violence against

the  mainstream  of  the trade  union  movement  in

Singapore.  It  meant arbitrary  arrests  of  trade

unionists  under the pretext of fighting  so-called

subversion. It meant deportation of trade unionists

and untold hardship for hundreds of families.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Created by you and your

Communists!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It meant the closing down of

trade unions. As the saying goes, Sir, they created

a  wilderness  and they called it  the  "industrial

peace"  of the Member for Cairnhill. In fact,  Sir,

it  was an industrial peace imposed with power  and

force from above, that is, the rich and the foreign

capitalists -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, will the Member inform

us  who  has led him to this revealing analysis  of

events  which took place when he was not interested

in politics?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Since when, Sir, I have

learned, and learned, a great deal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Who?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Definitely not from the Prime

Minister   of  Singapore.  Of  course,  the   Prime

Minister  of Singapore is omniscient. He knows  all

the  answers, except how to win the hearts  of  the

people. That is his greatest fault, and that is the

whole  trouble with him. Now he is trying  to  sell

away the rights of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Sir, when I was interrupted, that

the  rich and the foreign capitalists were  sitting

pretty because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



trade  union movement was suppressed. In fact,  the

labour  policy of the Member for Cairnhill and  his

record  as Labour Minister are best remembered  for

his  hatred for, and his reckless violence against,

the  legitimate trade union movement of  Singapore.

Now  this man is crying for industrial peace.  Does

he  mean the same type of industrial peace which he

imposed on the workers when he was in power? Is he

trying  to  encourage the type of industrial  peace

advocated by the Minister for Finance on his return

from Japan when he said that Government should deal

firmly with the workers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Both - employers and workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think I need any

that the Minister for Finance -

also gets completely out of order. When the Speaker

is  speaking,  he must be quiet. He obviously  does

not  wish  to give way to the Minister for Finance.

So  the Minister for Finance cannot say a thing  at

the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If it is a point of order, it must

out of order. Is it a point of order!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. Sir, the Member for

Queenstown quoted from a statement I made  after  E

returned from Japan. Is it in order for the  Member

misleading the House on what I actually  did  say?

Would that be in order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suppose it is a tactic which is

used by many politicians. The Minister for Finance,

of   course,   will   have   the   opportunity   of

contradicting the Member's statement. Even after he

has  spoken,  there is provision  in  the  Standing

Orders  for  him  to speak again  if  he  has  been

misunderstood.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, would it be in order for

me to request the Member for Queenstown to read the

full statement?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. As I

have  indicated, the Minister for Finance  will  be

able  to  correct any misimpression that  has  been

given.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the Minister for

Finance  will have a lot to explain,  Sir,  and  he

will not be able to explain them away too. I do not

know if this is the motive behind this motion,  the

motive of the Member for Cairnhill. Anyway, I would

imagine  that it needs considerable courage  for  a

man to try and advise the Government on a matter in

which  he himself has proved to be a total failure.

The  Member  for Anson has hinted on  this  in  his

speech. Therefore, let us ask: Does the Member  for

Cairnhill really know the key to the labour problem

in  Singapore today? Does the S.P.A. really believe

that peace will prevail and tranquillity will reign

only  if  there  are a few more Arbitration  Courts

functioning?  What  does the Member  for  Cairnhill

mean  by  the  term "reasonable"? By  "reasonable",

does   he  mean  that  the  rich  and  the  foreign

capitalists should be pleased and that the  workers

should  be disappointed? Does he want to see  trade

unionists  put  behind bars and  the  trade  unions

dissolved? Does he want to see workers surviving at

the  mercy of rapacious employers and yellow  trade

unionists at large?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has learned from the mistakes of

the   S.P.A., and  though  there  is  hardly   any

difference today between the Prime Minister and the

Member for Cairnhill -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what you are hoping

for!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - at least in one respect

they  differ.  We  had occasion to  refer  to  this

before,  Sir,It is that the Prime Minister  has  a

much  better  command of the English language,  and

when he formulated his labour policy, it came to be

known   as   "industrial   peace   with   justice".

Industrial  peace  with justice! What  a  wonderful

phrase! For neither the capitalists nor the workers

can  disagree with this perfect terminology.  Peace

and  justice  are what the capitalists want.  Peace

and  justice are what the workers want. It  may  be

said  that, on the face of it, both the capitalists

and  the  workers  appear to have very  significant

common  ground  in this slogan of industrial  peace

with  justice. But peace and justice are not merely

things  of  absolute standard, things abstract  and

vague.  When  these  concepts are  translated  into

realities,  they  assume definite  forms  and  have

definite  meanings.  Thus  it  is  that  when   the

capitalists  and the employers talk  of  industrial

peace  they mean that the workers should  not  make

demands on them. They mean that the workers  should

be  obedient,  pliable and be  subservient  to  the

bosses. They mean that the workers should not  talk

of  joining  trade unions and ask for higher  wages

and  better working conditions. By industrial peace

they  also  mean,  of course, that  the  Government

should  be on the side of the employers,  that  the

Government  should not hesitate to put the  workers

in  their  places by using the police and  the  law

courts  on the workers, arresting their leaders  in

the  trade  unions,  and  dissolving  forcibly  the

working   class   organisations.   Sir,   to    the

capitalists, industrial peace means that, in  fact,

the  workers  and their trade unions should  be  so

weakened and so disorganised as not to be  able  to

assert themselves in any legitimate way. This  sort

of industrial peace confers on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



the  capitalists  and the employers  the  right  to

exploit,  bully, oppress and suppress the  workers,

and  this  was  the kind of industrial  peace  that

prevailed in Singapore during the lime of  the  Lim

Yew  Hock  Government. But it was industrial  peace

that was devoid of justice. This type of industrial

peace  is  a  dangerous peace, because the  pent-up

feelings  of the workers will inevitably burst  the

lid  wide open and disaster will inevitably follow.

So let us not lose our sense of proportion, because

industrial  peace  by itself is not  necessarily  a

virtue,  just  as  industrial  dissatisfaction   or

unrest is not necessarily a vice. By this, I do not

mean  to  suggest that I am in favour of industrial

unrest.  What I would like to say is  that  if  the

workers  can  no  longer tolerate their  oppressive

working conditions, then it is perfectly legitimate

and necessary that they organise themselves and try

to  do  something to improve their lot  within  the

framework  of the law. This is the basic  right  of

workers, a right now recognised the world over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody talks of industrial peace these

days,  but it is easier to talk of industrial peace

with  justice  than to carry it out. The  important

question  is:  justice for whom?  Justice  for  the

workers or justice for the employers? That  is  the

rub. If it is going to be justice for both then the

interests of both parties must be reconciled. It is

no  mean  task  trying to reconcile  two  different

poles   of   interests.  It  means  doing   justice

simultaneously  to  two  antagonistic  classes   of

people.  This  task is rendered more difficult  for

the simple reason that justice cannot be split into

halves.  You  cannot  have  half  justice  for  the

employers and half justice for the workers. It just

cannot be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present context of our society the

employers,    generally    speaking,    enjoy    an

overwhelming  advantage over the workers  and  more

often  than  not justice is denied to the  workers.

For  example,  what justice can there  be  for  the

workers  when their employers acquire the help  and

support  of  the  weighty  police  force  in  their

dealings with the workers? It is a recognised fact,

Sir, that the law is weighted heavily on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



side of the employers. Who does not know that it is

always  an  uphill battle to fight  against  social

prejudices and economic oppression? The Member  for

Anson  recognises  this.  But  do  the  Member  for

Cairnhill and the Government benches know this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We know more about this than

you will ever learn in your life time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> When they are about to topple,

arrogance. I think it is time they learn how to  be

humble - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, when the workers manage

to  pressure  the  employers  into  making  limited

concessions     through    their    trade     union

organisations,  a  struggle deemed  legitimate  and

healthy  by  the  Member for Anson, employers  will

work  themselves  up  into fits  and  frenzies  and

accuse  the workers of bringing chaos and disorder.

Newspapers, particularly the Straits Times,  owned

by  foreign  capital - this was quoted by the  Member

for  Anson; if you will remember, Sir, he  said  it

was entirely due to the malice of newspapers and it

can  only  be  the  malice of  English  newspapers,

because  the  Member for Anson does  not  read  any

other  newspaper but English newspapers, and  there

is  only one English newspaper until recently,  and

that  is the Straits Times - will play up the  theme

of  the so-called organised irresponsibility of the

workers of Singapore. The Member for Anson has said

correctly  about the malice of newspapers  and,  of

course,   the   pro-colonial   and   pro-capitalist

politicians  like the Members from  the  S.P.A. - the

Member   for   Cairnhill,  and   the   Member   for

Tanglin - will  jump in and join in the  brow-beating

of the poor workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the unemployed?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yet when the trade union

movement  is knuckled under and suppressed,  not  a

murmur  is  heard.  They then  call  it  industrial

peace.  Is this not a mockery, an irony, the  peace

of  the  wilderness?  It is important,  therefore,

that  the  P.A.P. Government makes  its  policy  of

industrial  peace  with justice  a  meaningful  and

living  reality  especially with reference  to  the

workers who, in their unfortunate position  in  our

society  today, are yet to receive a just and  fair

share of the fruits of their labour. Of course, for

this  to  take place, for a just and fair share  of

the  fruits  of  their labour to be   given  to  the

workers,  it will have to mean that the  Government

that implements the policy of industrial peace with

justice  must necessarily he a worker's government.

It will mean that the aim of the Government must be

to  encourage  and  to build up a strong  socialist

movement both in the trade union field as  well  as

in the political field so as to realise a socialist

society within the shortest possible time. It  will

mean  that the Government, with the cooperation  of

the   trade  union  movement, should  allow   free

enterprise  to  function before  the  coining  into

being  of  a socialist society, provided such  free

enterprise  does  not  hamper  the  growth  of  the

socialist  movement in general and the trade  union

movement in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the pre-requisites if the policy

of  industrial peace with justice is  to  become  a

meaningful and living reality as far as the  people

are concerned. Then the workers will not be unhappy

even  if  it  means  that  they  have  to  exercise

restraint in their organised efforts and even if it

means  that  they  have  to  put  up  with  certain

temporary hardships. Because the workers will  then

know  that the Government is really On their  side.

They will know that the Government will work in the

interests  of  the welfare of the people  and  will

need  their  help in the struggle ahead,  and  they

will  then place their trust and confidence in  the

Government  when they have no reason to  doubt  its

sincerity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such conditions existed at one time, or so

the  workers thought. Thus it was that there was  a

period  of  industrial stability and calm following

the general elections in June 1959. Because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



the   workers  of  Singapore  in  the  trade  union

movement  thought and also felt at that  time  that

they   had  created  a  pro-labour  government;   a

government which they then felt confident would  do

justice  to  labour  a  government  that  had  also

pledged  to work hand-in-hand with the trade  union

movement   towards  bringing  about  the   earliest

establishment  of a socialist society.  Of  course,

there  were  sporadic cases of  workers  showing  a

tendency  to  over-exuberance as a  result  of  the

resurgence of their organised power. But  then  the

union  leadership  had  gone  out  of  its  way  to

exercise a restraining influence on the excesses of

trade unions in industrial matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this post-election period was also the time

when  the  employers did make efforts  to  readjust

themselves to the new political situation. They had

to   readjust   themselves  to  the  realities   of

industrial  democracy  and to  the  growth  of  the

socialist  trade  union movement in  Singapore.  In

such  a  situation the Government had no difficulty

at  all  in  maintaining industrial stability.  The

Prime   Minister   conveniently   attributed    and

arrogated  all  the  industrial  stability  to  the

P.A.P.'s  wonderful and sagacious  Government.  But

unfortunately the confidence of the workers and  of

the  trade  unions cannot be  gained by lip  service

and tricky manoeuvres. If the workers are convinced

that  the Government is only interested in its  own

selfish  political  gains, that  it  is  no  longer

interested in working together with the trade union

movement  for the building up of a strong socialist

movement,  that  it intends to depend  entirely  on

foreign   capital   to  solve   the   problems   of

unemployment difficulties, and that it  intends  to

advance the interests of foreign capitalists at the

expense  of the interests of the workers and  their

trade  unions, then the Government ceases to  be   a

government on the workers' side. It then ceases  to

be a workers' government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, industrial peace with justice has

become a meaningless and an empty slogan. In  spite

of  what  the Minister for Health and Law has  said

and  his  efforts at trying to give a list  of  the

good  things  the P.A.P. has done for the  workers,

the  P.A.P. has lost the confidence of the workers.

Everybody



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



knows the P.A.P. Government is no longer interested

in  doing justice to the workers of Singapore.  All

its talk of wanting social security as revealed  by

the  Minister  for Finance shows how one-sided  the

Government has become. The Minister for Health  and

Law  has  said  that  the P.A.P. is  a  pro-labour

Government  and a pro-workers' Government.  But  he

has very conveniently forgotten to mention that the

Government  has  banned  the  Federation  of  Trade

Unions,  has  not  lived  up  to  its  promise   of

unification  of the trade union movement,  and  has

withdrawn the Trade Union Bill which was passed  by

this  Assembly.  All these things  are  very,  very

conveniently forgotten. All the requisites for  the

successful   implementation  of   the   policy   of

industrial peace with justice are no longer present

in  Singapore  today. The P.A.P. Government  has  now

ceased  to  struggle  for  the  ultimate  goal   of

establishing  a socialist society. The  P.A.P. has

made   all   Left-wing   political   Parties    and

organisations its bitter enemies, whether  they  be

in  Singapore or in the Federation of Malaya or  in

the  Borneo  territories. The Socialist  Conference

recently  held  in  Kula Lumpur and  to  which  the

P.A.P. was  invited  had  to  pass  a  resolution

expelling  the  P.A.P. from  the  conference.   As

everybody  knows, the P.A.P. is now seeking  refuge

under  the banner of nationalism. The P.A.P. today

does not call itself a socialist Party any more. It

calls   itself  a  nationalist  Party.  Even   that

umbrella  will not save it from doom. Now following

its  change in policy, the P.A.P. Government  today

increasingly  allows  the  service  of  the   State

machinery  to  be  used by the  employers  for  the

Purposes  of  union-busting. We  see  nowadays  the

P.A.P. Government eagerly rushing the police force,

Labour  Ministry officials and even the law  courts

to  the help of the employers whose sole purpose is

to  break  the industrial action initiated  by  the

workers    through    their   own    trade    union

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a very curious phenomenon has arisen in

today's  curious political situation in  Singapore.

The   police  force,  hitherto  trained   for   the

oppression of labourers and of the Chinese-educated

is being used more and more to deal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



with   strikers  who  are  predominantly   English-speaking commercial workers and who happen also  to

be   members   of  the  Singapore  Business   House

Employees Union. The police are supposed to enforce

law  and  order as stipulated in the Trade Disputes

Ordinance,  a law which the P.A.P. had  pledged  to

amend  to the advantage of the working people.  But

now  the  police are more and more  being  used  to

break  strikes  and  to protect  non-union  workers

working  in strike-bound establishments. As regards

the  Labour Ministry, it is known to have  provided

facilities  so  that expatriate  personnel  may  be

employed  to overcome difficulties arising  out  of

industrial  action  initiated  by  English-speaking

commercial workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this clearly indicates that the P.A.P.

Government has indeed become anti-worker. I suppose

it  is  only a matter of time before the Government

will  even  go  so far as to recruit blacklegs  and

provide   them  with  the  facilities   of   police

protection in order that they may go to work  in  a

strike-hound establishment and so break  a  strike,

all because the organised workers do not see eye to

eye   with  the  Government -  a  discredited  P.A.P.

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is quite clear, as I have said, that the

Government  has  gone  over  to  the  side  of  the

employers. It finds more and more things in  common

with the capitalists and their Right-wing political

representatives, and less and less things in common

with  the  workers  and their  Left-wing  political

representatives.  I  have no hesitation  in  saying

that  the  P.A.P. Government, contrary to its  past

protestations,  is today pro-capitalist  and  anti-worker.  It  is  only a matter of time  before  the

P.A.P.  Government  goes all Out  in  resorting  to

repressive measures like those of the Lim Yew  Hock

Government  to maintain their so-called  industrial

peace. The Minister for Finance hinted as much when

he said that the Government should deal firmly with

the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see at the present moment late efforts being

made  by  the  P.A.P. Government  and  its  Finance

Minister  to induce Japanese capitalists to  invest

in  this country. The Minister for Finance  on  his

return from Tokyo on the 10th of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



this month made a statement of censure against  the

trade union movement. He said that the local labour

in  Singapore was the key to Japanese investment in

Singapore. By that he meant that the conduct of the

trade   union  movement  constituted  the  greatest

obstacle  to foreign capital coming into  Singapore

for industrial investment. I would like to ask him,

why  must  he  blame the labour situation?  Is  not

political instability the real cause of the lack of

industrial investments? Surely he should know  that

the real plague on economy is -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - political instability and the

about-to-topple position of the P.A.P.  Government.

It is the distrust and the lack of confidence in  a

discredited  Government in  an  unstable  political

situation  that  is the cause of non-investment  in

the industrial field. And crying Communism with the

object  of isolating the Barisan Sosialis will  not

help matters. That is why I have said that what the

Member for Anson has touched on is not conducive to

industrial   peace.  It  can   only   help   P.A.P.

propaganda. In fact, crying Communism will actually

help to frighten away whatever investment there  is

that  may want to come to Singapore. This  fact  is

very  important  and  I wonder  if  the  Government

realises it. There is even an editorial comment  in

the  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh a week or so  ago  on  this

matter.  The  Government should  really  look  into

this.  It  will  not help the industrialisation  of

Singapore   and   it  will  not   help   to   solve

unemployment in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one important fact that the P.A.P.

Government seems unable to understand. It  is  that

the  capitalists  are always on  the  look-out  for

opportunities  to  pressure  the  Government   into

taking  anti-labour  measures.  Such  measures,  of

course, will allow them to exploit the workers  and

blackmail  the  Government at the same  time.  When

there  was  industrial stability immediately  after

the  last general elections, the complaints of  the

capitalists then were that high wages



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



and  high  taxes  deterred  large-scale  industrial

investment by private foreign capitalists. Now that

the  P.A.P. has lost the confidence of the  workers

and  their  trade  unions, the  complaints  of  the

capitalists  are that the conduct of the  organised

workers constitutes the greatest deterrent to  such

investment. Well, the P.A.P. says the same thing as

the  capitalists say. Is this not evidence that the

P.A.P. is  already succumbing to the pressure  and

blackmail of foreign capitalists? Let us  ask,  how

can  such  a  Government achieve genuine industrial

peace  with  justice? Surely the  Government  knows

that  to achieve industrial peace with justice,  it

needs co-operation all round. As is well known  and

as  repeated  time and again by the P.A.P. in  the

past,  it takes three parties to achieve industrial

peace   with  justice - namely,  capital,  the  trade

unions  and the Government. Now with the Government

on  the  side  of the employers, how can  Singapore

have genuine industrial peace with justice? Let the

Government explain. As far as foreign employers are

concerned,  they need very little encouragement  in

their  policy  of  exploitation and  oppression  of

workers. Their conduct has been largely governed by

two  main factors - the political situation  of  the

day and the attitude of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is common knowledge that whenever there

is   political   uncertainty,  the  employers   are

inclined  to flex their muscles before the workers.

We  may still recall the speeches made by the Prime

Minister immediately after the 1956 purge  when  he

launched  very scathing attacks on employers  like

the  Naval Base authorities and the Tay Koh Yat Bus

Company.  That  was  the time when  many  employers

thought  fit  to mount a capital offensive  against

labour, especially when the trade unions and  their

leaders   had  been  severely  curbed.  A   similar

political uncertainty prevails today in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of talk about Malaysia and

this  so-called  merger between Singapore  and  the

Federation.   The  encouragement   employers   have

received from statements made by political  leaders

in the Federation is considerable,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



particularly when the Government Ministers say that

there have been far more strikes than are desirable

and   that  the  Federation  Government  will   not

tolerate  the existence and expansion of the  trade

union  movement in Singapore. May I refer, Sir,  to

the  statement made by the Tunku and printed by the

Straits  Times on 12th January, saying  that  after

merger  "we  will  try  to  reduce  the  number  of

strikes."  These were the words of the Tunku,  Sir.

"I  do not know how he will do it, but our Minister

of  internal Security will do it." Such words!  And

this  statement,  by the way, also  clearly  proves

what  we  have said all along. The P.A.P. has  been

trying to tell the people that there is autonomy in

this  White Paper merger of theirs. This  statement

of  the Tunku proves conclusively that there is  no

autonomy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Communist subversion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - in labour in this P.A.P.

merger,  and therefore all this talk about autonomy

is a bluff, and a deception on the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not follow that. The

Barisan want it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I understand many

capitalists nowadays think that the time  has  come

at  last for them to be no longer placed under  any

restriction. They feel that they need no longer put

up with the so-called nonsense of the employees and

the  trade  unions, and they feel  that  they  must

uphold   and   defend  their  so-called  management

rights.  Sir, I am told provocation from such  type

of  employers  constitutes a rich source  of  trade

disputes. The point is that such employers  are  no

longer   afraid  of  creating  disputes  with   the

workers,  when they know full well that  they  have

the  State machinery, the Labour Ministry and  even

the law courts all on their side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the labour situation in Singapore today is

further  complicated by the Government deliberately

pursuing a policy of union rivalry. We all know for

a fact that it has always been the intention of the

P.A.P. to dominate and monopolise the trade  union

movement in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



The  pity  of  it  is that this aspiration  of  the

P.A.P. has turned out to be merely a pipe-dream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government's patronage of certain trade

unions  in Singapore is well known. Through Mr  C.

V.  Devan Nair (whose salary I believe is paid  out

of  State funds) and the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister  for Culture, together with  all  the

facilities  of the State machinery, the  P.A.P. is

trying to control as many trade unions as possible.

Thus you find certain pro-P.A.P. union boys running

around  trying their level best to outdo  the  main

stream  of  the  trade  union movement,  i.e.,  the

socialist  trade union movement. I understand  they

go  round  telling workers not to join unions  that

are  non-P.A.P. And I stress "non-P.A.P."  They  go

round  promising workers heaven on  earth  if  they

would  only  join the P.A.P. unions.  This  is  the

cause of many a strike in Singapore today. You will

remember  the recent City Council workers'  strike.

It was actually sparked off because of A.U.P.E., of

which  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  Culture  is its leader, fighting  against  the

trade  unions of the daily-rated workers. Everybody

knows  that  this is a clear case of union  rivalry

sponsored by the P.A.P. And because of the P.A.P.'s

policy  of  union rivalry, the people of  Singapore

were  greatly inconvenienced and the public  health

gravely endangered. When it was clear to the P.A.P.

union boys that the City Council workers could  not

be  broken, they quickly beat a retreat and covered

up  their  complete fiasco with a lot of  Communist

bogey  propaganda, and blaming the Barisan Sosialis

for the P.A.P.'s own machinations and intrigues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been in the P.A.P. for quite some time,

Sir, and we have learnt -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That we speak the truth.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the maze of thinking that the

triumvirate of the P.A.P. indulge in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Triumvirate?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Triumvirate, of course. The

Prime  Minister, the Minister for Finance, and  the

Minister for Culture - the triumvirate of the  P.A.P.

The others, well -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What others?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - I do not want to talk too much

about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No one will stop you. Carry

on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, in the situation facing

us  today,  we  feel confident that  the  socialist

trade  union  movement, with its virility  and  its

resilience,  will be able to adapt  itself  to  the

changing  circumstances. I am in complete agreement

with  Mr Foo Yong Fong, President of the Singapore

Business Houses Employees Union and Chairman of the

Pro-tem Committee of S.A.T.U., when he says in  his

recent statement -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are not building him up, are

you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is the chap who burns

people with cigarette butts, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I quote, Sir, from a

speech made -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister for

Finance is guilty of disorder. He is referring to a

case which is sub-judice. It is on appeal. I think.

He  should never mention anything concerning a case

which is sub-judice. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is a message by Mr Foo

Yong Fong, President, S.B.H.E.U., to all members on

the  eve of the New Year. Here is a passage and  it

reads:-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Who wrote it? Woodhull?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - it is on page 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The only sensible thing for us, therefore, is to

begin  the  year with a demonstration  of  goodwill

with  an expression of our determination to achieve

industrial stability. If employers are prepared for

serious  discussion,  they  shall  find  us   quite

serious. But if they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



want  a  trial  of  strength, they  shall  find  us

equally serious. It is with these thoughts  that  I

ask you to consider the coming year. It shall be  a

year  when we shall discharge our duties  with  far

greater calculation, It shall be a year when we can

afford more time for discussion' -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> True, that may be so.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`than for demonstration, more time for an

examination of the implications of all we  do  than

for a concentration on the mere act of doing.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Are you sure he wrote it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I quote this just to

inform those hotheads -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - in the P.A.P., the Police

Force,  and in the Labour Ministry that today  they

are facing very reasonable people. But in spite  of

all   this,  the  Government  is  placing  all  its

resources  en the side of employers with  only  one

aim  in view - to help employers break the strike  so

as  to  break the organised strength of the  unions

and  to  make sure that they also break the support

of all legitimate -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Peace-loving.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Peace-loving organisations

that are struggling very hard -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To survive.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - not to survive; they will

survive  at  any time - but to raise the standard  of

living of the poorer classes of people. That is the

thing  which  I hope the Minister for Finance  will

bear in mind, although I know things like this will

take quite some time to penetrate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I want to give them social

insurance, but they do not want it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, as for the employers, I

believe  they are practical people, and as such  it

would help matters all round if they understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



and  recognise  the legitimate role  of  the  trade

unions. This means that the employers should do all

they  can to promote industrial democracy in  their

establishments,  and  it  means  that  they  should

refrain  from  coercing  the  powers  that  be   to

restrict  the  fundamental rights  of  the  working

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we would also like to take this opportunity

to  inform  the  employers that, for  the  sake  of

industrial  peace  in Singapore, they  should  keep

themselves  away from the political ring.  If  they

use  their economic position in our economy to  try

to  play  havoc and try to subvert the trade  union

movement   and   thereby  hope  to  influence   the

political situation, then they are making  a  great

mistake.  Similar warnings were given by the  Prime

Minister  in  the hey-day when he was fighting  for

the rights of the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Under different

circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And I am merely repeating what

the  Prime  Minister  had himself  championed  with

great  gusto  at  that time. These employers  would

only be creating trouble for themselves as well  as

for  others.  There  would  then  really  be  chaos

because  mounting a capital offensive on labour  is

sheer stupidity, sheer unadulterated stupidity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Singapore situation of today, the

trade union movement is fully conscious that it has

to  contend with three hostile forces. They are (1)

the  P.A.P.  Government with its big stick  of  the

State machinery, the Police Force, the Prisons, the

Law  Courts,  Senior Crown Counsel,  all  the  top-notchers, and so-called "witnesses"; (2) the P.A.P.

union  boys  backed by the might of the  Government

and  also by the Government's Police Force; and (3)

the  employers  who  look upon  Malaysia  as  their

opportunity  for unleashing an attack on  the  main

stream of the trade union movement. If these  three

forces  flock  together and  join  forces  together

against the main stream of the trade union movement

in  Singapore,  then  there  will  be  trouble  for

everybody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under those circumstances, Sir, I have no doubt

that the people of Singapore will know wherein  lie

the  responsibility of industrial  unrest.  Let  us

hope that such a day will never arrive.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it was not my intention

to speak so early in the debate. But I feel that if

I  am  given an hour to produce certain  facts  and

figures, it may perhaps help the other speakers  of

the  Barisan Sosialis to come more directly to  the

point. As the Leader of the House has indicated, we

are  prepared to sit every night up till 12 o'clock

to  listen to one harangue after another, and  from

time  to  time, if we may, peacefully  make  a  few

comments, albeit humorously, on the futility of the

closed circuit mind. The speech that has just  been

read  out by the Member for Queenstown, and  I  say

accurately  read out by the Member for  Queenstown,

illustrates  the inability to think  out  of  fixed

classified situations. Governments that do not  toe

their line are always pro-employer, supporting  the

capitalists,  and using the police  to  coerce  and

intimidate the workers. Governments which  are  not

amenable  to  their  pressures  always  consist  of

desperate  men  who  are always  on  the  verge  of

toppling.   If   the   industrial   situation    is

unquestionably worse, it cannot be because  of  any

other  reason  connected with  the  unions  or  the

wisdom  of their leadership, but surely it must  be

because  the  employers have no confidence  in  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tragedy with the closed circuit mind is

simply this. It often produces contradictions.  One

of  the first contradictions I want to point out to

the Member for Queenstown is that he has to make up

his  mind. If as he or his ghost writers would like

us  to  believe, and like the people of  Singapore,

particularly the workers, to believe, we  are  pro-employer  and  pro-capitalist, and are  willing  to

employ  the  State machinery, that is, the  police,

the  courts and everything to crush and oppress the

workers, then surely this is an ideal situation for

the employers. On the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



other  hand,  they say employers  do  not  like  it

because there is no stability, created by the  same

instability  which  the  forces  behind  them  have

launched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion speaks of mounting of industrial

unrest.  Nobody has denied that. It is a  fact.  It

also talks of the Government's policy of industrial

peace  with  justice. There are certain  facts  and

figures  which have to be explained away  by  those

responsible  for the switch in the  policy  of  the

Communist sector of the trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole of 1960, there were only 5,939

workers  involved in strikes with a loss of 152,000

man-days, compare  this to the  five  months  from

August.  You will remember the fateful day when  we

sat here till the early hours of the morning of the

21st  of July. From August till December last year,

there were 39,000 workers involved in strike with a

loss  of 370,000 man-days. In other words, in  five

months,  after  the  break  following  Anson,   the

increase in the number of man-days lost is 120  per

cent extra, 220 per cent of the whole of 1960. This

is a fact, a fact for which I claim not much credit

in  predicting in July. What is all this about?  Is

there  a  change  in the industrial  situation?  Is

there  a  change  in policy of the Government?  Has

there  been  a  sudden  right about  turn - employers

sacking  people  all  over the place  and  becoming

unreasonable? A change took place in Anson when the

P.A.P. refused  to be brow-beaten  or  intimidated

into   taking  the  Communist-front  line  of   the

abolition of the Internal Security Council and full

internal self-government. Once we said merger,  the

fight  started  and  it  went  on  to  its  logical

conclusion.  The fight is still going  on,  not  an

industrial  fight,  but  a  political  fight  using

industrial means to coerce the Government and upset

the  economy. I suggest to the Member for Cairnhill

that  perhaps this Government, having the advantage

not  only of having seen what happened in the  last

seven  years since 1955, but also knowing the minds

and  the  workings of the Communist cadres  in  the

unions, is wise enough to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



treat  this basically as a political and not as  an

industrial problem. It is not the shortage  or  the

inadequacy  of  the machinery for conciliation  and

arbitration.  They are there. We can  quadruplicate

it  and we can improve it a hundred thousand times.

The   men  who  mount  this  unrest  have  not  the

slightest  intention of making use of  conciliation

or arbitration proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain that out of the 96 strikes called

last year, 69 or 72 per cent of them were called by

the  unions  connected  with  the  Communist  front

S.A.T.U.  As I have explained earlier, the majority

of  them  took  place  after August.  Let  me  just

compare  the  figures January/July last  year  with

August/December. In January/July, there were  2,400

workers  involved in strikes with a loss of  40,000

man-days  compared  to,  in  seven  months,   2,400

workers   and  40,000  man-days.  In  five   months

August/December,  39,000 workers and  370,000  man-days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I wonder whether the Prime Minister

will  clarify  how many man-days  were  lost  as  a

result of the City Council strike.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That may be so. I will give

the  figures  later on. I have not got the  figures

with me here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Find out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, and that was a strike

which  the  S.A.T.U. group tried  to  exploit.  We

frustrated  the attempts of the S.A.T.U. group  to

exploit it. Let us make no bones about

it.  The  Member  for Thomson's other  friend,  Mr

Rajendra, the co-Secretary in S.A.T.U., was  there,

bringing  up  the  S.G.E.U. strike,  getting   Mr

Dominic Puthucheary to try and fix up a few  things

here and there just to warm things up. There is  no

denial. There can be no denial. These are facts. We

are fully conversant with the methods and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



the technique, and the position cannot be resolved.

In  an  industrial  unrest  created  by  political

agitators  for  political  reasons,  it  cannot  be

solved  by  the industrial conciliation  machinery.

Let me further exp1ain, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these 69 strikes - these were unions connected

with the Communist front S.A.T.U. - none of them went

to arbitration. They did not want arbitration. They

wanted  a  fight, to slug it out, to have incidents

with  the  police,  to  have  incidents  with   the

employers,  to  try and sour up the  situation  and

show  the  workers, "Look at the Government - wicked,

cruel,  unjust." Two cases - Guthrie's and  William

Jacks' - had  to  be ordered by the Ministry  to  the

Arbitration  Court.  Only 15 cases  throughout  the

whole  period were referred to the Labour  Ministry

by   the   Business  Houses  Employees  group   for

conciliation. A minor puffing problem!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how these disputes are fought out,

"for  the benefit of the workers," says the  Member

for  Queenstown. I say, explain a few facts  away.

In  the  case  of  the Ford Motor  Engineering  and

Workshop  Employees Union, they went on strike  for

110  days  and lost pay for 110 days and  ended  up

with a seven-cent per day increase.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Six cents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Six cents. Just tell me, Mr

Speaker, Sir, and I hope Members on the other  side

will  explain, how many months, and how many  years

have  they to work to make up for the loss  of  pay

during the strike?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What about the People's

Association?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What about them? They were

stupid  and  ignorant enough to follow the  Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because they refused to obey

you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They were never organised

into  a union! They thought they could capture  the

Government,  coerce the Government and  rattle  the

Government.  The net result is they  are  going  to

lose. Many of them have found



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



other  jobs  because they have lost  faith  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis forming the next  government  and

winning the next victory. They have folded up. They

have  gone to look for other employment. Only those

who   are  not  good  enough  to  look  for   other

employment are still hanging around, hoping somehow

or  other that something may fall down from  heaven

or the Barisan may give something to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give them another example for the benefit

of  the workers. There were four Shaw disputes, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  None of them was  referred  to  the

Labour  Ministry even for conciliation, or  brought

to  the notice of the Labour Ministry. They did not

want the Labour Ministry to intervene. They went on

strike  for  33  days  for  an  overtime  claim  of

arrears.  A  33-day strike. They have not  got  the

arrears. What they have definitely sustained  is  a

loss of 33 days' wages. All they have succeeded  is

to  get  the  matter  referred to  the  Arbitration

Court,  which  they  could have done  and  achieved

without  a  strike of 33 days. It is a  defeat.  It

brought  misery and suffering to the workers.  They

thought, of course, why not increase the hostility?

Government  moves  in  with  the  police  in  steel

helmets and batons. It is not as simple as that. If

Members   on  this  side  were  innocent,   stupid,

guileless,   willing  tools   of   the   employers,

reactionary  capitalists,  then  perhaps.  But   no

amount  of  harangue can convince  the  workers  of

Singapore that they have never had a Government  so

good.  It  is  a  fact. They  have  never  had  the

employers  put in a position where they are  always

willing to talk, where reason and argument  is  the

only thing that can prevail. Now, Sir  -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is it convenient to suspend?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Perhaps I could speak another

five minutes and wind it up.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would suggest to the

directors behind the S.A.T.U. group that perhaps  a

repetition of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



technique against the Lim Yew Hock Government  will

not  bring the dividends it did when it is  against

the  P.A.P.  Government.  Police  action?  Law  and

order,  Sir, is maintained always with a more  than

reasonable  bias  in favour of the workers.  Police

action,  repression,  broken bones,  broken  heads,

fire  hoses? Never. But, of course, let me  be  the

first  to  admit  that it is the  business  of  the

police  to  prevent  people from  having  cigarette

butts stuck into their necks when they refuse to be

intimidated,  it  is  the duty  of  the  police  to

prevent  people from being assaulted  and  molested

when  they  refuse to join or are being intimidated

by  the unionists. But if the unionists want to  go

on  strike, let them. There is a limit beyond which

they cannot go, because beyond that limit the goose

is  killed, the workers are put out of jobs, and it

rebounds back on the union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for hysteria. Everybody knows

the  situation  is a political one and  has  to  be

settled  politically.  I am  glad  the  Member  for

Queenstown  has referred to the statement  made  by

the  Prime  Minister  of the Federation  about  the

number of strikes in Singapore. There are two kinds

of  strike,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. One  is  a  genuine

industrial  issue, not complicated  either  in  the

issue or in the pushing of it by political factors.

These  cases can find settlement, sometimes with  a

little bit of difficulty, through strikes and other

open methods of protest, but always inevitably they

end  up, with reason in arguments, in an agreement,

either with or without conciliation with the Labour

Ministry  or arbitration in the Arbitration  Court.

This  is  the  sector that is the autonomy  of  the

State  of  Singapore after merger. And  it  is  our

business, with the experience that we have  gained,

to make it really work. The principle of industrial

peace  with justice will work. There will  be  more

Arbitration  Courts. There will be more  reasonable

people  who will actually seek the welfare  of  the

workers  and of the people of Singapore. But  chaps

refuse  to have agreements which have any  finality

even  for  a  relative period of time, and  of  the

hundred over agreements made by the groups



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



connected  with  the  S.G.E.U. and  the   Business

Houses, there are only two cases that we have  been

able  to  discover, on going through  the  records,

where  there are salary scales. All the others  are

straight,  flat increases. After six months,  after

eight months, after a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The employers do not want it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have gone into that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> If the Prime Minister will take the

trouble to contact the Employers Federation and ask

them to confirm from their member whose workers are

in  the Business Houses Employees Union, I am  sure

he  will find that the commercial employers  reject

salary scales.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is not my information. I

know   the  non-Communist  sector  of  unions   are

having - and  I  can  produce  and  I  think  I  will

produce - any number of agreements which show  salary

scales.  And we will show the whole lot. These  are

facts  which  can be established from  the  record.

Their aim is not industrial peace. It is industrial

aggressiveness; make aggression pay in  order  that

they  can keep the workers continually on the move.

From  time to time the workers have to be placated.

Then their appetites are whetted again for the next

onslaught. There is not the slightest intention  of

having  industrial peace with justice.  What  these

unions  want  is  a  constant state  of  industrial

excitement upon which they could expand  and  mount

their world revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, these are facts and figures

related  to  the  activities of  the  pro-Communist

cadres in the union. I claim no credit for it. I do

not  see any conceit in my having painfully exposed

these machinations. The fact of the matter is  that

after  merger, internal security will  ensure  that

the Communist element of the political manipulation

of unions will be checked and free play given to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



really  collective bargaining for  the  purpose  of

arriving  at  an  agreement which is  fair  to  the

employer and the employee, to the workers  and  the

State,   to   ensure   industrial   stability   for

industrial expansion, without which Members on  the

other  side know full well that there will be utter

chaos  and  disaster, but chaos and disaster  which

the  Communists  are quite prepared unabashedly  to

bring  about  in  order that they can  bring  their

world revolution one step further.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend this Assembly, I

will take the Chair again at 5.35 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.35 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL UNREST</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is the opinion of my Party that we

should  not  only  express grave concern  over  the

question  of industrial unrest but that  we  should

also consider the question in all seriousness. That

is  why  it is essential to find the cause  of  the

deterioration  in labour and capital  relationship.

No  matter  what the motive of the  mover  of  this

motion  is,  and  no matter how he  criticises  and

ridicules the Government in dealing with strikes, I

would  say  that during his term of office  in  the

Labour   Front  Government,  he  sided   with   the

capitalists and the employers, sent trade unionists

to  gaol  and  used  the  police  to  intervene  in

strikes.   I  would  also  say  that  the  previous

Government   did  not  only  fail  in   alleviating

industrial unrest but it also exploited the workers

and  sided with the employers, thus giving rise  to

general  discontent among the workers. So  I  would

say  that if the Member for Cairnhill is urging the

present Government to resort to similar tactics  in

dealing with the industrial workers, then it  would

bring about a worse situation than it is now.  This

is because if this line is taken, all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



workers in Singapore will do their best to counter-attack the oppression imposed on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present industrial unrest started during the

second  half of last year when the Government  took

action  to  close down the T.U.C. at  a  time  when

there  was a political crisis within the  Party  in

power.  It  is  undoubtedly true that  the  present

instability  in  politics is one of  the  important

factors  of  industrial unrest. Before  the  Labour

Department Report was given in 1961, we were unable

to find out the number of strikes in Singapore. But

from  information published in newspapers, we  find

that  in  November last year there  were  about  20

strikes affecting some 33,000 workers with  a  loss

of  a few hundred working days. An important strike

at  that  period was the strike of the Daily  Rated

Employees  Union  of  the City Council.  The  worst

industrial  unrest  in Singapore  took  place  last

year. From records of the past we can see why there

were  so many strikes. As we know, the P.A.P. came

to  power with the support of the left-wing people,

especially  the  workers.  When  the  P.A.P. took

office,  they promised to bring about  unity  among

the  labourers, amend the labour laws and carry out

all  the  election pledges they made to the workers

of Singapore. That was why they were so welcomed by

the people of Singapore, especially the workers who

had  full  confidence in them and  who  hoped  that

their  lot  would be improved. So in the first  two

years  of  the  P.A.P. Government, it  was  a  most

difficult time for the Government to deal with  all

the  problems  of the workers. At  that  time,  the

number of labour disputes was not as great as it is

now.  This was because of the fair attitude adopted

by  the Labour Department, as a result of which the

employers  did not take advantage of the  situation

and  they had to cooperate with the unions. It  was

because  of  this  that there were  more  cases  of

labour disputes being settled. In the meantime, the

workers  also understood that they should  not  ask

too much of the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the leaders of the P.A.P.

are  sincere and are prepared to keep the  promises

they  made  during the election to  carry  out  the

reunification of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



the trade union movement and bring about industrial

peace,  then in all sincerity the Government should

cooperate  with  the  workers and  the  unions  and

improve the relationship between the employers  and

the  workers. This is very possible. In  fact,  the

reorganisation of the Government had, to a  certain

extent,  brought about industrial peace. This  came

about  as  a result of the cooperation between  the

Government  and  the  T.U.C. at  that  time.  This

attitude  of  cooperation was very  promising.  All

this  was done in the interest of the workers.  But

from  what  we  see  now, it is very  difficult  to

ensure  industrial peace. The Government  has  lost

the confidence of the workers at present and it  is

only the irresponsible P.A.P. leaders who should be

blamed for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the contention of the

P.A.P. to use the Industrial Arbitration Court as a

means  to  bring  about industrial  peace.  On  1st

March,  1959 the Prime Minister said at a rally  in

Geylang Serai that the setting up of the Industrial

Arbitration  Court  was only a  means  to  try  and

settle  industrial disputes legally. If the workers

and the unions did not want this to be legalised by

law,  then they could decide for themselves whether

industrial   disputes  should  be   submitted   for

arbitration in the Court. But after the Party  came

to  power,  the  Prime Minister and his  colleagues

wanted  to  force  compulsory  arbitration  on  the

workers, that is to say, if the workers and  unions

wanted to resort to a strike, they could not do so.

Then  there  would be consultation and conciliation

between  the  Government and the workers'  leaders,

such  as  Lim  Ching  Siong .In this  respect,  the

Government has not been able to contribute anything

to  industrial peace. And the present situation  is

the responsibility of the present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before the Arbitration Court was set up,

the union leaders were very disappointed. Now there

is  an  indication  that  the  Government  has  the

intention   to  enforce  the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance.  We  must  point out  that  the  present

Ordinance has already given enough powers  to  the

Government, powers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



which  can be abused by it to restrict the  freedom

to  strike by workers; especially so in respect  of

the   non-P.A.P. unions.  As  a  matter  of  fact,

Government already has got an occasion to make  use

of this Ordinance to negate the right of non-P.A.P.

unions to strike. The Industrial Arbitration  Court

gives  union  leaders, especially leaders  of  non-P.A.P. unions  no  chance  for  any  defence   or

argument.  So we have doubts whether the Government

has  true intentions to amend the Ordinance in  the

interests  of  the  people.  And  we  are  doubtful

whether  there  is not an ulterior  motive  in  the

amendments to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closing down of the T.U.C. by the Government

has  given rise to a situation in which there is  a

split  in  the trade union movement.  This  act  of

closing  down the T.U.C. has encouraged  anti-union

employers   to  take  advantage  of   the   present

situation and to be stubborn against union leaders.

This  clearly  shows  that there  is  a  180-degree

change in the labour policy of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September last year the Minister for Labour

openly said, in regard to the Shaw Brothers'  trade

dispute, that he urged the Shaw Brothers management

to   disregard  the  appeal  of  the  workers   for

negotiations.  The  Government  instead  urged  the

management  of Shaw Organisation to have individual

talks with officials of the unions. In another case

the Singapore General Employees Union won a victory

in   a   secret  ballot  conducted  by  the  Labour

Ministry,  but the Singapore Manual and  Mercantile

Workers  Union,  which  is  pro-P.A.P.,  was   very

unhappy   about  the  situation,  and  its  members

resorted  to  stone-throwing. But the Minister  for

Labour turned a deaf ear to this complaint. And  so

there  is a conflict between the P.A.P. unions  and

the  non-P.A.P. unions. This is another factor which

can be attributed to the present split in the trade

union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the City Council strike the Government

made use of new workers to break down the strike of

the  union. The Government at that time pointed out

to the union that the trade dispute was politically

involved, and so such steps were necessary. On  the

contrary,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



the  Amalgamated Union of Public Employees is given

special privileges by the Government whenever there

is  any  strike,  and A.U.P.E. is  headed  by  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Culture. From all this, we can clearly see that the

Party   in  power  is  now  adopting  retrogressive

methods and is siding with the pro-P.A.P. unions at

the  expense of the non-P.A.P. unions.  These  acts

really  are  some  of  the causes  of  the  present

industrial unrest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, the trade

dispute  is  a  social problem. Trade disputes  and

labour  troubles  cannot  be  solved  easily  in  a

capitalist  society. It is only  when  there  is  a

policy  which  is in the interests  of  Labour  and

which is carried out by the Government supported by

the  workers  that industrial relationship  between

workers  and employers can be improved. It is  only

in these circumstances that industrial peace can be

brought  about to improve the lot of  the  workers,

especially  the  relationship  between  labour  and

capital.  This policy must have the cooperation  of

three  parties  concerned, namely, the  Government,

labour  and  capital. As a matter of  fact,  it  is

because  there  was  cooperation  among  the  three

parties at the beginning of P.A.P. rule that  there

was some form of industrial peace. In 1955-57 there

were  some very great strikes in the bus companies.

In   the   last  two  or  three  years  there   was

cooperation  between  workers  and  management.  We

would not say that the Hock Lee Bus Company and the

Tay Koh Yat Bus Company have changed their attitude

towards  the workers. Neither do we say that  there

has been a change of attitude of the leaders of the

bus  workers. All we say is that these two parties,

i.e.,  labour  and  capital,  have  come  to   some

agreement  concerning working conditions  and  wage

increases. Therefore, strikes have been avoided  in

the bus companies. But unfortunately, the Party  in

power, in order to deal their political opponents a

blow,   have   assisted  and   helped   out   their

colleagues. So there has been no balance in  labour

and  management relationship, and this move is  not

good to the bringing about of industrial peace.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are of the opinion that the

main  way to bring about industrial peace  lies  in

the   cooperation   of   all   parties   concerned,

especially  in the mutual interest of the  parties,

so  that the questions concerning industrial  peace

and  industrial relationship can be solved. We  are

of  the  opinion that the workers in Singapore  are

responsible  people. They have  a  great  sense  of

responsibility and as long as employers do not take

advantage  of  the  present situation  and  try  to

prevent  and  restrict their  activities  in  union

matters, then there is no reason whatsoever for any

deterioration  in relationship between  labour  and

capital.



<br><br>6.57 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim): Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  has been quiet and silence in the industrial

field  for  nearly two years, since June 1959  when

the  P.A.P. formed the Government, until  not  long

after  the defeat of the P.A.P. Government  in  the

Hong  Lim by-election. During this period, for some

reason  or  other,  we seldom  hear  of  industrial

disputes, industrial strike, not to say strikes. It

was  a  comparatively long period  of  silence  and

certain  trade  union leaders were then  under  the

impression   that  the  P.A.P. was   a   Left-wing

Government and was cooperating with the workers. It

was  not  so  much a fact that for two years  there

were no deep-seated grievances of the workers,  not

that  the  workers were satisfied with their  wages

and  conditions of service; but it  was  said  that

when  certain workers wished to press on with their

industrial demands, they were asked to give this so-called  Left-wing Government a chance to prove  its

worth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, came the Hong Lim by-election and we

have seen -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Historical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan: Historical Hong Lim by-election. And we have seen more strikes in the past

few  months  than  in the first two  years  of  the

P.A.P. Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, why are  there

so many strikes and so many industrial disputes? It

is because the workers' deep-seated grievances have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



been  pegged down for two years. We were faced with

a  similar  situation  in 1955  when,  with  a  new

Government  coming  in,  there  was   a   wave   of

industrial disputes which restored wages  to  their

normal  position.  So  this  period  of  industrial

activity  during  the  last  few  months,  in   our

opinion, is to catch up with what has been lost  by

workers  in  the first two years of the Government.

There   is   no  need  for  experienced   political

agitators to tell a worker that he should strike to

get more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when workers do not get

subsistence wages, there is a necessity  to  resort

to   industrial  action  in  order  to  get  better

conditions of living. One characteristic during the

past few months is the spate of industrial disputes

of  white-collar workers, i.e., clerks  of  British

and  foreign commercial houses. This is because  of

the  fact  that since the return of the British  in

1945  these white-collar workers have not generally

resorted  to collective bargaining. They  have  not

obtained  any general wage increase, and  after  so

many  years of silence, they have woken up  to  the

fact  that  they would be able to get better  wages

and  better conditions of service if they  resorted

to industrial action. Mr Speaker, Sir, if a worker

is  contented,  and  if  a  white-collar  clerk  is

contented, however much agitation is being  brought

about, it is very difficult for us or for political

agitators  or  industrial agitators  to  make  them

strike. We are thus faced with a situation where in

this  semi-colonial society we are trying to  bring

about  equilibrium  between  the  workers  and  the

employers.   During  the  past   two   years,   the

Government have not done much to bring the  workers

into their confidence. They have never shown in any

concrete way that they are sympathetic towards  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was in the City Council

we voluntarily raised the wages of the workers, the

peons,  the messengers and the poorly paid  workers

of  the City Council. Not that we could do much for

them - 40  cents increase a day for the workers,  and

$10 a month increase for the peon would not go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



along  way.  But it was a gesture of  goodwill  and

sympathy  for the working class. But what has  this

P.A.P.  Government  done?  [Interruption]  That  is

right,   Mr  Speaker.  And  why  not  the   P.A.P.

Government now also do the same thing? They  should

have done the same thing also. They still have  the

same Central Committee -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. To get the record right,

perhaps the Member for Hong Lim will translate what

the  hon. Member for Delta said. I do not think  it

has  got  into  our official record.  He  chose  to

answer  the  interjection. I think he  should  also

translate the interjection if he can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Delta said that the increase of the  wages  of

the  workers in the City Council was also the  work

of the P.A.P. That is why it is necessary for me to

clarify  the  position,  that  is,  if  the  P.A.P.

Government are really sincere, they could have done

it  when  they are in the Government. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  there was no wage increase. There was instead

a  deflationary situation where many  workers  lost

their job. Some received less pay. There was also a

situation where more taxes were taken from the poor

workers.  Therefore, the workers are faced  with  a

Government in whom they have no confidence and they

feel that it is only through industrial action that

they could get what they want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was very long after the Government was formed that they set up the Industrial Arbitration Court to try to conciliate the contradictions in this capitalist society between the employer and the employee. Now we have one Industrial Arbitration Court. But from what I gather, that one Industrial Arbitration Court is not sufficient for the purpose, and many unions and

employees  have to queue up for a long time  before

they can send their cases to arbitration. The Prime

Minister  has  said just now perhaps  that  is  the

reason why many employees do not want to send their

case  to  arbitration. It takes months  before  the

cases  could be heard. So I would suggest that  the

Government    should   set   up   more   Industrial

Arbitration Courts. Now the snag in industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



arbitration is that you need qualified men who have

much   experience,  and  there  are  not  many   in

Singapore  who  are prepared to  do  it  without  a

price - not  necessarily  in  terms  of  dollars  and

cents - to put up the cases of the workers before the

Court. Therefore, we must have certain substitutes,

for  instance, like wage councils, or whatever name

we  call it, where the employees can bring up their

case  in  an informal atmosphere before these  wage

councils and the employer will be asked to meet and

settle their dispute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we support the principle of

industrial peace with justice not only in name  but

also  in  practice, and we hope that the Government

could  set  up more Industrial Arbitration  Courts,

put  up more wage councils so that we would be able

to  bring more employment and more stability to the

present industrial position.



<br><br>6.07 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid) (In Malay): Mr Speaker, many Opposition Members from

the Barisan Sosialis have accused the Government of

using the State machinery to suppress trade unions.

The  Member  for  Toa Payoh, my  former  colleague,

after  having undergone such an experience, has  no

further  interest  in  labour  problems.  But,  Mr

Speaker,  I  myself  have  been  in  the  Singapore

General Employees Union right from the beginning. I

was  a Committee member. Subsequently, I became its

Chairman, then Vice-Chairman, and finally I  became

its  Secretary-General. I am fully conversant  with

how   the   front-line   Communist   leaders   have

manipulated the labour movement in order to  oppose

the  P.A.P.  Government now.  When  the  Government

wanted to establish an Arbitration Court, Mr  Fong

Swee Suan exchanged views with me. He expressed his

objection because he considered that this  was  not

in the interest of the trade unions. At first I was

unable  to  grasp the motive behind the reasons  of

Mr Fong Swee Suan. Later on when I made inquiries,

I  discovered that the setting up of the Industrial

Arbitration Court



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



would  be a disadvantage to the Communists  because

they  would  then have no opportunity  to  use  the

labour  movement  in  its struggle  to  oppose  the

Government. In addition, Mr Speaker -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is addressing

the  Chair as Mr Chairman, that is Tuan Pengerusi,

I  think  the  correct address is Mr  Speaker - Tuan

Speaker or Tuan Yang di-Pertua.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (In Malay): Mr

Speaker, I apologise for the mix-up in the usage of

the  terms  "Mr Chairman" and "Mr  Speaker".  Mr

Speaker,  when  the  Government intended  to  bring

about  the unification of the trade union  movement

in   Singapore,  similarly  Mr  Fong   Swee   Suan

expressed his views against the step taken  by  the

Government.  I  fail  to  understand  this  in  the

beginning. But later I was fully convinced that the

reason was this. Mr Fong Swee Suan himself was the

adviser  to  the S.G.E.U. when I was the Secretary-General, and the reason for his objection was  that

the  S.G.E.U. itself comprised various  classes  of

workers,  so that when the unification took  place,

the S.G.E.U. would lose its strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker. Just now many of the

Barisan   Sosialis   Members   have   charged   the

Government for using the State machinery, that  is,

using  the  police  force, to  suppress  the  trade

unions.  I ask the Barisan Sosialis to go back  and

ask  their  S.G.E.U. leaders like  Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong,  Mr Fong Swee Suan, Mr Dominic Puthucheary

and  others,  whether or not there  were  occasions

when the unions sought help from the police, as  in

the  case  of  the  Malayan Tin  Printing  dispute.

During the dispute, the S.G.E.U. sought police help

from  the workers of the Lighterage Company.  I  am

telling  nothing but the truth. As  its  Secretary-General  then,  I know the position  very  well.  I

think  the  Barisan Sosialis in  this  Chamber  are

merely   receiving  directives  from  irresponsible

trade  union  leaders  to utter  unfounded  charges

which they themselves do not know. It is because of

the unreasonable tactics adopted by them that I, of

my own free will, resigned as the Secretary-General

of the S.G.E.U.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the accusation by the Member for Hong

Lim,  he said that during the past two years, deep-seated  industrial unrest has been prevailing.  Mr

Speaker,   during   the  last  Government,   labour

legislation   was   introduced  concerning   public

holidays  and  so  on. But the previous  Government

took   no   action  to  enforce  these   provisions

according  to  the  law. When  the  P.A.P. assumed

office,  all  workers  came forward  to  claim  for

overtime pay, such as the employees of the  Raffles

Hotel  and  the Adelphi Hotel. They were successful

in their claims. The reason can easily be seen. The

P.A.P.  Government  took all steps  to  bring  both

parties to negotiation in the Arbitration Court and

then   settlement  was  reached.  Such  accusations

hurled  by the Barisan Sosialis are merely designed

to  confuse the workers so that they will  be  anti

the  P.A.P. Government. There are many problems  in

trade disputes and certain leaders, particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



from  the  S.G.E.U.,  do  not  like   such

disputes  to be referred to the Arbitration  Court.

The  reason can easily be given, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

because  if the Arbitration Court is successful  in

affecting a settlement, the workers can claim  that

it  is  not the Communist front that has  made  the

settlement.  It  is  the Government  who  does  it.

Therefore, the Barisan Sosialis leaders have  found

ways  and means to prevent such trade disputes from

being  brought before the Arbitration Court. I  say

so.  Mr  Speaker, because earlier I  have  already

said  what transpired in the discussions I had with

Mr  Fong Swee Suan. I know very well what is going

on  in  the  S.G.E.U. Unlike the  Barisan  Sosialis

Members  who  merely  receive  directions  to  read

speeches  in  this  Assembly,  the  leader  of  the

Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown,  wants

publicity  that  he  is championing  the  cause  of

labour. But he himself is in the dark as to what is

going on in the S.G.E.U.



<br><br>6.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government do view with grave concern the mounting of industrial unrest, but what was the cause of it? Surely the Member for Cairnhill is not too naive to suggest, as he did, that it was entirely due to the

defect of the Industrial Relations Ordinance.  Just

now  the Minister for Health and Law and the  Prime

Minister  have dwelt on the figures on  the  strike

position. But let me go through the following table

once again:-



<pre>



         Year      		Strikes    No, of workmen      Man-days   Disputes

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the table it will be observed that there was

a  marked  increase in the number of  strikes  from

August 1961 immediately after the Anson by-election

and  the split that took place in the Trades  Union

Congress.  The total number of strikes during  this

period was 77 as against 116 for the whole year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this sudden perceptible increase in

industrial unrest after the Anson by election?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that during the

Anson  by election the call for merger and Malaysia

was  in  the  air, and the Government took  a  firm

stand  in response to that call; but Mr Lim  Ching

Siong  and the pro-Communist elements in the unions

came  out  with  a  statement to ask  for  complete

internal  self-government only, with  the  Internal

Security  Council abolished instead of  merger  and

Malaysia. Therefore, it was over a political  issue

between the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



and  the pro-Communist Party elements in the unions

that they have waged a political battle against the

Government  over the issue of merger and  Malaysia.

The   historical  and  inevitable  event   of   the

reunification of the people of the two  territories

of  Singapore  and the Federation was taking  shape

day  by  day and the pro-Communist elements in  the

union  became  agitated and decided  to  use  every

means  to  fight the Government with  the  view  to

frustrating  the  materialisation  of  merger   and

Malaysia.  They  therefore mounted  the  industrial

unrest  with the view to forcing the Government  to

shift its stand on the issue of merger and, failing

which,  to  topple  the  Government  in  order   to

frustrate  the  reunification  of  the  people   of

Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I therefore move an amendment

to the motion as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to add after the words "industrial unrest" in

line 2 - "by pro-Communist political agitators for

political ends";



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to add after the words "in the interests of"

in line 3 - "industrial expansion so vital to"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)to add at the end of the motion after the

word "Singapore" - "and to prevent genuine industrial

grievances from being exploited for Communist

ends".



<br><br>The amended motion will thus read:



<br><br>"That  this  House  views with grave  concern  the

mounting  of  industrial unrest  by  pro-Communist

political  agitators for political ends and  calls

on  the Government to take all reasonable steps to

ensure  industrial  peace  with  justice  in   the

interests of industrial expansion so vital to  the

economic  well-being  of the people  of  Singapore

and  to prevent genuine industrial grievances from

being exploited for Communist ends."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I might mention that it is

usual  for the proposer of an amendment to be moved

to  clear  that amendment either with the Clerk  or

with  the Speaker, because there is a format  which

is  generally adhered to in these matters. I  would

suggest  that the amendment, which in substance  is

in order, should be:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all words from "unrest" to the end

and   substitute  the  words  suggested,  "by  pro-Communist political agitators for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



political ends and calls on the Government to  take

all  reasonable  steps to ensure  industrial  peace

with   justice  in  the  interests  of   industrial

expansion  so  vital to the economic well-being  of

the  people  of  Singapore and to  prevent  genuine

industrial  grievances  from  being  exploited  for

Communist ends."



<br><br>Is that accepted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg your

pardon. I did not catch you just now. If all the

amendments that are being moved by me in what you

have said, then, of course -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In substance, the amendment is in

order. It is a question of format. The amendment

should be: To leave out all the words in the motion

from "unrest" to the end and there to insert the

words as they appear in the cyclostyled amended

motion handed up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Copies of the cyclostyled amended

motion will be handed round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of amended motion distributed to hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was over

the  political  issue of merger and  Malaysia  that

caused the split in the non-Communist Left and  the

Communist Left in the Party and in the trade  union

movement. It therefore led to the test of  strength

between  the  non-Communist Left and the  Communist

Left.  The  Government  had anticipated  that  pro-Communists   would  mount  industrial  unrest   for

political objectives. Let me quote from the  letter

of  the Prime Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister

who  is  the  Chairman  of  the  P.A.P.  The  Prime

Minister  in  his  letter  pointed  out  the  grave

difficulties that faced the Government then because

of  the  three  Political Secretaries (Messrs.  Lim

Ching  Siong,  Fong Swee Suan and S. Woodhull)  who

had  openly  opposed  the Government's  policy  for

independence  through merger.  The  Prime  Minister

then said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is most likely that mounting industrial

action will be taken by Mr Lim Ching Siong and his

confederates to coerce the Party and the Government

to abandon its plan for merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, because they were openly committed to

our stand of industrial peace with justice, strikes

and  industrial unrest have nearly all been  of  an

industrial   character   and   without    political

objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that an open break has come, it is most

likely  that there will be  a mounting offensive  on

the  trade  union  front  with  political  and  not

industrial objectives.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us go through the statistics and see how

the  pro-Communist elements mounted the  industrial

unrest.  The number of strikes and lockouts  during

1961   was   116,  involving  43,584  workers   and

resulting in a loss of 410,889 man-days as  against

45  strikes  and  lockouts in 1960 involving  5,539

workers  and  resulting in 152,005  man-days  lost.

There  was  a  marked increase  in  the  number  of

strikes  from  August to December  1961,  i.e. the

period immediately after the Anson by-election. The

total  number of strikes during this period was  77

as against 116 for the whole year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period from 1st July, 1961 to 31st

January, 1962, there were altogether 96 strikes, as

compared  to  27 only for the first six  months  of

1961.  Of  the  96 strikes, 69 were  by  Communist-controlled  or Communist-penetrated unions,  24  by

non-Communist  unions and three  by  employees  not

represented by any union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore General Employees' Union called 31 strikes; the Singapore Business Houses Employees'

Union  25;  and the Singapore Textile  and  General

Merchants Employees' Union seven, making a total of

63 strikes or about 54 per cent of the total number

of  strikes  during the year. For the period  under

review,  the  Singapore Business Houses  Employees'

Union,  on  the  one hand, called  a  total  of  25

strikes  but, on the other, referred only 13  minor

disputes  to the Labour Department. Again,  in  the

case of the dispute between the four Shaw Companies

and  the  Singapore  General  Employees'  Union  in

September 1961, no attempt was made by either party

to  avail  itself of the machinery provided  before

taking industrial action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a difference in behaviour of

strikers between the non-Communist unions  and  the

Communist-controlled unions. The  pickets  of  non-Communist  unions were comparatively  well-behaved,

while  the  behaviour of strikers of the Communist-controlled  unions,  particularly  those   of   the

Singapore  Business  Houses Employees'  Union,  was

aggressive and offensive. Executives of  the  firms

were often assaulted and subjected to various forms

of humiliation. The following diary of events gives

the picture of the extent of misconduct by pickets:



<br><br>On 18-8-61 - Robinson and Co., Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following breakdown of negotiations over the

recognition of S.B.H.E.U. as the representative  of

the firm's employees, members of the union staged a

"go-slow" on 18th August, 1961, and prevented  non-strikers from entering the premises before  9  a.m.

When  Mr  Warren and Mr Hazel, employees  of  the

firm,  attempted to enter the store at  8.45  a.m.,

they  were  assaulted by four or five  persons.  An

optician,  Mr Meyer, who went to, the aid  of  the

two Europeans, was also assaulted. Mrs Khoo, a non-striking  Chinese  woman worker, was  knocked  down

when she insisted on entering the store.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11-9-61-Robinson and Co., Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-two pickets were arrested and charged in

court  for  causing obstruction. At  the  time  the

arrests  were effected, other obstreperous strikers

present  insisted that they should also be arrested

and taken to Central Police Station. Altogether 216

were brought to the Central Police Station where it

was  found  that  of these persons  only  150  were

actual  employees of the firm, the other  66  being

members of the S.B.H.E.U. employed at other firms.



<br><br>On l7-l1-61 - Seiclene Laundry and Dry-Cleaning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day during the strike, the workers held

up  a  British  Army truck which had  gone  to  the

laundry  to reclaim unwashed linen sent  there  for

washing  under  contract. The  strikers  under  the

instructions of Mr Tan Teck Wah, President of  the

Singapore    General   Employees'   Union    (which

represents the strikers), used two of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



company's  vans to block the entrance to  the  firm

and so prevented the Army vehicle from leaving.  It

is  known that the strikers were instructed by  Mr

Tan  Teck  Wah  to make the police feel  ridiculous

once it was decided to disperse them. However,  Mr

Fong  Swee  Suan  who  arrived  later  advised  the

strikers not to defy the police. In the event,  the

police  had to push the company's vans out  of  the

way  in  order to clear a passage for the  military

truck. Finally, when the police formed up to leave,

they  were  jeered  at and had  exploding  crackers

flung at them.



<br><br>On 25-11-61 - Gammon (Singapore) Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers went on a one-day strike on 25-11-61.

At about 8.15 a.m. when an engineer of the firm was

being  driven  into  the firm's premises  at  Bukit

Timah  Road his car was stopped by about 70 pickets

including  members of the S.B.H.E.U. who  were  not

employees of the firm. The Malay driver was ordered

to  leave  the car and when the engineer  tried  to

drive  on,  he was assaulted by two of the  pickets

who   were  not  employees  of  the  firm.   Timely

intervention  by two uniformed constables  on  duty

saved  the  engineer  from  serious  injuries.  The

strikers were defiant and the two police constables

had to draw their revolvers to deter the crowd from

further assaulting the engineer.



<br><br>On 2-12-6l - Guthrie and Co. Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9.30 a.m., a mercantile assistant of this

firm,   Mr   Walker,  was  escorting   two   women

employees - non-union members of the firm - to  office.

The ladies were prevented from going in to work  at

the staircase leading to the office. Mr Walker was

fisted by a male picket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day at 12.30 p.m., the director of

the firm and the manager of the Pan-Malayan Imports

were leaving the Chartered Bank Chambers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order. I think the

Parliamentary Secretary is referring  to  a  matter

which is sub judice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was on the point of enquiring from

the Parliamentary Secretary whether all these cases

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> I will therefore take your

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 4th December, 1961, at 3.50 p.m., a group

of  14  European employees of the firm were leaving

the  premises under police escort. As  they  passed

the  pickets, they were jeered at, and one  of  the

picketers threw two paper bags full of rotten  eggs

at  them.  The  police  constable  who  caught  the

assailant,  Mr  Teo Kim Eng, the  Guthrie  Branch

Assistant Secretary of the union, in the  act,  was

assaulted  by  Mr  Teo who  was  then  rescued  by

others.  Mr  Teo, however, was rearrested  by  the

police  constable with the assistance of  Inspector

Seah  Wai  Toh.  Mr Teo was most  violent  and  he

punched  and kicked Inspector Seah. The two  police

officers who took Mr Teo to a police pick-up  were

surrounded  by  the  picketers  who  prevented  the

vehicle -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order. I believe that is

also  a  matter that is sub judice. You  have  just

ruled on such matters.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary must be

very  careful  about  his speech  because  Standing

Order 46 (2) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Reference shall not be made to any matter which

of consideration of a Bill...'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> My memory may fail me, but I

believe  that  this  case was heard  in  court  and

disposed of by the court. However, I will take your

advice, not to mention it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now after the Anson by-election, why this sudden

upsurge  of  industrial unrest? It was not  because

the Government had changed its attitude towards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



the working class and frustrated the moves made  by

the  workers  for  better terms and  conditions  of

service.  It  was  entirely  due  to  the  pro-C.P.

elements  who were opposed to merger and  Malaysia.

They picked a quarrel with the Government over this

political  issue  and  they wanted  to  create  the

impression  in  the minds of the workers  that  the

Government was unsympathetic to the workers so that

the   workers  would  be  discontented   with   the

Government  and  so fight against  the  Government.

They,   therefore,   had   purposely   mounted   an

industrial unrest and deliberately led the  workers

to  clash with the police. But they have failed  in

the attempt to cause discontentment and ill-feeling

of the workers towards the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have failed because the Government did not

allow   the  employers  in  the  present  political

confusion   which  was  created  by  the   pro-C.P.

elements to take advantage of it and to oppress the

workers   as  the  previous  Government   did.   No

opportunity was given to the employer to weaken the

workers' bargaining position or the employers being

allowed  to  repudiate agreements  which  they  had

concluded   with   the   workers.   Further,    the

Government, unlike the previous Government, did not

allow  itself  to be manipulated by  obstinate  and

reactionary employers nor allow itself to  be  made

use  of  as a tool against the workers. As a result

of  the consistent labour policy of the Government,

the  workers had confidence in the Government  that

they could have their grievances redressed with the

assistance  of  the  machinery provided  under  the

Industrial  Relations  Ordinance.  The  House  will

notice  from  the  Press  from  time  to  time  the

improved  benefits  that the workers  had  achieved

from the day the P.A.P. took office up to now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have illustrated a few cases in which

the  pro-Communist unions agitated its  workers  to

use  violence in the course of industrial disputes.

Their  main object was to lead the innocent workers

into  a  clash with the police so that  they  could

convince the workers that the Government was wicked

and anti-worker. Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



through  these  means, they could  exploit  genuine

trade  disputes  for  their  own  selfish  aims  by

implicating  the  workers in a  political  struggle

against the Government. The pro-C.P. unions  always

issued statements blaming the Government for  using

the  police against strikers. It is quite clear now

from  the  incidents enumerated just now  that  the

police  had  no  alternative but to  step  in  when

violence was resorted to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-C.P. elements in the unions raised a hue

and  cry over the question of reunification of  the

trade  union movement. Mr Speaker, Sir, as I  have

pointed  out earlier, the split in the trade  union

movement was caused by the pro-C.P. elements over a

political  issue. They wanted the consolidation  of

the  working  class not for the workers'  interests

but for them to manipulate the trade union movement

for  their  own selfish political ends.  They  made

every attempt to capture control of the trade union

movement  so  that they can bring pressure  on  and

manipulate  an elected Government to advance  their

own factional political ends. They have made use of

the  trade  union movement for political manoeuvres

calculated to create conditions of political unrest

and instability in the State of Singapore. This was

the cause of the spilt in the trade union movement,

and  the  blame should go to the pro-C.P. elements

and no one else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there was a split in the trade union

movement  because  they  opposed  the  Government's

realisation  of  merger, the  Government  has  done

everything  possible  to  preserve  the  collective

organisation of the workers in order that their own

interests  can  be  protected. You  will  therefore

observe, Mr Speaker, Sir, that though there was  a

split in the trade union movement, nevertheless the

Government  has  preserved an  impartial  and  fair

attitude  in the face of provocation. Though  there

was  a  split  in  the  trade  unions,  the  P.A.P.

Government  sees to it that no employer is  allowed

to  create  yellow unions to weaken the  bargaining

position  of  the  workers, as  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government had done.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What about the A.U.P.E.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> For that matter, there are

records and it can be dismissed as a distortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above, you will now see that no matter

how  hard  the pro-C.P. elements have attempted  to

create  discontent and to instil  in  the  workers'

minds  the  fact that the Government has  abandoned

its  labour  policy  and  is unsympathetic  towards

them, they have failed because we in the P.A.P. are

genuinely working for the interests of the  workers

by  not  allowing  the  employers  to  exploit  the

political   situation  or  allow   itself   to   be

manipulated  by the capitalists. I would  therefore

take this opportunity to warn the pro-C.P. elements

in  the Barisan and in the unions that they have to

be responsible and answerable to those workers whom

they have misled by creating industrial unrest,  as

a  result of which the workers themselves have lost

their  jobs or suffered, as a consequence of  which

their families have also suffered, and they have to

be   responsible  for  these  workers   and   their

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for

Queenstown has accused the Government of being pro-employer.  Let us see who really has the  interests

of   the  workers  at  heart  and  who  really   is

interested in maintaining industrial peace so  that

economic development could be proceeded with. There

are  many  cases which I could cite to, prove  that

the pro-C.P. unions are making use of these genuine

trade  disputes for their own ends.  For  instance,

the  Malayan  Theatres, i.e, the Shaw Organisation,

the  Prime  Minister has cited it just  now  but  I

would  like  to give more details of this  case  to

show  how  they have put the workers to unnecessary

suffering and loss of income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute in this case was over claims for

arrears  of  public holiday pay and allowances  for

morning and midnight shows. Mr Speaker, Sir,  they

are  quite  aware that there is an Ordinance  which

provides for all these amenities and employers have

to  abide by them, and in case of a breach of  this

section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



of  the Ordinance the workers do not have to  fight

for  it but they could just simply either raise the

matter  with  the management or report  it  to  the

Labour  Department,  and the  Inspectorate  of  the

Labour  Department  will no  doubt  look  into  the

complaint  of  a  breach of  this  section  of  the

Ordinance.  But the pro-C.P. union,  as  is  usual,

claimed that what they had done was for the benefit

of  the workers without political motives. In  this

case, if that was their intention, in their failure

to   resolve   this  matter  with  the   management

directly,  why did they not just lodge a  complaint

with  the  Labour Department? Instead, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  they decided to mislead the workers  and  ask

them  to take industrial action. In this particular

case,  they had a previous discussion at the Labour

Ministry and it was adjourned to the following day.

But  the union, knowing full well the situation and

that  there  was  no breakdown in the  negotiation,

called off the workers on the eve when negotiations

should be resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a clear example of what

they  claimed to be acting in the interests of  the

workers.   As   a  result  of  their   unscrupulous

exploitation of a genuine trade dispute  for  their

own  political ends, the workers had to lose  wages

when  they  went on strike from the 21st  December,

1961  to 31st January, 1962. Both parties have  now

agreed  to  refer  the matter  to  the  Arbitration

Court,  but  as the Prime Minister has pointed  out

just  now, the management had, in fact, offered  to

refer  the  matter to the Labour Court  or  to  the

Arbitration Court, because in this case the dispute

was purely over a matter of facts and figures. So I

do  not  know  to what extent they can substantiate

their claim. Anyway, 419 workers had been asked  to

go  on strike unnecessarily for 2½ months, and they

had  to  suffer  during this period as  they  would

derive  no income. I wonder if they would or  could

ultimately  get back a substantial  sum  to  offset

this  period when the workers went on strike  which

resulted in a loss of income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the non-Communist trade unions and

the Communist-controlled trade unions. Do they make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



every  attempt and effort to bring about  long-term

industrial  stability  in  industry?  Surely,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, if you were to examine the agreements

that   were   concluded  between   the   Communist-controlled  unions  and  the  employers,  you  will

notice  that  in most cases they just asked  for  a

nominal  sum of increments to which, I believe,  in

any  case  they would have been entitled. They  had

made no attempt to study their claims or to put  up

claims where the workers did not have to go through

the  same  procedure  and the trouble  to  ask  for

revision of terms and conditions of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the non-Communist trade union group, they

always  study the case, consult their members,  and

put  up  claims  which lead to  ultimate  long-term

stability  in  employment. The House probably  will

have   seen  from  the  newspapers  that  in  every

agreement  concluded,  for instance,  by  the  Bank

Employees Union, the Insurance Employees Union, the

Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers Union,  and

other  unions,  i.e, under the non-C.P.-controlled

group, they always asked for salary scales.  So  we

see  that  once  these unions take the  trouble  to

fight  for better terms and conditions of  service,

they achieve real benefits and they do not have  to

negotiate again every year or every two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there such a difference in their tactics?

It is very simple, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Communist-controlled  unions accuse the Government  of  being

pro-employer, but how was it that the non-Communist-controlled   unions   concluded   agreements   with

employers  on  time  scales which  the  Member  for

Thomson said the employer always refused to accept?

Apart  from  this  nominal increment,  they  always

conclude  an  agreement for only  a  period  of  18

months  or  two  years, and  they  are  very,  very

reluctant to conclude an agreement for two years or

more.  This shows the intention behind their  move.

On the whole, Mr Speaker, Sir, they always say the

workers  are dissatisfied with the Government.  Let

us look at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



this   statement   and  see  what   is   the   real

dissatisfaction, as they allege, the  workers  have

with the Government. This is a Press cutting of the

Sunday  Tunes of 10th July, 1961. This is  what  is

exactly reported in the Press of the speeches  made

by  Mr  Dominic Puthucheary and Mr  S.  T.  Bani.

members of the 10-man T.U.C. Secretariat. They were

addressing  the 5th Annual Delegates Conference  of

Industrial Workers Union at its premises in Kallang

Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> At that time we were in the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Yes, that is the period when

you had already decided to betray the Party.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Hon. Parliamentary

Secretary  is addressing the Chair. I do not  think

the Speaker has betrayed any Party so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

referring to the Member for Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said: `A chief cause of dissatisfaction was

the  Government's  failure to implement  the  Trade

Union   Bill   which   would   provide   for    the

reunification of the trade union movement.  Another

reason  was  the  Government's loss  of  its  anti-colonial  fervour and the fact that  it  would  not

take   a  courageous  stand  against  the  Internal

Security Council.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said: `The Government had deprived active

trade unionists and anti-colonialists o citizenship

rights  and  had  not  implemented  the  unionists'

demand  for release of all political detainees  and

the  granting of freedom of speech and Assembly for

anti-colonial purposes.'"



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, what has this got to do with the

general  workers?  Again,  at  a  meeting  of   the

Singapore  Business Houses Employees  Union,  which

was reported on 16th February, 1962, in the Straits

Times,  Mr  Foo Yong Fong, the Union's  President,

said this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Wrong statement, it seems!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> These are Communist virtues

which  they  are trying to impress  on  the  white-collar workers. He started off with saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All the time we are told that the Communists are

supposed to be had people.'



<br><br>And he continued.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Countries such as Russia, China and Cuba which

can   supply  us  with  cheaper  things   are   bad

countries. Many people are not aware that they  can

get  cheaper  goods,  such as clothes,  shirts  and

canned  food from countries like Russia  and  China

than  from  America,  Britain,  Holland  and  South

Africa.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I do not have  to  waste  this

House's time to go through the resolutions and  the

statements  the Communist-controlled unions  issued

during  the Anson by-election and even up till  now

when  merger  is taking shape. The  main  theme  of

their  resolution was nothing else but to  try  and

deceive  the workers. They want to incite  them  to

fight against the Government on the ground that the

P.A.P.  Government  has  sold  out  the  people  of

Singapore  because  it  wants  a  merger  with  the

Federation, and the P.A.P. Government was reluctant

to  fight  for  internal self-government  with  the

abolition   of   the  Internal  Security   Council.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, from all this, we  can

see  that  it  is not the Government, due  to  this

political situation, that has lost interest in  the

workers. On the contrary, it is the pro-C.P. in the

unions which do not want to see the realisation  of

the  unification  of the people  of  Singapore  and

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now many Opposition Members criticised the

Government for not providing enough facilities  for

the  trade  unions in order that  they  can  settle

their disputes without resort to industrial action.

Let  me  reveal to this House what the  Government

has  done  in order to help the workers to  achieve

better  terms  and  conditions of  service  without

undue  hardship by going on strike.  There  is  the

Industrial  Relations  Ordinance  under  which   an

Industrial  Arbitration Court  was  established  to

maintain   industrial  peace  with   justice.   The

Government  has  taken  steps  to  strengthen   the

conciliation  team in the Ministry of  Labour.  The

number  of  conciliation  officers  in  the  Labour

Department  was increased from 4 to 9  officers  as

from  8th January, 1962. The organisation was  also

changed. In this new set-up there are five officers

with  considerable experience in conciliation work.

But,  Mr  Speaker,  do they really  ask  for  this

conciliation machinery in order that they will make

use of it to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



maintain  industrial peace? No, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.

Conciliation and arbitration machinery is not  what

the  pro-C.P. elements in the unions want  to  make

use of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, they have

brought  trouble  on their own shoulders  and  they

have  to face their own medicine when, in spite  of

all  their  evil deeds, they still fail to  prevent

the   historical,   inevitable   reunion   of   our

territories   on  whose  political   and   economic

stability  we  can build a more prosperous  society

for our workers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House views with grave concern the

mounting  of  industrial unrest and  calls  on  the

Government to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure

industrial  peace with justice in the interests  of

the   economic   well-being  of   the   people   of

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all the words from "unrest" to the

end,   and   there  to  insert  "by   pro-Communist

political agitators for political ends and calls on

the  Government  to  take all reasonable  steps  to

ensure   industrial  peace  with  justice  in   the

interests of industrial expansion so vital  to  the

economic well-being of the people of Singapore  and

to prevent genuine industrial grievances from being

exploited for Communist ends".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

surprising that the amendment should have come from

someone  who  sits  behind  the  Government   Front

Benches.  One  would have thought  that  the  Prime

Minister,  with  all his knowledge about  Communism

and his twelve talks, would have been the first one

to  bring  this amendment before the House.  If  he

should  fail, then, of course, there  is  his  next

best,  the  one who knows all about Communism,  who

depends  on the Special Branch for his information,

the  Minister for Home Affairs. What  is  the  real

meaning  of  this amendment? It says here,  in  the

second   part,  "in  the  interests  of  industrial

expansion  so  vital to the economic well-being  of

the  people  of  Singapore". Who disagrees  with  a

statement  like  that? But the  Government,  having

failed in its responsibility, having failed in  its

industrialisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



programme, now tries to find a scapegoat. And where

else  better  than to pin it on the Communists  and

the pro-Communist elements? Crying "Communism",  as

I  have  said  already a little while ago,  is  not

going to benefit anybody, except in this particular

case  the  P.A.P. and all those forces allied  with

the  P.A.P. for the suppression of the  legitimate

aspirations  of the workers. Crying "Communism"  is

not  new. It has been done before, Sir, and on many

occasions,  we  had also touched on this.  We  have

also told the House that long ago the cry "radical"

was directed against anti-anyone who happened to be

against the Government. Later on the smear word was

"socialists".  A thing which a lot  of  people  may

have  forgotten is that 1900 years  ago  the  smear

word  was  "Christian". Of course, today, they  use

other smear words. They are "red", "pink", "fellow-travellers"  and  "Communist".  Do  they  not  have

anything  new?  Is the P.A.P. Government  today  so

utterly bankrupt that their leaders cannot think of

anything to salvage their sinking prestige?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motives behind this amendment are very

clear.  First, in moving the motion here they  want

to adopt the same tactics which they adopted at the

last  Assembly  sitting;  namely,  they  want   the

Assembly to cover the action which they want to but

dare  not  take. It is clear to everybody that  the

whole  intention  of  the  Government  is  to  take

repressive  action  against the workers.  But  they

have  not  got the guts to do it. They  want  cover

from  the Assembly. Then they would say, if anybody

should  complain, that the action was  endorsed  by

the Assembly. In the Assembly the Opposition too is

there, and, therefore, the whole responsibility  of

such repressive action would not fall on the P.A.P.

alone.  That  is their line of argument.  But  that

will not deceive anybody. They are always trying to

get  the  Assembly as cover. It is a  very  foolish

thing  because it is becoming too common. Everybody

knows  it  already. By crying "Communism"  at  this

stage, Sir, of course, they also want to create



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



an  atmosphere of fear, doubt and uncertainty;  and

when  they have created this atmosphere of tension,

they  hope that a lot of people will get frightened

so that when ultimately they take repressive action

very  few  people will dare raise their  voices  in

protest.  These are tricks which have been  adopted

in the colonial mother countries on many occasions,

and  the P.A.P. are trying the same tactics  today.

But  let  me  tell  them this. In their  trying  to

create doubt and uncertainty, fear and suspense  in

the  minds of the people, they are actually  trying

to shove responsibility away from the Government in

their  inability  to  carry  out  their  industrial

programme.  Everybody  knows  that  the   fear   of

industrialists in coming forward today  is  because

of  the political instability. They would not  want

to  invest  in  a country when they know  that  the

government  of  the day may be pushed  out  at  any

minute  and  when  they very  well  know  that  the

Government has no earthly chance whatsoever of ever

being  returned to power. Such being the case,  the

P.A.P. think it might be a good idea to  pass  the

buck  over  to the unions instead. They  have  been

stigmatizing  the  unions for a long  time.  It  is

always  an  easy  way out crying "Communism",  Sir,

because  it is very safe. When you cry "Communism",

the  Communists who are underground will  not  come

forward  to  defend  themselves,  and  we  in   the

constitutional arena will also not come forward  to

defend  Communism. So is it not  nice,  is  it  not

easy?  Always  blame  the  Communists.  Nobody  can

answer  anything.  When  it  comes  to  talking  of

Communism,  I would like to tell them  a  few  home

truths,  namely,  that it is only  people  who  are

utterly  bankrupt of ideas and who  are  hopelessly

irresponsible who will go on this particular  line.

The  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Labour  has  listed so many instances of  so-called

Communist and pro-Communist activities. Why not  be

brave  enough  to identify those people  concerned?

Name  them.  Then  carry out  what  you  have  long

intended to do; send them to the country, put  them

behind  bars,  so  that the  people  who  are  now

against the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.,  the people who are supporting the  Barisan

Sosialis,  the people who are completely  disgusted

with  the  present Government, can be put away,  so

that they may not be able to come forward to oppose

the  P.A.P.  Then maybe the P.A.P. hope to  isolate

the  Barisan  Sosialis,  reduce  our  strength  and

perhaps when there is a general election, they hope

that  they might still have a fighting chance.  And

if  they could take away the core, the real  ground

work   from   our   Barisan  Sosialis,   then   our

organisation,  our strength, will  be  reduced  and

then,  so they think, they will be able to take  us

on   at   an  advantage.  All  these  actions   and

intentions  of  the P.A.P. are very reminiscent  of

the days of the Lim Yew Hock Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already said that the Prime Minister of

today  does  not  differ very much from  the  Chief

Minister  of the previous Government. Now that  the

amendment has come forward, it makes me wonder what

is  the  real  intention  and  motive  behind  that

original  motion. Is it to allow a chance  for  the

P.A.P. to  move  their amendment  about  the  pro-Communist  elements? Is it or is it not? I  wonder,

Sir, what really was in the mind of the Member  for

Cairnhill. Because we know during the days  of  the

previous Government repressive action was taken  on

the  slightest excuse against workers. They  called

them subversives. They called them so many things -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the Member for

Cairnhill can speak his mind afterwards. Sir, it is

very  clear  to  us today that the P.A.P. and  the

S.P.A. are  in cahoots. They are going  along  the

same  road. You can see, Sir, everything  that  the

P.A.P. does,  the S.P.A. supports.  Arguments  put

forward  by the P.A.P. and the Prime Minister,  the

S.P.A. and the Members for Cairnhill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



Tanglin and Farrer Park all echo. They are all from

the same bunch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish also at this particular stage to

remind  the  Back-benches of the P.A.P.  (since  so

many  of  them are not here, I hope they will  pass

the  word round). Do not let yourselves be used  by

the  selfish Front benches just to keep  their  own

positions.   Do  not  lend  your  names   to   such

repressive  action. Never allow your  names  to  be

linked with people who want to suppress people just

for  their own selfish ends. Never do a thing  like

that.  We all know the Prime Minister is trying  to

prove   himself  not  only  an  anti-Communist   in

Singapore.  He  is  anxious to gain  repute  as  an

international anti-Communist. By so doing, he hopes

to  gain  a  lot of support from the Americans  and

from  other sources. Then all the power of  capital

and  capitalists from outside Singapore  will  also

help to influence the power that be to keep him  in

power. The only snag is, in spite of all this,  the

P.A.P. will  still not be able  to  make  it.  The

people  will  see through all their stratagems  and

tricks  and  will tear them to pieces one  by  one.

Crying  "Communism" will not be able  to  keep  the

P.A.P. in  power,  and it  will  not  be  able  to

frighten  the people into supporting the P.A.P. if

ever  they  should go to the country at  any  time,

they  will  find  that even their deposits  may  be

lost.  If  any  one  of them on the  Front  benches

should ever dare come forward for a by-election  at

any time -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Resign first.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We will do it. Yes, I can tell

you  the same thing - resign. I will resign if  the

Minister for Home Affairs will follow me and resign

straightaway. Give an assurance right here -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. These challenges being thrown

across the Chamber surely are completely irrelevant

to  the  issue.  Let  us  come  back  now  to  this

amendment  and  try  and save  some  time  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not take the House very

much longer, Sir. I feel that this amendment to the

motion is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



all  meant  to  pass  the  responsibility  for  the

failure of the P.A.P. Government on to other people

and   to  blame  those  who  cannot  reply.  Crying

"Communism",  instead  of  helping  the  industrial

expansion  of  the country will, in  effect,  drive

away  whatever investment that may be  forthcoming.

That  is  a thing which the P.A.P. does not realise

and  I  hope  someone will tell  the  Minister  for

Finance so that he may stop all this tomfoolery and

smear tactics of the

P.A.P.  Only  then will there be a  possibility  of

foreign  investment  coming  into  the  country  to

develop industries so that people may have a chance

to  get  employment and so that the living standard

of the people may rise as a result.



<br><br>7.27 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon) (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, looking at the

amendment  put  forward by the Government,  I  feel

that  it  is  rather  ridiculous and  preposterous.

Speaking on the amendment, I feel that the  present

leadership of the P.A.P.

see  Communists with their eyes open and also  with

their  eyes closed. Even when they sleep and dream,

they  dream of Communists. I would like to  suggest

to  them  that this kind of behaviour is  something

like  a disease. They have been enchanted according

to  the Chinese, and the best thing for them to  do

is  to go to Sago Lane to have a Chinese Taoist  to

drive   away  the  evil  spirits,  so  that   their

bewilderment  can be driven away. In  this  manner,

they  will  not be so confused when  they  look  at

things.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, it is  said  that  when

Radio  Singapore was moving on to the present site,

there  was some sort of evil spirit there. At  that

time the Government invited all the leaders of  the

various  religious groups to drive away the  ghost.

Since there has been a precedent in this matter,  I

would  like  to  suggest to the  P.A.P. that  they

should  have some religious man to drive  away  the

spirit of the Communists. The best course for  them

to  take is to go before the Government building in

the  City  Council, put up there a very huge  paper

figure  representing the Communists  and  then  set

this paper figure on fire.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Serjeant-at-Arms, will

you see that order is kept in the Gallery? There is

unnecessary laughter in the Gallery and even  as  I

look  up  there, I see some strangers indulging  in

laughter.  I  would like you to keep order  in  the

Gallery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Sun Wing (In Mandarin): I believe that

if  the  Government accept my suggestion of burning

the  effigy of a Communist they will then calm down

and come to their senses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I am going back to the

motion  itself.  I  do  not claim  to  be  a  trade

unionist. Because of this, I am not very sure about

trade  union  matters. But according to  my  common

sense, I feel that this amendment of the Government

is  very  preposterous and illogical. In the  first

place,  I  would  like to ask: if this  House  does

accept  this motion, then the Government will  take

steps  to  suppress and gaol all the  pro-Communist

people - does  it mean that there will be  industrial

peace in Singapore after this action? I would  like

to  ask  a  Minister of the P.A.P, to  answer  that

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that everybody who

reads   newspapers  knows  that   in   industrially

advanced countries like the United Kingdom and  the

United  States  of America the Communists  are  not

supported and welcomed by the people. Although  the

people  in  those  countries  do  not  welcome  the

Communists,  are  there  no  strikes?   There   are

widespread strikes and there is industrial  strife.

What explanation can be given for such a situation?

We  will  leave  the U.K. and the U.S.A. and  take

India  for  example.  Not  long  ago,  there   were

widespread  strikes in India. The  leaders  of  the

Indian Government servants were not manipulated  by

the  Communists, and therefore the  union  was  not

manipulated  by  the  Communists.  Yet  there  were

unprecedented   strikes.   Therefore,   it   is   a

distortion  of  fact and a deceiving  statement  to

attribute  our  local  industrial  unrest  to   the

Communists. I personally do not know the details of

every case of industrial unrest or strike. But from

reports  in the newspapers, I understand  that  the

strikes by non-P.A.P. unions were blamed for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



the industrial strife. But we do remember very well

that  the  Daily-Rated Employees Union of the  City

Council  held a three-week strike. Can it  be  said

that the leaders of this union were manipulated  by

the  Communists? From the newspapers it can be seen

that  the  present Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Culture is the head of the  A.U.P.E.

which  has  given notice of strike action.  Another

sponsored trade unionist of the P.A.P. is Mr Devan

Nair  who  is  the  leader of  the  Singapore  Bank

Employees Union which has taken industrial  action.

There  is  also another union - the Singapore  Manual

and  Mercantile Workers Union - led  by  Mr  Gomez.

This union has often given notice of strike action.

In all the instances I have mentioned, the cause of

industrial strife and industrial unrest  cannot  be

purely attributed to the Communists. You cannot say

that all strikes are Communist inspired. If you say

that  that  is  so, then all unions  including  the

A.U.P.E. and those led by Mr Devan Nair can be  so

classified.  If  the Government intends  really  to

take  action against these people, then  they  must

treat other people alike. They must put in gaol all

those  responsible for industrial  unrest.  If  the

Government were to take action against unions which

are  their political opponents, then they would not

bring about industrial peace in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather reluctant to

disclose this, but since the P.A.P. Government  now

pretend to be a Government in the interest  of  the

workers, I feel compelled to disclose the  facts  I

know.  When I first began to work in the P.A.P.,  I

was   engaged  in  the  Trade  Union  Research  and

Advisory  Bureau of the P.A.P. I was the only  paid

worker  of this organisation and there was  also  a

person who was paid but did no work. If you want to

look up this matter, you can find out that the  man

who  held this post was a sinecurist. You can  also

find out the amount of provident fund in respect of

my  post.  This so-called Trade Union Research  and

Advisory  Bureau was one in which I  worked  as  an

investigator.  At  the  beginning,   I   was   very

enthusiastic in my work. But what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



was  there to investigate? There was no plan. I did

not  know  the kind of work I was to do. I  had  to

draw on my experience as a journalist to carry  out

the  work  in  my capacity as an investigator  when

talking  to the leaders of the unions in  order  to

get  their views. Who asked me to do this  kind  of

work? It was none other than the Prime Minister who

was  then  the Secretary-General of the P.A.P.  The

Trade Union Advisory Bureau had a signboard next to

the  P.A.P. signboard. They were  using  the  same

office  and the same table. So from this experience

I  know  all about the labour policy of the  P.A.P.

Now  if  they  were  just to keep  quiet  about  it

instead of boasting about their labour policy, then

I will not have to disclose the facts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether what

the  hon.  Member  is  saying is  relevant  to  the

amendment.  We  are now debating the amendment.  It

seems  to me that he is debating the whole  motion.

But if he can satisfy me that what he is saying has

some connection with the amendment as shown in  the

cyclostyled paper he has, then he can continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Sun Wing (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  was  just giving an example  to  show  the

people the whole truth in regard -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am only interested in

finding out whether the hon. Member is speaking  to

the  amendment. He is entitled to tell  the  people

the  whole  truth.  But as  far  as  the  Chair  is

concerned,  is  what he is saying relevant  to  the

amendment,  which introduces the  element  of  pro-Communist  political agitators for  political  ends

creating  industrial  unrest,  and  calls  on   the

Government to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure

industrial  peace with justice in the interests - and

this  is  the addition - "of industrial expansion  so

vital  to the economic well-being of the people...",

and  with  a further addition in order "to  prevent

genuine  industrial grievances from being exploited

for Communist ends"? The Communist element has been

introduced  as  well as the element  of  industrial

expansion vital to the economic well-being  of  the

people. The hon. Member has not spoken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



to the original motion. He can later on speak again

to the original motion. We are now dealing with the

amendment. Mr Chan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Sun Wing (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what I was saying was actually aimed  at  the

amendment  because I have already said that  I  was

rising to speak on the preposterous amendment moved

by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was trying to show was that the P.A.P.

originally did not have any labour policy. Now that

they  cannot  get the support of the workers,  they

are  therefore very worried that the leaders of the

workers   and  the  broad  masses  of  the  workers

themselves will discard the P.A.P. policy.  And  so

the  Government have moved this amendment.  I  feel

that   this   amendment  aims  at   the   political

achievements  of the P.A.P. instead  of  aiming  at

bringing about industrial peace.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is there any other Member who wishes

to speak only on the amendment?



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu) (In Mandarin):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, originally I did not  intend  to

speak,  but  having listened to the speech  of  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Labour

on this amendment, I have a feeling that the P.A.P.

Government  at  present  is  trying  to  shirk  its

responsibility, instead of facing the people. Take,

for  example, the question of industrial peace. All

the people of Singapore can see clearly that it  is

because of the failure of the P.A.P. to keep  their

promises   that  there  is  industrial  unrest   in

Singapore.  And so just for the sake of  their  own

interests,  the P.A.P. have set up many unions.  The

City Council strike actually came about as a result

of their manoeuvres.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought I made it clear

that  the debate now is on the amendment only,  and

that  is, the introduction of the Communist element

in  the  motion as well as the effect  of  that  on

industrial expansion vital to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



the  economic well-being of the people. That is all

we  are debating about at the moment. Later on, the

hon.   Member  for  Jalan  Kayu  will  have   every

opportunity of saying what he wishes to say on  the

general aspects of the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am only trying to say that it is  not  the

Communists  who are trying to bring about  strikes.

It is the Government itself that is causing strike.

It  cannot  shirk its responsibility and blame  the

Communists  who  just cannot  stand  up  to  defend

themselves. So, as a representative of the  people,

say that there is a lot of work not yet done by the

Government.   Instead   of   carrying   out   their

responsibilities, they are trying to use  the  name

of Communists to cover up their failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This term "Communists" was frequently used by the

colonial Government and the Lim Yew Hock Government

because  at that time they were trying to  suppress

the  people instead of trying to serve the  people.

So  whenever  anyone criticised the Government  for

not doing work for the people, he would be called a

Communist.  The P.A.P. Government now is  resorting

to  the  same  tactics  employed  by  the  previous

Government  and the colonial Government.  So  I  am

just saying that there is an ulterior motive in the

amendment - to put the responsibility partly  on  the

Barisan Sosialis and partly on the Communists. They

are trying to create this Communist phobia in order

to  use  it as an excuse to suppress the people  in

future.  In  the past two years of its office,  the

Government  has failed in many respects, especially

in  dealing with strikes. It is now trying  to  put

the blame on the Communists in order to confuse the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, about seven or eight months

ago,  the  People's Association was set up  by  the

Government to take charge of community centres.  We

all  know  that  the  setting up  of  the  People's

Association, as stated in its constitution, was  to

give  proper  recreation facilities to the  people.

But  in  actual practice this was not done, because

the   P.A.P.  Government  gave  directives  to  the

workers  in  the  People's  Association  that  they

should serve the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Member satisfy the

Chair  that  this  has something  to  do  with  the

Communist  element which has been  introduced  into

the motion? If he can, he can carry on; otherwise I

suggest that he reserve his remarks until later  on

when he has an opportunity of speaking. We are  now

dealing  with  the  amendment. Let  us  come  to  a

decision in so far as the amendment is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  People's Association went on strike  for

seven to eight months, and because the Union or the

organisation   of   workers   was   involved,   the

Government  did not recognise this strike.  Instead

it  disregarded their grievances and put the  whole

blame on the Communists. So I say that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has not as

yet  satisfied the Chair that this trouble  in  the

People's  Association has anything to do with  this

Communist  element which has been  introduced  into

the  motion.  Is  he  alleging  that  there  was  a

Communist element there? Or is he saying  that  the

Government have alleged that there was a  Communist

element  there? I do not know. But will he come  to

the point, and the Chair will be satisfied?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): r Speaker,

Sir,  the  strike  in the People's Association  was

described  as  one agitated by the Communists,  and

since  the  Communist element has  been  introduced

into the amendment, I am trying to link them up  to

show  that instead of trying to settle the  strike,

the   Government  put  the  whole  blame   on   the

Communists, unless the workers' organisation can be

exploited  by  them.  Now, if  the  unions  in  the

industrial  organisation cannot  be  exploited  and

manoeuvred  by  the P.A.P., then  action  would  be

taken  against  them. That is why I say  that  this

incident in the People's Association is related  to

the  amendment. I am just giving an example to show

that all the blame regarding strikes is put on  the

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel it is necessary to

criticise  the Government for trying to  shirk  its

duties. The Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



not doing anything for the workers. Let us take the

incident at the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation

as  an  example. The strike at the O.C.B.C. was  a

cause  of  great  inconvenience to  businessmen  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is this another of the

strikes   which   the  Member  alleges   that   the

Government say was Communist-inspired? If so,  then

he is in order. If not, then he is out of order.  I

would  suggest to the hon. Member that he  has  the

opportunity,  and he will have the opportunity,  of

speaking about these strikes individually  when  we

come  to  the main motion. We are now dealing  with

the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  because  this  union  concerned  is  inclined

towards  the P.A.P., and since this amendment  says

that  industrial unrest is the result of  agitation

by  the  Communists, I dare say that  not  all  the

blame  of  industrial unrest  should  fall  on  the

Communists. Even without Communist agitation  there

is  industrial unrest or industrial strife. This is

the  position as I know it, and it is because  they

want  to oppress the workers and fail to keep their

promises made to the workers that they have to find

a way out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the P.A.P. is

afraid of the freedom for people to organise.  This

amendment  aims at threatening people in regard  to

freedom of speech. Because of the tone contained in

the amendment, if future union leaders who want  to

fight for the interests of the workers should carry

out  a struggle, then they have to think twice,  in

view  of this amendment, as it claims that the  so-called industrial unrest is the result of agitation

by  the  Communists.  So if they  should  take  any

industrial  action,  they  would  be  described  as

Communist agitators and be dealt with accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel it necessary to express my

views  to the Government Benches. It is my  opinion

that the struggle of the workers sometimes, if  not

always,   is  reasonable.  In  this  respect,   the

Government  should try its best to help  solve  the

problems of the workers. Here, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



would  like  to  quote  the incident  of  the  Shaw

Organisation. According to my understanding of this

case, the strike at the Shaw Organisation -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member now

alleging that the Government alleges that the  Shaw

strike was Communist-inspired? If he alleges  that,

then  he  is in order. If he does not allege  that,

then  I  suggest once again that he  wait  for  his

opportunity when we deal with the main motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

<div align="center"><b>TOA PAYOH RESETTLEMENT SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since  the Government announced its  plan  in

April  this year to start the Toa Payoh development

project,  25,000 residents there have been worried.

They are dissatisfied with and have strong feelings

against  the Government. What they are dissatisfied

with  is not the scheme for the development of  Toa

Payoh   itself,  but  the  Government's   rate   of

compensation   in   regard  to  the   question   of

resettlement  for  the care of the  residents.  The

Government  has  not taken into  consideration  the

losses  incurred by the 25,000 residents there.  It

has  never taken their interest into consideration.

It  has only passed decrees to carry out its  plans

without such consideration. This rude attitude  and

action  of  the  Government  is  contrary  to   the

promises  made by it to the people at the  time  of

the   general  elections.  The  present   rate   of

compensation   is  based  on  the  Lim   Yew   Hock

Government  rate which was stipulated in  1956.  In

the P.A.P. Government promises at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



the  general elections to the people in respect  of

rural development -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Interpreter will

probably find it a bit difficult to follow the hon.

Member  if  he is speaking too fast. He  should  be

slower.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  today naked facts have shown that the  P.A.P.

have   been  acting  contrary  to  their   election

promises.  According  to page  2  of  the  P.A.P.'s

pamphlet, Book I, it says in regard to the P.A.P.'s

rural policy:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The position of all agricultural lands at

present in the occupation of squatter farmers which

have  been  zoned in the Master Plan as  sites  for

satellite  towns  or  potential industrial  estates

will be  reviewed and the fullest consideration will

be  given  to the representation of the members  of

the farming community before any decisions are made

as  to the future use to which such lands shall  be

put.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, the most important part which  merits

our  attention in this passage is that the  fullest

consideration would be given to representations  of

members  of  the farming community. The request  of

the  Toa Payoh residents to the Government is  that

the   Government   should  fully   consider   their

representations. But what has the P.A.P. Government

done?  It  should consider carefully the views  and

representations of the Toa Payoh residents. But has

the    P.A.P.    Government    done    so?    Their

representations are very simple and clear. They are

not  like the P.A.P. promises made at the  time  of

the  general  elections, which were  some  kind  of

trickery and were of a very confused nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the request of the Toa Payoh residents is

that  when they are asked to remove, the Government

should  give  them  adequate, reasonable  and  just

compensation  for  the loss of  their  agricultural

produce  and all the structures built on the  land.

At   the   moment,   the   Government's   rate   of

compensation   is  based  on  the  Lim   Yew   Hock

Government's rate of compensation which  was  fixed

in   1956.   The  rate  of  this  old   scheme   of

compensation was very low. Thus the rural residents

would have to incur great losses if they were to be

paid  according  to  this old rate.  Secondly,  the

request of the residents of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



Toa  Payoh  is that after they have resettled,  the

Government  should  look after  their  welfare.  It

should  not  let them be homeless or unemployed  so

that  they would suffer the misery of unemployment.

But  according to the present Government  measures,

the  Government has not given any safeguard to  the

residents  who  are affected in  respect  of  their

future  livelihood. At the present moment, most  of

them  are carrying on farming. In future, when they

are removed to new resettlement areas, they will be

faced  with the problem of a shortage of  land  and

they  may not have adequate land to carry  on  with

their  own trade, that is to say, farming and other

things.  Hawkers perhaps will also  be  unemployed.

There  is  always  such  a danger  and  uncertainty

before  them. About 1,000 residents who  have  been

engaging  in  the  bean-curd  business  and  rattan

industry  will  also be faced with the  problem  of

unemployment.  Therefore, the Toa  Payoh  residents

are  rather worried about their future.  They  have

all  sorts of misgivings and uncertainty.  I  would

like  to  ask the P.A.P. leaders whether they  have

given full consideration to the representations and

views  of the Toa Payoh residents affected  by  the

development  scheme.  The  answer  from   them   is

obviously   no.   In   order   to   present   their

representations  and views to the  Government,  the

residents of Toa Payoh convened mass rallies.  They

launched  signature  campaigns  in  the  area.  The

Country  People's Association also spent  over  one

month  interviewing the residents in the  area  and

seeking  their  views. In the end  the  Association

drafted two memoranda which were presented  to  the

Government.    These    memoranda    systematically

presented  the  views  of the residents  and  their

request  to  the  Government. But the  Government's

attitude  towards  these representations  was  very

bad.   The   Government   entirely   ignored    the

representatives     from    the     people.     The

representatives  of the people wanted  to  see  the

Minister,   but  the  Minister  and  the   officers

responsible  refused  to see them.  They  used  all

kinds  of pretexts and elusive tactics not  to  see

them.  Can  this  attitude  on  the  part  of   the

Government  be  satisfactory  to  the   Toa   Payoh

residents? Can this kind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



of  Government be pleasant to the people?  Can  the

people  have  any confidence in such a  Government?

The  Government's barbarity and its wrong  attitude

towards the Toa Payoh problem have incurred the ill-feelings and misgivings of the Toa Payoh residents.

The  P.A.P. Government has involved itself in a way

which is just like hitting itself with a stone. The

P.A.P. Government has not tried to review its  past

mistakes and rectify them. On the contrary,  it  is

levelling  accusations against me and  the  Country

People's Association for creating troubles  against

the Government. All this is absurd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Toa Payoh satellite town

plan  was  proposed last year. At that time  I  was

still  with the P.A.P. Government. Ever  since  the

plan   was  proposed,  it  has  caused  worry   and

misgivings  to  the  Toa Payoh residents.  This  is

because  the  Government did not at the  same  time

announce   a  reasonable  and  adequate   rate   of

compensation and they did not announce its plan for

resettlement  of the residents in Toa Payoh.  After

several  contacts, with them, I came to  understand

their  misgivings  and worry. On many  occasions  I

told the leaders o, the P.A.P. about the views  and

the  requests of the people affected. As  early  as

3rd  May,  1961,  I presented a memorandum  to  the

Minister for National Development, and also to  the

leaders,  to  remind them of the  worries  and  the

views  of  the people. I suggested that  the  three

parties,  that  is, myself, certain representatives

from   the   people   and  the   Country   People's

Association,  should form a consultative  committee

to look into the Toa Payoh resettlement problem. At

the   same  time,  the  Toa  Payoh  P.A.P.   Branch

representatives  also convened a joint  Branch  and

Headquarters  meeting  to discuss  various  matters

affecting  the  Toa  Payoh  residents  which   were

detrimental  to their interest and to the  interest

of  the people living there. At that time, that is,

in  May last year, about 20 Branch secretaries  and

assistant    secretaries   had   presented    their

representations to the leaders of the P.A.P. on the

question  of the Toa Payoh development  scheme  and

resettlement  problems.  The  representations  said

that in implementing the Toa



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



Payoh satellite town plan, the Government had  held

no  prior consultation with the residents there and

had  no  understanding of the living conditions  of

the  residents there. In fact, it had not paid much

attention   to   the  problems  of  resolving   the

livelihood  of the people affected by  the  scheme.

Though  the  plan itself is good, nevertheless  the

Government  has never taken into consideration  the

interests  of  the  people affected.  The  People's

livelihood  depends on business and  trades.  These

are  closely linked with the place they live in and

the  people affected will incur certain  losses  in

respect  of  their  property and  belongings.  This

should also be taken into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the request and views of the

people affected can be likened to a stone which has

sunk  in  the sea. They did not evoke any  response

from  the  P.A.P.  Government. The  Government  has

entirely ignored the misery and the difficulties of

the  people affected. On this point we, the  people

who  have  suggested various views and requests  to

the  P.A.P. Government, had in the end to part ways

with  the P.A.P. leadership politically. At present

the  P.A.P. leadership  have  incurred  the  great

displeasure  and dissatisfaction of the  Toa  Payoh

residents.  Now the P.A.P. leaders  are  trying  to

seek  some  other  side issues in order  to  divert

attention. They now construe the Toa Payoh  problem

as  a  kind of political question and put the blame

on  the Barisan Sosialis. They are accusing  us  of

purposely  trying to create confusion  and  trouble

and    also   create   ill-feelings   against   the

Government. These tactics on the part of the P.A.P.

disclose   the  Party's  barbarity,  rudeness   and

unreasonableness  in  dealing with  this  question.

This  kind  of  levelling accusations and  throwing

blame  will  not  help  solve the  various  matters

arising from the Toa Payoh development plan at all.

If  the  P.A.P. Government had sincerely  respected

the views and representations of the people and the

Rural  People's Association in thinking out a  good

plan to deal with the Toa Payoh problems, i.e.,  to

look after the interests of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



people  affected  and to have  a  certain  kind  of

safeguard for their livelihood, then this  question

could have been resolved amicably. It is now trying

to pay for its phoney merger and Malaysia Plan with

the  money it has, but it is not willing to  settle

the Toa Payoh problem. It has spent about $130,000

on   Malaysia  Week  and  the  Malaysia  Solidarity

Consultative Committee. It has spent about  $40,000

to  $50,000  in  distributing Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew's

pamphlets  for his personal propaganda.  These  are

issued   in   small  pamphlets  numbering   a   few

thousands. But as to the request made by the 25,000

Toa  Payoh residents, the P.A.P. Government is  not

even interested in their livelihood and after-care.

On  the  contrary, the P.A.P. Government is issuing

statements  in  the newspapers and trying  to  show

that  it is helping the Toa Payoh residents to move

into  a kind of paradise, whereas we, on the  other

hand, are trying to prevent them from resettling in

a  paradise. It has been said that we have lost the

support  of  the people of Singapore. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the people are the supreme authority and  the

final  judge on the question of what is  right  and

what  is  wrong, what is true and what is false.  I

would  like  to  draw the attention of  the  P.A.P.

leadership to this fact. I would like seriously  to

challenge  the P.A.P. leadership. If  any  of  them

wants to resign now, I would like to contest him in

a  future  by-election in order to let  the  people

pass their final judgment on us.



<br><br>8.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Sir, I would like to quote from a

Government Press release dated 10th March, 1962. It

started off briefly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It has now become clear that the Barisan

Sosialis  having failed to work up  public  opinion

against the Government among the workers, students,

People's Association employees and members  of  the

Work  Brigade, are now, in conjunction  with  their

sympathisers,  the  Country  People's  Association,

turning their attention to farmers and other  rural

people.  Towards this end, they are now  trying  to

work  up anti-Government feeling over the Ton Payoh

Development Scheme.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone of us knows that they are turning

their  attention  to  the  farmers  and  the  rural

people. One week ago, the Member for Toa Payoh  and

his  Party  held a mass meeting in  Toa  Payoh.  We

heard  from the Member for Toa Payoh just now  that

there  are about 25,000 settlers in Toa Payoh,  and

out  of  this  25,000 settlers, only  150  of  them

turned up at this meeting. The other 400 or 500 who

made  up  the crowd were brought in. It just  shows

that  the people who voted for the Member  for  Toa

Payoh  voted for the P.A.P. They did not  vote  for

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Member for Toa Payoh was still in

the Government, he vigorously advised the people of

Toa  Payoh  to  accept  the Government's  terms  of

compensation as fair and reasonable, and  he  urged

them  to  move out to resettlement areas set  aside

for  them by the Government. Now that he is in  the

Barisan Sosialis, he sings a different tune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh and his friends in the

Country People's Association have been told of  the

many  amendments this Government has  made  to  the

compensation  terms.  They pretend,  however,  that

they do not know. To refresh their memories, I will

mention  some  of these items. For  concrete  water

ponds   in  the  agricultural  areas,  which   were

previously not eligible for compensation  they  are

now compensated for by the Government according  to

their  cubic capacity. This was introduced  on  8th

October,  1959.  Again  on  11th  July,  1960,  the

Government  enlarged the list of  items  for  which

compensation would be paid by including such  other

items as Buah Namnam, Daun Pandan and orchids,  all

of  which  are  crops grown fairly  widely  by  the

country  people. On 15th January, 1962,  a  further

amendment  was made to provide for compensation  to

be  paid to owners of prawn ponds due for clearance

based on the cubic yardage of the earth fillings to

bunds  and  the number of sluice gates  and  Bakau

payas.  These new rates of compensation  for  prawn

ponds   proved  so  satisfactory  to  all   parties

concerned that the clearance of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



settlers  at Tanjong Kling and Joe David  Road  for

the  development project was affected smoothly  and

without disruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to expanding the list of items for

which  compensation  will be paid,  Government  has

also  removed from the schemes of compensation  the

limitation  as to the maximum amount of  payment  a

settler with less than one acre of land may  obtain

from   Government  by  way  of  compensation.  This

amendment,  which  was introduced  on  28th  April,

1960, enables a farmer with a holding of less  than

one  acre  to be eligible for the possible  maximum

compensation of $1,500 for his crops,  fruit  trees

and  flowers.  In  November  1960,  the  Government

revised  Resettlement Scheme C  to  provide  for  a

settler who cannot be classified as a farmer to get

compensation also. Under the unrevised scheme, such

a  settler was not entitled to any compensation for

improvements effected to the land he occupied. Now,

not  only this settler, but also his bona fide sub-tenants  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  for

improvements.  In addition, each of  them  will  be

given  a free basic house and a small plot of  land

on  which  he can continue to carry on his  present

occupation.  Government has already  announced  its

intention  to apply this revised Scheme C  together

with a special scheme of house exchange to meet the

special  conditions in Toa Payoh. A $5,000  terrace

house with its own yard along Kim Keat Road will be

given free to the owner-occupier of an existing hut

in  Toa Payoh, who, is willing to give up his whole

hut  in  exchange  for  a Government-built  terrace

house.  He  will pay a ground rent of $5 per  month

and   will   be  free  to  carry  on  his  previous

occupation   of  beancurd-making,  poultry-rearing,

etc.  This  exchange will, in fact, mean  that  the

settler  concerned will be getting a $5,000 terrace

house  with  all the amenities laid on in  exchange

for an old and often unsanitary hut worth less than

$2,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation by the Member for Toa Payoh and

his friends that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



people  of  Toa Payoh did not know where they  were

going  to  be resettled is without foundation.  The

settlers had been told individually by resettlement

inspectors  where they were going to be  resettled.

They  were  also told that they would  be  free  to

carry  on  the same occupation in their new  homes.

The  further charge that the settlers were  not  or

would  not  be  given full compensation is nonsense.

Government compensation terms have been given  wide

publicity in the last few days. Yet the Member  for

Toa Payoh, the Country People's

Association  and  the Rural Residents'  Association

keep  on  repeating that the terms of  compensation

are  insufficient and are pressing their  fantastic

demands. For instance, they want the Government  to

pay  compensation at the rate of $30 per  vegetable

bed  to  farmers. Sir, one acre of land can  easily

accommodate  300  such  beds and  the  compensation

would  amount  to $9,000. Again, for  earth  orchid

nurseries,  the  Association wants  a  compensation

rate  of  $100  per plot and, on the basis  of  300

plots  to an acre, the total compensation  for  one

acre of orchid nurseries works out to $30,000. They

know full well that no government can afford to pay

such  fantastic compensation terms. But then,  Sir.

their  objective  is  not  to  reach  any  amicable

settlement  of the issue, but only to create  chaos

and  confusion among country people to  suit  their

own  political ends, i.e., to involve country folks

in  the  Barisan  Sosialis'  futile  fight  against

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's schemes of resettlement are

aimed at assisting the people affected by clearance

to  settle down quickly and continue earning  their

livelihood  in  their  new  homes.  The  Toa  Payoh

Development   Scheme   will   provide   not    only

accommodation for thousands of people who  have  no

proper homes, hut also employment, both direct  and

indirect,  for  many thousands of its  inhabitants.

250,000  to  300,000 people will be housed  in  the

50,000  housing units and 100 shops that will  rise

up  in  this  area. There will be four markets,  20

primary and secondary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



schools, community centres and theatres, and  other

amenities  will  also be built to cater  for  these

people. But more important than anything else,  the

Toa  Payoh scheme will provide employment for 8,000

people  engaged in construction work and the supply

of  building  materials over a period  of  about  5

years.  The  earth that will be cut  off  from  the

hilly  parts of the Toa Payoh area will be used  to

reclaim  about  400 acres of land  in  the  Kallang

Basin.  The  land  so reclaimed will  be  used  for

resettlement   for  establishment   of   industrial

estates  that  will  provide  employment  for  some

30,000 to 40,000 people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the tremendous benefits that the

Toa  Payoh  scheme  will bring  to  the  people  of

Singapore,  the  Government  will  not  allow   its

intentions and its objectives to be deterred by the

agitations  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and   their

political   stooges   in   the   Country   People's

Association,  whose sole interest  is  to  see  the

failure  of  the Government's Four-Year Development

Plan  so that the pro-Communists can thrive on  the

resultant  widespread chaos and  unemployment  that

will  arise  from  the failure of this  development

scheme -
