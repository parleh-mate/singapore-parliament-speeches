<div align="center"><b>MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Ruling by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In relation to the motion in regard

to  the Member for Hong Lim which was sought to  be

moved  by  the Leader of the House yesterday,  hon.

Members will now know that notice of the motion had

in  fact  been given. The notice was to the  effect

that  the Leader of the House would move the motion

on Monday, the 19th day of December, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of the House nevertheless appeared to have taken the view that the motion was of such

urgency  and  of  such  importance  that   he   was

compelled  to  bring the matter to  the  House  for

debate  immediately relying on  the  provisions  of

paragraph (e) of Standing Order No. 30 which  reads

as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`30. Unless Standing Orders otherwise direct,

notice  shall be given of any motion  which  it  is

proposed  to  move  with  the  exception   of   the

following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) A motion for the suspension of a Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will recollect that I stated that I

wished  to  be  satisfied on two  points  before  I

permitted  the Leader of the House to proceed,  the

two  points being, firstly, whether in view of  the

fact  that  yesterday was a day  allotted  for  the

business  of Supply, the motion could be  taken  on

such  a day and, secondly, whether the motion could

properly   be  moved  without  notice   under   the

provisions of paragraph (e) of Standing  Order  No.

30.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, the relevant Standing Order

as I indicated yesterday is Standing Order No. 85,

paragraph (2) of which reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(2) On a day allotted to the business of Supply,

the  business  of Supply shall stand as  the  first

order,  and  so long as the business of Supply  has

not  been  completed, no business  other  than  the

business of Supply shall be taken after 3  p.m. or

before  8 p.m., and except in pursuance of Standing

Order  No. 21 (Adjournment on a definite matter  of

urgent  public  importance) no business  of  Supply

shall  be  taken  after 8 p.m.,  whether  an  order

exempting business from interruption under Standing

Order No. 4 (Exempted Business) is in force or not,

unless  the Assembly otherwise orders on the motion

of  a Minister moved at any time between 7 p.m. and 7.30  p.m. to  be  decided  without  amendment  or

debate.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there can be no doubt that a motion

of the nature proposed to be moved by the Leader of

the House is an item of business within the meaning

of  the  term "business" used in paragraph  (2)  of

Standing  Order  No.  85, and therefore  under  the

terms  of that paragraph, the motion could  not  be

taken  on  any  day allotted for  the  business  of

Supply between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. but could be taken

before  3  p.m. and/or after 8 p.m., in the  latter

case,  upon  a  resolution under the provisions  of

paragraph  (1)  of Standing Order No.  4  that  the

proceedings thereon be exempted from the provisions

of Standing Order No. 1 (Sittings of the Assembly),

in order that the motion could be debated after the

moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, the question of notice, it

is  a  well  established principle of Parliamentary

practice that before a complaint is made against  a

Member  he  should  be given notice  beforehand  in

order  that  he  should know the substance  of  the

charge  against  him and in order that  he  may  be

given the opportunity of being in the House in  his

place to be heard, if he so desired, in explanation

or  exculpation. When, however, a Member is  guilty

of  an offence in the view of the Assembly, that is

to say, guilty of an offence committed by him while

he  is  in the House during its sitting, and it  is

thought  necessary  to  take  action  against   him

immediately, then, of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



no  such notice would be necessary, and proceedings

could be taken against him forthwith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the principle I have enunciated,

therefore,  it appears to me that the provision  in

Standing  Order  No. 30 whereby a  motion  for  the

suspension  of  a  Member could  be  moved  without

notice  must  be taken, in fairness to  the  Member

concerned,  to have reference to a case  where  the

Member  is guilty of an offence in the view of  the

Assembly.  In  such an event, the  Standing  Orders

themselves   provide  for  the  procedure   to   be

followed.  The relevant Standing Order is  Standing

Order No. 56, paragraph (1) of which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`56. -(1) Whenever a Member has been named by the

Speaker  or by the Chairman, immediately after  the

commission  of  the  offence  of  disregarding  the

authority  of  the  Chair, or of  persistently  and

wilfully  obstructing the business of the  Assembly

by abusing the rules of the Assembly, or otherwise,

then,  if  the offence has been committed  by  such

Member in the Assembly a motion shall forthwith  be

proposed  by a Minister or Parliamentary  Secretary

present  "That Mr... be suspended from the  service

of  the  Assembly", and the Speaker shall forthwith

put  the  question  on that motion,  no  amendment,

adjournment  or debate being allowed; and,  if  the

offence  has  been  committed in Committee  of  the

whole   Assembly,  the  Chairman  shall   forthwith

suspend the proceedings of the Committee and report

the  circumstances to the Assembly; and the Speaker

shall on a motion being made as aforesaid forthwith

put the same question, no amendment, adjournment or

debate  being allowed, as if the offence  had  been

committed in the Assembly itself.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have formed the opinion, therefore, that the

motion for the suspension of a Member mentioned  in

paragraph  (e)  of Standing Order No.  30  must  be

taken  to  refer to the motion to suspend described

in the paragraph I have quoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from what I have said the motion proposed to

be  moved by the Leader of the House is, of course,

more than merely a motion to suspend the Member for

Hong  Lim. It also seeks a resolution of the  House

condemning  the  Member for Hong  Lim  for  certain

conduct alleged, in the motion, to be dishonourable

and  unbecoming of an elected representative of the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, therefore, it is my considered

opinion that this matter is clearly a matter  which

calls  for appropriate notice to be given not  only

to the hon. Member concerned but also to other hon.

Members  of  the House. I therefore rule  that  the

motion cannot be proceeded with forthwith and  does

require the requisite notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the notice already given, the motion will

accordingly  be  set  down  for  Monday,  19th   of

December.

<br><br><div align="center">DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES, 1961</div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Development Estimates. For the

convenience  of hon. Members, I intend  taking  the

totals  for each head as they appear in the  fourth

column of the summary of expenditure on page 502 of

Paper Cmd. 26 of 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D8 -



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D8 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been asked to vote a sum of $600,000

for   the   acquisition  for  slum  clearance   and

improvement schemes. I would like to ask the  Prime

Minister (I think it is his portfolio) whether slum

clearance  within the context of  this  vote  would

also mean clearing slums in the rural areas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the provision is for two purposes, both in the

City  and  rural areas. These two purposes  are  as

follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Section 15 of the Planning Ordinance provides

for   the   service  of  purchase   notices   on

Government in cases:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) where any person whose land is allocated in

the  Master Plan for development for a  public

purpose  (other  than a green belt)  completes

development  of any contiguous land  belonging

to  him. He can serve a purchase notice on the

Government.'



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the owners of housing estates, after

completion  of  development,  can  serve   purchase

notices in respect of land within the estate  which

has  been zoned on the Master Plan as "public  open

space" or for a "public market". Or,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(b) where any person has been refused

permission  to  develop land  allocated  under

the  Master  Plan for a public purpose  (other

than   a   green  belt)  in  an   area   where

permission  would otherwise have been  granted

to such development of land.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give another relevant example. The Geylang

Serai  Trade Fair site. Here we refused  permission

for  development of part of the site as  a  private

market,  and the owner could have served a purchase

notice in this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum provided in the Estimates will enable the

Government to purchase land in such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The sum is also to enable acquisitions for

improvement schemes, back-lanes and roundabouts  to

be carried out, and to meet outstanding liabilities

under the Singapore Improvement Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I asked a

very  simple  question, whether this sum  would  be

used for slum clearance in the rural areas as well,

and  I  received a long lecture on the Master Plan.

It is somewhat confusing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary did mention - I do not know whether the interpretation was correct - that

Geylang Serai, which is my constituency, is  within

the  scheme  of the slum clearance. Can he  confirm

that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I only gave an

example of how the sum could be used.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, will it be used for slum

clearance in Geylang Serai?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This sum is not

only  to  be  spent on work in respect  of  Geylang

Serai but in respect of other areas in the islands.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, is the Parliamentary

Secretary confirming that Geylang Serai also  comes

within the scope of the improvement scheme?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So I gather.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this vote

"Acquisition  for  Slum Clearance  and  Improvement

Schemes",  as  I  understand it, is  not  for  slum

clearance itself but merely for the acquisition  of

some  other  land  in order that  particular  slums

might  be  cleared  on to the  acquired  land.  The

second purpose for which the vote is sought  to  be

used is for improvement schemes. If I am correct in

my assumption, could the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Prime  Minister  tell  us  how  much  of  that

$600,000  is for the acquisition of land  for  slum

clearance,  how  much  of  it  is  for  improvement

schemes, which are the lands he proposes to acquire

for  slum  clearance, and what are the  improvement

schemes he has in mind?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, I gave

an   example   relating  to  Geylang   Serai.   The

application for a Trade Fair site was not approved.

This  sum  is only used as a reserve sum  for  such

cases  that may arise in the future. Just  now  the

Member for Farrer Park understood quite correctly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> May I rise

to add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I do not think it is

in  the interest of land owners to determine  first

the  priorities  upon which certain urgent  schemes

are  being pressed upon the Ministry at this stage.

It   may  well  be  for  divers  reasons  that  the

priorities  which we are giving at this moment  may

not  be  the  priorities which will,  in  fact,  be

implemented. I do not think it will be practical or

wise to name the priorities at this stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I agree with the statement of the

Prime Minister that perhaps it might not be wise to

divulge the areas where the Government wishes to go

in  and  buy land, but at least he could  tell  the

House   how  much  of  this  money  is   for   land

acquisition  and how much of it is for  improvement

schemes.  I do not wish to know the areas in  which

he  is going to purchase the land for these schemes

so  long as he could let the House know how much of

this vote is intended for the purchase of land. But

on  the improvement schemes, Sir, I cannot see  any

reason why the House should not be told where  they

are going to be carried out. On the answer given by

the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime  Minister

that   this  vote  is  intended  to  be  used   for

compensation for deprivation of use, it seems to me

to be a peculiar heading for a compensation of that

nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, most of Changi is in the green belt. We know

that if an area is marked out as "green belt", then

normal  development cannot take place there.  There

are  hundreds of acres marked out as "green  belt".

Is  the  Government saying that  if  any  owner  of

property in the green belt wishes the Government to

compensate him for loss of use, this vote  will  be

used for such compensation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We anticipate that the

majority  of  the  vote  will  be  used  for   land

acquisition  for slum clearance As the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  is well aware, for slum clearance  in

respect of the S.I.T., the amount involved for town

improvement, backlanes and all the little  bits  of

land  required  for  straightening  of  roads   and

corners is fairly negligible. As to the wider issue

which the hon. Member has raised about compensation

for  the  non-user, I think the question  does  not

arise at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to me that

the Government has just put in this sum of $600,000

without really knowing what use it is going to make

of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Perhaps the Member for Farrer

Park will change his mind. Sir, if he wishes to, he

could put in a query and he could be supplied  with

a list in the Estimates Committee which,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



I  would add, would be a privileged occasion  where

land owners will not be given an advantage.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It was a remark I was going to

make. Perhaps the Member for Farrer Park will raise

it in the Estimates Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I will, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D8 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been given to understand

that  an  area in the Malay Settlement was approved

by  the  last Government in 1958. I would  like  to

know   whether   this   provision   includes    the

construction of Malay areas in Jurong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the sum of $12,800 has been provided mainly to

pay  for the salaries of temporary staff of a

full-time  Secretary  to  the Boards  of  Management,  a

typist  and  a  clerk  in  respect  of  the   Malay

Settlement.  This  staff  assists  the  Boards   of

Management  in administrative and clerical  duties.

We  therefore provide this sum mainly to  meet  the

salaries  because of the integration  of  the  City

Council with the Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the point brought up by the Parliamentary Secretary

to the Prime Minister was not a direct answer to my

question.  I  would like to know  whether  an  area

which  has been approved by the Government will  be

made into a Malay Settlement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on page 513

of   the   Estimates  under  Head   D   20 - National

Development - (sub-head 2),  a  sum  of  $500,000  is

provided  for  Rural  Development  Projects   which

include the Malay Settlement.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I only

want  to  know whether the Jurong area,  which  was

approved  in  1958  to be made a Malay  Settlement,

will  be  developed by the Government according  to

the  provisions made, and will the plan be  carried

out or cancelled?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It might be convenient when we come

to  Head D20, sub-head 2, in respect of which there

is  an  amendment in the names of  the  Member  for

Geylang Serai, the Member for Farrer Park, and  the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan, to  deal  with  the

topic of the Malay Settlement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, before the debate on the

item  proceeds, may I remind the House that I  have

promised  to draw up a more comprehensive  list  in

order to show how much of the vote, which has  been

spread  in the various Estimates, is to be  devoted

to   the  rural  areas,  which  include  the  Malay

Settlement?  But as I have explained earlier,  when

the  Budget was integrated, the old format  of  the

Rural  Board vote disappeared, and therefore  items

which would have been collected together under  the

Rural  Board  vote  had  been  dispersed  over   20

different  Heads. I have caused  a  summary  to  be

prepared  so  as to give Members an opportunity  at

one  sight  to see how the spread-out of  some  $12

million  for the rural areas, including  the  Malay

Settlement,  will  be spent. If  I  may  take  this

opportunity, Mr Speaker, Sir, to leave some copies

for  the  use of hon. Members on the other side  of

the House, and perhaps-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Table it. If the Prime Minister

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am rising on a question of

principle, Sir. This is a Development Estimate  and

the  total plan cost of this particular development

is  $12.8 million; 100 per cent of which is  to  be

spent  in the forthcoming year. My appreciation  of

the Development Estimates vote was that most of it,

if not all, would go to capital expenditure, not so

much  consumed  on Staff as in other matters.  From

what  I can gather from the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Prime Minister, it seems to me that all the

money, if not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



most of it, is to be consumed in salaries of staff.

If  my  appreciation is correct,  is  this  then  a

Development Estimates Vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is

only  partially  true. The item has  been  included

under the Development Estimates because, as I  have

explained, such items in the past would  have  been

in  the  Rural Board Development vote.  This  is  a

setting-up  of  a  new office where  furniture  and

other  things,  buildings and so  on,  have  to  be

acquired. Subsequently when the office has been got

going,  the Personal Emoluments which are  annually

recurrent will appear in the P.E. Vote.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I take

this  opportunity to get further clarification from

the  Prime Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary.

The  area which I represent, Kampong Kembangan,  is

part   of  the  Malay  Settlement.  Could   I   get

clarification as to whether the Work Brigade, which

is in this area or in the Kaki Bukit area, is to be

transferred,  or  will  it  be  there  permanently.

Although that is Government land, as far as I know,

the  land  is allotted to those who apply for  land

from the Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like to explain to the

Member for Kampong Kembangan the work that has been

done  by  the Work Brigade in Jalan Eunos,  because

the  Brigade  has been asked to work in  the  Malay

Settlement. When the work is completed, the Brigade

will  be  transferred to a place according  to  the

scheme of those who control them. And the site used

as  the  Work Brigade camp will be allotted  for  a

market and shops.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Am I right in assuming that the

topic  raised  by the Member for Kampong  Kembangan

comes  within  the  portfolio of the  Minister  for

National Development?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I clear this point, Sir?

In   so  far  as  construction  expenditure,   i.e.

buildings,  levelling  of  land  and   so   on   is

concerned, it will come within the portfolio of the

Minister for National Development. But in so far as

it  comes  within rural development, then it  comes

under my portfolio.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is convenient then that we deal

with the matter now, I take it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, as I have said, the

difficulty arises because all the items  have  been

dispersed  over  the whole of the Budget,  some  20

Heads.  It is really a matter for Members  opposite

to  choose any particular point of entry  on  which

they  would like to enlarge their thoughts  on  the

Government's plan for rural development.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I did remark sometime ago that it

is,  in fact, a matter of convenience. I was trying

to  channel the debate in its proper course because

of the passage of time.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I hope

the Prime Minister could clarify certain points, as

I   would   like   to   banish   all   doubts   and

misunderstanding.  As  far as  I  know,  the  Malay

Settlement is, according to this Budget, under  the

office of the Prime Minister. I am neither hurt nor

jealous,  but I am surprised that the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for National Development

is Chairman for every area in the Malay Settlement.

As  far as I know, as a Parliamentary Secretary, he

has  a  lot of work and burdens to carry and, apart

from  being  Chairman of three areas in  the  Malay

Settlement,  he  is  also a member  of  the  Muslim

Advisory Council. Could the Prime Minister  explain

to  me  why the opportunity has not been  given  to

other Malay Members on the Government side?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am deeply indebted to

the Member for Kampong Kembangan for his suggestion

as  to  how  I  should  spread  the  responsibility

amongst  Members  on my side of the  House.  I  can

assure  him  that, in my opinion, the  Member  most

qualified to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



discharge  these  duties, and for this  reason  has

been asked to do so, is the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for National Development. For  one

very  simple reason: he is also in the Ministry  of

National Development, apart from the fact  that  he

is  a  Malay and also a Muslim learned (as  he  has

mentioned)  in the laws of Islam and so  on.  As  I

have just explained, in rural development, when  it

comes  to building, levelling lands, then  it  goes

over  to  his Ministry. And therefore a  convenient

administrative arrangement is to have one person to

co-ordinate  needs which arise from  two  different

Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,312,800 for Head D8 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D13 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D13

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members are aware that the Federation

Government  is  going ahead with  an  international

airport of its own. In the light of that, does  the

Government  not  consider that the  importance  and

usefulness  of  the  Singapore  Airport  might   be

impaired  to the extent that certain traffic  might

be   diverted   to  the  Federation   International

Airport?  If  such  is  the  case,  would  not  the

Government  think  it advisable to  reconsider  its

plans   fur  the  development  of  the  Paya  Lebar

Airport, and see in what way money could be  saved,

if necessary, before spending such a big sum, about

$11  million,  for an airport whose usefulness  and

importance  might  be impaired  as  the  result  of

another international airport just 250 miles away?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr Speaker, we are fully aware that the Federation

Government  are  very anxious to  build  their  own

international  airport,  thereby  probably   saving

Federal  citizens  the trouble of  coming  down  to

Singapore  to catch a flight overseas.  However,  I

would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



to  remind the House, and in particular the  Member

for  Cairnhill, that even if the Federation  should

have    their   own   international   airport,    a

considerable amount of air traffic will still  pass

through   Singapore.  We  are  in  the   privileged

position  that  we  have  an international  airport

located almost within eyeview of the seaport.  With

such  a  favourable location, it is important  that

Singapore  should  seek  not  to  diminish  but  to

increase   its   prestige   as   an   international

communication centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plans for development of the international

airport  at Paya Lebar have been thoroughly studied

by  me  when the Department came under my  control.

Estimates  made  in 1959 to spend  $60  million  on

development  on the Paya Lebar Airport  have  since

been considerably cut down. The requirements for  a

hangar  runway  extension  and  passenger  terminal

building amount to only $6.5 million. The amount of

money  spent on these facilities should be  clearly

distinguished     from     that      spent      for

telecommunications.      The       amount       for

telecommunications is $2.2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that in these days, when jet

planes  are flying at a speed of about 400  to  600

miles  per hour, we should be able to detect  these

planes   several  miles  before  they   arrive   at

Singapore.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, in fact, one of the functions of Air

Traffic Control to direct aircraft at what altitude

and   at   what  distance  they  should  fly   into

Singapore. Without telecommunications, it will  not

be  possible  to  do so. And in  Singapore  we  are

particularly   faced  with  the  problem   of

co-ordinating civil and military aircraft. As  Members

are  aware, there are altogether four airfields  in

Singapore - one  civil airfield  and  three  military

airfields, the military airfields being at  Changi,

Tengah  and  Seletar. Military  aircraft  are

jet-powered aircraft. Civil aircraft today are also

jet-powered aircraft. Changi airfield is very close  to

Paya Lebar airfield, and it has happened at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



times  that  military aircraft  have  mistaken  the

civil  aerodrome as Changi airfield and vice versa.

Under  these  conditions, it is essential  that  no

accidents  and  no collisions should occur  between

fast  flying aircraft, and the only way to  prevent

these collisions is to use the latest technological

advances in telecommunications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have radar aid, and it is proposed to

install radar costing $1.1 million at Paya Lebar to

assist Air Traffic Control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been very careful in estimating demands

for  extension  of the runway. Let  me  inform  the

House  that  there  are two considerations  in  the

building  of  the runway. One is strength  and  the

other is length. As far as the strength of the Paya

Lebar  runway  is concerned, all airline  operators

are  satisfied that its structural strength fulfils

their requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting of the International Civil Aviation

Organisation  in  January 1959 in Rome,  there  was

some form of general consensus of opinion that  the

runway for all airfields where the first generation

jets,  the  Boeing  707  and  the  D.C.8.  will  be

landing,  should  have at least a length  of  9,500

feet.  In January this year, the International  Air

Transport   Association  -I.A.T.A.  -reviewed   the

position, and considered that there should  be,  in

fact, a length of 10,000 feet, plus 500 feet

clear-way at each end, totalling 11,000 feet. In February

this  year, a Pan-American Airways jet survey  team

came to Paya Lebar to examine the facilities of the

airport. It came to the conclusion that the  runway

at  Paya  Lebar  was adequate for  existing  sector

lengths,  although it may be insufficient for  full

economic operation where the stage lengths  of  the

Boeing   707  aircraft  exceed  1,500  miles.   All

aircraft  which fly from Singapore have a range  of

1,500  miles.  Djakarta, Bangkok.  Manila,  Saigon,

Rangoon,  Ceylon, Hongkong and Calcutta, all  these

airports are within 1,500 miles. The only sector on

which the Boeing 707 does not carry a full pay-load

is  the Singapore-Darwin sector; this sector having

a distance of 1,820 miles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see, there are conflicting views

on   runway   requirements  by  different   airline

operators, depending upon the type of aircraft they

used.  We have today the first generation  jets  in

the  Comet,  the Boeing 707 and the D.C.8.  It  has

been  predicted that in 1964 the second  generation

jets will appear. One of them is the V.C.10, and it

has  been  stated  by  the manufacturers  that  the

V.C.10  will  be  able to utilise  the  Paya  Lebar

Airport  on  the existing length of 8,000  feet  on

full pay-load from Karachi to Singapore. In 10 to 15  years'  time, it is predicted in  the  technical

journals  that supersonic aircraft will make  their

appearance.  As  aircraft designs  improve  and  as

aircraft engines improve, the length of runway  for

take-off need not be as long as is the demand  made

by  the  airline operators today. In fact,  at  the

Farnborough  air  show this year, it  was  reported

that  an  experimental  aircraft  came  flying  in,

stopped in mid-air, and landed down vertically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when we consider the requirements and the developments of the airport, we have to

look pretty far ahead, and we have to keep in touch

with modern developments. We should not, therefore,

consider  developments just for next  year  or  the

year after. We should consider what will happen  to

the  developments that we put up now at the airport

in five years' time, in ten years' time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I remind the Minister

that  debate on this Head must end at 3.30 p.m.?  I

do  not  know  whether  any other  Members  of  the

Opposition  would  like to ask  further  questions.

Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I have said, Mr Speaker, that

we  have made a careful study of the development of

Paya  Lebar  Airport, and the amount of money  that

has  been allocated for its future development  has

been  scaled  down considerably from  the  original

estimates.  Moreover,  we  are  encouraged  by  the

promise of the United Kingdom Government to  assist

in  the development at Paya Lebar. In a letter from

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



Secretary  of State to the Prime Minister,  he  has

promised  £210,000  sterling for runway  extension;

£296,700  for  radar  and  other  telecommunication

aids;  and £250,000 for a terminal building. I  can

assure the House, and in particular the Member  for

Cairnhill, that there would be no wastage of public

funds when we come to extend the facilities at  the

International Airport.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is not only the wastage

that  is  involved, but the wisdom in  carrying  on

with it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, wisdom lies in careful

planning, and I think they go together. It does not

necessarily  mean that if you have an international

airport at Kuala Lumpur, therefore we should  close

down  the Paya Lebar Airport. I am sure the  Member

for  Cairnhill is not suggesting that. Moreover,  I

may  add  that airline operators will  continue  to

pass  through  Singapore in five years,  ten  years

time,  whatever may happen in other parts of

South-East  Asia;  for one simple reason,  and  that  is,

Singapore is the centre for air traffic.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, may I withdraw the motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,469,010 for Head D13 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D20 -



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D20 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 1*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment stood in the names of  Mr Ong Eng Guan and Mr A. P. Rajah.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sum of $34 million has been set aside for

housing  in  1961. This is a huge  sum.  I  should,

therefore, like to ask the Minister some  questions

before  I proceed in making my comments. These  are

the  questions. First, whether this  would  be  the

total  amount  required for the building  of  7,200

housing  units  for  1961?  Second,  whether   this

includes  the cost of land? Third, the areas  where

the  housing units would be put up? And fourth, the

cost of each housing unit?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Geylang

Serai  must know how this $34 million will be spent

next  year  in housing development. It has  already

been  announced  that for 1961  - announced  outside

this  Assembly  - plans have been put  up  to  build

12,000  units in 1961. It is expected  that  about.

9,000  of these units will be completed next  year.

The areas where these housing units will be put  up

will  be  at  Tiong  Bahru, Queenstown,  MacPherson

Road, Selegie Road and St. Michael's Estate.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost per unit will be in the region of $4,700

for  a three-room unit, $3,700 for a two-room unit,

and $2,000 for a one-room unit.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> There is another question to

which  the Minister has not replied, Sir, and  that

is,  whether  the amount of $34,000,000  asked  for

includes the cost of land?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> In some areas, yes.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in other

words,  the figures given by the Minister  are  not

quite correct, as in some areas, as he admits,  the

cost  of land is not included. In other words, Sir,

there is a hidden subsidy in regard to this housing

loan  to  the  Housing Authority. I was  wondering,

Sir,  whether in next year's estimates the Minister

for Finance would give a proper figure so that this

Assembly would be fully aware of the actual cost of

each  housing  unit. That is to say,  the  cost  of

building and the cost of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, if I may draw, the attention

of  the Minister. He says here that the units to be

put   up   will be   in  Tiong  Bahru,  Queenstown,

MacPherson  Road,  Selegie Road and  St.  Michael's

Road.  You  will  see, Sir, that  all  these  areas

mentioned are within the City area. I was wondering

whether  the  Minister would  consider  putting  up

houses in the rural areas as well. There is a great

demand for houses in the rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the previous Government, I think it was in

1957, no less than 200 housing units were put up as

a  pilot  scheme  in  Bukit Panjang.  It  was  very

successful and, if I am not mistaken, there were no

less  than  2,000 applicants for the 200 houses  in

Bukit Panjang itself. Similarly, Sir, it would be a

wise  move if Government would put up these housing

units  in rural areas where the demand is  just  as

great as, if not greater than, in the City area.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I notice the Member for Hong

Lim is reading a newspaper. I was wondering whether

it  is in connection with this debate. If it is  in

connection with this debate, then, of course, he is

in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, it is

in connection with my speech later.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I

am not quite sure how the Member for Geylang Serai,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, comes to the conclusion that the

figure  in  the Development Estimates  contains  an

element  of  concealed subsidy because he,  as  the

former  Minister for Local Government,  Lands,  and

Housing,  is familiar with many aspects  of  public

housing, and, perhaps, the most perplexing  one  is

the question of subsidy. Hitherto, the main item of

subsidy  which  the Government  has  given  to  the

Housing  Authority is by way of  a  very  long-term

loan - a   60  years'  loan - so  that  the   cost   of

amortization will be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious thing about the policy of the

previous  Government - I  do  not  want  to  make   a

political  point here, but it is a fact that  there

has  been  a  multiplicity  of  rents  charged  for

practically similar accommodation. Partly, this was

due to the fact that houses were built at different

times  and  costs  varied at different  times.  But

there was also the tendency for rents to go down as

polling day came nearer. But, be that as it may the

Housing  Board  has represented to  the  Government

that  there is a case for subsidy. They base  their

argument on three grounds:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. It is the general practice in many countries

to   provide  either  direct  subsidy,  by  way  of

allocation from the revenues, or indirect  subsidy,

by way of remission of rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Housing Board say that the are providing a

number  of services by way of maintenance of  roads

and  properties which are, in fact,  services  they

could  have  expected the City Council  to  provide

since they pay the full rates to the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Housing Board is an agency of Government

in  the  implementation of its social policies.  In

other  words, it is not a money-making concern.  It

does  not rent out its dwellings to those  who  can

pay the highest rent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In taking all these three factors into account,

it  does seem to me, at any rate, that they have  a

case for subsidy. Then, of course, you want to  see

how  the subsidy is calculated. I, for one, believe

that if any subsidy were to be given to the Housing

Board,  it should be an open one. It should  appear

as  an item in the Budget. But the matter is, as  I

have  said,  an extremely complex one,  because  we

have  to  make  sure  that whatever  the  basis  of

calculation of the subsidy, it should be  one  that

can  lend itself to long-term calculation, so  that

we  will  not  saddle future governments  with

increasing amounts of subsidy as a result of what  we

do now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, while we are on the financial

aspect of this matter, might I ask the Minister for

Finance  (this  is a loan to the Housing  Authority

and I take it the loan will carry some interest) if

he could inform the House of the terms of the loan,

dates  of repayment, and such like things connected

with the loan?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The loan has not been

negotiated  yet. I think it will  be  a  matter  of

negotiation  between  the  Housing  Board  and  the

Government. There are two alternatives; one is  to

allow  for an element of concealed subsidy  in  the

loan by giving them a repayment period of 60 years;

the  other one is 10 charge them the current market

rate,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



i.e., what the Government itself has to pay when it

borrows from the market. No decision on this matter

has yet been reached.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I have

the  assurance from the Minister about  putting  up

houses in rural areas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, in our Five-Year

Programme of building, there will be units  put  up

in the rural areas, and I think that should satisfy

the Member for Geylang Serai.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am glad to hear that 9,000 units  will  be

completed in 1961. However, I would like  to  point

out  that  we  all  know that there  is  a  housing

shortage. I was surprised that 91 terrace houses at

Tiong Bahru. 16 units at the Queenstown flats,  and

13  units at the St. Michael's Road flats were left

vacant.  We were told this by the Minister  on  the

16th  of  November. When I asked whether  the  high

rents  had  anything  to  do  with  it,  you   will

remember,  Sir, you very aptly reminded us  that  I

was not to go into details because we were debating

the  speech  of the Hon. the Minister for  Finance,

and  we  were dealing with general principles.  Now

that this debate is on housing, may I point out  to

the  Minister (I will not go into details) that the

rents  that  have been asked from the fire  victims

are  in  some cases nearly 40 per cent higher  than

what  they  are  paying now. I do understand,  Sir,

that   the  present  rents  they  are  paying   are

subsidised by the Government to the extent of their

paying  $25  (I  think the rent  is  $30)  and  the

Government  is  subsidising $5. I also  understand,

Sir,  that  this cannot go on forever, but,  seeing

that  this is a case of fire victims who have  lost

everything  in  the fire, could  the  Minister  not

extend  this privilege to them? Moreover, Sir,  the

Government  have  always  criticized  the  previous

Government  for building expensive houses  so  that

the  rents  have  to  be  high.  If  I  am  rightly

informed, Sir, this project at Tiong Bahru is not a

creation of the previous Government. The plans that

have  been  put up for that have been scrapped  and

new plans have been made by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



present  Government and houses are built  according

to the present Government's plans. That is why I am

surprised,   Sir,   that  the  buildings   are   so

expensive. For a much inferior building which, as I

have said the other day, offers no separate kitchen

and  bathroom  facilities, the people  have  to  be

charged  nearly  40  per cent more  than  what  the

previous Government had been charging all along for

the S.I.T. flats down at the old Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Sir, as I have said, I have had

complaints from 135 people whose names, particulars

and  addresses I have, and if the Hon. the Minister

for  National Development will be so kind - I do not

want  to  bore  the  House  - as  to  grant  me   an

interview, I am prepared to come with some of these

people and place the case before him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is a more recent complaint, Sir,

about  S.I.T. flats. It seems  that  formerly  the

S.I.T. supplied  bulbs for all  lights  along  the

passageway  of  the flats. This is  something  that

they have put forward to me. The tenants were asked

to  pay  for the charges under conservancy charges.

Two   days   ago,   the  S.I.T. mandore   received

instructions to take away all the bulbs  along  the

passage-way. The excuse is that the maintenance  of

this type-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. Sir, is it in order to

discuss these details in a debate on principles?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have indicated that too much

detail  will probably take us a bit far  away  from

the  idea of a Committee of Supply, i.e., to debate

the   principle  of  Government  policy  in   these

matters.  I  have  also  indicated  that  there  is

nothing to prevent a Member in passing from  airing

a complaint.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, letters

were  read  out  yesterday, and  the  Minister  for

Education was listening patiently-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have ruled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I will then mention

that  there  have been complaints that  tenants  of

S.I.T. flats have been asked to pay for the use  of

the  lights in the passage-way and although in  the

past bulbs have been supplied, the tenants now  pay

for  the  bulbs themselves. These bulbs  have  been

taken  away  by  the Government although  they  are

their  bulbs and not the Government's. The  tenants

were  told  that they were not to have  lights  any

more.  On  principle, Sir, this  is  a  bad  thing,

especially in this case where it happens at the old

Airport.  It is not a very good area, and to  leave

all  those blocks in darkness, as the letter  if  I

were  permitted to read it would have told you,  is

just providing opportunities for scoundrels or  bad

hats to go into houses, un-noticed.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, these fiats are five and six storeys

high  and it is quite dangerous at night if  people

have to grope in the dark when going up and down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for National Development will

give  his  consideration to these cases, because  I

believe that not only are bulbs removed from  these

flats  that  I  am  concerned with,  but  since  in

principle the S.I.T. are not going to supply  bulbs

and  have taken them away, any bulbs put up by  the

residents  will  be taken away in future.  That  is

why,  in principle, I do appeal to the Minister  to

give a second thought to their complaint.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have just a few words to

say. Mr Speaker. Sir. When I spoke just now. I did

mention, in  passing, that as  polling  day  drew

nearer last year



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister did get away

with that. He is now trying to draw the Speaker  on

too much. Let us keep away from that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is the essence of my

argument,   because  the  Member  for   Mountbatten

alleged  that the present Government was  charging.

rents  that are 40 per cent higher than  what  they

should be, and my answer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



was  that  the  rents charged just  before  polling

day - in the case of the Tiong Bahru fire victims who

were  moved to Geylang - were 40 to 50 per cent below

what  they  should have been. It  was,  of  course,

unfortunate that the houses were burned out but  it

was  very  fortunate for them that that happened  a

few weeks before polling day.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the one

hand, it may be correct, but on the other hand,  it

is  not. The fire victims were treated as a special

case.  At  the  time  the fire victims  were  given

flats, there were other people who were also  given

flats. They were not charged rents similar to those

charged to the fire victims. I can assure the House

that  it  was  not a question of electioneering  at

that time.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if my

information  is  correct - I believe it  is  correct,

because it came from reliable sources - that the fire

victims had only a subsidy of $5, the rent was $30.

The fire victims paid $25.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I would like to go back to

the  day when the Member for Mountbatten questioned

about  flats  being vacant because of  high  rents.

When  the question was asked, there were 91 terrace

houses in Tiong Bahru Fire Site that were completed

and were vacant at that time. No offer had yet been

made  to  the  fire victims at that  time.  So  the

question of high rent did not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of fire victims now being

offered high rental flats or housing units in Tiong

Bahru  Fire Site. Sir, it was the intention of  the

previous Government to start this Tiong Bahru  Fire

Site  scheme to build units so that they  would  be

available to the fire victim families at low  rent.

As   an   interim   measure,  566   families   were

accommodated  in  one-room and  two-room  flats  at

special  rentals of $25 and $35 respectively.  Sir,

according  to the Housing Board, these  rents  were

given  to the fire victims at a very heavy subsidy.

The  economic rentals of the flats at Kallang  that

were rented out to the fire victims at $25 and  $35

worked  out  at $73 and $77 a month. Sir,  you  can

imagine the amount of subsidy the Government had to

pay for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



housing   these  fire  victims.  The   Member   for

Mountbatten said that there was only a  subsidy  of

$5. Perhaps her mind is a bit clearer now about the

subsidy  the  Government has  to  pay.  From  these

figures, it is clear that the subsidy for the flats

rented  out  to the 566 families amounted  to  more

than half the full cost of these units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the question of these units that were put

up  in  the Tiong Bahru Fire Site. When the present

Government  took over, the plans drawn  up  by  the

previous  Government were already  in  an  advanced

stage.  In order not to delay the project,  it  was

decided  to  proceed with the scheme as  previously

planned, but with modifications in order to  reduce

the  cost per unit as much as possible and, at  the

same  time, to provide a larger number of units  on

the  same area of land. The original scheme was  to

provide  a total of 740 units at a total  cost  of

about $4.8 million. The revised scheme provides for

a  total  of  1,025 units at a total cost  of  $5.3

million.  It  will be seen that for  an  additional

cost of $0.5 million, an additional 285 units - about

40 per cent more - will be provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the modifications, Sir, it was found that

economic rentals for the units would still be quite

high, namely, $40 for one-room flats, $45 for

two-room  fiats and $68 per month for three-room  flats

or  terrace houses. To let these flats or units out

at low rentals within the means of the fire victims

as  proposed by the previous Government would  mean

that   the   Government  would  have  to   meet   a

considerable  subsidy covering at  least  half  the

actual  cost  of  providing the  units - a  scale  of

subsidy  which  is quite unthinkable.  Accordingly,

the   present  Government  decided  that  the  more

sensible  course  would  be  to  make  these  units

available to the public at economic rentals and  to

provide  for the fire victims and other members  of

the lower income group a new basic type of low-cost

unit that can be rented out at $20 per month. It is

expected  that 900 of these units will be available

at  Tiong Bahru next year and these will be offered

to   the   fire  victims  in  the  first  instance.

Meanwhile, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



victims of the fire are being given first option to

occupy  the  units that are completed at  the  fire

site if they are prepared to pay economic rentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be said that the Tiong Bahru fire

victims  would suffer hardship as a result  of  the

Government's decision to let out these Tiong  Bahru

Fire Site units at economic rentals. Those families

have  been  given flats at Kallang at  special  low

rentals. In addition, each victim has received cash

relief of $90. All the fire victims, however,  will

be  eligible to apply for the $20 units  when  they

are completed at Tiong Bahru.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaints on lighting. Sir, in

the  past, the Singapore Improvement Trust had been

lavish in the matter of providing lighting for  the

flats  so  that  at night when we passed  by  these

multi-storey flats, we saw a blaze of  lights  even

till  the  early  part of the morning - till  6  a.m.

This, however, cost the Board a considerable sum in

the  electricity  bill  and  burnt  bulbs.  As   an

economic measure, the Board is now providing, on  a

trial basis, only lights on the staircase and  also

one light in the centre of the access corridor, and

all  other lights have been taken off. This is only

an experiment to reduce costs to the Housing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, about bulbs belonging to the tenants

that  have been taken away by the Board, I  am  not

aware of this, but I will look into it.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems

quite obvious that the Minister meant that the fire

victims  would be able to apply for the  $20  flats

even  though  they refuse what is offered  to  them

now.  There are fire victims who have been  offered

these  present flats at Tiong Bahru, and there  are

others who have not been offered. I think it is the

practice  that  those who refuse now  will  not  be

given  a  second chance. Sir, that is why  I  would

like - if  the  Minister  would  be  so  kind - to  get

confirmation that if these fire victims refuse  now

what is offered to them (i.e. the present flats at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



Tiong  Bahru)  they would not have to forego  their

privilege of applying for the $20 flats in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> If the Member for Mountbatten

had  listened to my last sentence, she  would  have

realised that I said that all fire victims would be

eligible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I have two points. The Minister for

National  Development - I think it  was  last  Sunday

when  he was opening the Housing Exhibition - made  a

statement  that the Housing Board would charge  $20

for one fiat. He has given to the House the cost of

these units - $2,000 for a one-room flat. He has also

said  that  a  two-room unit would cost  the  Board

$2,700  and for a three-room unit $4,200. I hope  I

have  not  taken him down wrongly.  Those  are  the

figures I took down: $4,200 for a three-room  fiat,

$2,700  for a two-room flat, and $2,000 for a

one-room flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Probably the figures are

wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> The cost of a three-room unit is

$4,700 and the cost of a two-room unit is $3,700.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am much obliged. Taking the figures

then as $4,700 for a three-room unit, $3,700 for  a

two-room unit, and $2,000 for a one-room unit,  the

Minister  made an announcement that the  Board  was

intending  to  charge $20 for a one-room  unit.  On

that  basis, Sir, it would appear that  a  two-room

unit  will be let at $37 and a three-room  unit  at

$47.  Assuming  that the cost  per  unit  has  some

relation to the rent, it would work out that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the House has also been informed by the

Minister for Finance that the monies which will  be

utilised  by the Housing Board will all  be  monies

given  to  them on loan, the interest on which  has

not  yet  been fixed, and the manner of  repayment,

whether by annual repayments or in what manner  the

loan should be paid, has not yet been determined by

Government. If in these circumstances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



the Minister for National Development is unable  to

say  how much interest he would have to pay to  the

Government, and how much of the capital  monies  he

would  have to repay per year or at any other time.

I  am  wondering, Mr Speaker, Sir, how the Housing

Authority  was able to advise the Minister  and  to

commit  the  State to letting this out at  $20  per

month.  Because  if the Government is  against  any

subsidies,  it  could well be that  the  Government

might decide to charge an economic rate of interest

at  5  or  5½ per cent, and those of us who  have

some  experience  of housing management  by  public

authorities know that a vast portion of the  rental

charged is because of interest payments which  have

to  be met on the loans utilised in the building of

those houses. That is the first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, is this - I have it

down  as 12,000 units for 1961, that is the  figure

the Minister for National Development gave.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> 9,000 units to complete.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He hopes to build 12,000 units. This

$34,000,000 is for 12,000 units of which  he  hopes

to  complete  9,000 in the year 1961. That  is  not

quite a small undertaking, Mr Speaker, Sir,If the

Government could complete 9,000 units next year,  I

think  they would have done very well, and I should

congratulate them. But the building of these  units

is a huge undertaking. Not only is it a question of

bricks  and mortar and land, it is also a  question

of  providing services for these houses before they

become   habitable.  Services  mean  water,  light,

sewerage, and things like that which go to make  up

modern living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I have the assurance of the Minister for

National  Development that he has  in  this  matter

consulted  the City Council, or whoever runs  these

services  now, and that they will be in a  position

to  supply  him  with  water, the  light,  and  the

sewerage facilities that he needs for these  12,000

units?   And   could  the  Minister  for   National

Development   also   indicate  to   the   House - the

Minister, of course, is aware that in so far as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



provision of light and water is concerned, the City

Council adopts a certain policy with regard to  the

public  at large - whether the City Council  also  is

going  to adopt the same policy with regard to  the

provision  of  water  and  light  for  the  Housing

Authority?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

dispose  of the first of the three points  made  by

the Member for Farrer Park? As I understand it, his

contention was that, unless the rate of interest is

settled  between Government and the Housing  Board,

the  Board  itself will not be able to  compute  an

economic rent, because payment of interest and more

particularly  the funding operations  of  the  loan

would  be a major item of cost. If that is correct,

what  the  Housing Board did take as  a  basis  for

computation-and   that   has   been   accepted   by

Government  -is  the current practice  of  allowing

them  a fairly extensive period of repayment in  60

years.  This  is the thing that really reduces  the

cost  of  amortisation. We  can  hardly  grant  the

Housing Board less generous terms than those in the

past,  but  in the event we require that  they  pay

interest  at market rates and on repayment  periods

normal  to  such loans, then, of course, they  will

have  to  pay more for interest because of  funding

operations which would be more, but that will  have

to be offset by a corresponding subsidy, so that it

comes to the same at the end.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said just

now  that  the plan was to built 12,000 units,  and

out  of  these, 9.000 are expected to be completed.

As  regards  light and water and arrangements  with

the  City  Council, I shall be glad to  supply  the

details  to  the Member when they are available  to

me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in Part 2 of

the  P.A.P.'s  "The Tasks Ahead", page  29,  it  is

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A human being has three basic needs namely,

food, clothes, and housing.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, during the Budget debate we have

already  touched on the position of the  first  two

needs, food and clothing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Government with a policy of soaking

the poor, the standard of living has gone down;  in

other  words, less income means less food and  less

clothing.  Sir, today we touch on the  third  basic

need  of  a  human  being in this society,  namely,

housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same page of Part 2 of "The Tasks Ahead",

it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During the last four years [i.e., during the

Labour  Front Government], the S.I.T. produced  an

average  of  2,000 units per year, and not  all  of

these  were within the reach of the poorer  classes

of  people. It is estimated that Singapore needs to

produce  10,000  units of housing  for  the  public

annually [in other words, a minimum of 10,000 units

of flats for the people of Singapore].'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, when I took charge of public  housing

in  June 1959, we immediately started to reorganise

the S.I.T. on a semi-war footing. Mr Speaker. Sir,

I  was  appointed Chairman of the S.I.T. so that  I

could  have  firsthand knowledge  of  the  building

programmes  and  firsthand  charge  of  the   whole

programme.  This is an idea of how  we  carried  on

with building. The officers-in-charge had to give a

time-table  for every project which we put  up.  We

started in June, immediately after taking over  the

S.I.T. Among the many projects was the Kampong  Koo

Chye  project. Each project had a time-table. Would

you  excuse  me if I read, just for the purpose  of

illustration, the following time-table for  Kampong

Koo Chye?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Documents sent for typing [i.e., plans and

specifications]  on the 14th July;  about  a  month

after the taking-over of the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Documents completed, 17th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Advertisements in the Press, 18th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Tenders to be returned, 27th July at 10 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Tenders to be checked during 27th July (on the

same day).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Tenders to Acting Deputy Manager, 28th July

(on the following day).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Notice of acceptance to contractors on the

same day, 28th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Contractors to finalise formalities, 30th

July.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in other words, in about two

weeks  after the plans and specifications had  been

drawn up, the whole project was ready for work  and

the  contractor was supposed to march in  with  his

tractors and machines and work should be started.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same with the Kampong Tiong Bahru

scheme,  the MacPherson Road scheme, the Queenstown

scheme,  the  Kallang/Tanjong Rhu scheme,  the  St.

Michael's  Road scheme, and various other  schemes.

At  the  end  of this sitting, I shall lay  on  the

Table, Mr Speaker, Sir, various schemes which  had

been put out for contracts to show that by February

1960    we   should   have   6,973   units    under

construction - 6,973 units under contraction - that is,

within  the  space of less than eight months  after

the new Government had been formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not possible to

build  houses  with just plans and  specifications,

contracts,  and other things. The last  element  is

not  forthcoming, i.e. funds from the Minister  for

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the new Government was

formed,  the  Minister  for  Finance,  being   very

stringent  with his funds as far as the  public  is

concerned,  froze all votes voted by  the  previous

Government on housing. Some of the votes were,  for

instance, on specific schemes like the Kampong  Koo

Chye Fire scheme, the Kampong Tiong Bahru Fire Site

scheme,  and  even  these  specific  schemes  which

amounted  to about $7½ million were being  frozen

by the Minister for Finance. Despite protestations,

as  usual, the Minister for Finance turned  a  deaf

ear.  So, on the 13th August, 1959, I wrote to  the

Minister for Finance, as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provision of Funds for Low Cost Housing



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Keng Swee,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already intimated to you on several

occasions,  my  Ministry will require  considerable

funds   to  carry  out  the  Government's  low-cost

housing programme. We are aiming at the first phase

on  the  construction of some 10,000  units  at  an

average cost of $4,500 per unit, which, as you will

see,  will  require  funds  to  the  order  of  $45

million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that there are three ways in which

these funds can be made available, namely-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the provision in the 1960 Estimates from

funds available to the Government, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) by floating a Government loan, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) by the S.I.T. floating its own loan through

the   issue   of  housing  bonds,  under   the

provisions  of  Sections  25  and  27  of  the

Singapore Improvement Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be grateful if you will let me know as

soon  as  possible  whether  you  can  arrange  for

provision  of  funds as in (a) or (b) above.  Since

failing  either of these two courses, I propose  to

initiate action on course (c) .

I  do  not consider it advisable for the S.I.T. or

any  other division of your Ministry to go into the

market.'



<br><br>Immediately I replied, on the 21st:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to your letter that the S.I.T. could not

enter the market at the moment.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, it is not true that I am not

co-operative. I agreed to the request of the  Ministry

of Finance, and we were very co-operative.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that the Minister for Finance

floated  a Government loan of $30 million,  he  was

more  willing to put the money in the bank,  paying

$1.8  million interest a year, rather than lend  it

to the S.I.T. to build houses.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am wondering why in this

particular instance there must be a personal attack

on  the  Minister for Finance. Is there not such  a

thing   as  Government  responsibility  or  Cabinet

responsibility?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Minister for Finance

had  not  consulted his Government Ministers,  then

perhaps there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



something  in  it.  But I should imagine  that  all

these decisions are decisions of high policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is far

from  the  fact.  He would consider  this  as  high

policy  of  Government, but it  is  not  the  case.

Otherwise,  I would not have raised it today.  This

is  a typical example of a letter from the Minister

for Finance:



<br><br>`Dear Eng Guan,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We discussed the need for the S.I.T. to commence

its  building programme as early as possible. I  am

in  sympathy with your proposal to get on with  the

job  as  this will provide a boost to the  economy.

For  this  reason we agreed that you would initiate

action  as  soon  as I give you  the  green  light.

Please  take this letter as support for  S.I.T. to

enter  into  a total commitment of $15 million.  We

agree  that  as little of this should be  spent  in

1959  so  that  the  amount to be  entered  in  the

Development  Budget  for  the  next  year  can   be

correspondingly increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory limit for your expenditure in 1959

is,  as  you know, $7 million, but I do not  expect

that  anything more than a very small part of  this

would be spent. I have already asked the

Accountant-General  to  arrange for the payment  of  $4½ million

that  you asked for. The 1960 Development Estimates

are now being framed.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, this shows who runs finance. This

letter gives us a clear inication that there was no

attempt to build houses, but he pushed forward  the

money to 1960, if possible, to show the public that

we  were  going to build houses just for propaganda

purposes. But despite the fact that the Minister-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Hon. the Minister will

have time later on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I just want to find out the

date of the letter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see. If the Member will give the

date.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> 17th October, 1959. So despite

the fact that the Minister had in writing said that

he  had asked the Accountant-General to arrange for

the  payment of $4½ milllion, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

cheque did not seem to arrive at all. So on the 9th

November, I had to write again for clarification.



<br><br>`9th November, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please refer to your letter of 17th October.

1959,  informing  me that you are prepared  in  the

first  instance to make available a  total  of  $15

million  for S.I.T. housing for this year  and  the

next. There are a number of points I should like to

raise  for  clarification. Firstly,  is  it  to  be

assumed  that  the  $15  million  includes  the  $7

million  which has been provided for S.I.T. housing

out of previous loans granted by the Government? If

this  is  so,  then the new money  which  is  being

provided  for  S.I.T. housing schemes  is  only  $8

million.  Secondly,  I must presume  that  the  $15

million  is  not intended to cover the two  special

Government housing schemes for which special  funds

were  provided by the previous Government,  namely,

the  Kampong Tiong Bahru and the Kampong  Koo  Chye

schemes.  As  you  are  no doubt  aware,  money  is

provided for the two schemes as follows:

<pre>

                                         $



 (a) Kampong Koo Chye scheme          569,000

 (b) Kampong Tiong Bahru scheme     4,800,000

</pre>

<br><br>I  understand  that the $569,000 for (a)  has  been

released  for  expenditure. But  out  of  the  $4.8

million  for (b), that is, the Kampong Tiong  Bahru

scheme,  only a total of $1.2 million  has  so  far

been  made  available, leaving a  balance  of  $3.6

million  yet to he made available. In any case,  it

seems to me desirable that funds provided for these

two  schemes  should continue to be  kept  distinct

from  the  loan  funds  to be provided  for  S.I.T.

housing  projects  for two reasons.  In  the  first

place,  these  are special Government  projects  to

house fire victims which S.I.T. have been asked  to

undertake.   Secondly,   donations   from    public

contributions,  the  City  Council  and  the   U.K.

Government,  totalling  about  $181,000   for   the

Kampong  Tiong  Bahru scheme and $206,000  for  the

Kampong Koo Chye scheme are involved in the scheme.

In order that I may have a clear idea of the extent

of  funds  I shall have available for my Ministry's

housing schemes, I shall be grateful for your early

clarification of the two questions raised above. If

you prefer it, I shall, of course, be happy to have

a  meeting  with  yourself  and  officials  of  our

Ministries to clear up the matter.

<pre>



                                        Yours sincerely,

                                    (signed) Ong Eng  Guan.'

</pre>

<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  the  last  of   the

correspondence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed:</b> (In Malay): Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Yaacob, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would

like to know whether we are now on the question  of

the   duties   of  the  ex-Minister  for   National

Development, or whether we are now on the plans for

1961. It appears to me that we are now going on  to

another  matter concerning the duties  of  the

ex-Minister  for  National Development. We  are  going

away from the matter before us.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As far as I could gather, the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

National Development is inquiring whether it was in

order  or  relevant for a Member to touch  on  past

expenditure when dealing with expenditure for 1961.

To  my  mind,  it  is relevant to  try  to  draw  a

comparison between what has been done, what has not

been  done,  and what will be done  to  enable  the

Members of this Assembly to decide whether  or  not

the amount to be voted for 1961 is justified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, without the

basic  necessity of life - money - nobody can do  much,

however  hard  we  work. So  since  money  was  not

forthcoming, and despite the fact that most of  the

contracts had been signed with the contractors,  we

could not start work. Instead, what was done was to

start  a Commission of Inquiry into building rather

than to provide the money which the Government  had

deposited, paying interest, and refusing to lend it

to the S.I.T. and also refusing the S.I.T. to float

its own loans. Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that there

are  tens  of  thousands of people  who  have  been

waiting  for years and years queuing up for  S.I.T.

flats. It is these flat-seekers who are the persons

who  suffer.  To my knowledge, some  of  them  have

waited  for five to six years, and even  until  now

they  cannot  get  a  flat. We hope  that  the  $34

million  which  has  been  earmarked  in  the  1961

Estimates  for loan to the Housing Authority  would

not be meant just for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



propaganda  purposes but would be meant really  for

building  flats. In the past one and a half  years,

there was no construction by the Government at all,

except  opening hospitals and markets built by  the

former  Government or the former City Council.  The

only  new construction of this Government had  been

several  community  centres and opening  the  Telok

Paku  Rest  House - a  former  house  built  by   the

Government and which was just whitewashed.  But  we

hope  from  now  onwards that the  Government  will

honestly and sincerely build flats for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this going to be the

case? The 8,000 over units which the S.I.T. is  now

building and which are in the process of completion

were  built  and  started in  1959.  As  far  as  I

understand, the Minister for Finance is  still  not

yet sure of his new housing plans; whether they are

going to have standard types of a one-room flat, or

a  two-room flat, or a multi-room flat. A  decision

has  not  yet  been made. I urge the Government  to

leave  the  matter of housing to the  Minister  for

National Development who is the best authority  and

who is the best portfolio in charge of the subject,

rather  than  a Minister for Housing  who,  we  see

today,  is  the  real person who runs  the  Housing

Authority. Mr Speaker, Sir, the earlier a decision

is  made, first, on the sites, and secondly, on the

plans of the flats, the better it would be for  the

people   of  Singapore,  instead  of  arguing   and

disputing  on small and minor technical issues  for

which we have to suffer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think I am going to enjoy

myself. Mr Speaker, Sir, and if you will give me



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So long as the mood is good!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I hope you will give me some

latitude   because  I  have  been  under   personal

criticism. The Member for Hong Lim started with  an

account of how he conducted operations when he  was

the  Minister for National Development. He put  the

S.I.T. on  a  war footing and in two  weeks'  time

could  carry  the  whole process  of  planning  and

designing,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



from  the  typing  of the plan  to  the  contractor

getting  down with foot-rule on the field.  Sir,  I

put  it to you that this is purely a figment of his

imagination. In one instance, I knew what  happened

because  he got into an awful jam, and he sent  his

Parliamentary Secretary to me to sort out the  mess

he had landed himself into. And briefly it is this.

He  was  uncertain how he could tender for  a  very

substantial sum, some $600,000 or so, and he wanted

to  know whether the approval of the Senior Tenders

Board  was  necessary.  I  told  his  Parliamentary

Secretary that it was necessary, and that  if  they

proceeded with it, then they may have to  face  the

wrath   of   the  auditors,  the  Public   Accounts

Committee  and  so  forth. This brilliant  war-like

operation which he described just now -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister will not give way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, Sir, It is as fictitious

as  the  paper houses that he mentioned.  The  main

substance  of what he said was this. He  could  not

build houses because he did not get the money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You got the money, but you would

not give it to him?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would not give it to him,

black-hearted Finance Minster that I am! During all

this  time the S.I.T. had ample money of their  own

to  complete payments for whatever was on foot.  By

the  time October came, and that was when he really

thought he was done in, he was worried. He was very

angry  because  I did not give him $15  million  to

spend  for 1959. Sir, there were three months  left

for 1959.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the Member for Hong Lim has magicians and

fairy  godmothers to construct real houses and  not

paper  houses out of thin air in a matter of weeks,

I  say  that the amount of money he asked  for  was

quite  unnecessary, as he had more than  enough  to

spend on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has read out extracts of letters I sent

to  him, commencing with a letter of 13th of August

and ending with his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



appeal  for  more funds, to which I did not  reply,

dated  the  9th  of November, 1959.  Naturally,  he

wanted  money. Fair enough. He had to  make  out  a

case  for wanting money. That was duly communicated

to  him  between August and October. What we really

want  is,  "What are your plans? You want to  build

houses.  So  what  are  your plans?  What  is  your

policy?  How  many  houses?  Where?  What  rent  or

subsidy?" These are all very complicated issues.



<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MR G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 12th of September, 1959, in reply to

my  request  for details of his housing project,  I

received  this letter, and with your permission,  I

shall  read it. We were on talking terms then,  Mr

Kandasamy.  Sir,  and  the letter  quite  naturally

started  in  endearing  terms  which  will  not  be

tolerated today. The letter reads:



<br><br>`Dear Keng Swee,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our recent conversations I have discussed

with you our 5-year plan for housing. We propose to

build  about 80,000 units of flats within the  next

five  years and we have confidence that it  can  be

done.  The total amount of funds required is  about

$400  million. However, I feel that if the Treasury

can  get  $300  million it is  sufficient  for  the

purpose  because some of the flats can be sold  and

in the meantime certain rents can he collected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the land in the 5-year plan are now in

the  possession  of the S.I.T. and I  am  confident

that  you  will agree with me that every  endeavour

must  be  made  to  complete this 80,000  units  of

houses within the next five years.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And enclosed was the Minister's five-year housing

programme.   Mr  Kandasamy,  Sir,  I  shall   have

occasion to quote from his appendix to the Treasury

letter, and with your permission, may this document

be circulated to Members of the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> You may lay it on

the   table.  Dr  Goh,  do  you  have  copies  for

distribution?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. I have copies. It

occurred to me that this subject might arise and  I

came equipped with the documents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents* handed in.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Copy placed in the Assembly Library.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Referring to the documents,

perhaps-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> They will be

distributed. Dr Goh, you may continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this request for $400

million  is  contained in the annex to the  letter.

You  will  notice  that there  are  23  lines,  Mr

Kandasamy,  Sir, and four columns  -the  year,  the

place,  the  number of units to be built,  and  the

cost.  Sir,  anyone  capable  of  doing  elementary

arithmetic will find that all that has been done in

order  to get $400 million is to multiply a  figure

by  another figure to get the answer. This is  done

23  times. The only mathematical operations  needed

are multiplication and addition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Minister for Labour and

Law,  has  for some time been pestering  me  for  a

photostat  machine costing some $600, and  we  have

not  yet  come to an agreement because we  have  to

assess  whether  he needs this particular  machine.

The   impasse   may  be  ended   by   sending   the

Organisation  and Methods Branch to  have  a  look.

Now,  for  a small sum of $600, Sir, we do  try  to

find  out  whether  there is a  need  for  such  an

expenditure. Here you have a monstrous  demand  for

$400  million  on this rag of paper.  There  is  no

description  of  what type of  houses  are  to  be

constructed,  what  is the rent, what  consequences

will  follow, what are the subsidiary costs by  way

of  markets, creches, and schools. When I  received

this,  I  thought, well, perhaps this  was  just  a

summary  of  some  grand  master  plan,  which  the

despatch  clerk  in his Ministry had  forgotten  to

send  along. On inquiry, I was told that  this  was

the plan. This was the $400 million plan. Obviously

it  was  impossible to treat this application  with

other  than  contempt.  Nevertheless,  we  were  on

speaking terms then, Mr Kandasamy, Sir, and I  did

ask  him, "Let us have some more details." I waited

for  some time, until November, but no details were

forthcoming.  By that time we were aware  that  the

position, so far as public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



housing went, was serious; that, in fact, the whole

machinery had run to a standstill. Hence my request

to  him in November. "For God's sake, get going  on

public  housing. Never mind the plan. We can  check

on that later." Far from being grateful that he got

away  with  substantial sums of money, he  had  the

effrontery  now to complain that he  had  not  been

given his just due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Sir, that in any government, in any

country, be it the most backward, if a Minister  in

charge  of housing were to ask for $400 million  on

the  basis of a scrap of paper, copies of  which  I

have  distributed  to Members, I suggest  that  the

reasonable  response that that Minister could  have

expected  was to have been packed up  to  a  mental

home to have his head examined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it gives me no pleasure to dwell on the

inadequacies  and follies of a former  Minister  of

the  Government whose stupidities at that  time  we

were  responsible for. But I do want to  point  out

that  the  Member  for Hong Lim is  no  longer  the

Minister  for National Development. He has divulged

papers and documents concerning State business. May

I remind him that there is such an Ordinance called

the  Official Secrets Ordinance, and that we  shall

be consulting our State Advocate-General whether or

not his action in publishing correspondence between

himself  and  myself  in  this  Assembly  has   not

constituted  a  breach  of  the  Official   Secrets

Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Kandasamy, here is another

typical  example  of  sheer  intimidation  to  take

proceedings -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, on a point of order. Is

it  in order for someone to allege that a Member of

the House is intimidating him?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> No. I do not think

he  suggested that anybody here intimidated him.  I

think he felt it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Oh, I beg your pardon, Sir. He

did  say that here was a Member of the House trying

on another example of intimidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Kandasamy, I must thank you

for  your impartial stand. We have always listened,

both  inside and outside this Chamber, to so-called

decisions of the Internal Security Council and  the

Cabinet coming from the mouths and Press statements

of  Ministers other than myself. Have I  ever  said

that  such  and  such  a decision  comes  from  the

Cabinet and such and such a decision comes from the

Internal Security Council? These are the people who

always divulge official secrets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kandasamy, I wish to make a few clarifications. Firstly, it is on the $600,000

scheme for which the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for National Development went to  see  the

Minister  for  Finance.  I cannot  remember  having

instructed  him for this purpose, but I believe  it

must be about the 100 units of houses for the Malay

settlement in Jalan Eunos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister for Finance has said that

there  had been no plan and that he does  not  know

what this was all about.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here a list of all contracts which had been accepted and their

respective dates:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queenstown. 26th October, 1959, 160 units,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Tiong Bahru, Phase I, 26th August. 1959,

91 units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Tiong Bahru Fire Site, Phase II, 7th

December. 1959, 470 units,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queenstown, Contract 4, 10th December, 1959, 331

units,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacPherson Road, 20th October, 1959, Piling Contractor, 2,360 units,

<br><br>making a total of 3,732 units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh Keng Sweet On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. May I know whether the hon. Member

was reading from an official document or a copy  of

an official document?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> That is not a point

you  so  much. The schemes which were prepared  and

ready  to go out to tender by the end of the  month

(that  is,  December 1959) and early the  following

3,241  units,  making a total  of  6,973  units  by

February 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance

was  trying  to confuse the matter by shifting  the

issue.  He has learned a lot of debating techniques

from the Prime Minister. What I was trying to drive

at  just  now  was not on the $415 million  scheme.

That  is  a  different issue. It can  come  up  for

debate  at some other time-if I am still here.  But

what I am raising today is the immediate issue  for

1959  and  1960 -  the $7½ million  voted  by  the

former  Government  on specific projects  like  the

Kampong  Tiong Bahru Fire Site and the Kampong  Koo

Chye  Fire  Site.  The Minister  for  Finance  even

refused  to  release this small sum of  money - $7½

million!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister said that

he did not see the plans. In all the world, I never

heard of a Minister for Finance who wants to use  a

microscope to see whether the houses will stand  or

not.  As a matter of fact, I did not see the  plans

myself.  That  is the work of architects.  That  is

what  we engage them for. They do the planning  and

the specifications, and they see whether the houses

can last or not. That is not for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just for clarification. The same

architect  who  is  now the head  of  the  Building

Section of the present Housing Authority and who is

putting  up a new five-year programme is  the  very

same  person who drafted and put up this  five-year

programme  of  80,000 units.  I  promise  you,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, that  the  houses  will  not

collapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one thing is clear. The Government is not

sincere  in its planning programme, but  I  believe

that with all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



pressure against them now, they will start thinking

it over and start building from now onwards.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I despair of the Member

for  Hong  Lim as to whether there is any spark  of

human  reasoning in his mind. On the one  hand,  he

boasts  of the fact that he has put up an  enormous

number  of houses. On the other hand, he blames  me

for  not  having  given him enough money  to  build

houses.  I cannot follow the argument of  the  hon.

Member.  Either one statement is true or the  other

is true. I am not interested



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> If the Minister

will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. Sir, I have dissipated his

so-called  five-year plan. I am not  interested  in

whether  his houses will collapse or not.  That  is

not  the  point.  But when you ask for  substantial

sums of money, it is necessary to back that request

with  full  details, not with a one-page  five-year

plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim

said that the same architect who did that piece  of

work  is  in  charge  of  the present  Government's

housing programme. It may well be so, but that does

not  excuse  the  hon. Member for putting  up  that

atrocious  piece  of  work  and  when  pressed  for

details  he was unable to produce them.  Either  he

had  concocted this whole $400 million out  of  his

own  mind - I  will not be surprised if that  is  the

case - or  he was unable to get across to  his  staff

what exactly was wanted to substantiate his request

for  money. That is the important thing, Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, In the case of the present  Ministry

of  National Development, it has been possible  for

my  colleague the Minister for National Development

and myself, as Minister for Finance, to get on very

easily  whenever there are difficulties. There  are

certain  complicated  problems.  I  refer  to   the

question   of  subsidy  which  was  left   to   our

respective  officers to solve  at  the  preliminary

stage. There is the question of steering the course

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



building   operations  to  fit  into  the   general

framework   of  industry.  These  and  many   other

questions  are  relevant  to  budgeting   for   the

development  expenditure. These  questions  can  be

resolved   at   present   simply,   politely    and

expeditiously.  But in the old  days,  it  was  not

possible.  The Member for Hong Lim either terrified

the staff out of their wits - there was a failure  of

communication between himself and his  professional

advisers - or  he was unable to understand  what  the

Treasury and the Minister for Finance wanted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have given the House sufficient details

to  show  that the principal reason why he did  not

get the money he asked for-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> If the Minister

will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. The hon. Member did not

get the money he asked for in the early days simply

because he never deserved it. And yet eventually he

got more than he asked for, and indeed more than he

could spend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say this in conclusion, Sir? All the things

that  the hon. Member has been saying are  just  to

explain to the public his dismal failure, his inept

bungling when he was in charge of public housing.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to

mention  that  at the time when my  colleague,  the

Minister  for  Finance, was not on  speaking  terms

with  the  ex-Minister for National Development,  I

was on friendly terms with him. I used to speak  to

him quite often.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, $415 million is a very

big  sum  of money. If you will look at  the  first

page  of the Estimates, you will see that the total

revenue  that we hope to collect for next  year  is

$344  million, and our expenditure is $347 million.

Now, $415 million is a very, very big sum of money.

I cannot remember a single occasion when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



the ex-Minister for National Development said to me

that  he was finding it difficult to get money  and

that  there  were differences between him  and  the

Minister  for Finance. Nothing like that  was  ever

said  to  any of us. I have been his colleague;  he

has  been  with  us; we have been  members  of  the

Central  Executive Committee of the  Party  and  we

have been members of the Cabinet. The first time  I

ever  knew  that there was a plan for $415  million

was when I read it in the Straits Times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You and I must have read it at the

same time!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We read it at the same time. It was

the  first  time  I  knew about  this,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has a duty to discharge. There are many of us who want various things. But

he  is  the Minister who has to find the money.  On

many  occasions I tried to apply to him  for  money

and  I  sometimes tried to get away with it, but  I

never succeeded. That is the way we have to do  our

work.  It  is his duty. He is the watchdog.  He  is

looking  after the taxpayers' money. And we respect

him  for  it.  We  cannot  expect  him  to  approve

everything that we want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said publicly - in the way that the

ex-Minister   for   National  Development   made   his

announcement - and it did not involve such a big  sum

that  we  wanted  to build a court in  the  Kallang

area. There has been a lot of work done with regard

to  that  small item of expenditure. I  thought  we

could  get  a court house built for, say, $600,000.

On  a number of occasions, I have had meetings with

Government  architects,  architects,  and  so   on.

Various  plans  have  had to  be  drafted.  Various

architects have had to be met. I met them myself. I

discussed  the project with them. But they  advised

that a court could not be built unless for a larger

sum of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are priorities and

they  are  considered by the Standing Committee  on

Public Works, They have ruled that for the present,

because the sum involved is over $1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



million,  they cannot give priority for the  court.

We  have  to accept it. That is the way we have  to

work  in the Government. We cannot just say,  "Look

here,  I want the sum of $415 million. I must  have

it."  That  is  not  the  way  any  government  can

operate. Unfortunately for us, that is the way  the

Minister  for National Development had always  been

acting when he used to be our colleague.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir,I was

disappointed when the Member for Hong  Lim  made  a

passing remark that he may not be here. So in  view

of  that, I think I had better say what I  have  to

say now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a man experienced in planning houses and

in  planning the housing programme. But if this  is

all  that is required to be a house planner,  I  am

quite sure, when the Member for Hong Lim intends to

build  a house the next time, and if he will employ

me   on  a  project  like  the  Kampong  Koo   Chye

scheme - 219  units  to  be  built  in  1959  at   an

estimated  cost of $900 each - that I am  capable  of

doing  this sort of thing myself without any  great

effort.  And where the Member for Hong Lim said  it

took two weeks, I can do this sort of thing between

now  and tea-time and give him projects perhaps for

the next 20 years on that basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think he can interrupt when I

have finished what he has to hear.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Order. It is five

o'clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of

the Committee and look the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b>  I  suspend

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, earlier we had a claim by the  former

Member for Hong Lim - I am sorry - by the Member  for

Hong Lim that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> So soon!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b>- that he had produced a

five-year  housing programme costing over $400  million,

and  that  it  was  the Minister  for  Finance  who

frustrated  him  in his designs to  bring  so  many

thousands  of  units of houses for  the  people  of

Singapore. Sir, I have never seen a more  expensive

paper produced in this House. This paper would have

cost-if the Minister for Finance had accepted it at

its face value - $400 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, no other-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It would be much better

perhaps  for  the Member for Hong Lim to  bide  his

time because we are in Committee of Supply, and  he

will  have  all the opportunity he wishes  to  meet

those points. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, there was only one other

great  man who produced a great thought in  a  very

short   formula.  That  was  Albert  Einstein   who

compressed  a  lifetime of work in  a  very  simple

formula  which,  I am told by Dr Toh,  who  is  an

eminent  scientist,  is E=MG2, which  produced  the

atom  bomb  and also provided the means  of  atomic

energy.  And here we have a little piece  of  paper

which  would  produce thousands of  housing  units.

That,  Sir,  is  not  a plan which  requires  great

ingenuity on the part of any Minister to produce.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



As I said earlier, I could produce a plan like this

in  half  an hour. In fact, I am gratified to  know

that  the Minister for Finance rejected this offer,

and  I  would  be  horrified if  the  Minister  for

Finance had given any Minister $400 million on  the

basis  of  a  paper like this. In  fact,  Sir,  the

Member  for Hong Lim has been trying to  present  a

picture  of  the  Finance Minister which  seems  to

imply that he is an avaricious man who holds on  to

his wealth and does not want to disburse his funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me give a definite illustration of how

the Minister for Finance works. Once upon a time  I

said, "I and the Minister for Finance get on like a

house  on  fire." I may now say like two houses  on

fire.  But when my Ministry asked for a few million

dollars for television - and this is one part of  the

correspondence that went on; I did  not  bring  the

rest  as  there  are some three or  four  files  on

this - the Minister quite rightly wanted to know  how

I  intended to spend something like $4 million.  It

was  a  long  correspondence calling  for  detailed

plans.  So  I  can quite understand, when  somebody

asks for $400 million, why the Minister for Finance

fights  shy  of approving money on the basis  of  a

document which is not even worth the price  of  the

paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one last point; earlier the Member for Hong

Lim  claimed that by the time he left he had  plans

in progress for some 6,700 units by February 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister, who was then acting as the Minister for National Development, revealed in

this  House  after making intensive  investigations

that  by  the time the former Minister for National

Development left, only some 821 housing units  were

in  process  of construction. And I am quite  sure,

Sir,  that  if  any of these plans had materialised

- there is a well-known proverb which says that  the

hen  which  lays even a small egg will  cluck  very

loud,  as  loud as one which lays many eggs - and  if

there  had  been many houses completed  or  in  the

process  of being completed, we would have heard  a

great  deal about it in the Press. But the fact  is

that  I cannot remember any housing estates or  big

constructions being proclaimed open by  the  former

Minister for National Development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the whole

housing  policy  of the P.A.P. for five  years  was

being  put forward to the people in less than  2½

pages.  Yet  the  people voted the P.A.P. in.  The

whole  Government was elected on  two  small  books

which  we  would  get if we had 80  cents  to  buy.

Otherwise, we would get a small manifesto measuring

less than 8 inches square.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this plan was not prepared by

the  ex-Minister for National Development,  who  is

not  a qualified person for the purpose. This  plan

was  prepared by two qualified architects who  were

in  charge of the building programme in those days,

and  they are still in charge today. A letter dated

11th September, 1959, from Tay Chiang Guan, head of

the Building Department, S.I.T., reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Enclosed herewith please find a copy of the

Five-Year  Building  Programme and Annual  Programme  of

Construction. The Deputy Manager in charge, Mr  Ng

Chee  Sen [another qualified architect] has  agreed

to the programme.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not certain whether it is

in  order,  Mr Speaker, Sir, for a Member  of  the

House  to  read from documents over which there  is

doubt as to whether he is in rightful ownership.  I

can  only presume that the Member for Hong  Lim  is

reading from official documents. Now, would  it  be

proper  for  a  Member of the House  to  read  such

documents which he should not have?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Of course, the short answer is that

he   has,  in  fact,  complete  privilege  in  this

Chamber.  I have indicated, of course, in the  past

that the Member for Hong Lim is the only person who

would be able to say for himself whether or not  he

is  transgressing the Official Secrets Act  or  any

other Ordinance. I am not here to advise him. It is

up to him to consider the point himself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now

while  you  were absent, the Minister  for  Finance

produced  this document. He produced it himself,  a

document  which  he knows is an official  document.

And  I  am only trying to explain how this document

came  into  being.  It is not fair  to  deny  other

people   the  right  to  give  facts  by   indirect

intimidation-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have not heard any

suggestion  of  any intimidation!  It  is  only  an

enquiry on a point of order on which I have  ruled.

And  I take it the hon. Member for Hong Lim is not,

in fact, intimidated. Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order, yes. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not want to be difficult,

Mr Speaker, Sir, but surely it is quite proper for

a Minister to produce official documents. But there

may be a doubt whether a person who is not a member

of the Government, not a Cabinet Minister, can read

from  official documents. That is the  point  I  am

making.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As I have indicated, it is not

really  a  point of order nor a matter on  which  I

could judge. Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

saying which goes like this: it is illegal for  the

people  to  have a light, but it is legal  for  the

Government to commit arson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Government

Benchers were trying to shift the issue by throwing

the  whole  limelight  on this  Five-Year  building

plan. This plan was submitted to the leaders of the

Government  for discussion, There was no  necessity

for  all the details of the plan to be adopted. But

the  Government cannot reply to this question:  why

did  they  freeze also the $7½ million  earmarked

for   the  S.I.T. by  the  former  government  for

building flats for the fire victims?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the answer is quite

simple  and  I have already given it to the  Member

for  Hong  Lim. The answer is that the  S.I.T. had

more  than  enough  funds  from  other  sources  to

continue  with whatever projects they had in  hand.

But the Member for Hong Lim has not met my point. I

said that first he tried to explain his failure  to

build  any  number of houses by saying "the  wicked

Finance Minister stopped me". And in defence I  had

to  produce  this  document  to  show  that  it  is

absolutely out of the question to give any money on

a  request of that sort. On the one hand, he  says,

"I did not build any houses because I was stopped."

On  the other hand, he went on to say that he  had

built  6,700  houses.  What  are  the  facts,   Mr

Speaker. Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a certain amount of

repetition. Unless there is something  new  we  can

deal  with  under this item, I propose  to  inquire

from Dato Abdul Hamid whether he wishes to put  the

amendment  now  to  the  vote.  Unless   there   is

something  new to be contributed to this particular

debate,  perhaps  Dato Abdul Hamid  would  indicate

whether he wishes to take a vote on the item.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have spent

the  last  half  an hour before the  tea  break  on

production of notes and counter production of other

notes,  making it appear that there is an  exchange

of  notes  between ex-colleagues in the  Government

and  ex-colleagues in the Party. I think the  whole

thing  boils down to this: whatever the ex-Minister

had  done or had not done, whatever was done or was

not  done  as  a  Minister of the  Government,  the

Government  cannot  shirk  its  responsibility  and

admit that whatever wrong the ex-Minister had  done

was a wrong done by the Government.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come and submit a paper like what we have got

and  say,  "Look  at  the foolish  things  the

ex-Minister had been trying to do to us." But  when  I

look  at  this, Sir, I remember that  there  was  a

front-page report in the Straits Times, as referred

to  by the Minister for Labour and Law, which  says

it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



the  "Government".  It  is  not  the  Minister  for

National   Development.  "Government  proposes   to

introduce a $415 million housing scheme."  Not  the

Minister, but the Government. And to lend  credence

to  that, on the same day in the same paper,  there

was the Prime Minister driving a tractor, and there

was the question, `Who is this man?' Ah ha! - `the

Prime  Minister laying the plans for a $415 million

housing development.' I hope the time of this House

will   not  be  spent  in  just  trying   to   push

responsibility back and forth.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

Member for Cairnhill is being quite fair because  I

think  the  Member  for Hong Lim has  made  certain

allegations, and those allegations have had  to  be

met.  If the Member for Cairnhill thinks that those

allegations are irrelevant, then, of course, he has

a  point of order, which perhaps I would not  agree

with. But the fact remains that documents have been

produced to rebut something which has been said.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, the speeches

we  have  been hearing have been such that each  is

trying to say that the other was wrong, and it  was

because  of  that that I said, what is the  use  of

spending time in this Assembly trying to say who is

right  and  who is wrong? What has been  done,  has

been done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker.  I  feel  that what  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  had  to  say about the  so-called  Press

announcement was not, as what he said, a Government

pronouncement. This is according to  Hansard.  Vol.

11,  No.  18, 14th December. 1959, col. 1207,  when

the  Member for Hong Lim was then the Minister  for

National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for Farrer Park was trying to play up

this  $415 million programme which we have  planned

out.  The  S.I.T. has put up this  programme,  but

unfortunately  it leaked out and was  published  in

the  Press.  This  programme shows  the  organising

ability  of  the S.I.T. It does not  say  that  the

Government will carry out the programme.'



<br><br>If   there  had  been  a  leakage,  deliberate   or

otherwise, it was on his own responsibility and not

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I might remind the Parliamentary

Secretary that there is only a quarter of  an  hour

left  for  another amendment. If the  Parliamentary

Secretary will be brief - does he wish to pursue  the

point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, with

regard  to  what the Member for Hong Lim  has  said

before the adjournment for tea - the Member for  Hong

Lim  has accused the Minister for Finance that  the

$7  million  which  was  provided  for  the  S.I.T.

estimates  by the previous Government was frozen - in

order  to clarify the matter, Mr Speaker,  I  will

quote  from  Hansard, Vol. 13,  No.  4,  dated  5th

August,  1960, col. 256. During the debate  on  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's policy speech of 1960,  I

made a clear statement on this $7 million which was

provided by the previous Government for the  S.I.T.

estimates. The second paragraph reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In July last year at the Cabinet Estimates

Committee,  documents  relating  to  S.I.T. funds

showed that the Minister-'



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of order, Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Is it proper for the

Parliamentary Secretary to quote his own speech?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am really extremely puzzled. It

is  the first time, I think, that I have ever  been

so puzzled in trying to search for a point of order

which  is  not  there.  It seems  to  me  that  the

Parliamentary Secretary is merely drawing attention

to  what  he  said on the 5th August, 1960, and  I

cannot see that that is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, I quote my speech

in  order to show to the House that what the Member

for Hong Lim has spoken is absolutely untrue:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In July last year at the Cabinet Estimates

Committee,  documents  relating  to  S.I.T. funds

showed  that  the  Minister  for  Finance  made   a

provision  in  the  1959  S.I.T.  Estimates  of  $7

million.  The  remaining money was  allowed  to be

used,  for the Minister for Finance had marked  the

word "allowed".'



<br><br>I remember, when I spoke on this, that I produced documents in which was marked the word  "allowed".

Now  I will turn to this. What the Member for  Hong

Lim  has  spoken  on the number of units  which  he

proposed to build during this time was also untrue.

I refer to Hansard, Vol. 13, No. 6, col. 460. It is

a speech made by the Deputy Prime Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During the six months term of office of the

Member  for  Hong Lim as Chairman of the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust,  work  commenced  on  only  821

units.  In  the six months since he  ceased  to  be

Chairman,  the  Housing and Development  Board  was

formed, and under its direction, work was commenced

on 2,729 units.'



<br><br>The reason why such a small number of units was put

up  by the ex-Minister for National Development was

this. Also in the same Hansard, col. 460:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The slowness - admittedly the Government was slow

in  getting housing development to start - was due to

the  depletion of technical staff and  the  haywire

changes  in building plans. A total of 79

monthly-rated  staff  left the service of the  S.I.T.  They

were  dismissed, or they resigned, or they retired.

And  of  these  79, 22 were senior  officers,  five

being  heads of departments and five were heads  of

sections.'



<br><br>Now,  referring to the tenders, the Member for Hong

Lim  has  said that quite a number of  tenders  had

been  put  out. Mr Speaker. Sir, I refer again  to

the speech made by the Deputy Prime Minister on the

same day. That is, in Hansard, Vol. 13, No. 6, col.

460.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Tenders for two phases for the Tiong Bahru fire

site  development  were  submitted  to  the  former

Minister for consideration in June 1959. These were

turned down, and instructions were issued for fresh

plans  to be drawn up to substitute communal  units

for  self-contained flats. On this new instruction,

a revised lay-out was produced, but again there was

a change of mind. Plans had to be drawn up all over

again, and eventually only 280 communal units  were

included  in  the  development.  Because  of   this

indecision  and  frequent changes of  mind  of  the

former  Minister,  these  two  contracts  were  not

officially approved for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



letting  until  November 1959 and January  1960,  a

delay of over five months.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, it is quite clear from this that what

the  Member  for  Hong Lim has said  is  absolutely

untrue.

*The  same  amendment also stood in the names  of Mr A. P Rajah and Inche Mohd. Ali bin Alwi.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are being asked to vote a sum of $500,000

for  rural  development projects.  Other  than  the

water  supply  at  Pulau Tekong  mentioned  in  the

footnote,  we are somewhat in the dark as  to  what

these   projects  would  be.  Could  the   Minister

indicate the types of projects he has in mind?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Primary

Production  Department of the Ministry of  National

Development has continued to improve and expand the

various  services  provided to  farmers  and  other

producers  in the rural areas. There  has  been  an

increase  in the number of free inoculations  given

for  pigs  and poultry. More and more  farmers  are

availing  themselves  of  our  services   for   the

treatment  of livestock diseases. We  have  a  stud

boar service, and a special ploughing service which

has  been introduced with encouraging success in  a

number  of  areas. For fishermen  who  use  powered

boats, we have also been providing a repair service

for engine faults and breakdowns. At the same time,

research  and experimental work on the  development

of  better  strains of pigs and poultry  have  been

making  good progress at the Sembawang Experimental

Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai asked for the

projects that we have in mind for 1961. A programme

of  such  projects  has  been  designed  to  assist

farmers and other primary producers, including  the

Malay  population  both in  Singapore  and  in  the

Southern Islands and will be implemented in 1961.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $500,000 to be spent in 1961,

approximately   $180,000  will  be   reserved   for

projects  designed  for the benefit  of  the  Malay

population  both  in  Singapore  and  the  Southern

Islands. Of the projects in mind, the Sungei Poyang

Reclamation scheme will be implemented in  January.

There  will  be  an  intra-nasal chick  inoculation

service.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This service will be introduced next year and

these inoculations will be carried out in the Telok

Ayer Quarantine Station. But for this service, Sir,

a small fee will be charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to set up also a special film unit to

supplement    our    present    information     and

instructional  service for farmers.  We  will  also

introduce  a  service to deal with plant  parasites

and  diseases  and also to provide  tests  for  the

suitability of and fertility of soils.  There  will

also  be a fisheries training scheme for boys  from

fishing villages and rural areas. Students will  be

taught  an  elementary  knowledge  of  fishing  and

fishing  gear, carpentry work and repair  of

boat-engines.   We   also  propose  to   establish   two

veterinary  extension centres. We  also  intend  to

provide  an outboard-motor hiring scheme to  assist

those Malay fishermen who cannot afford to purchase

outboard-engines. We shall be implementing a scheme

to  help the Malay farmers by purchasing goats  for

distribution to the Malay farmers and fishermen  to

encourage  them to rear goats in order  to  augment

their meagre income.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

another  question? Earlier in the afternoon,  while

we   were   discussing  another   Head   on   Malay

Settlements, I believe the Parliamentary  Secretary

to  the  Prime  Minister did  say  that  the  Malay

Settlement  projects would come  under  this  Head.

Could  the Minister give us some information as  to

the Malay Settlement projects he has in mind?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, as far as I know,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



this  does not include the Malay Settlement scheme,

but  it  will be so distributed that all the Malays

in Singapore can benefit from this.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

National Development has misunderstood what I  have

said. Could I speak in Malay?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, what I

asked was this. According to the explanation given

by   the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Prime

Minister, development of the Malay Settlement  will

be  implemented and the cost of the development  is

under  this expenditure which we are now  debating.

What  are the schemes of development and where  are

they, including the area in Jurong?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I have

explained  just now that this does not include  the

Malay  Settlement scheme, but it embraces  all  the

areas  in Singapore where there are Malays  living,

it  is  in the development scheme and not specially

in the Malay Settlement.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is five past six. Time is up. I

have  no  doubt  that the Member for Geylang  Serai

could pursue his queries by correspondence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $34,546,500 for Head D20 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D25 -



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D25 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 23.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, $22,000 has been asked for Chua Chu Kang

Cemetery General Division Chinese and Free Division

Chinese  Bidadari Christian Cemetery. Sir,  what  I

would like to know is why nothing is being spent on

the  Muslim  Cemetery at Bidadari? For  one  thing,

Sir, it is good to see that the Government has  not

forgotten  the  dead.  But, apparently,  they  have

forgotten the Malay dead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the conditions at this cemetery, to say the

least,  are  very deplorable. First,  the  approach

roads  to  the  graves leave much  to  be  desired.

Sometimes coffins have to be carried over  hillocks

and boulders and, in some cases, over graves. Then,

there  is  the  question of fencing.  There  is  no

continuous fencing all round, and this has  enabled

herds  of  buffaloes and cows  to  roam  about  the

graves.  Could the Minister, Sir, assure the  House

that  he  would  look into this and, if  necessary,

probably apply for a supplementary vote?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

had  anticipated that the Member for Geylang  Serai

would  be raising such communal issues, and  I  had

come  myself  prepared. It is my pleasure  here  to

inform  him  that  the Malay and Muslim  cemeteries

have been looked after very well, and, in fact, all

the  work that was outstanding has been carried out

during the past year. In the years 1961 to 1964, it

is   our  intention  to  bring  the  various  other

cemeteries  up to the same standard as  the  Muslim

cemetery is at present. I mean the Bidadari  Muslim

Cemetery.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> May I beg leave to withdraw,

Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D25 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 26.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this provision it is stated, "Ten Dental

Clinics and Huts and one School Clinic" to be built

by  the  Government in 1961. I  would  like  to  be

informed where are the areas where these are to  be

built in 1961?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps it

would  be pertinent for me, first of all, to define

what these various terms mean before I proceed with

my answer. It does appear a little bit confusing to

have  dental  huts, dental clinics, school  clinics

and  the whole lot. However, a dental clinic is  an

outdoor  clinic providing dental care for a  number

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



schools in a large area, it may have anything up to

15  chairs.  A  dental hut is a  smaller  unit  and

probably has only 2 chairs. A dental unit is a unit

with only one chair. In the course of the next four

years,  it is proposed to group the various schools

together  and provide dental service to  the  whole

island of Singapore. Where the schools are very far

apart,  we  have  a  dental  unit  so  that  school

children  need  not  have to go long  distances  to

receive  dental treatment. In areas  where  schools

are  congregated together, it is our  intention  to

save  on  overhead expenditure and staff emoluments

by building a single dental clinic to cover 4, 5 or

6 schools. It is because the Ministry of Health has

the convenience and the interests of the people  at

heart that we make such definitions and build  such

different units of dental institutions to serve the

people. I am unable to give the details as to where

these huts and clinics will be built, because  this

is  the  first time such a scheme is introduced  in

Singapore. But I can assure him that in areas where

there  are  many  schools, dental clinics  will  be

built,  and  in remote areas hitherto uncared  for,

there  will be dental huts and dental units  built.

By  the end of 1964, all the schools will be served

with  dental services. I am afraid I am  unable  to

supply  the exact locations of these various  units

as yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Tun

in order to seek information from the Minister.

Sir, I formally move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D25 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (3) of sub-head

58.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a number of items in this

Development  Estimate  which  says  so  much  other

projects, so much others and so on, without  giving

any specific details. Sir, here is another instance

where  $100,000 has been asked for outdoor clinics.

It  is  mentioned "others". Could the Parliamentary

Secretary  inform us where these clinics are  going

to be put up, and the types of clinics?



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

I  have  to  define again the various terminologies

used here, because it is a little bit confusing  to

have    "Combined   Clinics",   "Kallang   Out-door

Dispensary" and "Out-door Clinics" all  under  this

sub-head 58.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A combined clinic is one in which outpatient

services as well as preventive health measures such

as maternal and child health services are provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An outdoor clinic is one in which only

out-patient services are provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Geylang Serai will look

carefully at the Budget Estimates, he will see that

the  planned cost for the whole project under

sub-head  58  (3) comes to $1,523,000 of which $100,000

will be provided in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite unlike the last Government, we prefer to

plan   our   schemes  and  services  at   five-year

intervals  rather  than yearly,  and  the  Ministry

submitted  a  full  paper on the whole  development

projects for the five-year interval. As it has been

suggested that combined clinics would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



serve  greater purposes for the time being, because

we  have  given  an  assurance to  the  Member  for

Geylang   Serai  that  we  will  give  the   utmost

consideration  to  the  lowering  of   the   infant

mortality   rate,  particularly  among  the   Malay

community,  we  have devoted much of  our  building

capacity  this  year  to the building  of  combined

clinics  in  the rural areas. It therefore  follows

that  the building capacity for outdoor clinics  is

reduced,  and  out of a total of $11 million,  only

$100,000 is given to us. The clinics that we expect

to  put  up  with this $100,000 would  include  the

Queenstown  Clinic,  the  Still  Road  Clinic,  the

Kampong  Tiong Bahru Fire Site Clinic, the  Kampong

Bugis Clinic, and the Sembawang Clinic.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a pity

the  Ministry  has only got $100,000  for  a  $1½

million  plan.  I hope the Parliamentary  Secretary

will  put more pressure on the Ministry of  Finance

and  get more money next year. Anyway, may I  thank

him  for his clinical dissertation and, in view  of

his explanation, may I beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $6,155,700 for Head D 25 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 28 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D28 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 1 reads "Economic Development Board ...

Plan  costs $100 million Estimated to be  spent  in

1961, $40 million".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Finance in his Budget

Statement   told   the  House  how   important   he

considered the economic development of the  country

to  be and that is why he had allocated $30 million

from the current revenues of the State. He went  on

to  say  that the $10 million which the  Federation

was  repaying  in part payment of the  $30  million

loan   was   also  being  lent  to   the   Economic

Development  Board, thereby properly stressing  the

importance  of  economic development in  Singapore.

Because we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



all  realise,  Sir, that if there  is  no  economic

development during the next year or so, then surely

our economic life will come to a near stanstill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the occasion of the last

Budget  debate, I ventured to suggest that  nothing

would take place this year. I hate to say it myself

but  I  regret  to say that I was  right  and  that

nothing  has, in fact, taken place in  the  way  of

economic development and much to our distress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Finance was in America, the

Minister for Labour and Law had occasion to mention

to   the   House  a  number  of  limited  liability

companies  that  were  willing  to  come   in   and

undertake  economic development in this  State.  He

said that a number of them had received approval to

carry  on  business and that they  would  be  given

favourable  tax  treatment.  On  that  occasion,  I

ventured  to  ask the Minister for Labour  and  Law

what, in fact, had taken place beyond that; whether

those  companies, beyond being registered, had  had

their shares subscribed and fully paid for; whether

these  companies - their shares having been paid  for

and fully subscribed - had bought the sites necessary

for  economic development, either bought the  sites

or  had  the sites allocated to them by Government;

and  what  actual  physical steps  these  companies

which  had been given tax exemption had taken which

would  give  us  an indication that they  were  not

merely  getting  into  the queue  to  get  economic

benefits, not really putting their effort into  the

development  of this country, but were  waiting  to

see  whether  they would come here or go  somewhere

else.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance could  tell

the  House what has happened to those eight or nine

companies  who  have had this favourable  treatment

from the Government. Beyond that, Sir, the Minister

also  said  that there were a number of people  who

had   made   applications  to  start  projects   in

Singapore.  I  believe  the  Jurong  Site  is  also

intended  for  such people. Could the Minister  for

Finance tell the House whether the Jurong Site will

be  ready  for economic development, in  the  sense

that it will he able to receive these people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



who will help in the industralisation of Singapore.

Or  what  are the plans of the Economic Development

Board to spend this $40 million for the year 1961?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first

take  the point of the Member for Farrer Park  that

nothing  is  being done in the way  of  encouraging

industralisation in Singapore. Sir,  in  my  Budget

Statement,  I  did give details of  the  number  of

applications  we  have  had  for  pioneer  industry

status  and  the  scope  and  magnitude  of   these

proposals. This part of my Statement seems to  have

escaped the attention of the Member for Farrer Park

and perhaps I may be excused if I were to read this

passage  again. I say in column 18 of the  Official

Report dated 29th November, 1960, Vol. 14. No. 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The rate of industrial expansion has shown

improvement since the last budget. There are now no

less  than  54  projects under  various  stages  of

consideration  for  the award  of  pioneer  status.

Twenty-six  projects can be considered to  be  firm

proposals  and  gazette  notifications  have   been

issued  or will soon be issued in respect of  those

that  qualify  for  pioneer  status.  The  two  oil

refineries have already been awarded pioneer status

and  construction work has commenced. Some  of  the

new  industries for which pioneer status  is  being

considered include the manufacture of a wide  range

of   consumer   goods  such  as   condensed   milk,

chocolates,  toothpaste, garments, matches  and  so

forth. Among the major proposals are flour milling,

textile weaving and a steel rolling mill. The total

capital involved in all these projects is well over

$100  million, and when they are in operation, they

would   provide  employment  for  more  than  2,500

workers.'



<br><br>Then I went on to say something about projects that

were still in their exploratory stages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Farrer Park wants to have

details as to what stages these industrial projects

have  reached, I shall be very happy to supply them

to  him  provided  he wants this information  as  a

Member   of   the   Assembly  and   provided   this

information will not be used -as I am sure it  will

not  be  used-for  any professional  purposes.  The

reason is that when a firm or concern or a group of

persons  decide  to  explore the  possibilities  of

launching  a new enterprise, they are very  anxious

that there should be some secrecy about it. We have

experienced, at least on one occasion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



where   premature  publicity  had  prejudiced   any

prospect of development. But I do assure the Member

for  Farrer  Park that these are genuine  proposals

made to us - as far as we can judge - in good faith by

people  who  have  the capital  and  the  means  to

establish these industries.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have also made it clear that I do not

consider  that the volume of investments  which  we

have  so  far received is anything like the  volume

that we do need. And, if I may quote from my Budget

statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In normal circumstances, industrial expansion of

the  scale  I  have  described  can  be  considered

satisfactory. However, in the present situation  of

Singapore with its population explosion, much  more

is  required. An expansion of at least 2 to 3 times

the  present  rate  would be necessary.  Much  more

needs  to be   done  to accelerate  the  growth  of

industry."



<br><br>I  do not think that the Member for Farrer Park can

say  that  we are making any extravagant claims  on

what  has been achieved by our policy. But it  will

be  a  gross  exaggeration to say that nothing  has

been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of any industry surely is

a  very  long and complicated process. If,  say,  a

manufacturer decides that he wants to open such and

such a factory, there are many stages which he  has

to  go through. He has to form a company; he has to

raise the share capital; he has to acquire land; he

has  to  meet the requirements of the Master  Plan;

there  are  health regulations involved,  as  there

often  are; he has to meet the health by-laws;  and

if  there  is  a fire hazard, he has  to  meet  the

requirements laid down by the Fire Brigade, and  so

on  and  so  forth. Even when all  the  preliminary

calculations have been made - calculations  of  cost,

calculations  of  market, calculations  of  output;

when  all  these have been made - the sheer physical

work  of starting a project would take anything  up

to  two  years or more. And let us not forget,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that in 1959, before the  elections,

there was a complete standstill of the economy, and

for months after that too; and as a result of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



scare   campaign  carried  out  by  the  opposition

Parties,  there  was  a  widespread  reluctance  to

invest. But I can assure the Member for Farrer Park

that  we have passed that stage and we are  now  in

the  position  to say that the first initial  steps

have  been  taken  and that the response  has  been

encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Economic Development Board, in the

first  part of my speech I did say that it was  the

intention  of Government to set up this Board  this

year, and that we would approach the World Bank for

assistance  in  getting the top  personnel  of  the

Board. Getting the money is an easy matter; we have

finances and we can quite easily spare $40  million

for  the Board. But more important than money,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, are the men who are to use the money.

We  approached  the World Bank nearly  a  year  ago

immediately after the last Budget speech,  and  the

World Bank have cast the net far and wide in search

of  top-level personnel who could be of  assistance

to  us  in  establishing and running  the  Economic

Development  Board. We require different  types  of

men.  We  want  a  person  who  has  experience  in

industrial financing and who can evaluate the worth

of a proposition when it is put to him by potential

investors.  We need a person who has experience  as

an  industrial consultant to act as adviser to  the

Government  in initiating a programme of industrial

growth.  We  need different types of engineers  who

can  advise  industry  and who  can,  if  need  be,

develop  industrial projects which can be submitted

to the potential investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But above all, because our situation is so

complex  and  so  difficult, we  need  men  of  the

highest calibre. It is necessary to have men of the

highest  calibre  because  whatever  industries  we

establish  in  Singapore, they must  be  industries

that are competitive by world standards. The market

in Singapore and even the Pan-Malayan market is not

large enough to sustain major industrialisation  of

many   lines.   It  is  therefore  necessary   that

industrialisation    in   Singapore    should    be

competitive in the export markets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I think it would be useful for me to

say  a  few words about the progress that  we  have

achieved in making recruitment to the top personnel

of  the  Economic Development Board.  Although  the

World Bank had been most helpful, we were not  able

for  some  considerable  time  to  agree  that  the

recommendations  that  they made  fitted  into  our

needs.  They  recommended a number of persons,  and

when  I  went to the United Kingdom last  August  I

took  advantage of that occasion to interview  some

of  these  men. And my assessment was that although

these people are competent in their own fields  and

they  would  be  useful officers  if  the  Economic

Development Board had already been a going concern,

they lack the experience and the high quality,  the

creative  ability  which  is  needed  when  we  are

starting  a  new  project.  Accordingly,   to   our

disappointment,  we  were  unable  to  accept   the

recommendations then made up to that  date  by  the

World Bank. Then I went to Washington and discussed

the  subject with top officials of the  World  Bank

itself.  The  idea  was discussed  that  a  certain

professor  teaching  in the Israeli  Institutue  of

Technology in Haifa would be a suitable candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened to know this professor myself, when I

visited  Israel  sometime  ago.  He  had   a   very

distinguished  record  in  the  Netherlands   Civil

Service  and,  if I remember correctly,  was  their

advisor  on organisation and served in the capacity

as  industrial consultant. In addition to  teaching

at the Israeli Institute of Technology in Haifa, he

was  also one of the industrial consultants of  the

Government  of Israel. The World Bank  thought  the

nomination  a  good  one. It  so  happened  that  a

delegation of the Israeli Finance Ministry  was  in

Washington  around that period, and it  was  agreed

that an approach could be made to this Professor to

accept   appointment  as  Head  of   the   Economic

Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it became clear that when we went to

Washington, our policy of recruiting to a post  and

accepting applications from whoever was willing  to

take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



on  the job was a wrong policy, because if a man is

really  outstanding he would already be  performing

some  useful work either in private industry, in  a

local authority, or in government, and the men  you

would get would either be mediocrities or, at best,

less competent secondraters. You would not get your

top-level man, and that is the type of man we want.

So  the  Professor being engaged in teaching duties

in Israel and engaged in a consultative capacity to

the   Israeli  Government,  we  had  to  carry  out

discussions  and  negotiations  with  the   Israeli

Government.  I  am very happy to  announce  to  the

House  that  these negotiations are successful  and

that Professor Cahen would be released next year to

take  up  duty in Singapore as Head of the Economic

Development Board. He will be arriving in Singapore

in February for preliminary talks, and he will take

up his substantive appointment in June.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also surveyed the field for good technicians

and   engineers  who  are  not  only  skilled   and

experienced   in   their   specialist   field    of

engineering,  but  who have had experience  in  the

planning   of  industries  and  the  promotion   of

industries. And I am very happy to announce to  the

House  that  we  have succeeded  in  obtaining  the

services  of  Mr Jangbir Singh to be Head  of  the

Industrial  Division  of the  Economic  Development

Board.  Mr  Singh  has  a  distinguished  academic

career.  He  took First-class Honours in Mechanical

Engineering in the University of London and won the

Bramwell  Gold Medal. He has many years' experience

in the Planning Commission of the Indian Government

and currently is Head of the Industrial Division of

E.C.A.F.E.   Both   E.C.A.F.E. and   the   Indian

Government were kind enough to release his services

for  work  in Singapore for a period of  two  years

commencing March next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have pressed on with

recruiting our local talent. And here again we have

met  with  perhaps  more success than  we  deserve.

Today  I  am informed by the P.S.C. that they  have

selected  perhaps  the most outstanding  mechanical

engineer  to be produced by this country.  He  too,

like Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



Jangbir   Singh   took   First-class   Honours   in

Mechanical Engineering in the University of  London

and won the Bramwell Gold Medal. There is also hope

of   getting   a  chemical  engineer   trained   in

Australia, who has considerable experience  in  his

line  and  who  has  won the  degree  of  Ph.D. in

chemical engineering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the alternative open to us a year ago was to

press  on  and  just get on with  the  job,  taking

whatever  men we could. We decided that if  we  had

done  so,  perhaps we could have started the  Board

much  earlier  than  we  did.  But  the  Government

decided on a policy of putting quality of men above

everything  else. Hence this delay in  getting  the

Board  going.  But  I think this  policy  will  pay

dividends in the years to come.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also sought expert advice pending the

formation of our own panel of technicians. We  have

sought expert advice from the United Nations,  and,

as  the  House knows, the United Nations have  sent

two  teams of experts, one on the establishment  of

an  integrated steel industry in Singapore, and the

other  a general industrial survey team. Perhaps  I

may  say  a  few words about the work of these  two

teams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the team to study the establishment of

an  integrated  steel industry  in  Singapore,  the

United  Nations  had despatched  an  eminent  steel

technologist  in Mr P. L. Schereschewsky.  But  he

was  merely the vanguard of a much larger  team  to

come.  He  has submitted his preliminary report  to

the  Government which has been studied, and I  will

say  no  more  than  that it  gives  a  picture  of

restrained optimism. It is feasible in his opinion.

There are certain difficulties, both technical  and

economic, that have to be overcome. Later next year

he  will return to Singapore with a fuller team  of

experts  in all technical processes connected  with

the steel industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the United Nations general industrial

survey  team, they have completed their preliminary

findings, and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



received  the  report only yesterday.  Naturally  I

cannot claim, in the short time available to me, to

have  digested  all  that is said  in  the  report,

because  it is a lengthy report. I would  say  that

this  commission was headed by a most able  man - Dr

Winsemius - who has a distinguished career both as  a

civil  servant and as an entrepreneur. He has taken

a  very  realistic approach to this problem.  About

his recommendations, so far as I can reveal them, I

may  say  that  it is an open question  whether  we

should  publish this report because there are  many

points  of advice on policy and industrial strategy

which   we  think  we  should  keep  to  ourselves.

Nevertheless,  so  far as I can  make  public,  his

recommendations fall into two broad groups.  First,

the  immediate  future, and second,  the  long-term

view.  For  the immediate future, he recommended  a

crash  programme of industrialisation to absorb  as

much  of  our  unemployed workers as  possible.  He

recommended  that we pay special attention  to  our

position as the fifth biggest seaport in the world.

He thought that more Singaporeans could he employed

on board ocean-going ships than is now the case. He

has, on his own initiative, met various ship-owners

and  asked  them whether or not they  could  employ

more Singaporeans. And he has advised Government on

how  we could bring about a much greater employment

of  workers  on  board  ships plying  international

routes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other project on which he has advised us to

concentrate  in the immediate future is  to  extend

the  ship-breaking  industry, because  this  is  an

industry  that has a ready market, and in the  case

of Singapore, a ready supply of ships to be broken.

Further,  it  is  an  industry that  employs  large

numbers  of  workers with a very  small  amount  of

capital investment. If the Member for Hong Lim were

here, I would perhaps go into a dissertation on the

ship-breaking industry, in particular  the  way  in

which  the  Member for Hong Lim did his  utmost  to

stifle this industry. However, he is not here to be

at  the  receiving end, and I will merely say  that

the  proposals  of the U.N. team are being  studied

with great care.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have more than a sporting chance, much

more than a sporting chance, of making a success of

it in the immediate future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the long-term future. Of course,

this  depends  on having your Economic  Development

Board  set up which has funds and men to lend money

to the industry that wants to be set up here; which

has  technicians to assist our industry to work out

new  projects;  and which has men  who  can  go  to

intending  investors  with a  case  that  has  been

examined  and worked out-a proposition  which  they

can accept or at least examine with interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific technical reports of the U.N. team

have  not all been completed, but it is likely that

by  March  or  April next year, we  will  have  the

technical   reports  from  the  U.N. team.   These

technical reports will lay down what industries can

be  established in Singapore, taking  into  account

the  market  for  the product, the sources  of  raw

materials,  the  supply of power, skilled  workmen,

roads  and so forth. Then, of course, we have  also

asked the Japanese Government to design a plan  for

the  development  of the Jurong Industrial  Estate.

But  since  this  particular item  deals  with  the

Economic  Development Board, perhaps  I  will  deal

with it when we come to the second amendment.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (2), standing in the name of Mr A.P. Rajah, reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be reduced by $10 in respect of

sub-head 5.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is convenient we might as

well take it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was going to

suggest  that perhaps the two could be conveniently

taken together.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is

perhaps very fortunate in that there are two places

on  the coastline where we have access for deep-sea

vessels. One, of course, is our present port  area,

the  Singapore Harbour Board, and the other one  is

at Jurong. With this in view, we have decided that,

if there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



to  be  a substantial rate of industrialisation  in

Singapore, there must be an area reserved for these

industries  which have access to deep-sea  vessels,

simply  because  there  are  no  raw  materials  in

Singapore.  Whatever  raw materials  our  factories

need  must be imported from overseas. To cut a long

story  short,  Mr Speaker, Sir, after  I  returned

from   Japan,  I  was  greatly  impressed  by   the

tremendous expansion of the Japanese industry,  and

accordingly, I have decided that it may be  a  very

good idea to ask the Japanese Government to send  a

team  of  industrial  planners  and  engineers   to

develop this plan for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made, for the purposes of a five-year

plan, a preliminary rough plan as regards the area,

the  siting of wharves, railways, and so on and  so

forth.  The Japanese team, which included  some  of

their  top planners in the Japanese Ministry,  came

here  some time ago, and they have submitted  their

preliminary report. In their opinion, the scale  on

which we are thinking is rather on the low side; we

wanted  an  area of 5,000 acres, and  they  thought

that  that  was  much too small. They  have  nearly

trebled  the size of the site and are making  plans

for the larger area. The U.N. experts on industrial

planning  thought that we should plan for a  longer

period  and have marked off an area five times  the

area  we  originally intended.  Anyway,  I  do  not

imagine  that within the next five years  we  shall

have  enough industries to fill, say, 25,000 acres.

I  doubt that very much. It will take some time  to

complete  the design because a lot of the  details,

such  as the topographic map, the soundings of  the

sea  and the straits off Jurong, have not been made

in   detail  and  to  the  specification  that  the

Japanese planners need. Various departments of  the

Government,  such  as  the Survey  Department,  the

Master Attendant's Department, the P.W.D., the Land

Office and so on are embarking on a crash programme

to get the data in time for the Japanese experts to

complete their final detailed plans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the subject of the expenditure of $40,000, I would like clarification from the

Ministry concerned in regard to the proposals  that

will be carried out in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are no children's

playgrounds in the rural areas. All the  children's

playgrounds are located in the urban areas, and for

that reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have provided  in

the  Estimates  under  "Parks  and  Recreation"   a

provision for $40,000. We anticipate that with this

money  we  will  be  able to build  two  children's

playgrounds in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are vast stretches of land in the

rural  areas,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  these  cannot  be

considered as lands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



which  can be used as children's playgrounds.  Many

of  them  are  in the occupation of  squatters  and

farmers.  Some of them are planted with rubber.  It

will   be   necessary,  now  that  we  have   these

facilities in the urban areas for children, that we

also provide the same amenities for children in the

rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, could

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, on which I would like

to  seek  clarification regarding  the  subject  of

community  centres,  is:  Could  the  Minister  for

Labour   and   Law   clarify   whether   the    new

constructions  include schools  for  poor  children

which  are referred to as "sekolah makan"  (feeding

schools)?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to the

Member for Kampong Kembangan for having raised this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



query.  This provision is a carry-over  of  schemes

for  the provision of community centres which  were

approved  by the previous Government and  which  we

have  scrapped. Mr Speaker, Sir, no part of  these

funds  are being used for the building of community

centres.  All  the community centres  that  we  are

building now are being built from the vote that was

approved  by  the Assembly under the estimates  for

Social Welfare last year. We have entered a similar

provision for a similar vote in the Social  Welfare

estimates  for this year, so that we have  all  the

money  that  we want under the vote for development

and integration of community associations which has

already  been  approved by the  Assembly  when  the

Social  Welfare estimates were considered  for  the

expansion  of  our work in building more  community

centres.  So  this provision is really  unnecessary

and it will be deleted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D47 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one new item, but in my opinion it is not extraordinary and I seek

clarification  from the Minister for  Culture  with

reference   to  his  programme  which  amounts   to

$1,300,000.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to

not   know   whether  it  can  be  taken   together

conveniently?



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+The amendment reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D47 be reduced by $10 in respect

of sub-head 11.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first item

relates to expenditure on equipment, the setting up

of  studios and so on. The second one, sub-head 11,

which   you   are  taking  together,   relates   to

television works and buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first, as you know. Sir, a couple

of  months  ago,  two  experts  from  the  Japanese

Broadcasting  Corporation  came  here  and  made  a

report,  and  our project for television  is  based

more  or less on their recommendations. I can state

briefly  what will be the nature of the  television

outfit. Firstly, the studios will be sited at Radio

Singapore,  because it is cheaper to do so,  though

we are told that perhaps in future years television

might have to be a completely separate outfit.  But

for  the  next  few years, we find  it  cheaper  to

operate  it  as  part of Radio  Singapore,  so  the

studios  will be sited at Radio Singapore  and  the

transmitter will be sited at Bukit Batok.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures which were submitted were roughly

estimated  by the Japanese experts. So there  might

have  to be some alterations one way or the  other.

But $2,740,000 is the rough figure given to us, of

which  we  propose to spend $1,300,000 in 1961.  We

also  have a plan for the training of the necessary

staff  for  television both for the  technical  and

programme sides. This plan is being worked out  and

it  involves  the training of some of the  existing

staff  in  Radio Singapore for television work  and

also the recruiting from outside for the purpose of

training.  As  far  as  the  actual  channels   are

concerned,  it is intended to start  off  with  two

transmissions to operate initially for four hours a

day in all the four languages. The second one,

sub-head  11,  really relates to the cost of  buildings

and television works.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

my  opinion,  it  is indeed strange that  Singapore

will have its own television. But before that comes

about, the Members of this Assembly as well as  the

people  of  Singapore would like to know  from  the

Minister  for  Culture the kind  of  programmes  or

proposals that will be shown on television and  the

proposed tax on people owning television sets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As regards programmes. One of the

difficulties,  even  more  so  in   the   case   of

television than in the case of radio, is  that  the

programmes   are  quite  expensive,  unlike   radio

broadcasting. Television programmes involve a great

deal  of  expenditure  and they  will  have  to  be

broadcast   in   four  languages.  The   types   of

programmes  will  be, first, educational,  possibly

for  schools; and, second, the transmission of news

in  the  nature  of newsreels relating  to  foreign

affairs  because  we  can  get  them  from  foreign

agencies, and also local news in the form of films,

sports and cultural performances. In fact, we  hope

to  relate television to the National Theatre where

performances  can  both be shown for  the

theatre-going  audience as well as broadcasts which can  be

viewed in the homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain type of programme will be introduced.

For  example, I am told that sports programmes  can

be broadcast in all the languages in the sense that

they  are visual and most of them need very  little

commentary. You might even have to experiment  with

two   or   three  commentators  chipping   in   and

introducing a few sentences to help the  viewer  to

understand what is going on. But as regards certain

other   types   of  programmes,  especially   local

programmes  Chinese, Malay and  Tamil - the  bulk  of

them  will  have to be produced here because  these

are  not  available from abroad in these languages.

Some of the films, for example, instructional films

can  be  put across by using sub-titles and can  be

broadcast  in  English  with sub-titles  in  Malay,

Chinese and Tamil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in licence fees, I cannot

give  the  precise details but I can give  you  the

basis  on  which the fees have been worked  out  in

other  countries. By and large, I  understand  that

you  can increase by about 20 to 30 per cent of the

existing  fees,  but  that  depends  on  how   long

television  shows are going to be put  on.  We  may

start on a small scale with each language programme

for  only  one  or two hours a day, and  as  we  go

along, we may have to increase the length of  time.

So  we  have to work out the fees in terms of  what

our  ultimate showing time will be. On that  basis,

there is a table which has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



been  worked  out but I cannot give details  as  to

what the actual fees will be. I do not know whether

that satisfies the Member for Kampong Kembangan  or

not.

<br><br>7.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on television.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Budget

Statement, the Minister for Finance stated that  we

have to find a lot of money from outside as well as

from  inside  in  order  to  put  into  effect  his

development plans. In order to attract  loans  from

outside,  he  considered it necessary  to  increase

taxation  next year so that a picture is  given  to

the outside world that the Singapore Government has

done its best for itself locally. I wonder, in that

context,  whether it is necessary in  the  economic

interest of Singapore to want to spend nearly $4¾

million on television. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



economic  benefit  can Singapore derive  from  this

$4¾   million?  Would  it  not  be  better   that

television be entrusted to a public corporation and

the  money that is to be spent on television  could

be  better  devoted to more housing, hospitals  and

schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the arguments

are  (a)  whether we are justified  in  introducing

television,  and (b) whether we should not  entrust

television in the hands of a corporation.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MR G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>7.24 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first, the expenditure of over $4

million on television is no more a waste of  public

funds  than  spending money on libraries,  museums,

art   galleries  and  radio,  because   television,

especially in a multi-lingual society like ours, is

a    powerful   and   effective   instrument    for

transcending language barriers and also because  in

television we have a medium using visual images and

to  that  extent we can overcome language barriers.

Further,   it  is  a  very  effective  medium   for

educational purposes. I was in Japan a  few  months

ago. One of the things that were told to me by  the

teachers there was that, as a result of television,

the powers of comprehension of a child increased by

something  like  100  per  cent.  Because   through

television a child can realise what a desert  looks

like, what Paris looks like, and what a green  belt

of tropical forest looks like. The children can see

historical  episodes  and they  can  get  a  better

impression of what they can only read in books  and

imagine themselves. So there is no doubt about  the

value  and  effectiveness  of  television,  because

every country today realises that television is  as

essential as radio and the many other types of mass

media.   Therefore,  I  do  not  agree   with   the

contention that we cannot afford to spend this  sum

of money on television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government intends to sustain

television  by  introducing  commercial  programmes

into  television. In fact, the experts are  of  the

opinion that, instead of the odd $4 million going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



down the drain, it will bring in revenue to justify

that  expenditure, apart from the effectiveness  of

television   in   educating  and   increasing   the

intellectual and cultural level of the people.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question whether we should hand

this  over  to a corporation, I see no  reason  for

this.  For  many years the radio has  been  in  the

hands  of this Government, and in the hands of  the

previous  government  and  many  other  governments

before.  There is no particular reason  why  it  is

necessary   to  put  it  into  the   hands   of   a

corporation.  Because at this stage we  think  that

the Government can use television or any other mass

media  effectively  to achieve  certain  objectives

which we have in mind, including the creation of  a

Malayan culture and a Malayan consciousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr

Thio Chan Bee and Tun Lim Yew Hock:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That the sum to be allocated for Head D47 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 11.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Amendment (2) *

is not being moved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,482,400 for Head D47 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D50 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D50 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a point of information, Mr Kandasamy: what is

this "Dhoby Ghaut" and what is it intended to do at

Changi Camp?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, a "ghaut", according to the  Concise

Oxford  Dictionary,  means a mountain  pass,  or  a

flight  of steps leading to a river-landing  place.

But  it  is also a Hindustani expression meaning  a

place where washermen do their washing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Like Dhoby Ghaut!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In this case, it consists of

stone  slabs  on which the soiled linen  is  beaten

with a wooden stick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dhoby Ghaut at Changi Camp was originally

meant  for volunteer week-end and annual  camps  to

have  their  soiled linen washed and  cleaned.  But

with   the  increase  in  the  number  of   regular

personnel  in  the  Brigade headquarters  at  Beach

Road, it has been found that soiled linen may  have

to  be  taken over to Changi Camp and washed there.

The  present proposal, therefore, is to enlarge the

Dhoby  Ghaut at Changi Camp, so that a small  ghaut

originally meant for 20 men may now have a capacity

for  500 men. It is considered much cheaper than  a

steam laundry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I commend the Government for its

economy  in  this  matter,  and  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D50 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Kandasamy, on a matter of information:

what is the Ulu Pandan Camp and whom is it intended

to serve?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Ulu Pandan Camp was first

erected  in  1957,  and it was  intended  to  be  a

temporary  camp for the Singapore Military  Forces.

It  was  hoped that permanent barracks at Woodlands

could  be  taken  over, but the  latest  indication

shows  that  it  will  not  be  possible  for   the

Singapore   Military  Forces  to  take   over   the

Woodlands  Camp  until possibly  in  1963.  At  the

present  moment,  the  Ulu  Pandan  Camp  is  being

occupied by the Singapore Infantry Regiment.  Since

it  was  originally a temporary camp and  now  that

certain   semi-permanent   structures   have   been

erected, a certain sum of money has to be voted for

maintenance and possible improvements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I have leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $137,900 for Head D50 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D55 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Kandasamy, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D55 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kandasamy, in this provision, as much as $28,000 has been allocated for the completion of

Pulau  Senang  Settlement, to be distributed  under

several items. I take this opportunity to submit my

views  in  regard  to  Government's  proposals   to

establish  an  improvement in  the  morale  of  the

detainees  for their past activities as  gangsters.

While  I  welcome this measure for the  welfare  of

Singapore.  I would like to make a request  to  the

Ministry concerned to consider the welfare  of  the

people in the Southern Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received a number of complaints and

pleadings about the difficulties which they face or

the  obstacles which they meet since the settlement

was  established there. I would like  to  say  that

Pulau Senang, which is in the neighbourhood of  the

Southern Islands, is an island which originally had

useful  materials for the people  of  the  Southern

islands.  For  example,  according  to  information

given  to me, there is plenty of fish in the waters

around  Pulau Senang, and the islanders often  went

there  to  catch  fish. Moreover, this  island  has

trees which provided the islanders with material to

construct kelong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Pulau Senang island has now become a

protected area, the islanders have been deprived of

the fish and the trees. I do not question that. But

I  wish to draw the attention of the authorities to

the  prohibition to fish in the waters and to being

challenged by the guards on the island.  This  does

not   mean   that  I  am  protesting  against   the

prohibition  to  land on the island,  as  it  is  a

protected  area, but I feel that fishermen  who  go

there  in search of fish could be distinguished  as

dwellers   in  the  Southern  Islands,   as   their

livelihood is fishing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to this matter, I hope the Minister

could   appreciate  the  difficulties   which   the

dwellers of the Southern Islands face. And  if  the

Minister would like to have further information,  I

shall submit them in detail later, as I do not wish

to waste the time of the Assembly on details.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am, in fact, quite

surprised  at  what  the Member  for  the  Southern

Islands had said, because under this heading - Pulau

Senang  Settlement - it refers to (1) the  completion

of   the   Superintendent's   quarters;   (2)   the

completion of the water catchment project; and  (3)

the  construction  of a jetty. I  see  no  relation

between  what  the Member for the Southern  Islands

has just said and the various items provided for in

the  Budget.  Anyway, for the  information  of  the

House,  when  we  chose  Pulau  Senang  to  be  the

settlement, we had, in fact, considered the welfare

of  the  fishermen. We had consulted the  Fisheries

Department of the Ministry of National Development,

and  I  can  assure  the Member  for  the  Southern

Islands  that due consideration had been  given  to

the  various  aspects before  we  decided  on  this

island.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

I  am  surprised  when the Minister concerned  said

that this matter had nothing to do with what I  was

pleading  for.  I believe that the problem  is  not

confined  to the construction or developments  made

at  the Pulau Senang Settlement. But it may well be

that tomorrow we could not even go there because of

the  other  developments which the  Government  may

make  there.  Even now, when there  are  no  fences

around, difficulties have been created. So  I  feel

that  with  the  provisions made in the  Estimates,

large  schemes  may  be put into  effect.  In  this

connection, I would like the Government to consider

what I have put forward.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when

it  does come to that stage, we will consider  what

the Member for the Southern Islands had just said.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, on the

same subject but on another aspect. We have read in

the  papers that Ministers and Assemblymen from the

Government side have made visits to Pulau Senang. I

was wondering whether the same facilities could  be

given  to the Members of the Opposition - not to  be

inmates of Pulau Senang! - but we would like to have

a  look  at  what is going on there. As Members  of

this  Assembly, we have the right to visit prisons,

hospitals and institutions in Singapore. So  I  was

wondering whether the Government would provide  the

same  facilities for us to visit Pulau Senang  and,

at  the  same  time, to provide transport  for  us,

because they have the boats and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> One-way traffic, is it?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> No, two-way traffic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am

really glad to hear that the Opposition Members are

that  they  have  the welfare of the  detainees  at

heart. I can assure Members of the Opposition  that

facilities will be provided for them to visit Pulau

Senang. In fact, it is my intention sometime  early

next year to set up visiting teams to Pulau Senang,

and   in  these  visiting  teams  Members  of   the

Opposition will be included.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D56 be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, judging by the amount to be spent on the

acquisition  of school sites, I wonder whether  the

Minister  could  tell us if, under this  programme,

all  suitable school sites in Singapore  have  been

acquired  by  the Government so that aided  schools

would  have no suitable school sites left for their

own expansion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, the

Government  of  Singapore has made  plans  for  the

development  of  schools. It has  prepared  figures

from   statistics,  and  owing  to  the  population

increase,  it  is  felt that the Government  should

endeavour  to  build the equivalent of  19  schools

each  year,  14  of which would be  primary  and  5

secondary, and which, if all these 19 schools could

be  erected each year, would take in an anticipated

enrolment of 40.000 per year. As I said earlier  on

during  the  Main Estimates debate,  a  responsible

government  should not avoid the responsibility  of

providing  education  for its  citizens,  and  this

Government is proceeding along those lines. In  the

past,  it  is  true that aided schools have  played

their   part  in  providing  education  where   the

Government  has failed. But I think the  time  must

soon   come  when  Government  must  shoulder   its

responsibility to provide education for as many  as

possible in its schools. But it does not mean  that

we  will  push  out aided schools if they  wish  to

develop  and erect new buildings, for which capital

aid  will still be available. But I must warn those

in  charge  of  aided  schools  that  we  are  only

reserving $1 million per annum as capital  aid  for

aided  schools, because we cannot do it both  ways.

We  ourselves go in for a large building  programme

of  about $11 million a year and, at the same time,

offer millions of dollars to aided schools. So with

that  as  a conditional qualification, we  will  be

very  pleased  if  aided schools will  continue  to

build new schools where this dollar-for-dollar  aid

will be available, but it is only restricted to  $1

million per annum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

think  we  agree  that it is only  right  that  the

Government should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



be  the one to shoulder the main responsibility for

the   education  of  the  children  of   Singapore.

Therefore, it was with great reluctance  that  when

the Government approached the aided schools for the

use  of  available classrooms in the afternoon,  we

agreed,  because we realised that  by  agreeing  to

expansion at this time it would mean an increase in

our  own problems. I do not think, Sir, that  aided

schools want to compete with Government schools  in

expanding  their  facilities, because  economically

they  are  not  in a position to compete  with  the

Government. But if because of circumstances  a  few

aided schools are compelled to go further and start

building   schools   because   of   this   enforced

expansion, would the Government make available  any

of  their  sites,  at the cost that  they  acquired

them,  to enable the aided schools - I must say  that

only  a  few of them would be able to do  that -  to

build  new  buildings or new schools  in  order  to

solve their own problems? Of course, the Government

would  give them a dollar-for-dollar grant, but  we

know  that  in  practice usually the aided  schools

have to spend more than what Government gives them.

But   sites  are  difficult  to  find,  and   since

Government  has  gained almost a  monopoly  on  the

suitable sites, then we hope, if the aided  schools

find  it  necessary to ask Government  for  aid  in

having  a  few of the sites marked for acquisition,

the Government would give the necessary assistance.

I  wonder  whether the Minister could  give  us  an

assurance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

subject to what I have said just now, I am prepared

to  give  the assurance. But the Member for Tanglin

mentioned that although aided schools get a

dollar-for-dollar  aid, they do not really  get  the  full

amount of aid. Here again, it has been the practice

in  the  past  for aided schools to  build  schools

which are of a much higher standard than Government

schools.  I think that is a very peculiar state  of

affairs.  If  aided schools want to build  schools,

then I think they should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



follow Government specifications; and if the  aided

schools would like to have more ornamentation, more

grandeur in the rooms and halls, then I think it is

only fair that they meet the difference themselves.

I  think that has been done when the new Government

came into power.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, aided

schools  are getting poorer and poorer these  days,

and  I am afraid the future will not be as good  as

before. I am glad of the assurance given that there

will be the necessary assistance. Therefore, I  beg

to withdraw the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment stood in the name of Inche Mohd. Ali bin Alwi

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this provision, $3,500,000 is for the school

building  programme for 1961. I hope  the  Minister

for  Education could explain whether these  schools

will  be  built in 1961 and where their  localities

will  be - whether they include primary schools  in

Blakang  Mati. No schools have been built there  up

till this year.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I can

assure the Member for the Southern Islands that the

1961  school  building  programme  will  include  a

school  at  Blakang Mati. It is part  of  the  1961

programme.  There  will  also  be  another  one  at

Kampong  Pasir,  Pulau Tekong. The annual  building

programme,  as  I  have said, is  that  out  of  19

schools,  there will be 7 primary, 7  post-primary,

and  5 secondary schools, two of which will be  for

technical education.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Kandasamy, Sir,

with  regard to the secondary schools as stated  by

the  Minister for Education, could he say how  many

of them will be Malay schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> To answer that question, Mr

Kandasamy,  Sir,  I may go back, I  think,  to  the

1959/60 school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



building programme. It takes some time to plan  for

a   school  and  to  really  see  it  coming   into

operation.  But,  in any case,  under  the  1959/60

building programme, two secondary schools have been

reserved  for the Malay medium, the first of  which

will  be  at  Aljunied, which should be  ready  for

occupation in September 1961. The second  one  will

be  at  the  junction of Wilkinson and  Mountbatten

Roads, which will be known as the Kallang Secondary

School, but which, unfortunately, because of piling

difficulties, will not, I think, be available until

August 1962. As for the 1961 building programme, we

have not made any definite provisions yet. We shall

build  the  schools and if we find that the  demand

for   a   particular  language  medium  school   is

required,  then it is reserved for that  particular

language medium.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Kandasamy, Sir,

according  to the explanation given,  there  is  no

Malay secondary school to be built for 1961, but it

will  be considered according to future demands.  I

would  like  to draw the attention of the  Minister

for  Education  to  the  schools  that  are  to  be

definitely   built  in  Aljunied  and  Mountbatten

Roads.  I  feel  it is necessary  for  a  secondary

school to be built in Pasir Panjang, especially for

those  students who live there. I know it is  quite

far  for them to go to and from their schools, and,

therefore. I would like the Minister, in  his  plan

for   next  year,  to  consider  building  a  Malay

secondary school at Pasir Panjang.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

could the Minister for Education say, if he has not

forgotten, whether under his building programme for

1961  he  is  going to build a school  at  Alsagoff

Estate? I feel that this is necessary because there

are many children who have to go out of the area to

attend school. It would be better if a school could

be built in that area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, the point

mentioned by the Member for the Southern Islands is

very  much in the minds of Government. In fact,  in

the  building  of  schools, we are endeavouring  to

build primary schools in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



the   city  areas  and  secondary  schools  in  the

outlying  areas, so that the younger children  will

not  have to travel too much by bus, but the  elder

boys  could move more freely when they go by public

vehicles.  We  also  plan to have  our  schools  so

situated  as  to meet the needs of the  population.

That is why in congested areas the schools would be

multi-storey - a six-storey school at Silat Road and

a  10-storey  school  at the  Selegie/Short  Street

site.  It  is our intention, therefore,  since  the

first  two Malay secondary schools would be in  the

eastern region of the island of Singapore, i.e. at

the  junction  of  Mountbatten and Wilkinson  Roads

plus Aljunied Road, that the third secondary school

would  very  likely be on the western side  of  the

island, which would be around Pasir Panjang. But  I

think  we  will  first find a site  and  then  say,

"Well, we will build it around these parts."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that also would be the answer to the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan. It is  very  likely

that  the  secondary school which we will build  at

Jalan  Kaki Bukit - we are already going to  build  a

primary  school there and we have an area  reserved

for  a secondary school - may be turned into a Malay

secondary  school. I think sometimes it  is  a  bit

difficult  to pinpoint a certain area  and  say  we

would  like  a  school to be built  there,  because

sometimes  it is not possible to acquire  the  site

for  certain  reasons. But we  shall  endeavour  to

build  as  close  as possible in  areas  where  the

demand has to be met.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Hon. the Minister for

Education  just  now  said  that  in  certain  very

crowded  areas, he proposed to have erected

multi-storey buildings for schools. If these multi-storey

buildings   are  to  be  used  by  primary   school

children,  I wonder if it is a good thing  for  the

small  children  to be in such schools,  because  I

take  it  that it necessarily implies the provision

of  lifts.  The  experience of housing  authorities

where  multi-storey  flats have  been  erected  and

lifts provided even where adults live, has not been

very  satisfactory. That is the  first  point  that

occurs to me, Mr Kandasamy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is what provision the Minister

proposes  to make in respect of playing fields  for

these  multi-storey  sites. Is  he  proposing  that

there  should  be a common user of  playgrounds  in

respect of these multi-storey buildings?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, as to the first point

raised by the Member for Farrer Park, here again it

is  a question of choice between what is ideal  and

what is practical. These are days when, because  of

land  shortage, flats are being built for citizens;

whereas  in the past, everyone could have a  little

plot of land a little away from town, perhaps,  and

have  all the advantages of living space. So it  is

not something new for the citizens of Singapore  to

be  staying  in flats that are

either 7-storey,  9-storey or even 11-storey, and the children will  be

living in such fiats. It can be safely assumed that

adequate precautions would be taken regarding the

operation  of lifts and even for teachers  to  look

after  the  children when they  move  up  in  these

lifts.  This  multi-storey school  where  the  lift

difficulty  would arise will be the one at  Selegie

Road, because the one in Silat Road, although it is

a six-storey school, will have the approach road to

the  third  floor. So it is a question  of  walking

either  three  flights up or walking three  flights

down. So I think the Selegie/Short Street 10-storey

school building could be regarded as a sort  of  an

experiment. If it is proved successful, then we may

consider   building   more  of  such   multi-storey

schools;  but  if  it  does  not  prove  to  be  as

satisfactory as we had hoped for, then it could  be

converted,  I think, to a post-primary  school  for

children who are in their teens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question posed by the Member for

Farrer Park has escaped my notice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Playgrounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Playgrounds. Well, in our

plans,  we are hoping to provide for every  primary

school a playground space of three acres: and for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



secondary schools, 4½ acres. These are things  we

work  to, but if we are pressed. I suppose the only

alternative would be to give them those  facilities

as  mentioned by the Member for Farrer Park,  i.e.,

to use a common user playground for their games and

so  forth.  These are matters of detail which  will

have  to  be worked out, and every effort  will  be

made  to  let the younger children have  more  play

time than study time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, this year, there has been

somewhat  slow progress in the building of  kampong

roads  and kampong bridges. I do not know why,  but

this   has   been  so.  If  I  may  refer   to   my

constituency,  that  is Geylang  Serai,  because  I

happen  to  know more about this constituency  than

any  of the others, a request has been made to  the

authorities concerned to metal Jalan Alsagoff,  the

main  approach to the Alsagoff Estate, but  it  has

been  of no avail. Further requests were also  made

by  the  residents  of a forgotten  kampong - Kampong

Paya  - for  a  bridge  and an approach  road.  Here

again,  nothing  happened. If I may  say  something

about   this  forgotten  kampong,  it   is   almost

completely  surrounded  by marshy  land.  The  only

approach  road  there is mostly unusable  in  rainy

weather  due to prolonged flooding. The  plight  of

the  residents in Kampong Paya is not rare  amongst

the residents of other rural kampongs in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore hope, Sir, that Government in

implementing their rural schemes would  draw  up  a

priority list to the effect that those who  are  in

need most be given help first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will take

sub-head 2 of Head D57 first. Sir, according to the

wording of this sub-head, which is "Improvements to

Rural  Bridges", I would like to inform the  Member

for  Geylang  Serai  that  this  provision  is  for

repairing,  widening  and  strengthening  of  rural

bridges.   It  is  not  a  provision  for  building

bridges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the building of Kampong and rural

roads,  the  provision  is for  major  repairs  and

making  up  of  existing rural  and  kampong  roads

throughout  the  island.  Work  to  the  value   of

$500,000 is expected to be done in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a list of roads with me here. This

programme  of  making  up and  repairing  roads  is

divided  into  three divisions. The north  division

covers  Sembawang, Jalan Kayu, Nee Soon, and  Bukit

Panjang.  The  estimated cost of this programme  is

about  $168,000. The second division is called  the

eastern   division  covering  Tampines.  Kembangan,

Punggol.  Serangoon, Geylang Serai, and Changi  and

the programme is estimated to cost $131,450.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



For  the third division called the western division

which  covers  Jurong, Bukit Panjang and  Choa  Chu

Kang, the estimated cost of repairing and making up

roads is $31,400.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to the making up and repair of

kampong and rural roads, priority is decided by the

Urban   and   Rural  Services  Advisory  Committee.

Priority is given according to the urgency  or  the

need  of  such  areas as require the making  up  or

repair of roads.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, I

would  like  to draw the attention of the  Minister

concerned,  that  is,  the  Minister  for  National

Development, to the subject of the construction  of

roads  in  the rural areas. Members of  this  House

have  spoken  on many matters about pipes,  bridges

and  roads.  I  have often paid attention  to  this

matter,  and  though it has been  explained  to  me

that,  in  principle, this and that  road  will  be

built,  I  am afraid that the plans envisaged  have

not been fulfilled. Why is this so? If the Minister

concerned  wants  to approach the  problem  in  the

right way, I can supply him with details. That is a

matter which affects my area. I am saying this as a

representative of Kampong Kembangan. I gather  that

whilst  I  cannot  get  what  I  want,  there   are

others - whose names I would not mention - who can get

what  they  want. I have asked for  bridges  to  be

built  in  villages, but so far there has  been  no

response from the Government because they  want  to

do  it  themselves.  It  is to  be  regretted  that

members  of the Government have asked and got  what

they  wanted.  I  would like to get an  explanation

from the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  the President of the Urban  and  Rural

Committee  is  to see that the work  in  connection

with  the  provision  of pipes,  bus  shelters  and

drains  is properly carried out in the interest  of

all  the people living in the various parts of this

island.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has made an

accusation  which  is  not  justified,  because  we

cannot do all the work that is required in one year

to  satisfy all the people of the 51 constituencies

of  Singapore. We can only fulfil some of the wants

of each constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the work to be undertaken for each

constituency in 1961, the Urban and Rural  Services

Advisory   Committee  has  already   directed   its

Secretary to put up a report for the information of

all  Members of this House. Therefore, it is to  be

hoped  that  the Member for Kampong Kembangan  will

await  this  report before he levels the  criticism

that his constituency is being treated unfairly.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  want  to  dwell at length on  this  matter

because in my explanation I have said that  I  hope

the  Government will co-operate with the Opposition

in  regard to the rural areas. I am still  left  in

doubt  as to what the programme for 1961 is, and  I

consider it necessary that it be explained  to  the

Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sub-head 5 reads "Conversion and Furnishing

of  Government Buildings for Overseas  Specialist".

It  is  just  one specialist. I am  sure  it  is  a

mistake.  It  could  be many overseas  specialists.

There  are  a  number of Government buildings.  But

what I would like to point out is that a number  of

Government  buildings have already been  furnished.

Is  it  therefore necessary to re-furnish  and

re-convert  certain  Government  dwelling  houses  for

overseas  specialists? If there are  only  a  small

number  of  overseas specialists, would it  not  be

cheaper  to  house  them in hotels  than  to  spend

$150,000?

various  Governments, including the Governments  of

the  United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan,

India,  Israel  and  others,  to  provide  us  with

suitable officers. It would be far cheaper to house

them  in Government quarters than to let them  live

in  hotels. And indeed in the case of officers  who

are  expected to serve in Singapore for any  length

of  time, they would expect normal accommodation in

order  that they can bring over their families  and

children,  if necessary. In the case of the  larger

Government quarters, what we have done  now  is  to

split   them  into  separate  flats  so  that   our

available  accommodation can be used to  house  the

maximum number of persons.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> 1961. Priorities for the various

areas to be equipped with street lighting will also

be  allocated  by  the  Urban  and  Rural  Services

Advisory  Council. In deciding on these priorities,

the  Council will no doubt also have regard to  the

urgency  of need in any locality, and depending  on

the  representation of the people in that locality.

I  am  afraid I cannot supply information in regard

to  the  number of lamp-posts that will be provided

in  these  areas; I am afraid I do  not  have  the

details.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

even  the  Minister could not say how much  is  the

cost  of the lampposts! I do not mind. But  what  I

want to point out is that in the Geylang Serai area

there are lamps, but in my area there are no lamps.

I  admit there are lamps in Lorong Marican, but the

installation of lamps stopped at the bridge leading

to my area.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the

Minister for National Development will do something

about  it; otherwise there will be a very big spilt

in my Party!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Seow? Also on lamp posts?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

want  to  draw  the attention of the  Minister  for

National  Development  to this:  he  will  remember

talking  about bulbs being taken away  from  S.T.T.

flats.   Well,  it  was  because  of  the  verandah

lighting  in  the  flats that the  lack  of  street

lighting  was  not felt. But now  that  it  is  the

principle  of  the Government to  take  away  those

bulbs   and  they  will  not  be  replaced,  street

lighting will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



imperative  in  some S.I.T. areas. You  will  agree

with me that in some areas with S.I.T. flats, there

are  quite  a lot of bad-hats and gangsters  living

there.  So if the streets are not lighted and  with

all  verandah  lights being taken away,  the  whole

S.I.T. area  will  be in total darkness,  and  the

Minister  will not be surprised to find  gangsters'

dens growing in that area.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  apart  from  wanting  standpipes  and  street

lamps,  every  Member of the Assembly wants  street

lamps  installed in his respective area.  But,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, our provisions are not large  and  we

must  consider  the  general  position  instead  of

concentrating on any one area. If we  compare  this

year's  provision with last year's it will be  seen

that  a  considerable provision has been  made  for

Kampong  Kembangan. This is not buying the  support

of Kampong Kembangan for the Government. But I feel

that  the  burden should be equally  shouldered.  A

sarong  that is short could be pulled up. We  could

all share our joys and sorrows together.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is getting a share of

the sarong!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

wish  to explain the position of street lamps.  The

Urban  and  Rural  Services  Advisory  Council,  in

considering the installation of street lamps,  will

first consider recommendations and suggestions  put

up  by  the Police. For example, in the Tiong Bahru

area  and in Silat Road, because of recommendations

and explanations by the Police that there have been

gangster activities in those areas, they have  been

given priority in the distribution of Street lamps.

My  colleague  has  explained just  now,  and  very

clearly  too,  that  if we have  enough  money  and

sufficient  working  staff,  we  will  be  able  to

provide street lamps in every street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $31,886,500 for Head D57 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining Heads of Expenditure

in  respect  of which no amendments  stand  on  the

Order  Paper are D14, D16, D17, D18, D19, D26,  D33,

D40  and  D54. D52 is not required, I take it,  Mr

Minister for Finance? D52 is really a blank and we

can leave it out with safety, can we?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sums stated for those Heads

as  they appear in the fourth column of the Summary

of  Expenditure on page 502 of Paper  Cmd.  26  of

1960 stand part of the Development Estimates", put,

and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Have I left out Head D58? Mr

Minister, is a vote required for Head D58?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister assist? On page 502, column 4,

there  is a total of $165,356,710, and there  seems

to  be  an addition of $872,940 in respect of  Head

D58  - Colonial Development and Welfare  Schemes - and

the final total then is $166,229,650.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is right, Sir: the final

figure.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So there has to be a vote on Head

D58 as well. I will put that Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $872,940 for Head D58 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sum of $166,229,650 shall be

supplied  to  the  Government under  the  heads  of

expenditure  for the public services shown  in  the

Development Estimates contained in Paper Cmd. 26 of

1960", put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution to be reported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report  that the Committee of Supply have  come  to

certain resolutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolutions read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,  "That  the  Assembly  doth  agree  with  the

Committee on the said resolutions."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolutions accordingly agreed to.
