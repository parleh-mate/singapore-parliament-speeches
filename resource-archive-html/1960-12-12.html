<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (10th December,

1960),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be reduced

by  $10 in respect of item (59) of sub-head 1."-(Mrs Seow Peck Leng).

<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>MAIN ESTIMATES, 1961 (Cont.)</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 28-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to be

allocated for Head 28 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (59) of sub-head 1."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will recollect that it has been agreed

that  the  debate may range over sub-head 63.  It  is

also  on  the  Political Study Centre. Dr  Goh  Keng

Swee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I was just about to reply to the  three

questions  raised by the Member for Mountbatten  when

the recording system unfortunately broke down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may recapitulate, first, she wanted to know for

whom  the  Political Study Centre is  meant;  second,

what  type  of instruction goes on; and  third,  what

benefit is derived by the students and the State from

these activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question, the Political Study Centre is

meant  for  civil  servants, not only  those  in  the

Administrative services but also Government employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



in  Division II posts who perform duties relating  to

administrative  work  of one  kind  or  another.  The

Centre   has  also  run  a  series  of  classes   for

principals of English primary schools, and some  time

next year we hope to run similar classes of political

instruction   for  principals  of  Chinese   language

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the content of the courses, as the title

suggests,   the  courses  are  designed   to   impart

knowledge of political theory, political institutions

in  general,  and  Asian  political  developments  in

particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as to whether these courses have benefited

the  students and the State, I would say  undoubtedly

they have.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, I

wonder whether the Minister for Finance would be kind

enough  to  tell  us  in what way  the  courses  have

benefited the students?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The answer is to ask the students!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  When  we  formed  the Government,  one  of  the

difficulties  that faced us was that we  inherited  a

civil  service which, by and large, was incapable  of

making  political judgment. Our local civil  service,

though  technically competent, had always been  under

the   illusion  that  because  they  should  be  non-

political  in character they must avoid all  interest

in  political  affairs to the extent  of  even  being

ignorant  of  political  issues.  For  instance,  the

opinion  has  always been expressed  that,  as  civil

servants,   they  must  not  indulge  or  dabble   in

politics,  as  if politics is a kind of parlour  game

intended  for the amusement or diversion  of  people.

The  way  we look at it is that political affairs  is

not  a  parlour game. On the contrary, it  may  be  a

matter of life and death whether or not we can  build

up  a  democratic  system of sufficient  strength  to

withstand the stresses that our country has to  meet.

This  is not such a simple matter as some Members  of

the  Opposition may think. It is not sufficient  just

to say that the civil servants are there to carry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



out  the policies and instructions of Ministers. When

they carry out policies, they necessarily must have a

wide  sphere  of discretion. It is not  possible  for

Ministers to give directives in detail to enable  the

civil  servant  to meet any possible eventuality.  If

the  role of the civil service were just to carry out

instructions  in a mechanical way,  that  is,  to  be

guided purely by the letter of the General Orders  or

by  such  circulars and directives as may be  issued,

you can be sure that the Government would not be able

to  make  any  impact upon the people. This  lack  of

experience or lack of involvement or lack of thinking

on the part of the civil servants on political issues

has been detrimental to themselves, because they have

not  been  able  to see how they have been  separated

from  the masses, why that is a bad thing and why  it

is  necessary for them to know what the masses  think

about political affairs, their hopes and aspirations,

so  that  the execution of Government policy  can  be

made more effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the school principals, it is obvious,

Sir,  that they have a vital role to perform  in  the

task of nation-building. They are the key persons who

will  mould  the form and content of the thinking  of

the  younger generation. And like the civil servants,

the  school principals have not given any thought  to

the  political issues of the day, nor have they  made

any   effort  to  understand  the  general  political

background not only, in respect of Singapore and  the

Federation  of Malaya but also the general resurgence

of  nationalism in Asia in the post-war years.  These

are  matters  they must appreciate,  and  it  is  the

purpose  of the Political Study Centre to run courses

of   instruction  for  these  groups  of   Government

employees.  As I have said, the effect  on  them  has

been very marked and immediate. I myself have gone to

the  Political Study Centre after sessions  and  held

informal  discussions with civil servants and  school

principals on what they thought of these courses; and

apart  from  a  few diehards who cannot  understand

what  it  is  all about or who cannot appreciate  the

necessity  for re-thinking of the basic  issues,  the

general effect has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



been, one might almost say, the reconversion to a new

point  of view of which they were completely  unaware

previously.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I entirely

agree with the Minister that civil servants who  have

to  carry  out instructions cannot do so  effectively

unless they know the background to these instructions

and  the  policies on which they are based.  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister a question in  connection

with  the  studies and courses held in the  Political

Study  Centre.  I  agree that the students  attending

these courses have become more knowledgeable men, but

would  the  Minister  state  categorically  that  the

knowledge  they  have  gained  have  made  them  more

efficient civil servants, and that the civil  service

has become a more efficient service?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would say without a doubt that

the  answer is yes for this reason, quite apart  from

the content of the political instructions. The senior

officers who went through these courses - many of  them

for  the  first  time - understand now  why  Government

policy is what it is, and they are therefore able  to

exercise  their  own  initiative  in  promoting   our

policies  instead  of  being jogged  along  by  their

Ministers.  But I would be the last person  to  claim

that what we have done is all that is necessary.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Political Study Centre has run courses for

all Divisions I and II officers and a large number of

school  principals,  we will in  the  next  stage  go

through  the  other remaining principals  of  English

schools and part of the Chinese school principals. We

also  intend  to  run  more  advanced  courses   for

selected officers in Division I. As I have said, this

is  a  continuing process, and I would say  that  the

results  we have achieved have justified our  efforts

in starting it.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  speak on the content of the courses that are  made

available at the Political Study Centre? While



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



agreeing with the Minister for Finance that it  is  a

good  thing  for our civil servants to know  what  is

going  on  around  them, not only  in  Singapore  but

throughout the world, particularly in South-east Asia

and  Asia,  and  that  it is  good  to  educate  them

politically,  the  question  that  arises  is   this:

whether the P.A.P. in power, while seeking to educate

them,  should itself, in the course of that political

education, seek to gain an advantage. If the Party in

power  while politically educating the civil servants

does  not  itself seek an advantage,  I  can  see  no

objection to that. But I understand that some of  the

lecturers,  tutors or whoever they  may  be,  perhaps

without  the knowledge of the Minister,  do  adopt  a

line which quite blatantly praises the Party in power

and  quite  openly  runs  down  the  other  political

Parties  in  Singapore. I wonder if the Minister  for

Finance knows this. If he knows this and he disagrees

with  it, will he stop it and give the Opposition  an

assurance  that  this  will not  continue  to  occur?

Political  education  is a  good  thing,  but  to  so

educate the civil servants as to make them think that

the  P.A.P. is  the  only  Party  worth  supporting,

whether  that  is a thing to be done  out  of  public

funds is yet another matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Sir, which I indicated to you could

conveniently  be dealt with this, is sub-head  63  on

page  273  of  the Estimates. Could the Minister  for

Finance tell the House what exactly would the Service

Manual contain?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As regards the statement that we

might  be  taking party political advantage  of  this

institution,  I can assure the Member  that  that  is

very  far  from  our intention. In fact,  if  we  had

attempted  to make it, shall we say, an  arm  of  the

Party,  then  we would not have achieved the  success

that  we  did. Surely the civil servants  could  have

seen through this. It could be, mind you, that in the

process  of  discussing  the  particular  issues  the

policy  of  the Government might have been  examined,

and it might have been demonstrated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



very  convincingly to the students that that was  the

correct  and  only policy that could be followed.  In

that  instance,  I would say that the lecturers  were

explaining the policy of the Government, as  distinct

from praising the excellence of the Party leadership.

I know there is a subtle difference, but nevertheless

it  is there. As for running down the Opposition,  if

the  Member for Farrer Park could give me details  as

to  when that happened and who did it, I will  assure

him that steps will be taken to stop it. But I rather

suspect  that the Member for Farrer Park  was  either

speaking  with  his tongue in his cheek,  or  he  was

badly misinformed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, that is, the Manual, it is

nothing   more  than  a  booklet  setting   out   the

attractions  of  a career in the Civil  Service.  The

previous Government published one in, I think,  1956.

It  is  now out of date. We are revising this Manual,

so  that  copies of it can be distributed to schools,

colleges,  and so on-places where we want to  recruit

civil servants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, while I entirely agree with the

Minister  for Finance that the line is very difficult

to  draw,  he will also agree with me that there  are

certain  instances where one cannot  but  help  think

that  that line is being taken. There could be  cases

where  a  line  is difficult to draw. Yet  there  are

other  instances where one knows quite  well  that  a

certain  line  is being taken, not to  put  across  a

theory  to the students, but merely to run down  some

previous  Minister or ex-Minister, or something  like

that. If, in the course of putting across a theory, a

discussion  entailed the merits of a policy  followed

by  a  former  Chief Minister and the  present  Prime

Minister,  that  is all right. But  where  gratuitous

insults   are  hurled  at  ex-Ministers  or  ex-Chief

Ministers, then I think that is going a bit too far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not raising this with my

tongue  in  my  cheek, but I have  had  it  seriously

mentioned  to  me  that this was  going  on.  And  in

fairness to the Minister, I felt I had to raise it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am obliged to the Member for

drawing my attention to it, and I shall certainly see

to it that if this thing had indeed occurred, it will

not take place in future.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister tell us whether these courses are voluntary,

or are civil servants told that they have to attend?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The courses for school principals

are  voluntary.  The courses for civil  servants  are

compulsory; they have to attend.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am one of the many Ministers  who  go

to  the Political Study Centre to give lectures,  and

to  be  lectured to. It is quite true  that,  by  and

large, we drew up the courses and we took great  care

to  see that they were not primarily intended to  put

forward  a party point of view, because that  would

have  destroyed  the  purpose  of  the  courses.  For

example,  last Wednesday. I think, I had to go  there

and one of the questions often asked was: "Is it true

that  the P.A.P. is anti-English educated?" In  reply

to  a  question like that, I asked, "Why do  you  say

so?"  Then  they  quoted  speeches  made  by  certain

political Parties. Naturally when we replied to  such

thing  we said that that was a very stupid statement.

I  do  not  know  whether that is  taken  as  putting

forward   propaganda  detrimental  to  a   particular

political  Party. Very often we were  asked,  "Is  it

true  that the P.A.P. is run by Communists?"  And  we

replied. "Who said so?", and certain Members  of  the

Opposition were quoted. And we said that that  was  a

very  stupid remark, in that sense, it could be.  But

by and large the purpose of these courses, apart from

imparting  instruction in political theories  and  so

on,  is  to provide the Ministers with an opportunity

to  get ordinary members of the civil servants to  be

critical.  Very  often  they  are  very  critical  of

Government policy. They ask questions like  "Why  was

it  done  this  way?" or they say that they  disagree

with  a particular policy, and we try to explain  why

we do these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



things. To that extent, I think these courses serve a

broader   purpose  apart  from  imparting   political

knowledge - they give civil servants an opportunity to

discuss things with their Ministers; not only  people

at  higher  levels but in the intermediate levels  as

well.  Therefore, they would then feel that they  are

not  just  dummies carrying out instructions  by  the

Government.   They  feel  they  have   a   sense   of

participation; that their advice is listened to,  and

in  a  number  of  cases they have put  forward  very

fruitful  suggestions  about how  political  problems

should  be  approached, and so on.  To  that  extent,

these courses are of mutual advantage not only to the

people  who  go  there  but  also  to  the  Ministers

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I saw the

Minister for Culture speaking there, I seemed to  see

the  face of Professor Enright! Why I bring it up  is

this:  this is the Political Study Centre  to  inject

political  thought  into  the  civil  servants.   The

Government says that such political activities cannot

be  indulged in by aliens. Yet the Director  of  this

Political  Study  Centre is not a Singapore  citizen.

How does that reconcile with Government's policy?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The answer surely is very simple,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. The Director is an officer of  the

Government and he has duties and functions to perform

in carrying out the policies of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I think it is indeed very

simple.  So  long as an alien plays the line  of  the

P.A.P., it is simple. If he does not play the line of

the P.A.P., it is no longer simple; he is brought  to

book.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that remark is as foolish

as  it  is offensive. There is no similarity  at  all

between  the  role  of an officer of  the  Government

performing  his  functions  in  the  office  of   the

Government,  and  an academic man  holding  forth  in

public  on matters of public policy. The work of  the

Director of the Political Study Centre is within  the

closed walls of the Civil Service.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Professor Enright's lecture-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think we need bring in

Professor Enright in this connection at all.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is just to show, Sir, that

so  long as any alien is prepared to play the line of

the P.A.P., it is quite all right to the Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think that question has been

answered. It is becoming a little tedious.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the

Hon. the  Minister for Finance whether this  teacher

who  is  teaching political science in the  Political

Study Centre is allowed to use his own discretion and

participate  in it? If he has ideas that are  adverse

to Government policy, will he still be employed? Will

he  be brought to book if he teaches what is fact  in

the  history  of politics, and in certain  Government

policies he happens to disagree with them and condemn

them?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That question, I think, is out of

order because it is purely hypothetical.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister should leave it

to  the Chair to decide what is or what is not out of

order.  In  the  Committee of Supply,  arguments  are

always hypothetical, or most of them are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Member for Mountbatten asking for a vote on

this?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the explanation given, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 10*.

*The same admendment stood

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 10, Mr Speaker, Sir, is in connection with

expenses  in connection with travelling on Government

duty.  In  this year's Estimates, there is a  sum  of

$100,000,  and  in  next  year's  Estimates,  it   is

intended to double it - more than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



double,  I  am  reminded. Could the  Minister  please

explain  whether Government is going to travel  twice

as much as it has done this year?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Government expects to travel

as much next year as this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In that case, the vote should not exceed

$100,000. That was the point of my objection. As  the

vote  now  is  $100,000, and it  is  intended  to  be

increased  to $206,000 for next year, have the  fares

gone  up  twice as much then for the same  amount  of

travel?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, actually the

vote   of  $100  000  for  this  year  has  now  been

exhausted, and it has been necessary to replenish  it

by  transfers from other heads. I do not know whether

we  are  going  to embark upon a long argument  about

travelling abroad. But it became quite obvious in the

course of this year that we had many conferences  and

meetings to attend abroad. As far as possible, it  is

the practice of this Government to send officials and

unofficials on conferences overseas. I have before me

a  figure  of  nearly 90 persons who  have  travelled

abroad   on   various  Government   conferences   and

meetings.  Of  these  90  persons,  only   five   are

Ministers.   I   do  hope  that  by  providing   this

explanation the Opposition will not waste the time of

the House in irrelevant debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I mean in unnecessary debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister appears to be taking

unto himself the functions of the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, one can understand the

feelings   of   the  Minister  when  an  embarrassing

question  is  asked. It is indeed a very embarrassing

question,  Sir,  particularly as we know  that,  with

regard  to this travelling overseas, it has been  the

practice  of  P.A.P. Ministers and P.A.P. supporters

and  Assemblymen to go round telling these unofficial

people, who are being allowed to travel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



overseas,  that  if they will just join  the  P.A.P.,

they could have a trip overseas. If the Minister will

just  give the names of the 90 persons who have  gone

overseas, I can assure this House that 90 per cent of

them are P.A.P. members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am afraid the Member for

Cairnhill is acquiring some of the bad habits of  the

Member for Hong Lim. The facts are quite the reverse.

The  majority of the persons who have gone abroad are

officials.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Unless the Member wishes to debate on

the   principle   of  Government  travelling,   these

details,  as I have suggested before, could  well  be

looked  into by the Estimates Committee; and  if  the

Estimates Committee finds that the expenses  are  too

extravagant,  it  will probably report  back  to  the

Assembly.   If  the  Member  wishes  to  attack   the

principle, by all means do so.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect. Sir, it is on the

question  of principle. Public Funds are being  spent

to  send  P.A.P. members overseas. If  the  Hon, the

Minister will give the names of those persons,  apart

from  officials and Ministers, the public will surely

have their eyes opened as to who have been travelling

on public funds.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill is really being quite tiresome about  this.

I would say straightaway that the number of Ministers

who  have  gone abroad - and I am the one who has  gone

more than any of my colleagues - is much less than that

under his Government. It is quite untrue to say  that

any  public funds have been wasted by sending members

of  the People's Action Party abroad. When a Party is

in  government, it is natural that the Ministers  and

some  of the Parliamentary Secretaries would be  sent

abroad  to  conferences  as  representatives  of  the

Government. May I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

debate  is  getting quite tedious unnecessarily,  and

that   the  procedure  would  be  for  the  Estimates

Committee  to satisfy itself whether there  has  been

any  gross  abuse  of  public funds  in  this  year's

expenditure?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister, as I have remarked

before, would like to be in this Chair himself! I can

assure  him  that  I  am  watching  the  point   very

carefully. There seems to be a difficulty in  drawing

the  line  between  principles and  details  in  this

particular matter. But perhaps we could deal with the

matter with less excitement.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the

Minister   is   evading  the  issue.  I   have   said

"unofficials". By "unofficials" I mean pot Government

servants,   not  P.A.P.  Ministers  and  not   P.A.P.

Assemblymen,  but those who are not in this  Assembly

and   those  who  are  not  in  the  service  of  the

Government. If the Minister will not give us  a  list

of  those  names,  I  can now understand  why  he  is

evading the issue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if that is the question he

asks,  then  I say that no member of the  P.A.P. has

been sent abroad at Government expense as a member of

the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I beg leave to withdraw, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refund of Previous Years' Revenue - $30,000". Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  this  is  purely  on  a   point   of

information.  I  see that a similar item  appears  at

page   287,   under  Customs  and  Excise,   sub-head

15 - "Refund  of  Previous Years' Revenue".  Could  the

Minister  please explain whether it is for accounting

purposes  that  the refund is made? I  take  it  that

these  were  revenues  which  were  intended  to   be

collected in the year 1960, but will be collected  in

1961,  and,  therefore, are refundable  to  the  1960

account. Is that the position?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this vote is

necessary  because, in some instances, taxpayers  are

overcharged in error, and these were detected  rather

late  in the day. So this is to make restitution  for

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 49.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this sum of $2,000,000 appears as

a  charge against the Consolidated Fund, whereas,  in

point  of fact, it is, I take it, an advance  to  the

City  Engineer's Department to enable  them  to  make

purchases of materials, stores, spares, etc. As  this

$2  million  has the effect of creating a deficit  or

adding to the expenditure of Government, could I  ask

the  Minister whether there is a corresponding  entry

somewhere on the revenue side in respect of  this  $2

million?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is one of

the  tricky  operations  we have  to  go  through  on

account  of the integration of the City Council  into

the  Government.  Perhaps I should  explain  how  the

Advance  Account  works. The Member for  Farrer  Park

probably has some knowledge of this subject. The City

Council  accounts are operated on an  accrual  basis,

that  is,  an income and expenditure basis,  so  that

debits  and  credits are made into the votes  as  and

when the operation takes place. For instance, in  the

case  of  the  City Engineer's Department,  they  buy

stocks of sand, granite, tyres, petrol and so on, and

the  costs of these things are charged to an  advance

account.  As  and  when particular  departments  want

these materials, be it the Sewerage Department or the

City  Transport Centre, these materials are  supplied

by  the  City Engineer and the vote of the department

using these materials is debited. In the case of  the

Government,  of course, it is different,  because  it

works on a cash basis. The whole of the costs of  any

purchases  would be debited against the vote  of  the

buying department. The reason why we have decided  to

continue  this Advance Account is that  a  change  of

procedure  in the book-keeping involved  would  be  a

fairly formidable undertaking, and this is one of the

compromises referred to in my speech and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



in  the  memorandum whereby the accounting procedures

of  the  City Council have been maintained, at  least

for  this  year.  By  next  year  we  hope  that  the

accounting system would be on the Government basis. I

hope  this  explanation is clear to  the  Member  for

Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> As I understand it, Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is because of budgeting purposes and is  really

an artificial deficit to the extent of $2 million. On

that basis, may I have leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take it that this is an item of expenditure

which  the  Singapore  Government  is  incurring   in

respect of trainees coming into Singapore and whom we

are assisting in training under the Colombo Plan. May

I  also deal with sub-head 52, Sir? I think it  would

be convenient if it were to be dealt with at the same

time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sub-head 52 is Colombo Plan Technical

allocated  for Head 28 be reduced by $10  in  respect

of  sub-head 50." The debate may range over  sub-head

52.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sub-head 50, Mr Speaker, is as

the Member for Farrer Park has indicated. That is, we

have  made  offers to all Colombo Plan countries  for

training  facilities  in  very  extensive  fields  in

Singapore   ranging  from  courses  in   engineering,

architecture,  accountancy  at  the  Polytechnic,  to

health   visitors'  and  public  health   inspectors'

courses by the Ministry of Health, practical training

in low-cost housing by the Housing Board, training in

port  management by the Singapore Harbour Board,  and

courses in telecommunications, civil aviation and  so

on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



and so forth. This vote is to provide for the cost of

allowances  as  scholarships  for  the  trainees   in

Singapore as well as for transport allowances, books,

equipment  and  tuition  fees where  applicable.  The

other   one,  that  is  the  Colombo  Plan  Technical

Assistance,  Local Costs, is to pay for experts  sent

to  Singapore  under  the  Colombo  Plan.  Under  the

scheme, the donor countries will pay the cost of  the

salaries and passages of these experts, but  we  will

have  to  meet the local costs, such as the  cost  of

board  and  lodging if they are staying for  a  short

while, or a fixed allowance of $600 per month plus  a

transport  allowance  of $7.50 if  they  are  staying

longer.  We  have  now some 20 Colombo  Plan  experts

assisting the Government at the present moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 68 is Singapore Industrial Promotion Board.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, during the debate on the Estimates

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



the  year  1960,  I  had occasion to  refer  to  this

particular  item  and I did suggest to  the  Minister

then  that perhaps no useful purpose could be  served

by this. Over the year I have waited to see what this

Industrial Promotion Board is doing to Singapore.  It

may  be  doing  something on paper,  but  the  people

certainly  do  not know of it. So far as  the  actual

achievements  of  the Singapore Industrial  Promotion

Board  are  concerned, Singapore  has  not  seen  any

concrete results yet. Perhaps the Minister could tell

us  what  the  Board has achieved during the  current

year  and what it hopes to achieve in the forthcoming

year, particularly when I see that he has allocated a

sum of $20 million to the Economic Development vote.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did say last

year  that the Industrial Promotion Board is  in  the

process  of being wound up. Indeed, for all practical

purposes,  so  far  as  the position  of  assets  and

liabilities is concerned, that process is practically

completed.  But the staff engaged by the  Board  have

been   doing   other   work,  such   as   considering

applications  for pioneer industries, preparation  of

the Government's development plans, and generally  to

give  assistance  to  various  industrialists  making

inquiries   in   Singapore  as  to  what   investment

opportunities exist. I suggest that if the Member for

Farrer  Park  agrees, then we shall go into  this  in

more   detail   when  we  discuss   the   Development

Estimates,  particularly the item under the  Economic

Development  Board, because these  are  inter-related

matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am just wondering, Mr Speaker, whether

that  particular item has a motion on it. If it  has,

might I also speak on sub-head 27 in respect of which

I have given notice of an amendmentØ?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, it would be convenient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, it would appear that the Singapore

Children's  Society is going to get an allocation  of

over  $32,000. Why is it necessary to split  it,  one

under the Ministry of Health and the other under  the

Ministry of Labour and Law?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sub-head 18 is a maintenance

grant towards the running of the Singapore Children's

Society  Convalescent Home, while sub-head  27  is  a

grant towards case-work done by the Society. The vote

under sub-head 18 that is, the maintenance grant  for

the  Children's Convalescent Home, is  supervised  by

the  Minister  for Health. This, home is  to  provide

convalescence to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



children  who  have  suffered from T.B.,  meningitis,

rheumatism and other types of disease for a period of

three  to  six months. The other sub-head deals  with

case-work  for the prevention of cruelty to  children

and   the   promotion  of  welfare  of  children   in

Singapore. This is an important part of the  work  of

the  Protector under the Children and Young  Persons'

Ordinance, and the expenditure is supervised  by  the

Social  Welfare Department of the Ministry of  Labour

and Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I accept that statement, Sir. But if the

Minister will be good enough to look at sub-head  12,

that  is,  the Children's Society Convalescent  Home,

$1,310 - is  that  the Children's Society  Convalescent

Home  which he has mentioned in connection  with  sub

head 18? If so, it seems to get another allocation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the item in

respect of sub-head 12 is a contribution towards  the

supply of full-cream powdered milk to children of the

Home,  whereas the item in sub-head 18 is in relation

to the Government subsidy given to that hospital. The

Singapore   children's   Society   runs   a    24-bed

convalescent home on the basis of 50-50  between  the

Government and the Society itself. Sub-head 18 is  in

relation to the dollar-for-dollar maintenance for the

home,  whereas sub-head 12 is for the supply of  milk

powder.

posts have been abolished probably in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



view  of an economy drive. Could I have clarification

on this matter from the Minister for Finance?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this has a

rather  long history. In 1954, the Organisations  and

Methods   consultants  employed  by  the   Government

recommended  a change in the staffing of the  Customs

Department.  They  thought  that  it  would   be   an

advantage to the efficiency of revenue collection  if

revenue  officers  were replaced by customs  officers

with  higher  qualifications at  the  rate  of  three

revenue  officers for one customs officer.  This  has

been  going on for some time. Eventually it is  aimed

to  reach a total strength of 304 revenue officers so

that  105  revenue officers will be  replaced  by  34

customs  officers. The strength,  at  that  time,  of

revenue  officers  was  more than  400.  The  present

strength is 325 as a result of the abolition of these

posts,  which  is  taking  place  gradually  as   the

incumbents   retire,   or  are   promoted,   or   are

continuing in next year's Estimates, and it looks  as

if  we are soon approaching the figure recommended by

the Organisations and Methods consultants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 9.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a point of information, Sir, I see that this

grant to the Senior Officers' Mess appears under Head

33;  and if the Minister will be good enough to  turn

to  page 279 of the Estimates, he will see a grant to

Police Officers' Mess under Head 31- Contributions and

Charitable Allowances. Is there any particular reason

why this should appear here and not in the other?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There is a reason, Sir, In the

case of the grant to the Police Officers' Mess, it is

paid  outright,  but  in  the  case  of  the  customs

officers,   it   is   made  on  a   dollar-for-dollar

contribution, and we thought it best that the Customs

Department administer this vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 36-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (42) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to enquire from the Minister for Finance as

to   the   respective   functions   of   the   Deputy

Commissioner and of the Chief Assessor.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, because of the

integration  of  the  City Council  with  Government,

local  rates  will  have to be  replaced  by  central

Government  tax. To this end, the Property  Tax  Bill

has  been  introduced and the property  tax  will  be

administered  by  a  branch  of  the  Inland  Revenue

Department.   The  branch  will  be  known   as   the

Assessment   Branch  and  it  will   be   under   the

administrative control of the Deputy Commissioner  of

Inland Revenue, Grade G. The Deputy Commissioner will

have  a Chief Assessor and six Assessors to help  him

on the technical side. The setup of this organisation

is  based  on the recommendations made by a  team  of

experts on local government sent to Singapore by  the

Canadian Government, and takes into account the acute

shortage of valuers and assessors in Singapore today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am still not

clear about the duties to be discharged by these  two

persons.   Most  of  the  technical  departments   in

Singapore  are  headed by experts in the  field:  for

instance,  the  P.W.D. is headed by an engineer;  the

Accountant-General's  Department  is  headed  by   an

accountant;  the Planning Department is headed  by  a

qualified  planner;  and  the  Survey  Department  is

headed by a qualified surveyor; and so it goes on.  I

cannot understand the principle which underlies  this

appointment. Why is it necessary to have a person who

is  to  be  the administrative head of the department

under  a  person who is to be the technical head  of

the department?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think I could best elucidate

by  reading  some  extracts from the  Report  of  the

Working   Party  on  the  integration  of  the   City

Assessment  Office into the Government. This  Working

Party consisted of the following officers:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Permanent Secretary (Treasury), as the

Chairman



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Comptroller of Income Tax



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting City Assessor



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Valuer and Assessor, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Organisations and Methods Branch

of the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is proposed that the Commissioner of Inland

Revenue,  Grade  D,  should  be  in  charge  of   two

branches. In the Income Tax, Estate and Stamp  Duties

Branch,   he   will  continue  to   have   a   Deputy

Commissioner who will be in charge of the Income  Tax

Office  and an Assistant Commissioner to be in charge

of both the Estate Duty and the Stamp Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other Valuation Branch, there should also be

a   Deputy  Commissioner,  Grade  G.  This  grade  is

suggested  so  that  there would  be  parity  in  the

deputyship  of the two branches. The duties  of  this

post  have been carefully considered by the Committee

and it is considered that his requirements should  be

administrative ability and experience since he  would

be  assisted in technical matters by both  the  Chief

Valuer  and the Chief Assessor. While it is desirable

that  he  should  have  some  knowledge  relating  to

valuation and assessment, it is however thought  that

it  would  not  be necessary to have a professionally

qualified  man for this purpose. It is considered  by

the Committee that both the posts of Chief Valuer and

Chief  Assessor should be on the upper time-scale  so

as to be in line with their counterparts in the other

branch. These posts are technical posts and require a

high standard of qualification and experience and  on

that  account  there  are difficulties  envisaged  as

these   officers  fetch  a  special  price   in   the

circumstances   existing  in  Singapore.   It   would

therefore be necessary to consider special terms that

can  be  offered  to attract suitable  candidates  to

carry on the duties for the next few years.'



<br><br>The Report goes on to describe salary scales, and  so

on, which are quite irrelevant here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish

to  put  it  to  the  Minister  that  many  of  these

recommendations - which  I have read  myself - are  meant

for the purpose of fixing up certain things. However,

let   us   assume   that   the  recommendations   are

acceptable.  Could  the  Minister  inform  the  House

whether there is any person to fill this post and, if

there is, whether he is in an acting capacity or in a

substantive  appointment - that  is,  whether   he   is

holding   a  post  on  a  temporary  or  a  permanent

basis - and also whether such an appointment has passed

through the Public Service Commission?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The post of Deputy Commissioner,

Inland  Revenue Department, Grade G, was circularised

to  all Government departments and advertised in the

Press in July. The applications were submitted in the

usual  manner  through the official channels  to  the

Public   Service   Commission  which   has   made   a

substantive appointment to this post.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

enlightened  to  hear that the post was  circularised

and  advertised  in  July. But from  a  look  at  the

Establishment  list dated 1st June,  1960,  I  notice

that  this  person was appointed to  that  particular

post  on  the 24th May, 1960. I wonder if  there  has

been any printing error.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, it could have been

that he was acting in that post. But since I have not

had  sight of that particular document, I am not able

to  say  so for certain. But the date of the circular

calling for applications was 1st July, 1960.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come to

the  principle that I have been trying to  drive  at.

Many  posts were first filled in a temporary capacity

for  a certain period of time in order to by-pass the

findings of the Public Service Commission. This is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether

that  principle arises on this particular  item.  The

principle, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



imagine,  would  apply  to  several  appointments  in

several  Ministries. I am just wondering whether  the

hon.  Member for Hong Lim could satisfy me  that  that

principle arises particularly in this item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am referring

to   the   principle  in  general  applied   to   all

Ministries, and this, in particular, is  one  of  the

applications of that principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that prior to being transferred to this

position,  this particular officer was paid  a  basic

salary  of $995. According to the Budget in front  of

us, this present holder; if appointed, will be paid a

salary of $1,520, which means an increase of a  basic

salary  of  $525.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this  particular

officer  was  previously in the Land Service  scheme.

And  the  reason  why he was not  promoted  there  is

something  which I do not understand. In my  opinion,

there  is  nothing, as far as I know, to  merit  this

transfer  other than the fact that he is the brother-

in-law of the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Hong Lim

has    been   informed   in   no   uncertain    terms

[Interruption] - Order.  The  hon.  Member   has   been

informed in no uncertain terms that I am against  any

personalities in this particular debate.  That  final

remark  is  completely irrelevant to the  issue,  and

ought  not  to have been mentioned by any  Member  in

view of my ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I rise on a point of

clarification? I am obliged to you for  that  ruling,

Sir.  But,  of course, as you know, I have  explained

that   the  purpose  of  making  that  remark  in   a

privileged  Chamber  is to get it  published  in  the

Press, as it has already been said. I have called the

Member a lot of names, and I am going to call  him  a

lot more names outside. And I say this: if he has not

got  the  courage to say that outside, then, Sir,  at

the  next  sitting of this Assembly I  shall  move  a

motion  against his personal conduct. When that  time

comes, let me assure him that my public conduct bears

looking into - that is why I am here - including also the

appointment of this officer who was removed from  the

Land Office because he was not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



promoted  by the Public Service Commission.  But  the

Member's  private  conduct,  on  a  personal   motion

against   him,   does   not   bear   looking   into - a

multiplicity of wives and nefarious conduct-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister has

made  his  point. I do not know whether the  Minister

for  Finance  would like to reply to the  Member  for

Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

said enough in the course of this debate to show that

this  appointment was made on principles  recommended

by  experts,  who  were  sent  from  Canada  at  some

expense.  Bearing  in mind the circumstances  in  the

staff    recruiting   position,   that   was    their

recommendation.  The  actual  appointment  was   made

strictly  according  to  the  Constitution  governing

appointments to the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Hong Lim had any decency, he

would  repeat  that last phrase of his  outside  this

Chamber  where  he does not enjoy immunity  from  the

laws of libel and slander. If he does not-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not pursue that line of

thought.  I  should imagine as much of  the  question

asked  by the Member for Hong Lim as is relevant  has

been  answered, that is, the appointment was made  by

the Public Service Commission. If the hon. Member was

dissatisfied  with that appointment, he  should  have

attacked  the Public Service Commission, and  nothing

more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw

the attention of the Government to the fact that such

appointments  must first be advertised  before  being

considered by the Public Service Commission. I am not

going   into  the  personal  capacity  of  the  Prime

Minister. I am only touching on official functions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You got the blue funk!

outside!

the persons on the Government Benches.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am not interested in the

Member  for  Hong Lim's opinion in that  matter.  The

Prime  Minister has already indicated  that  he  will

bring  that  matter up, if necessary, in  the  proper

manner  under the Standing Orders. We are now at  the

moment  on  item (42) of sub-head I of  Head  36.  If

there is any other Member who wishes to speak on  the

principle of that item, he may do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the, name of Mr A.

P. Rajah-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of sub-head 22.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am not moving, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Perhaps I should explain why I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Strictly, that is against Standing

Orders.  Perhaps  the  Member  will  move  and   then

withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of sub-head 22.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I gave notice of this

amendment, I had not sighted the Property  Tax  Bill.

Under  the Property Tax Bill, allowances are  payable

to  Members  of the Assessment Appeals Committee.  In

view of that, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to be

allocated for Head 36 be reduced by $10 in respect of

to say?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of sub-head 1.

incumbent, I take it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

Budget   debate   last  year,   we   criticised   the

appointment of Political Secretaries in a  number  of

Ministries, including the Ministry of Labour and Law.

One  year  has now passed, and the Minister therefore

will  be  able  to  tell us from his experience  what

usefulness he has derived from the appointment of  an

officer to this post. During the debate -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has not moved.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (3) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to repeat what I said just

now,  and I hope that will be on record. I would  ask

the  Minister to tell us in what way he has found the

usefulness of such a post in his Ministry. He has had

more  than one year of experience of having  such  an

officer in his Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate during the past few days, Sir, the

Prime  Minister has defended his Political Secretary,

and  yesterday  the  Minister  for  Finance  made  an

attempt  to defend his Political Secretary,  although

he  admitted that he did not see eye to eye with  his

Political  Secretary. He did not deny that  he  never

saw  his Political Secretary face to face. Would  the

Minister for Labour and Law please inform



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>

been of use to him and to the country?

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, you will

particular officer. That being the case,  I  did  not

take part in that debate.



understood  the  debate on this particular  gentleman

was quite lengthy. I was unaware of the fact that the

Member for Cairnhill was not present.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry, Sir, but I was

<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not like to

have said anything on this matter, but in view of the

personal  attack that has been made against a  friend

and  a  colleague, I think it is my duty now to state

in  this  House that Mr Fong Swee Suan has  been  of

great  service to me in the Ministry for  the  period

that he has been with me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



He has helped me and the Ministry a great deal in the

conciliation  work that has had to  be  done  in  the

Ministry.  Through his efforts we have been  able  to

get a number of very difficult disputes settled. I am

indeed very grateful to him for the services that  he

has  rendered  to  the Ministry. It  is  unfortunate,

however,  that  we  struck  a  discordant  note.   We

disagreed  on  certain points. I do  not  propose  to

touch  on that here in this House. All that  was  the

subject  of correspondence between him and the  Prime

Minister,  and that correspondence has  already  been

published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret that the Members of the

Opposition have found it fit in this House  to  thumb

their  way  through  the Estimates  and  to  try  and

ridicule  both Mr Lim Chin Siong and Mr  Fong  Swee

Suan.  They have tried to suggest that it  is  beyond

the  capacity of both Mr Lim Chin Siong and Mr Fong

Swee   Suan  to  understand  the  workings   of   the

Government and the technical work that is done in the

technical departments which are within the portfolios

of  the  Minister  for Finance and the  Deputy  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not within the competence of

any administrative officer or any political person in

charge  of  Ministries  to  be  concerned  with   the

technical   work   that  goes  on  in   the   various

departments   that  are  attached  to   the   various

Ministries. Government does employ technical  experts

to  advise  it as far as the work of these  technical

departments is concerned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I try and channel this

debate,  otherwise we might be going  back  over  the

ground  that has already been covered? At the moment,

the  motion  is  in respect of an incumbent  of  this

particular post, namely, Mr Fong Swee Suan, and  the

question  asked, I think, of the Minister is  whether

that  particular incumbent was of any use to  him.  I

think  the  Minister  has answered  that  point  very

fully.  Let  us not go back to the debate  that  took

place  on Saturday as to the requirement of technical

qualifications and so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to answer only

one  point.  In trying to ridicule my colleague,  the

Opposition Members have tried to suggest that  he  is

of  no  use whatsoever in the Ministry of the  Deputy

Prime Minister, and that he serves no useful function

there.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. My recollection of the debate

is  that,  I think, that matter was touched  on  very

fully  in the original debate which arose out of  the

motion by the Member for Mountbatten. I do not  think

it is proper to go back to that aspect of the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, then the short answer

to the question that has been asked by the Member for

Cairnhill  is  that Mr Fong Swee Suan  had  been  of

great service to me whilst he was in my Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, to suggest that I levelled a

personal attack just now is not right. I did  not.  I

was  just  asking the Minister for  his  view  as  to

whether   or  not  the  man  who  was  his  Political

Secretary had been of use to him. He has replied, but

unfortunately.  Sir, what he says in his  reply  does

not  bear  out  the reply of the Prime Minister  when

this  particular Political Secretary was  debated  in

this  House  as a Political Secretary to  the  Deputy

Prime Minister's Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I had not intended to enter into this

debate. But since the Minister for Labour and Law has

said that disparaging remarks were made about the two

gentlemen,  and  since I was one  of  the  Opposition

Members who took part in this debate, let me make  my

position  quite  clear. Mr Speaker,  I  intended  no

insult or disrespect to these two officers In fact, I

made  it quite clear that in their field in Singapore

there were none better. I made that point quite clear

when  I  started.  The  only question  I  raised  was

whether  they could be of any particular use  to  the

particular  Ministries to which they  were  going;  I

asked  the  Deputy Prime Minister those questions  to

which I thought, Sir, I got no satisfactory reply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



So  far  as  these  two gentlemen are  concerned,  no

disrespect to them was intended by me. In their field

I can say that there is none better in Singapore. But

surely  the  Minister will also concede that  outside

their field they cannot be of any particular use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that arises on this post is this.

Now  that  the gentleman who held this post has  been

transferred, does  the Minister  intend  to  appoint

somebody else to this post?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, remarks have been made

that   were   derogatory  and   disparaging   to   my

colleagues. I have had occasion to discuss  with  Mr

Lim  Chin  Siong  a  very tricky  question  involving

income tax, and its effects on the contributions made

to   the   Central   Provident  Fund.   Through   his

association in the Ministry, I could see that he  had

picked up quite a lot of the work, and he made a very

intelligent  contribution to the discussions.  So  it

does  not  follow  that, because a  man  is  a  trade

unionist  and  because he has not had the  advantages

that Mr A. P. Rajah has, he has not a good brain.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes. The Member for Farrer Park. If they

are given the opportunity, they are able to study the

work  in  Government departments, to  appreciate  the

problems that arise in the course of the work, and to

make  a  contribution. It would be  quite  unfair  to

suggest,  as  the  Opposition  has  suggested,   that

because these men are good in the trade union  field,

they  are  not  necessarily good elsewhere.  I  mean,

events have shown-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have allowed the Minister to

carry on up to a point. But it appears to me that  he

is  going back on the debate. I would ask him now  to

come  straight to the point, which is really the post

now  vacant.  The  question that has  been  asked  is

whether  the post is to be filled. If it  amounts  to

leading   to  the  supposition  that  one  of   these

gentlemen  will  come  back to  the  Hon.  Minister's

Ministry, then perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



it  is  relevant. I do not know. I leave  it  to  the

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, efforts will be made to

have  this appointment filled in the course  of  next

year.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I now come to the memorandum

that  the Minister for Finance sent to the T.U.C.  It

is  a memorandum sent to the workers' organisation to

seek  their  views. The Minister for Labour  and  Law

had,  at  that  time, a Political Secretary  who  is,

shall  we say, a senior trade unionist. I would  like

to  ask him whether this senior trade unionist,  this

Political  Secretary of his, had been  consulted,  or

whether his Ministry had been consulted, before  such

a  memorandum was sent out to the T.U.C. My point  is

this,  Sir, If the Government has appointed a  number

of  Political  Secretaries who  are  excellent  trade

unionists  and who are also Assistant Secretaries  in

the  T.U.C.,  then  they,  as Political  Secretaries,

could  have  advised  the Government  first,  without

their  having  to go to the T.U.C. and reply  to  the

Government on the memorandum on which they should, in

the first instance, have been consulted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is not the Member for

Cairnhill  then going back to the general  debate?  I

think the Member should assist the Chair by trying to

confine  himself  to this particular office,  because

the   general   principles  relating   to   Political

Secretaries, I think, have been sufficiently debated.

My  difficulty is to draw a line somewhere. I do  not

know whether the Member for Cairnhill can relate  his

remarks   to  this  particular  post  and   to   this

particular individual.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I think I can, but I would

not like to do it here because I am now beginning  to

think  that  what the Prime Minister said  was  quite

right.  It is better to leave a lot of things unsaid.

But I would like to say this, Sir. The stand taken by

the  Minister  for Labour and Law in regard  to  this

particular appointment is totally not the same as the

stand taken by the Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is completely

untrue.  I have been asked questions about  Mr  Fong

Swee  Suan. I have been asked to say whether  I  have

found him to be of any service during the year and  a

half  that  he  had  been with me,  and  I  say  that

definitely he had been of great service to me. On the

other  question  as to why it was necessary  for  the

exchange  of letters between the Government  and  the

T.U.C.,  it  must  be  remembered  that  there  is  a

permanent secretariat of the T.U.C., and there are  a

lot  of  unions associated with the T.U.C. Government

found  it  necessary to bring this subject  of  wages

into the open, and the only way we could do it was by

an   exchange   of  letters  between  the   permanent

secretariat  and the Government. There  are  so  many

unions  which  are involved, and the  T.U.C. has  to

consult the views of these unions. That is one way by

which  we  could bring this whole question  into  the

open. That is why we resorted to that procedure.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have said so

much  and  yet have not said enough. May I leave  the

rest unsaid, and beg leave to withdraw the motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 he reduced

by $10 in respect of item (4) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is it intended to have only one

Industrial Liaison Officer or more for the year 1961,

and  whether any Industrial Liaison Officer  has  now

been appointed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of my

work.  I  have found that because I am not conversant

with  Mandarin, it is very necessary  for  me  to  be

assisted by someone who is good in Mandarin  and  who

is  also well acquainted with industrial matters. For

that  reason,  as a matter of urgency, I  have  asked

that the services of a suitable person be engaged  to

assist me in this work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is proposed that one post

should  be  created for next year, and it depends  on

the  amount  of  work  that is to  be  done.  If  the

pressure is increased, it would be necessary  for  us

to  seek  provision for an additional post.  That  is

absolutely necessary. But meanwhile it is proposed to

enter  provision  for  one such  appointment  in  the

Estimates for next year. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

important  that  the person who fills  this  post  is

acceptable  to the Minister and can get on  with  the

Minister,  particularly in this type of work.  It  is

for  that reason that we have looked around and  have

found somebody to do this work. He has been assisting

me for sometime, and he is being paid from some other

vote  in  the meanwhile. It is proposed to regularise

the  whole position by entering a provision for  this

post in the Estimates for next year.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would appear

from   the  Minister's  reply  that  this  Industrial

Liaison   Officer  is  another  kind   of   political

appointment,  and  that it has not gone  through  the

P.S.C. Am I right?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not intended that

it  should be a political appointment in the same way

as  the post of Political Secretary would be.  It  is

intended  that the officer should be a civil servant.

But  it  is  necessary that he does have considerable

experience  in  this type of work.  It  is  for  that

reason  that, at the time - when there was  a  lot  of

work to be done and we were not able to do without an

officer, we had to look around and get an officer  to

fill this post.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister now says that it

is  going  to be a civil servant. If so, he  has  not

disclosed whether he has gone through the P.S.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is permitted under

the constitution for any person to be recruited to  a

post  in a temporary capacity. In this case, however,

there  was no post. It is possible later to  put  the

application  for  this  appointment  to  the   Public

Service   Commission,  and  ask  the  Public  Service

Commission to support the action taken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But the answer given to me by the

Minister  for  Finance when I touched on  the  Public

Service    Commission   was   that   even   temporary

appointments   went   through  the   Public   Service

Commission.  It  is  now  disclosed  that  one   such

temporary appointment has not gone through the Public

Service Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is perfectly

permissible under the present practice for an officer

to be recruited and placed in a temporary appointment

until  the  whole matter has been considered  by  the

Public Service Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is nothing in

the  Estimates here to indicate that this post  is  a

temporary post. Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will look at

page  320  of  the  Budget, i.e. under  Industrial

Arbitration  Court - Temporary Staff:  - President,  the

Estimates  most categorically say that the  President

is  temporary  staff. This other one  gives  one  the

impression  that it is permanent staff. I  think  the

Minister would like to think up something else.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think wherever posts

are  shown  with  an asterisk they are  temporary.  I

think  that  is  the  practice  with  regard  to  the

preparation of the Estimates. Mr Speaker. Sir, after

page 32, in the notes on Expenditure, it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The printing of an appointment in ordinary type

generally indicates pensionable status, but must  not

be   regarded   as   conveying  authority   for   its

pensionable status. Non-pensionable appointments  are

shown in Italics.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the procedure with regard to the preparation

of the Estimates. It is not intended that this should

be a pensionable and permanent post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, am I to understand then that any

post that is not pensionable is a temporary post? The

Minister gave me to understand that because  this  is

in  italics  it is not pensionable and  therefore,  I

think, he asked me to infer that is was temporary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the preparation

of  the Estimates, even if there are posts which are

non-pensionable, it is possible for  officers  to  be

recruited to them in a temporary capacity.  That  can

always  be  done. It a post is shown in the Estimates

under  personal emoluments, it is always  permissible

for  a  person to be recruited against that provision

in a temporary capacity before the appointment is put

to  the Public Service Commission. That has been  the

practice for quite a long time, as far as I know.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, should not the job of

industrial relations be one of the first duties of  a

Political  Secretary? To have a  Political  Secretary

and  an Industrial Relations Officer is just spending

public  funds  without getting  value  for  money.  A

Political  Secretary should, of course,  be  able  to

advise the Minister on industrial relations. There is

no  need to create an appointment to do a job  which

should be done by the Political Secretary, unless, of

course,  the  Minister now feels  that  there  is  no

chance  or  desire on his part to fill  the  post  of

Political Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that the

work  of an Industrial Liaison Officer would be in  a

more   limited  field  than  that  of   a   Political

Secretary.  He would actually be required  to  assist

the  Minister  in  the  work of conciliation  in  the

Ministry. In the Industrial Relations Ordinance it is

provided   that   there   are   various   stages   of

conciliation. The parties get together;  they  cannot

agree;   they  go  to  the  Commissioner;  from   the

Commissioner to the Parliamentary Secretary, and then

to  the  Minister. It is the function of this Officer

to assist the Minister in this work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, as I understand the Industrial

Relations Ordinance, there are a number of officers

created there called Industrial Relations Officers,

who are statutory officers. On page 320, Mr Speaker,

Sir, you will find in item (7) of sub-head 24, Fees

for Industrial Relations Officers, on which I have

raised a motion, and I will deal with it at a later



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



stage.  These  men  are  the statutory  officers.  An

Industrial  Relations  Officer  is  not  a  statutory

officer  under  the  Industrial Relations  Ordinance,

but, I take it, some officer has been created by  the

Minister  in  order  to liaise  between  himself  and

either the disputants in trade disputes or some  such

thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have no Industrial

Relations Officers but we have conciliation  officers

in  the  Ministry.  They  are  provided  for  in  the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance. They have  functions

to  perform. They get the parties together and try to

conciliate. If they fail, they pass the parties  over

to  the  Commissioner for Labour. We  have  different

stages  in this work of conciliation. The parties  go

through  these  various stages until they  reach  the

Minister.  So  this Industrial Liaison  Officer  will

come  in  at the stage where the matters have reached

the Minister. The conciliation officers we employ are

the people who meet the parties early in the dispute.

This  particular official will only come in when  the

dispute has reached the final stage, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, from my personal experience

of  how a Budget is made up, I would like to draw the

attention  of the Minister to the fact that,  if  the

Industrial  Liaison Officer is not to be a  political

appointment,  then  it  should  not  have  been   put

immediately after the. Political Secretary. It should

have been classed either as a Division I officer or a

Division  II  officer after the Permanent  Secretary.

The  fact  that he has put it immediately  after  the

Political  Secretary and in this particular  grouping

gives  us  the impression that it is going  to  be  a

political appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, this is how the Treasury has put

it.  However,  there  is a need for  an  official  to

fulfil  these functions, and it has been put in  this

way because he works very closely to the Minister. In

fact, he shares the same room as the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Cairnhill

has  raised a really valid point. As I understand the

Budget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



throughout, all political appointments come under the

Minister  for  Labour  and Law,  and  all  the  civil

service   appointments  come  under   the   Permanent

Secretary-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> After.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> -come after the Permanent Secretary.

When  I  said "under" I meant after, Sir. So  on  the

face  of  it. Mr Speaker, Sir, it would appear  that

the   Industrial  Liaison  Officer  is  a   political

appointment in the sense that the. Minister  is,  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  is,   and   the   Personal

Secretary (Political) is. Now the Minister tells  us

that it is a civil service appointment. The post  has

been  created  and an appointment has been  made.  He

also tells the House that it is proposed to seek  the

permission of the Public Service Commission - did the

Minister say to confirm or to appoint?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> To appoint.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Now, if it is to appoint, then I take

it,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, that the normal  methods  of

appointment  will be followed in this  case  with  an

advertisement  and that sort of thing.  So  we  again

come  to  this  basic point of temporary appointments

which  is  now involved in this appointment  where  a

person   has  been  recruited  to  the  post  without

advertisement or circulation, and has worked with the

Minister   for  some  time;  and  when  the  Minister

certifies  that  he  is a good  officer,  capable  of

carrying out the duties of the post, what then is the

position of the Public Service Commission?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was no such post

and  the provision for this post has been entered  in

these  Estimates. There was a need for this  service.

There was a need to get somebody suitable to do  this

work, to help out in a time of real need, and we have

been  able  to  get somebody to assist me.  For  that

reason, this post has been created. The usual routine

will  be  gone through, and the post circularized  in

the usual way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no desire to try and

keep this post within the grouping of the Ministerial

set-up of my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



Ministry. I would have no objection actually to  this

post being shown after the Permanent Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a matter which the Estimates

Committee could possibly look into as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hesitated

to  add  further clarification to this  until  I  had

confirmation from the Minister for Finance.  I  think

the  Establishment's reason for putting it under that

particular heading immediately after the Minister  is

because  this post is newly created. Whether it  will

become  a permanent feature of the Establishment  has

yet  to be decided, if it becomes a permanent feature

of  the Establishment, then it will go below all  the

other  permanent officials underneath  the  Permanent

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new post and not a political appointment.

How  it  works  out will depend upon  very  much  the

usefulness  of the man appointed to the Minister.  If

the post becomes an establishment post, then it moves

below the Permanent Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I would like to point out

that in the case of other appointments which are  not

political  (new appointments created which  have  not

been  classified  by  the Government  as  posts  that

should  remain on the Establishment), they have  been

classified   elsewhere  as  Other   Charges   Special

Expenditure.  The  fact that the post  of  Industrial

Liaison   Officer  comes  in  here  gives   one   the

impression  that it is going to be a political  post.

But  since  a lot of explanation has been  given,  we

accept,  the explanation and the assurance  given  by

the Minister that this post will go to the P.S.C. But

I cannot help expressing my view, Sir, as to what the

Minister said just now. He said that he had got a man

to  do  the job and that was why this post had to  be

created.  I would like to point out that you  do  not

create  a  post for a man, but you create a post  and

find a man.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is what was done. The need did

arise,  Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained before.

We had to get somebody to do this work. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>









was  a job to be done. We had to seek somebody to  do

that  job.  That is how we do things.  We  do  things

intelligently, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> We shall see whether we can be

intelligent about this one. The Minister  for  Labour

and Law informed the House - I only mention it, Sir, in

order that I might use that in this argument which  I

am  now going to advance - that the function which  Mr

Fong Swee Suan performed for him was very useful.  It

was to intervene in and settle strikes. That was what

the  Minister informed the House. It seems to me that

the  purpose for the Industrial Relations Officer  is

also some such purpose - to settle industrial disputes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is Industrial Liaison Officer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Minister said that when the matter

could not be settled and a trade dispute was about to

arise, then the Liaison Officer came into the picture

and  assisted  him in settling it or bringing  it  to

some  conclusion.  That  was what  I  understood  the

Minister  to  say. If that is correct,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  myself  can  see no difference  between  the

functions of an Industrial Liaison Officer and  those

of  the  Persona Secretary (Political) as set out  by

the  Minister for Labour and Law himself. In view  of

the circumstances, would the Minister say that if  he

has one of these posts he will be satisfied?



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, it is quite easy to know that the

functions  of  a  Political  Secretary  are  entirely

different   from  those  of  an  Industrial   Liaison

Officer. It is intended that this Industrial  Liaison

Officer  will provide a service which is provided  by

the  civil  service.  The functions  of  a  Political

Secretary  have been explained to this House  by  the

Prime  Minister, and I do not propose to add to  what

he  has  already  said on so many  occasions.  It  is

intended that this officer should assist the Minister

when a dispute reaches its final stage before it goes

to the Industrial Arbitration Court.

building  agricultural roads in that  area  and  they

will  be draining the area as well and also extending

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> -and from that camp, the members of the

Brigade  are  building a link road  between  the  new

estate at, Queenstown and Holland Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it will be correct to say that they are

working on national construction schemes and, at  the

same time, we are training them in useful trades.  We

have  been in contact with the Polytechnic and,  with

its  assistance,  we will be establishing  next  year

training schemes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



in  various trades for all members of the Brigade who

are  interested. Those training schemes will be based

at Kolam Ayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, I have given the information which the

Member for Mountbatten has asked for.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my

colleague  the Minister for Labour and Law has  asked

me  whether I can confirm that the appointment of the

Director, Work Brigade, was made by the P.S.C.  I  so

confirm.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Work Brigade started as

a  sort  of  scheme to provide relief  work  for  the

unemployed.   That  was  started  by  the   previous

Government when the workers in the Brigade were  paid

at the rate of $3 a day with free sugar and rice. But

now  they are paid only $2 a day with food, and  they

sleep  outside  where they have extra  activities  at

night. What the Minister for Labour has told us  just

now  clearly  shows  that these people  are  used  on

specific projects of the Government, and if they  are

specific  projects and not relief works, surely  they

must be paid a more decent wage. This is not the  way

to get cheap labour, if it is relief work, I agree to

giving  them some money and asking them to  till  the

ground. But when they are actually put on projects of

the  Government,  such as the ones  outlined  by  the

Minister, I submit that a wage of $2 a day with  food

is   lower  than  what  is  paid  outside,  and   the

Government  should not make use of these  people  who

join  the Work Brigade to form a sort of slave labour

camp.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is utter

balderdash.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The   Chairman  (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b>  Order.  The  word

"balderdash"  is  unparliamentary, and  the  Minister

ought to withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is with great regret that I have to

withdraw it because it is unparliamentary. It is well

deserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill knows that we do not go in

for organising slave labour camps. Have you ever been

to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



camp?  At any time if the Opposition Members wish  to

come  with  me  to  see  any of these  "slave  labour

camps",  they  will see that the workers  live  under

excellent  conditions and in excellent  surroundings.

Camps costing a lot of money have been built and  the

workers are accommodated there under conditions which

many  of  them  do  not  have  in  their  own  homes.

Everything  is  well disciplined and well  organised.

The  food  is  good. The accommodation is  good.  The

workers  are  paid  an  allowance  of  $2  a  day.  A

directive  has  been  issued  by  the  Minister  for

Finance that all those who are in future recruited to

posts  in  Division IV of the Government  service  or

equivalent  jobs in quasi-Government bodies  will  be

recruited from the Work Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not like the previous Government. They

employed  a work force and I had to wind it  up.  The

only  thing that the workers had to do - it  was  soul-

destroying - was to changkol a hill. There  is  nothing

more soul-destroying than that. Very little work  was

done.  They  were paid public money  for  doing  such

work.  It was started just as a gimmick for the  last

election. It was my duty to wind up that work  force,

and  with the co-operation of the people we were able

to  set  up the Work Brigade. It is completely untrue

to  say that they are slave labour camps. Come  round

with  me any time, and I will show you that they  are

not slave labour camps.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, it would

appear  that what I have said has got under the  skin

of  the Minister. I did not say that they are slaves.

The  fact that they are paid $2 for definite projects

is  nothing but slave labour, and I repeat it, it  is

nothing but slave labour. No man is paid $2 for doing

definite work on a project useful to the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has thought it fit to touch upon

the relief workers who came into being during my time

of  Government, but I can assure this  House  that  I

never  asked  those workers to go to the  Airport  to

cheer when I returned from Tokyo!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, no members of

the  Brigade were asked to go to the Airport to cheer

me  when  I  returned from Tokyo.  I  was  completely

surprised to see them there. Nobody was asked to, and

I  do not know how they came. But a reference to this

occasion does not get around what was said about  the

Work  Brigade. I can assure you, Sir, that they  work

under  good  conditions and that the  allowance  that

they  get  is adequate. Most of them are  very  young

people. They are being trained in useful trades. They

are  given good conditions until such time when  they

will  be able to get permanent jobs elsewhere, either

in Government service or in quasi-Government bodies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is

absolute rubbish -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Kandasamy): Order. The Minister

is  well  aware that that word ought not to  be  used

here. Will he withdraw it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I so withdraw it. It is sheer

nonsense to say that there is any resemblance between

the  Work Brigade camp and a slave camp. In the  case

of  a slave camp, you go there not out of choice  but

because  you  are packed there and you  are  retained

there  under guard. In the case of the Work  Brigade,

people  go  there out of a free choice. In  fact,  we

have  more applications to join the Brigade  than  we

have the capacity to admit them at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister for Labour and Law, in

drawing  a comparison between our Work Brigade  today

and  the  former relief force forgot to  mention  two

deficiencies  of  the former Chief Minister's  relief

force. The first was that a large number of them were

secret society gangsters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The second was that more than 40

per  cent of the monies spent on those projects  went

into   the   pockets  of  contractors  who   supplied

transport  to  cart  the workers from  town  to  Paya

Lebar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is indeed a wonderful

disclosure;  and the Hon. the Minister  was  at  that

time  working  in  my  Ministry  on  this  particular

project!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr

Kandasamy.  I had nothing to do with this  ridiculous

scheme.  Indeed, if I had, I would have  pointed  out

the  folly  of  the  operation of  the  former  Chief

Minister. In fact, it was his Permanent Secretary who

ran  the whole show, and I had absolutely nothing  to

do with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Kandasamy, this seems to be a matter

for disciplinary action. It appears to me that if the

Minister, when he was a civil servant, did  not  have

regard  for public funds, then I think it is  a  very

serious matter indeed, as the Ministers are dependent

on the civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was the one who gave notice of this

amendment, but it seems to have taken the line I  did

not  intend to take. What I wanted to raise  on  this

matter  is that a sum of $3 million had been provided

under  sub-head  27 "Work Brigade Projects".  What  I

would like te know from the Minister is whether there

has  been careful budgeting. I mean whether the costs

have  been  worked out in detail, both in  regard  to

labour  costs and material costs, and the  sum  which

has  arisen thereby; or whether this $3 million is  a

cock-shy, put in there to see if it is enough. If  it

is  not  enough, we will ask some more; or if  it  is

more than enough, it does not matter, there will be a

surplus.  Is  the  sum worked out on some  calculated

basis, or is it just put in there for the sake  of  a

vote?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is carefully calculated, Mr

Kandasamy. Originally we intended to build it up to a

work  force of some 5,000, but experience  has  shown

that  the  bottleneck here would  be  the  number  of

engineering  staff that you can employ.  That  rather

sets  the limit to the total strength of the Brigade.

The  Organisation and Methods Branch of  my  Ministry

have  gone  through the organisation of  the  Brigade

with great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



care, and they have in the last few months made  far-reaching proposals for strengthening the organisation

and  the  procedures of this Brigade. I am  satisfied

that  the  money  allotted to them will  be  properly

spent and properly accounted for.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, the projects

outlined  by  the  Minister for Labour  and  Law  are

projects  for which votes are being asked  under  the

Development  Estimates. Are they different  from  the

projects that he has made? If they are different, why

should   it  be?  Could  not  the  projects  in   the

Development Estimates be usefully employed  for  this

Work Brigade?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> They are essentially different

projects,  but  in  some cases you do  require  extra

money.  For  instance, for special construction  work

which  cannot be done by the Brigade, or if  you  are

digging  an  irrigation  canal,  then  you   want   a

floodgate, which controls the flow of the tide.  That

part  of  the  work  is rather  skilled,  and  it  is

necessary that such work be done in the normal way by

the P.W.D., i.e. drawing designs, handing out tenders

for construction by contractors, and so forth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The first question is: would it be

possible for the Minister to tell us how much of this

$3  million is for the cost of maintaining  the  Work

Brigade throughout the year 1961? The second question

is:  if the present enrolment of the Work Brigade  is

going  to  be  maintained at this  level  throughout

1961,  is this sum of money sufficient to keep  them

occupied throughout the whole year?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This money will pay for the

daily   allowances,  food,  clothing,   purchase   of

building  materials to construct camps,  purchase  of

simple  tools  for making roads, and  so  on  and  so

forth. It does not include, as I said, money for more

complicated structures which have to be built in  the

usual  way. By far the largest part will go  in  the

way of allowances and payment of food.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, do I understand the Minister to say

that  this is mainly a welfare project and  that  the

work is subsidiary to the welfare project? I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



ask this question. Sir, because if that is not so and

if  the  intention of the Government is to provide  a

number of facilities to the State of Singapore and to

carry  out  certain projects, then I would submit  to

the Government that these projects should be built as

economically  as  possible. The question,  therefore,

that  arises  is  this:  if  the  accent  is  on  the

projects,  then  I  think the  accent  should  be  on

getting  the  job done as economically  as  possible.

From  what the Minister has said, it seems to me that

if   this  $3  million  takes  into  account  capital

expenditure  like constructing and maintaining  camps

and all the subsidiary expenditure which is necessary

to  keep the workers beyond the $2 - housing, beds and

clothes - the   question  then  arises  whether   these

projects are being done as economically as they might

be.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am advised by my technicians,

the  engineers. Mr Kandasamy, that the use of labour

intensive  methods - and that is basically  the  scheme

under  which  the Work Brigade was conceived-will  be

more  expensive than by the normal commercial methods

which  use bulldozers and mechanised methods  with  a

minimum  of labour force. So this is partly  training

for  the  young-building a sense of discipline,  good

living, and nation-building - and partly to create  new

works  useful  to the State. It is a  combination  of

both.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Minister has said that

recruitment to Division IV of the Government  service

is  through  membership of the Work Brigade.  Arising

out  of  this, the question which I wish to raise  is

this:  could the Minister tell us how recruitment  to

the  Work  Brigade is made? Frankly,  Mr  Kandasamy,

there  is  a feeling in town that unless  you  are  a

member of the People's Action Party and you go  round

and  say that you are willing to join the Party,  you

will  never get employment in the Work Brigade. Could

the Minister disabuse the fear of the people in town?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is quite untrue, Mr Speaker, Sir.

As  far as the Work Brigade is concerned, we had  the

duty, first of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



all, of absorbing the Special Squad into the Brigade.

That is the time when my Ministry took over the whole

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no responsibility for the recruitment of the

Special Squad, and I really do not know how they  did

come  in.  We  had  to  offer them  opportunities  of

transfer to the Brigade, and many of them did go into

the  Work Brigade; some left saying they did not wish

to  be  in  the  Brigade.  As  far  as  I  have  been

concerned,  everyone  who joined  after  my  Ministry

became  responsible  for it, was  taken  through  the

Employment  Exchange.  That  is  how  we  did  it.  I

received  many letters from young people saying  that

they were unemployed and that they wanted jobs. And I

sent  them to the Employment Exchange where they were

registered, and they were then employed in  the  Work

Brigade. The present strength is 1,500. So it is  not

true  to say that one must be a member of the  P.A.P.

before one can get employment in the Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am glad of the assurance of the

Minister  for  Labour and Law, and I  hope  that  the

Minister's assurance will get across to the people of

Singapore,  because there really is  a  genuine  fear

that  unless you are a P.A.P. member or were prepared

to  say  that you were going to join the  Party,  you

could  not get into the Brigade. That becomes  doubly

important, Mr Kandasamy, when the present ruling  is

that  unless  you  are a member of  the  Brigade  you

cannot get admission for employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to raise is this. I remember

reading   in   the   Press  somewhere   that   P.A.P.

Assemblymen  are intimately connected with  the  Work

Brigade.  I would like the assurance of the  Minister

that that report is incorrect. And if that report  is

correct, then I would like his assurance that he will

go  into  the matter and see that this Work  Brigade,

which is being maintained on public funds, is not  in

any way controlled by any Assemblyman, be he a P.A.P.

Assemblyman or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> There were some officers in the Brigade,

but they have since resigned. Mr Kandasamy, Sir, the

responsibility for the Work Brigade will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



come under the Ministry of National Development.  For

the  information of the Opposition, the Minister  for

Finance appointed a committee to look into the  whole

organisation  of  the Brigade, and  the  persons  who

looked  into  its  organisation are  members  of  the

Organisation and Methods Branch of the Treasury. They

have advised Government on the way in which the whole

Brigade  ought to be reorganised so that there  is  a

single  chain of command. For the Brigade we  have  a

ministerial committee of three, which is  in  overall

control,  and we have the Director and his staff  who

are  responsible to the ministerial committee for the

organisation  and administration of the  Brigade.  It

has  been  necessary to recruit a full-time  Director

for  the purpose. He is an engineer. Hitherto we  had

been  using  the services of the former  Commissioner

for  Civil  Defence.  The  Organisation  and  Methods

Branch's  recommendation is that the  whole  of  this

work force be placed under the control of a competent

engineer.  This  engineer has since been  engaged.  I

believe, Mr Kandasamy, Sir, that the Brigade is  now

in very good hands.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Kandasamy, Sir, in

regard  to  what  the  Minister for  Labour  and  Law

explained  just  now about the Work Brigade  at  Kaki

Bukit   and  which  has  relation  to  the  electoral

constituents  of  whom I am the  representative,  how

long will the Work Brigade remain there? If they  are

stationed there permanently, will allocations be made

to applications for sites in the Malay settlements?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> They are working at Kaki Bukit on

levelling  a hill and filling up some very low  land.

The  intention  is  to make that low  land  part  and

parcel of the Kaki Bukit Resettlement Scheme. It is a

continuation of that scheme. I really do not know how

long  the  Work  Brigade will  be  working  here.  No

decision  has  been made on how the apportionment  of

the land is to be made until the land is levelled and

the  houses  actually built. That is  a  resettlement

scheme, and it would be within the portfolio  of  the

Minister for National Development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Minister said just now that

there were three Assemblymen who were attached to the

Work  Brigade, or who were in some way connected with

it, and that they have now resigned. But the Minister

let  the matter drop there. Could the House have  his

assurance  that in future the Work Brigade will  come

under  the  control of the civil servants,  and  that

there  will  be no interposing factors - either  P.A.P.

Assemblymen  or some other Assemblymen - between  the

civil servants and the Work Brigade?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Kandasamy, that was the point made

in  the  report -  that the Brigade was  to  be  fully

operational under a single command. That  is  why  we

have the post of Director of the Work Brigade so that

there  will  be  a single chain of command  from  the

ministerial   committee  through  the  Director   and

through  the  various  camp leaders,  i.e. the  camp

commandants. Otherwise it would never be possible for

the Brigade to operate if there are so many people in

command.  It  is  necessary  to  have  one  chain  of

command.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Kandasamy): It is five o'clock.

Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I suspend this sitting now

until 5.30 p.m. Order, order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (30) of sub-head 1."



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister

for Labour and Law might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



have   answered  the  question  which  I  raised   by

implication, but I have not understood  him  to  have

answered  directly. He has told the House that  there

were three P.A.P. Assemblymen who were connected with

the  Work Brigade, and he has informed the House that

they had subsequently resigned. I sought an assurance

from  him that they would not be re-appointed to  the

Work  Brigade and that the civil service  would  look

after  the  Work Brigade in the future. Further  than

quoting  a report, the Minister himself has not  said

whether in future no such appointments will be  made.

Could  the  House be assured that in future  no  such

appointments will be made?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Work Brigade is in

the  process of being reorganised and is being placed

under  the direct charge of the Director of the  Work

Brigade  who  will be responsible to the  Ministerial

Committee. That being so, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  cannot

see how the Member for Farrer Park can have any fears

that Assemblymen will in future be in control of  the

work of the Work Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I have heard it said, Mr Speaker,

Sir - and  I  am going to follow it up - that members  of

the  Work Brigade were, in fact, commanded - I use  the

word expressly "commanded" - by certain Assemblymen. If

that  is  correct,  then it is a  highly  undesirable

state of affairs. The Minister has said that they had

subsequently resigned. All I ask the Minister to  say

is  this - that  in  future  no  Assemblymen,  be  they

P.A.P.,  S.P.A. or  U.M.N.O., be  appointed  to  the

positions  that  these  three  Assemblymen  had  been

appointed in the Brigade. I have also heard  it  said

that   it  was  these  three  Assemblymen  who   were

commanding  the Brigade, and not the civil  servants.

In  fact,  they were getting in the way of the  civil

service to the extent that the whole thing was  about

to collapse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they were referred to

in  the  Press as "Supremo". But their work  was,  in

fact, the work of liaison officers. Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  former Commissioner for Civil Defence was not  a

Chinese-speaking officer. The present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



Director  of  the Work Brigade is fully qualified  in

Chinese. It was necessary, Mr Speaker, Sir, at  that

time  to have proper liaison established between  the

Director  and  the camp commanders, and that  liaison

was   established   through  Assemblymen   who   were

associated  with  the  Work  Brigade.  Now  that  the

Brigade  has  been placed on a proper  organisational

footing, with a Director who is able in every respect

to  command  it, there is no reason why camp  liaison

officers should continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am not satisfied, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of sub-head 24.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Arbitration Court - Temporary staff. Sir,

the  point  I  wish to raise here is similar  to  the

point that I have raised on a previous occasion  with

regard to temporary staff. The Industrial Arbitration

Court  has  come to stay with us. It is part  of  our

system  of  government and way of life. In  view  of

that,  should  the staff who have now  been  employed

there  be  temporary? I am not quite sure  about  the

President - it is a permanent post - and an officer  may

be  held  against  it temporarily.  That  is  another

matter.  Should they all be classed under  "temporary

staff",  like the Registrar? As I understand it,  the

Registrar who has been appointed is a member  of  the

Singapore  judicial service, and possibly  already  a

member of Government service. In view of all that, is

it  right  that the staff should be termed temporary?

Or  is  there a special signifance in the use of  the

phrase  "Temporary  staff" in  connection  with  this

particular subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is intended that

the   Industrial  Arbitration  Court  should   be   a

permanent court, but the Treasury has really  had  no

time  to sort things out. But I can assure the Member

for  Farrer Park that all this will be sorted out  in

next year's Estimates. Furthermore, Mr Speaker, Sir,

this vote has been placed in the wrong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



head   in  the  Estimates.  As  this  Court   is   an

independent  tribunal, I think it should  go  in  the

earlier heads of these Estimates, that is, next after

the  head for "Judicial". All that will be sorted out

in next year's Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the explanation, Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I be given leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



That  the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be  reduced

by $10 in respect of item (7) of sub-head 24.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, item (7) - Fees for Industrial Relations Officers. As I understand it, Industrial Relations

Officers are statutory officers. Are the fees payable

under  the Industrial Arbitration Court, or  are  the

Industrial  Relations Officers paid salaries  by  the

Government? Why should they appear as fees?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, when the Industrial Relations Bill

was  before this Assembly, I mentioned to the Members

of  the House that it was the intention of Government

to  appoint, in addition to conciliation officers who

were  permanent civil servants, Industrial  Relations

Officers  to handle the disputes when they reach  the

arbitration  stage, that is, when  the  disputes  are

actually  before  the  Court.  And  it  has  been  so

provided  in the Industrial Relations Ordinance  that

the Minister has the power to appoint, in addition to

conciliation officers, Industrial Relations Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Industrial Relations Officers

are  set  out  in  this  legislation.  They  are  the

officers  who  will  appear  before  the  Court   and

represent  the  interest of  the  unions  before  the

Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not intended that such

persons  should be career civil servants.  Government

hopes to recruit these officers from practising trade

unionists  who are interested in this type  of  work,

and  who  can  adequately represent the interests  of

trade unions before the Industrial Arbitration Court.

We  have provided this sum in the Estimates to enable

us  to  engage the services of such persons for  this

type of work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a precedent for this

method  of  payment  to  be  found  in  the  head  of

Estimates  dealing with the Public Service Commission

itself,  where you will see that the members  of  the

Commission  are not civil servants. The  Chairman  of

the  Public Service Commission is paid a salary,  and

he  is  not  allowed, if he is in any profession,  to

practise that profession so long as he is Chairman of

the  P.S.C.  The other members of the Commission  are

permitted  to  engage in their usual activities,  and

they receive a retainer, plus a fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on that analogy, it is proposed

that   when  the  services  of  Industrial  Relations

Officers  are required, then those services  will  be

paid  for  by  fees.  There is  a  provision  in  the

Ordinance itself which says that the Minister has the

power  to  appoint persons to be Industrial Relations

Officers.  These  Industrial Relations  Officers  are

public  officers. Mr Speaker, Sir,  this  difficulty

could   be   overcome  by  representing  Government's

proposal to the Public Service Commission, and it  is

possible  for the Commission to appoint  people,  who

are  interested  in this work, temporarily  for  this

type  of  work.  If the occasion does  arise  in  the

future  where officers who have done this work  prove

that  they are in every respect equal to it  and  are

interested in this type of work, then we may create a

post in the civil service for this type of work.  But

we  are not quite sure at this stage. We feel that at

this  stage it would be premature to enter provisions

for posts of Industrial Relations Officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Minister sought to draw an

analogy  between this case and the case  that  exists

for payment of fees in the Public Service Commission.

In  the  case  of the Public Service Commission,  the

Chairman  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  works

permanently and full-time, and he is paid  a  salary.

The members of the Commission who assist him are five

or  six  in  number, and they get a  fee.  The  point

there, Mr Speaker, is that they are doing a job  for

the  State, and the State pays them fees. That is the

position  as  I  understand it in the Public  Service

Commission. The position here, as I understand it, is

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



the  Industrial Relations Officers per, form services

only  for  trade unions who are involved in  a  trade

dispute,  and  as  a result of the  dispute  have  to

present  their case before the Industrial Arbitration

Court.  As  I understand it, these officers  are  not

available to the employer. Now, the position we reach

then,  Mr  Speaker, is that in a dispute between  an

employer  and  an employee, in which the  State  must

hold  the balance equally between the two, the  State

is  providing  money for services to the  unions, it

could  have  been  a  solicitor;  he  may  not  be  a

solicitor; now he is an Industrial Relations Officer.

So  the  State,  which  is  supposed  to  maintain  a

balance,  and  which is supposed to be impartial,  is

providing money in order that the trade unions  might

argue  their case against the employer. The  question

then  arises,  is that a desirable position  for  the

State to take?



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Industrial

Relations  Bill  was  under  consideration  by   this

Assembly,  it was pointed out then that it  was  well

within  the competence and the capacity of  employers

to engage lawyers, who are not practising lawyers, to

represent   their  interest  before  the  Arbitration

Court.  That  is  not possible as far  as  the  trade

unions  are concerned. They have to employ their  own

officials  and  they  are not able  to  pay  for  the

services of practising lawyers. It must be remembered

that the legislation itself does not allow practising

lawyers  to appear before the Arbitration  Court.  It

was  for  that  reason that Government proposed  that

Industrial Relations Officers (they will be recruited

from  the  trade unions and are people in  the  trade

unions who are interested and who have the ability to

do  this  type of work before the Arbitration  Court)

should  be made available to such unions who  do  not

have  their  own paid officials to do  this  type  of

work. I do not think that it is in any way unfair  to

the  employers to so provide. They are able to afford

the services of trained legal brains, who are not  in

practice,  to  assist  them in the  presentation  of

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



cases.  It is nothing but fair that Government should

make  available to the unions persons who are trained

in  these  matters  and  who  come  from  the  unions

themselves  to assist in cases where the unions  have

not  got  the officials to represent them before  the

Industrial Arbitration Court.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the principle that was debated on

this Bill was whether Government should employ public

servants  who  would give of their  services  to  the

trade unions exclusively. That was the principle that

was debated. Perhaps the Minister made out a case;  I

did  not  accept it. But perhaps he made out  a  case

that in the existing circumstances in which the trade

unions  found themselves, some of them needed  advice

and  help, and therefore in the development stage  it

was  essential that a good Government should  provide

them  with  assistance. That was a  point  worthy  of

consideration.  But where the service  is  not  being

provided  by  a  public servant and  where,  in  each

dispute, a particular individual can be appointed and

paid  for, it is quite a different matter altogether.

Mr  X  might  be appointed in a certain dispute.  We

might find that the same Mr X is being appointed  in

all  trade  disputes.  This  is  going  to  become  a

profession for Mr X to appear in all cases of  trade

union  disputes. I know three or four people who  are

not  lawyers  in Singapore who do trade  union  cases

very  well  indeed. It could possibly  be  that  this

$15,360 could be earned by one man and not by several

persons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have myself known of

trade  unionists who are in employment outside.  They

have  given  their  services gratis before  tribunals

dealing  with labour problems. They have had to  take

leave of absence on no pay to enable them to do  this

work.  There  must  be  some  way  by  which  we  can

remunerate  such persons to enable them  to  do  this

work.   Of   course,  all  this  is  still   in   the

experimental stage. We have to wait and  see  how  it

develops,   but  if  the  need  should   arise,   the

Government would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



quite  prepared  to  seek the creation  of  posts  of

Industrial  Relations Officers. But we have  to  wait

and see how things develop.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Can I say a few words, Sir? The

Member for Farrer Park states that a new principle is

involved  because State funds could be spent  in  the

payment  for services of persons. But I do not  think

any  new  principle is being created  by  this  vote,

because in the case of the Legal Aid Bureau, money is

set  aside  for payment for the services of  lawyers;

for  instance, in the case of the Ministry of Health,

some  sums  are available for payment of services  to

private doctors on the basis of sessional fees. There

is no difference as far as I can see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> So far as legal aid is concerned, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, there is a means test, and unless  you

satisfy  that  means test, you do not get  legal  aid

assistance. The principle involved here is this, Sir.

The  Opposition takes the view that the State  is  an

impartial observer. If there is a dispute between  an

employer  and an employee, it is for the two  parties

to get together and settle their differences. If they

cannot,  then  the State says, "We provide  you  with

quasi judicial machinery which will enable you to get

justice." We, as the State, should keep well  outside

it." If the trade unions had been financially strong,

the State would have said to the employees, "No. You

pay  for your own appearances in Court; just  as  the

employers  do." Or if the finances of the  union  had

been  strong, but proper personnel was not  available

to  the union, again there might have been a case for

the  State  employing that personnel and  getting  on

with  the  job. So there seemed to be a case  in  the

first  instance when the Bill was debated. So far  as

the  Opposition  is concerned, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

have  no  objection at this stage if  the  Government

would engage one or two Industrial Relations Officers

who  would  be officers of the State. But  we  rather

object  to  these fees being provided  in  this  way,

which  will  enable the Minister to pick  and  choose

whoever  he  likes, to represent a particular  union.

That, I think, is objectionable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member is shifting

his  ground. In the first instance, he said  that  he

was  afraid that the whole of this amount of  $15,000

might  be paid to an individual. Then one would  have

thought  that  his objection really  is  that  public

money is spent on fees payable to an individual. Then

when  he  rose in reply he said that he  had  another

fear,  namely, that trade unions which are relatively

well  off  will  be able to enjoy this free  service.

That  is another issue. On that, I think the Minister

for   Labour   and  Law  is  capable  of   exercising

discretion.  But I will leave it to my  colleague  to

answer that point. But, as I have said, on his  first

ground,  I  think there are precedents in  Government

practice  for  the  payment of fees  to  persons  for

services performed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, I will have to follow on what the

Prime Minister has said, by pointing out that in  the

legislation itself, it is provided that the right  to

representation  in this case belongs,  in  the  first

instance, to the secretary or a paid official of  the

union. It is only when such persons are not available

that the union can select some other persons who  are

in  the  union  field to represent  them  before  the

Arbitration  Court. When that sort of  representation

is sought, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is only then that the

question of fees arises. I have known from experience

that  many trade unionists who are in employment have

to take leave of absence to appear before a tribunal,

whether  it  is  a court of inquiry or an  industrial

court,  on  a no-pay basis. They are not paid  whilst

they represent the interests of the unions before the

tribunal. It is to compensate such cases that we  are

providing for these fees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to

labour the point. The point I tried to make, briefly,

was  this. There are two issues involved in this. The

first  is  the  question of principle - whether  money

should  be  utilised  by the  State  for  payment  to

particular  persons in order to present the  workers'

case.  There is a principle, and that is an  accepted

right. The House has accepted that principle and that

is agreed. Then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



a  further question arises. The principle having been

accepted, the question is: how is that money which is

to  be voted going to be spent? The Assembly, in  the

first  instance,  understood that these  monies  were

going to be spent on a permanent civil servant.  That

was  what  the Assembly understood then.  The  debate

might  have  taken  an entirely different  turn,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, had not the Minister assured the  House

that   these  officers  would  be  officers  of   the

Government. But now there is a slight twist  to  this

when I asked the Minister whether he would assure the

House  that under the Industrial Relations  Ordinance

there is authority for him to pay in the way of  fees

to  Industrial  Relations Officers.  As  I  read  the

Ordinance,   Industrial   Relations   Officers   were

statutory  officers and, as such, could  be  employed

and  paid  out of public funds. But if they  are  not

going  to  be  public  officers, has  the  Government

authority  to pay these fees under the existing  law?

Mr  Speaker, Sir, you will remember that  under  the

Property Tax Ordinance, a special provision  is  made

for  fees to be paid for the members on that  panel.

But  I cannot remember any sanction in the Industrial

Relations Ordinance which will enable the Minister to

pay  fees to an outsider who is not a member  of  the

Government service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you do not need

legislative sanction to do that. I have just  pointed

out   that   we  have  a  Public  Service  Commission

Ordinance.  We have a Chairman on the Commission  who

is  engaged full-time and who is paid a salary out of

public  funds.  As  I  have pointed  out,  the  other

members of the Commission are not civil servants, and

they are paid retainers and fees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect to

the Minister, that is provided for in that particular

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No. Mr Speaker, Sir, when this Bill was

before  the Assembly, I did point out to the Assembly

why   these   Industrial  Relations   Officers   were

required.  The  work  of  conciliation  can   involve

officials in full-time work. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



have  four  conciliation officers  working  full-time

every day in the Ministry on conciliation work.  This

sort  of  work  arises only when there  are  disputes

before the Arbitration Court and only when the unions

want  it. In very many cases, Sir, the unions appoint

their  own  secretaries to represent them before  the

Arbitration  Court. I think it will  be  a  waste  of

public  money, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we were to create

posts  now for Industrial Relations Officers when  we

really do not know what the future requirements  will

be.  As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

putting it to the test now, and we are experimenting.

If  in  the future we find that there is a volume  of

work required to be done, the Government will be  the

first  to  propose that posts of Industrial Relations

Officers are created.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in this debate it would

appear  that  my  colleague has  lost  sight  of  the

overall  picture. It is definitely the  intention  of

the Government to buy up the trade unions as much  as

possible. That is why they have offered them a  Trade

Union House. Surely, trade unions in this country, if

they  have  that feeling of pride, will  be  able  to

provide a house of their own. Now here the Government

is  going  to  provide fees for Industrial  Relations

Officers who are chosen to represent a union  if  the

union itself does not have men of that calibre in its

pay, or as a full officer. The Minister suggests that

the  people who are appointed or chosen as Industrial

Relations  Officers have sometimes to  forfeit  their

pay  because of their being absent from work. Let  us

tackle  the problem in its correct perspective,  Sir.

How  much  would that amount to even  if  the  person

concerned were to be quite a senior man in  the  job?

It might only amount to $30 a day. To suggest that  a

trade union is not able by itself to find $30, to  be

free  from obligations to the Government, to pay  for

its  own Industrial Relations Officer is to say  that

that  union  is very poor and is in need  of  charity

from the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it shows how much out

of  touch the Member for Cairnhill is with the  trade

unions  generally. There are trade unions who  cannot

afford  to  pay for these services. Take it  from  me

that  this is true. Of course, there are other larger

organisations  which  can  afford  to  employ   well-qualified persons to do this type of work.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by and large, I do not think that the unions

at  present  can afford to pay for such  services  if

they  do not have their own officials to do this type

of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other question of Government providing

a  Trade  Union  House for the  workers.  This  is  a

workers'   Government  and  before  we   became   the

Government,  we  did publish in the  Party  manifesto

that  if we became the Government we would provide  a

Trade Union House for the trade union movement. I see

nothing wrong in that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I do not wish to depart from

the  principle  of  this  particular  amendment,  but

surely  the Government, in view of its present policy

of  weeding out unions of small membership,  has  not

seen  to it that the unions which remain in existence

today  are  unions of at least some good  membership.

Surely, the Minister is not going to suggest  that  a

member  of  a  union cannot afford to  pay  a  dollar

towards  meeting the cost of an Industrial  Relations

Officer. He cannot suggest that. To say that they are

a  workers' Government and therefore they must do all

they  can  for the workers, I would suggest that  the

way  to  do  it  is not to give them  a  sugar-coated

pill - to  give  them a T.U.C. House and tell  them  to

shut up and not to go on strike.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for lack of any

further  arguments,  the Member  for  Cairnhill  just

indulges his whims here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the annual returns of many unions, but

the membership claimed and the subscriptions received



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



bear  no  relation to one another. There  are  unions

which really cannot afford such a service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Labour  and Law mentioned that these fees were  being

provided because the persons who would represent them

were  already in employment and had to give up  their

employment, and that therefore some provision has  to

be  made for the loss of their services in their  own

employment. Could the Minister indicate to the  House

what  he  intends to pay such an Industrial Relations

Officer  should  he  appear for a trade  union,  say,

before  the Industrial Relations Court on  a  dispute

which lasts four days?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have already

provided  in the regulations that, in so far  as  the

panel is concerned, they will be paid at the rate  of

$30  a day, that is, if they are employed a full day.

If  they  are employed half a day, they will be  paid

half  that  amount - $15 a day. That is  quite  a  good

guide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, $15,360 is provided for fees for

Industrial Relations Officers, and it they are to  be

paid  at  the rate of $30 a day, it would  mean  that

there  is going to be a number of trade disputes  in

Singapore for next year!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have no doubt that the Member for

Farrer  Park will look into that item very  carefully

in the Estimates Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We have been warned by the Opposition

that they will never vote us any money unless we make

our  requirements  known  well  in  advance  and  all

expenditure  must  be reasonably foreseen.  For  that

purpose, this sum has been entered in the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Over-estimated!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (7)* has been dealt with.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (7) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be reduced by $10 in

respect of sub-head 27.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 40 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Ministry of Labour and

Law was formed when the Government came into power, I

had  misgivings  whether the Minster for  Law  should

have  with him other departments under his portfolio.

I  was not quite sure whether that principle was  one

which  should be kept intact all the time and whether

there might not be exceptions to that principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government saw fit to join the

Ministries of "Law" and "Labour" together. Sir, it is

my submission that it is highly desirable to keep the

Ministry  of Law as a separate Ministry  and  not  to

have with it other departments of the Government. The

Minister  for  Law  must give the impression  to  the

State of Singapore and to everybody who is interested

in  the maintenance and upholding of the prestige  of

the  law,  that  he  is an independent  and  fearless

Minister  who  will  uphold  the  law,  whatever  the

consequences may be. If that is the correct principle

on which the democratic system, which believes in the

rule  of  law, should be administered, then  I  think

that  principle will be considerably weakened if  the

Minister  for  Law  takes other  departments  of  the

Government under his portfolio in which he would tend

to  get  more interest, which might give him  greater

political  kudos, and therefore would engage  him  in

greater public attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen that the Minister for Labour and Law

in  his  capacity as Minister for Law has got himself

involved  in  a  number  of controversial  situations

where  he  has  forfeited the confidence  of  certain

sections  of the public. Whether the actions  of  the

Minister  deserve that is quite another  matter,  but

the  factual position is that his pronouncements  and

his  behaviour  on  certain occasions  have  operated

towards a loss of confidence in certain sect ions  of

the public in Singapore. The whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



of Singapore, whatever their sectional, political and

economic interests may be, are all interested in  the

law, the dignity of the law and the upholding of  the

law.  They want to see that not only justice must  be

done  but  seem  to  be done, and that  the  Minister

himself must personify the unassailable principle  of

the law on which democratic institutions are founded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not blame the Minister for

Labour  and  Law  for the present  situation.  It  is

unfortunate that he has been given a most contentious

Ministry - the  Ministry  of  Labour -  which  has  been

coupled   with  a  Ministry  which  should   maintain

dignity, calm and poise. As the Minister for  Labour,

sometimes  he  tends  to lose that  poise,  calm  and

dignity.  Perhaps  it is not his  fault.  It  is  the

occasion  that  makes  us behave  in  the  manner  we

sometimes behave, and perhaps the Minister for Labour

finds himself obliged to behave in that way. That  is

a  matter which only he himself can say, but I  think

he  will  appreciate that, as the Minister  for  Law,

that  kind  of  attitude  or pose  is  not  suitable.

Therefore,  I would, in all earnestness,  suggest  to

the   Government   that  they   give   very   careful

consideration to separating the Ministry of  "Labour"

and  "Law". I certainly appreciate that the  Ministry

of  Labour  is  a very, very important  Ministry.  In

fact,  the  future  of  Singapore  depends  upon  how

successful  the  Minister for Labour is  in  handling

labour matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Coupled with law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And the Minister will also appreciate

how  important  it  is that the dignity  of  the  law

should  be maintained. If the Minister finds that  in

being a good Minister for Labour he cannot be a  good

Minister  for  Law,  I  think  we  have  reached  the

position where the two Ministries must be separated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask the Government to give

serious consideration to my suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I never expected to be

called upon to pass judgment on myself in this House.

But I would say that the functions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Labour and the Law sides in my Ministry  are

quite  separate. Although the Department of  Law  and

the  Department of Labour and Welfare are  housed  in

the  same  Ministry building, the functions of  these

Departments are entirely separate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is provided for in the

Constitution itself that the control over all  public

prosecutions  remains with the State Advocate-General

and   as  far  as  I  have  been  concerned,  I  have

scrupulously adhered to the principle that as far  as

public  prosecutions are concerned - the legal side  of

the Ministry - that is left entirely within the control

of the State Advocate-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of imputations have been made against

my  Ministry  and I would refer particularly  to  the

imputations  that have been made quite  unjustifiably

by  the  Member  for Farrer Park when the  House  was

debating the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech. On that

occasion he pilloried the Ministry. He suggested that

things  were getting quite out of control and out  of

hand  in  the Ministry. He mentioned three  cases.  A

case  where  a  worker was accused of pilfering  ice-cream,  that there was ministerial intervention,  and

that  although the charge was substantiated, the  man

was  reinstated in his employment when  the  Minister

knew  very  well  that be ought  to  be  sacked.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that allegation is completely  untrue.

This particular man was accused of having wasted  his

employer's  material in the preparation of ice-cream.

There  was  no question of theft at all  and  he  was

dismissed for that reason. On due and proper  inquiry

by  the  Commissioner, the employer was not  able  to

establish  that, and the employer himself  willingly

paid him severance pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other case of the bakery in

Sembawang,  the Member for Farrer Park said  that  he

represented  the employer. He said that there  was  a

strike,   that   there  were  pickets   outside   the

employer's  premises and that when the  employer  and

his  wife insisted on going back to their homes,  the

wife of the employer was walloped by a big brute of a

trade  unionist. He went to see the Commissioner  for

Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



and  nothing  could  be done.  He  went  to  see  the

Parliamentary  Secretary who hung down  his  head  in

shame.  These were his words. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

courts  of  law are open in Singapore.  Nobody  stops

anybody  from  going  to  make  a  complaint   to   a

magistrate.  Why  bring  this  lady  around  to   the

Ministry,   to   the   Commissioner,   and   to   the

Parliamentary Secretary? The Member for  Farrer  Park

is  a  practising  lawyer. If  there  is  a  case  of

assault,  all he has to do is to walk down  with  his

client to South Bridge Road to the Police Court, make

a  complaint and apply for a summons. That is all  he

has to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he mentioned the case of the Stamford Cafe. He

alleged  then that the workers got out of hand,  that

the employer's children were threatened with a knife,

that  the Minister took it away from the man's  hand,

that  the  man  was  still in  employment,  and  that

nothing happened. In fact, three days before the hon.

Member  spoke  in  this  Assembly,  the  worker   was

prosecuted  at  the  instance  of  the  wife  of  the

proprietor of that cafe and he was fined.  These  are

the  facts,  Mr Speaker, Sir. A few  days  after  he

spoke  in  this Assembly, the Member for Farrer  Park

himself  had a complaint when he was representing  an

employer.  He had seen the Commissioner and  did  not

get  satisfaction. He came to see me and we spent two

long sessions together.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made certain criticisms against a union. He said

the  workers were unreasonable in their demands. They

were insisting that the course of commercial practice

should be interfered with, should be changed - much  to

his  dislike.  We  went  into that  fully.  A  Labour

Inspector  was sent down to make a full investigation

into  the truth of that matter. The Member for Farrer

Park  will himself agree that there was no foundation

that he made them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the sort of situation

that  happens  in Singapore. As soon as  there  is  a

strike, Mr Speaker, Sir, the employer wants to  have

a  go  at  his  workers. He wants  to  get  everybody

involved,    the   Police   involved   against    the

workers - everybody, including



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



the  Ministry. "Lock them up." The  Commissioner

for  Labour receives telephone calls. "We  want  them

all  locked  up." They try to involve the  Police  in

these  disputes. The Minister for Home Affairs has  a

duty to discharge. He has to build up respect for our

Police  Force.  It would not do for us  to  get  them

involved in these matters in that way. That  is  all,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  And once  the  matter  has  been

settled, I get letters saying, "Use pressure  on  the

State  Advocate-General. Ask him  to  withdraw  these

prosecutions." Mr Speaker, Sir, that is what happens

in Singapore regularly. I can mention cases, but I do

not wish to waste the time of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few days ago I received a letter in regard

to the C. K. Tang dispute. There were complaints that

the   Police  were  not  discharging  their   duties;

everything  had  gone  mad;  there  was  the   Labour

Ministry  sitting around doing nothing and  everybody

was getting berserk, and so on. "Why not arrest these

people and bring them under control?", and so on.. A,

few  persons  did  go  before the  Police  Court  and

applied for summonses and summonses were issued.  The

moment  the dispute was settled, we received  letters

from the employers. Here is one:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`C. K. Tang Ltd. - in Voluntary Liquidation.' I will

not  mention  the  name  of' the  Liquidator  who  is

involved, but this is the letter which he wrote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With reference to my telephone conversation of

this morning, I confirm that the relationship between

the  strikers and non-strikers of this Company so far

has been good, and therefore it is the desire of both

parties  to  continue keeping this good  relationship

for their mutual benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore respectfully suggest that it would be

most difficult to expect them now to stand before the

Court facing each other as accused and witness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above explanation, the shareholders

and  all employees of the above Company would be most

grateful  if  you  would kindly  exercise  your  good

offices  to intercede on their behalf with the  State

Advocate-General   to   drop   the   above    pending

proceedings,  which have been put down  to  be  heard

before  the Fifth Magistrate's Court on the  9th  and

12th  December,  1960.  This  act  of  kindness   and

sympathy  would, be much appreciated by all concerned.

If it is the wish of the State Advocate-General that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



I should call on him, I shall be glad to do so at any

time convenient to him.'



<br><br>I conveyed this to the State Advocate-General telling

him  that this matter was within his sole discretion.

And he sent him a reply, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With reference to your letter on the above matter

dated  6th  December addressed to  the  Minister  for

Labour  and Law which has been forwarded  to  me  for

reply,  I have to inform you that, after giving  full

consideration to the points raised by you and to  the

facts   of   the  case,  I  have  decided  that   the

prosecution   against  the  above-mentioned   accused

persons should be proceeded with.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst I have been the Minister

for Labour and Law, I have been very, very careful to

distinguish  between  the  legal  functions   of   my

Ministry and the Labour and Welfare functions. I  can

assure   the   House   that  I   am   aware   of   my

responsibilities in these matters, and  that  I  have

left  all legal matters affecting my Ministry in  the

competent  hands  of  the State Advocate-General,  so

that there is no danger of any conflict arising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to my general deportment and behaviour as a

Labour Minister and whether that should or should not

be the correct attitude of a Minister for Law, all of

us are entitled to our own opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the

difficulty in which the Minister for Labour  and  Law

finds  himself  when  I asked that  he  should  split

himself and his Ministry into two, and he is not in a

position  to  reply. It is a pity that the  Hon. the

Prime Minister is not present, because he might  have

been able to reply on the Minister's behalf. But I do

not  want to be side-tracked into issues which I  did

not raise on this particular case. The issue which  I

raised  was  that in the particular circumstances  in

which Singapore finds itself now, I am suggesting  to

the  Government that it will be highly  desirable  to

keep the Ministry of Labour and Law apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the State Advocate-General's

post  was  discussed in this Assembly  on  the  first

occasion,  you may remember I fought the  point  that

the  State  Advocate-General should not be  given  an

appointment for two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



years, but that he should be given the full five-year

period  as  the Constitution allows, for  the  simple

reason  that  I believed then, and I do believe  now,

that  the State Advocate-General should be completely

independent,  as the Director of Audit is,  and  that

although  he  is a Government officer he should  have

his  full term of employment so that he can carry out

his   duties   fearlessly,  sometimes  advising   the

Minister and even against what the Minister wants him

to advise him on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

Permanent  Secretary to the Minister for  Labour  and

Law has resigned, and that the State Advocate-General

is  being made to act in the position where  he  will

have to deal with matters connected with the Ministry

of  Labour.  That  again, Mr Speaker,  is  a  highly

undesirable   position.  The  State  Advocate-General

should  be the State Advocate-General. He should  not

become the Permanent Secretary to any Ministry.  What

is  his position if he has to advise the Minister for

Labour on a particular point involving Labour? Is  he

going  to  split  his allegiance into  two  or  three

different  ways? And which way is he  going  to  act?

These are principles in which the Minister for Labour

and  Law  has got himself involved merely because  he

heads one Ministry. I would suggest that even if  the

Ministry  of Labour and Law is not split,  the  State

Advocate-General  should not have any  administrative

control   or   any  administrative  say  in   matters

connected with the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the retirement of the

former Permanent Secretary took place when I was away

in  Tokyo.  The State Advocate-General has  been,  in

addition   to   being  State  Advocate-General,   the

Permanent  Secretary on the Law side of the Ministry.

He   is  also  acting  Permanent  Secretary  for  all

administrative functions relating to the  Labour  and

Welfare  side. This is a very temporary  arrangement.

It  will  take  time for a suitable  officer  of  the

administrative service to be selected  and  appointed

by the Public Service Commission as a replacement for

the last holder of the post



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



of  Permanent  Secretary on the Labour  side  of  the

Ministry.  It is not an arrangement that is  intended

to be permanent at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that was raised by the Member for

Farrer  Park is that he felt that because  the  State

Advocate-General's  appointment  was,  in  the  first

instance,  for two years only, he was not independent

and free. I cannot understand how he can believe that

to  be  so.  The State Advocate-General is completely

free  in  the legal side of the work of the Ministry.

Does  the Member for Farrer Park suggest that  he  is

being pressured? And if he is being pressured, is  he

being pressured by the Minister for Labour and Law?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am not suggesting that at all, Sir.

Let  the Minister not misunderstand me, please. I  am

not   suggesting   that  the  present   Minister   is

pressuring  the  State Advocate-General.  What  I  am

saying.  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  when  we   set   up

democratic  institutions which are  nicely  balanced,

then  it  becomes  important that a proper  sense  of

values should be attached to each post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a Supreme Court Judge, Mr Speaker, Sir, is an

important  man  in  the  State.  Not  only  must   he

administer justly, he must seem to administer justly.

It  is a very important principle of the law which we

must  maintain  in  this  State - that  not  only  must

justice  be done, but that it must seem to  be  done.

Therefore,  what is the principle involved  when  the

Director  of  Audit is given a five-year  appointment

under  the  Constitution? The principle is  that  the

Director  of Audit is in a position to criticise  the

Government and its Ministers. Therefore, he  must  be

in  a  position from which he will be able to  do  it

fearlessly. Now, could the Government contemplate the

position  where  the Director of Audit  is  appointed

from  year to year? What confidence could the  public

of  Singapore have in the Director of Audit's Report,

if his appointment is at the pleasure of the Minister

from   year  to  year?  I  think  the  Minister  will

appreciate  that. If he will translate  that  to  the

State  Advocate-General who must advise each Minister

fearlessly according to the law and not according  to

what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



Minister wants him to advise, then, I do not say that

that  is happening now, but the situation now is such

that  everybody might believe that that is  what  can

happen.  The position will be that if he has  a  two-year  appointment, there will be many people who will

say, "Oh! it is a two-year appointment, and surely if

he  wants another three-year appointment, he  is  not

going  to  say everything he thinks should be  said."

That  does  not  mean to say that in this  particular

instance,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  State  Advocate-General  is not doing his duty fearlessly. I  do  not

say that at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that was all discussed

when  the  question of the appointment of  the  State

Advocate-General  was raised in this  House.  It  was

then  pointed out that the Government have the  power

under the Constitution to appoint the State Advocate-General  for  a  stated period, and that  after  this

initial  period it would be up to the  Government  to

confirm  him in the appointment. There is no question

that,  because these arrangements were followed,  the

State  Advocate-General is not free in the  discharge

of  his functions. He gives advice not only to me but

to  all  the  other Ministers. And he has  been  very

scrupulously careful to give us what he considers  to

be  his  own advice. There has been no pressure  ever

exercised  either by myself or by any other  Minister

on  the  State Advocate-General. I think that it  was

very  unfair of the Member for Farrer Park  to  leave

the  Assembly  with the impression that  because  the

State  Advocate-General has  been  appointed  for  an

initial  period of two years, he is tempted  to  take

the  line  of least resistance and fall in  with  the

wishes   of   the  Ministers  in  order   to   secure

confirmation of his appointment. I think that  was  a

very  unfair  imputation to make and I think  it  was

most improper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I want to make the position quite clear.

There  is no personal imputation against the  present

State Advocate-General. I am sure he is carrying  out

his  duties  to  the best of his ability,  which  any

State Advocate-General would do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get on with the question of the State

Advocate-General  acting as  Permanent  Secretary  to

another  Ministry. The Minister said that it is  only

temporary-excuse  me,  it is  only  temporary.  I  am

suggesting  to  the Minister that  this  is  such  an

important principle that it should not even  be  only

temporary. When that official resigned, I  think  the

Government  should  have  come  up  with  some  other

appointment,  making some other person  to  act.  The

State  Advocate-General, Mr Speaker, Sir, is one  of

the  most hard-worked officers in Singapore. The  way

he produces these Bills is like nobody's business!



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the House could

just recollect the word used: it was "excuse". There

is no excuse. Nobody is trying to talk himself out of

any  difficult  situation at all. There  is  no  such

thing as an excuse in this matter,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I arrived from Tokyo I heard

that  the Permanent Secretary had retired, and I came

to  know the next day that the State Advocate-General

was acting as the Permanent Secretary to the Minister

for  Labour  and  Law. It takes time for  the  Public

Service  Commission  to  review  the  claims  of  the

various  officers  according to their  seniority  and

merit  for  appointment  as  a  replacement  to   the

Permanent  Secretary. All that takes time.  Meanwhile

the  work  has got to be done. This I can assure  the

House is a very temporary arrangement. As soon  as  a

suitable  officer is found, he will be  appointed  to

the  post  of Permanent Secretary on the  Labour  and

Welfare side of the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only raise this

question  in  order  to bring to Government's  notice

certain principles involved in this business. I  have

done  so,  Mr Speaker, and may I be given  leave  to

withdraw my motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,720,060 for Head 40 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 41-.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure for Industrial Courts Ordinance - $6,000.

Sir,  I  wonder if the Minister could  tell  us  what

expenditure this is, particularly when the Industrial

Courts  have been provided for under other  heads  of

expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to the

Member  for Farrer Park for questioning this item  of

expenditure.   The  reference  is   really   to   the

Industrial Relations Ordinance. The Industrial Courts

Ordinance   has  been  repealed  by  the   Industrial

Relations  Ordinance. I would like an amendment  made

to  replace  the words "Industrial Courts  Ordinance"

with the words "Industrial Relations Ordinance".  The

Industrial  Relations  Ordinance  provides  for   the

appointment  of  Boards  of  Inquiry  to  look   into

disputes which are not properly covered by collective

agreements  or  awards. These Boards of  inquiry  are

similar to the Boards of Inquiry appointed under  the

former  Industrial Courts Ordinance. The  legislation

itself provides for the payment of fees to witnesses,

and this is the provision that enables payments to be

made  for  these services when Boards of Inquiry  are

appointed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I be given leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $861,070 for Head 41 ordered to stand

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 45 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (28) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I move this amendment in order to

seek  clarification  from the  Government  concerning

what  has  appeared  to  be a question  mark  by  the

members  of the Muslim community. After this Assembly

had  made  amendments  to the  Muslims  Ordinance  in

Singapore to bring about better and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



more  satisfactory  conditions  in  connection  with

Muslim  marriages and divorces, more powers had  been

conferred by these amendments on the Chief  Kathi.  I

would  like  to know whether the Minister for  Labour

and Law is aware of a recent incident when a marriage

took  place  in Singapore. The man came to  Singapore

and  lived  here  temporarily.  But  he  was  already

married  and had children in Indonesia. If I  am  not

mistaken,  according  to the Muslims  Ordinance,  the

necessary investigation is required to be made to the

satisfaction  of  both parties  before  the  marriage

could  be solemnised. Because the marriage took place

rather  suddenly,  I  seek  clarification  from   the

Minister   whether   the  marriage   was   solemnised

according to the provisions of the Muslims Ordinance.

I  would  like  to  stress in this Assembly  that  in

promulgating  laws, it is also the responsibility  of

this  House  to  see  that  the  provisions  of   the

Ordinance  are carried out by the civil  servants  to

the letter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for the

Southern  Islands is referring, I think, to the  case

of  Syed  Alwi  Jamaludin. This man  is  a  religious

lecturer resident and domiciled in Indonesia. He  has

already  a  wife - and, according to some reports,  two

wives -  in  Indonesia. Yet his marriage in  Singapore

was  solemnised  by  the Chief  Kathi.  Inquiries  in

Singapore disclosed that no proper investigation  was

made,  and  that the Chief Kathi only  acted  on  the

statement  of the man that he was able to maintain  a

wife.  No  details  of his income and  standing  were

recorded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the State Advocate-General has

received a number of complaints regarding the way  in

which  the  Chief Kathi has performed his duties.  He

has  ascertained, Sir, that whilst  the  Chief  Kathi

keeps to the letter of the Muslim law, he has in some

cases  not  been  very careful  or  thorough  in  his

inquiries.   All   complaints  received   have   been

investigated and, where necessary, explanations  have

been  asked  from  the Chief Kathi  and  instructions

given to him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Kathi is 65 years old and appears to be

very settled in his ways. As a result of a number  of

complaints  that  we have received, consideration  is

now  being  given to his retirement from  the  public

service.  The Chief Kathi was appointed, I think,  in

October 1959, on temporary terms, i.e. on a month-to-

month  basis. In view of these complaints, action  is

being taken to have his services terminated.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

explanation submitted by the Minister for Labour  and

Law  is  completely satisfactory to me. But there  is

one  thing I would like to remind him. Whoever he may

be  who  implements  the provisions  of  the  Muslims

Ordinance,  the question of age does not concern  us.

But  it  should be remembered that no fun  should  be

poked  at  the provisions of the Ordinance.  If  this

recurs  again in the future, it would be a source  of

uneasiness to the Muslim community. With this, I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.

remained vacant since then simply because we have not

found a suitable person to fill it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other query by the Member for Tanglin would

entail  my  repeating  the  statement  made  in   the

Assembly on 2nd September, 1959, in Hansard, Vol. 11.

No.  9,  column 538, where the case for  a  Political

Liaison  Secretary  was made. The incumbent  left  in

October  1959,  and until such time  as  we  can  get

somebody to discharge these functions, obviously this

post must remain vacant.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the

Hansard  that the Minister for Culture quoted,  which

is  2nd September, 1959. Vol. 11, No. 9, it seems  to

me  that  this  is  a very special  post.  First  and

foremost,  it  draws a salary of  $1,400  as  against

$1,100  of  the Political Secretary. In that  debate,

the  Minister  pointed out the special qualifications

needed.   In   column   540,   he   gave   the    two

qualifications:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, one of these posts requires someone

with a knowledge not only of the Chinese language but

also  of  Chinese trends, thought and  reactions  and

also  a  knowledge of (on the purely technical  side)

publicity methods and organisation.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently, Sir, the Minister has not found these

two  qualities in one man. Very probably,  there  are

many who have the first quality, but who have not the

second, and vice versa. From what I see, Sir, 1 think

it is 15 months now and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



Minister  has  not been able to find a  man  who  has

these  combined qualities. If I may put in my  humble

observation, it is not likely that he will  find  one

in  the foreseeable future, because the knowledge  of

not  only  the  Chinese  language  but  also  Chinese

trends,  thought and reactions, (meaning the  Chinese

way  of living, minds and culture), is something that

cannot  be acquired overnight. If a man who  has  the

technical knowledge cannot acquire that overnight and

he  is going to take years, then it is true the other

way  round  also.  A  person who has  all  the  first

qualities  cannot get technical knowledge  overnight.

He  will take years. That is why I feel that it  will

take  years before a man with the first quality could

be  trained in the second quality and vice versa.  It

is  not, of course, like the shortage of doctors.  If

we cannot find enough doctors in Singapore, well, let

us  publicise it throughout the world and  see  which

country  can send us experts. This is not so in  this

case.  The  Minister has made it very  clear  in  the

Hansard  that  this is something very, very  special.

This  person must be someone who must have  lived  in

Singapore and must have the feel of the way  of  life

in  Singapore, its culture and its trends of thought.

That  is a quality which we cannot get in a technical

expert from overseas. I would like to point out  that

the Minister, in winding up his speech, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am quite sure that if, as the Prime Minister

mentioned  earlier,  the previous  Government  had  a

little bit more foresight in this matter and not felt

its own pulse and mistaken it for the pulse of public

opinion, it would not be where it is today.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks as if the Minister may not be able to find

such   a  person  within  the  span  of  the  present

Government's  life. If they are unable to  find  that

person,  I  am just wondering whether they  would  be

where we are today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, when the Member for

Mountbatten  spoke, she hoped that we  would  not  be

able  to find one. But I can assure her that we  have

found,  not  one,  but  quite  a  few  who  have  the

requisite  qualifications. They  are  journalists  of

long  standing, but unfortunately, for one reason  or

another, we could not induce them to take the job. In

fact, I can assure the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



Mountbatten that there are quite a number  of  people

who  are  capable  of  doing this  job.  When  I  say

"special qualifications", it does not mean a  special

type  of  people  or  some rare being.  All  that  we

require is somebody with enough political acumen  and

a  knowledge of Chinese. This is not because it is  a

Chinese  post  but because in my Ministry  I  have  a

Political Secretary who is well-versed in Malay  and,

therefore, we need somebody to balance the other side

to  help us keep in contact with Chinese opinion  and

organise the publicity services. The co-ordination of

them  does not require all that great skill.  If  you

are  a  journalist  or  a publicity  man,  you  could

discharge the job. But unfortunately, as I have said,

although  we did find a number of people,  they  were

not prepared, for one reason or another, to take  up

the job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if for the

last  15  months it has not been found  necessary  to

fill  this  vacancy and the Ministry of  Culture  has

gone  on quite actively in its programmes, I  see  no

reason  why  this  post should be  continued  in  the

Estimates.  My  opinion, Sir,  is  that  the  present

Parliamentary Secretary is the one who has almost all

the qualifications required for the present post.  In

view  of  the fact that the Government is pursuing  a

policy   of  economy,  it  does  seem  strange   that

Government  should still want to continue  with  this

post  and be looking for some applicant when  it  has

been  able to carry on so far without this post being

filled.  I suggest that, in the interests of economy,

the post be deleted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, this Assembly has gone on at

least five years without the Member for Tanglin being

present  in the Assembly, but it does not mean  that,

therefore,  we should dispense with the  constituency

for  Tanglin.  There  are many  posts  in  Government

departments  which  have not  been  filled  for  many

years, but, nevertheless, people carry on. Similarly,

with the case of this Publicity Liaison Secretary, we

have  carried on precisely by distributing  the  work

among  a  number  of  people like  the  Parliamentary

Secretary, the Political Secretary, myself and  other

officers  of  the Ministry. To an extent,  it  was  a

makeshift arrangement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



and the work involved hindered these people from

carrying on the other jobs which they have had to do.

As  I  have  said before, it means co-ordinating  the

radio,    information   services,   posters,   films,

publications,   field   units,   special    campaigns

organised by various Ministries and so on. Perhaps in

the  near future it will include television and other

activities.  For example, in a very recent  case,  we

had  the family planning campaign. This involved  the

printing  of a large number of posters, booklets  and

so  on.  But what happened was that there was  nobody

else  to  co-ordinate this work so that our  Ministry

had  committed  itself  to  producing  pamphlets  and

booklets  for  some  other  Ministry  without   quite

realising  that we could not discharge these  duties.

There  is  a  little  bit of bad  blood  between  the

various  Ministries. They feel that the  Ministry  of

Culture  is discriminating in favour of one  Ministry

or  the other. This is just an instance of how, if we

had  an  officer like this, it would at least  ensure

that  the publicity services speak as far as possible

with one voice consistently, unlike, I think, in  the

previous regime where you occasionally had three  and

four voices emerging from the same outfit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

explanation  given,  I think the Ministry  should  be

called the Ministry of Culture and Propaganda. But if

it  is a Ministry of Culture, I do not think the post

should be there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if this post was not a political

appointment,  if it were a civil service  appointment

and  if I were sitting on a committee going into  the

staffing position in the Ministry of Culture, one  of

the questions I would ask the Ministry would be, "How

long  has  this post been vacant?" If the answer  is,

"For  a  considerable time," I would ask,  "Have  you

been able to get along without this post?" and if the

answer  is, "Yes, as well as we could," I  think  the

result  of  that  investigation might  well  be,  Mr

Speaker, that the post would be deleted. This being a

political  post,  of course, the yardstick  which  is

applied  to  the civil service cannot be  applied  to

this  particular post. But the point remains that  we

are all of us using a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



lot  of words to hide something which we do not  want

to  say. Is this not the truth of the situation: that

this  post  was created for a particular person,  and

that  was  why  it  was fixed at $1,400  and  not  at

$1,100,  because he would not accept the  appointment

at $1,100, because he felt he was superior to all the

other Political Secretaries? Now that that person has

left,  there  is  no possibility of this  post  being

filled. I do not think the Government intends to fill

this post, so why have the post on the list?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> If the argument of the Member for

Farrer Park depends on that post not being filled and

if  in  the next few months I do manage to fill  this

post,  would he then say that therefore this post  is

justified? Fortunately, this Government is not  going

to  fill a post just to satisfy the Opposition. There

is  necessity  for the post because we consider  this

post  is  essential to us. We therefore want to  look

around  for  an individual who can help us  discharge

this  function.  If we cannot find  that  individual,

then  we  will leave it vacant for as long as  it  is

necessary  and we will carry on as best we  can.  But

the  argument that the Member for Farrer Park has put

forward seems to be that, "If you can fill this post,

then we will have nothing to say."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, what I am saying frankly and simply

is  this. This post is created at this salary to take

in  a particular gentleman. I think the Minister  for

Culture knows whom I refer to. As a result of certain

differences of opinion in the Ministry,  he  has  now

left.   He  was  certainly  a  very  versatile   man.

Versatility was his metier. Now that he is gone, they

cannot  find  anyone  else, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  They

cannot  find anyone else who will fit in  with  their

way of thinking and their way of doing things, and  I

do not blame them, Sir,It is difficult to find these

individuals. They do not grow on trees. The point  we

are  making is, "If you thought there was a need  for

it  then, you voted him $1,400, that was all right as

far  as it went. But you are not going to get such  a

creature again. Even if you do get him, why  pay  him

$1,400? How is he going to be any better than the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



other  Political Secretaries?" I understand that  the

present  Political  Secretary  in  the  Ministry   of

Culture  is an excellent individual doing  work  that

nobody else can do. The Prime Minister has said  that

on a number of occasions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If that is correct, I cannot see how you

can get better than the best?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This, of course, is another item which

the  Estimates Committee could well look into if  the

Member for Farrer Park thinks so. Mr Rajaratnam?



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think the argument advanced

is not that this post is not necessary. The criticism

really  springs from the chronic antipathy  that  the

Members  opposite have against Political  Secretaries

in  general. As indicated in one way or another, they

are  afraid that if we get good political advice, the

situation perhaps in another four or five years  will

be  improved,  with perhaps a few more reductions  in

the  number  of Members on the other side.  So  their

objection is not that this post is not unnecessary as

it  has not been filled, but that they object to  the

appointment of Political Secretaries in principle. We

cannot  stop them from doing that. It is  quite  true

that  the post was held by a previous individual  who

was  a  very versatile man with great talent. He  was

not  only  purely  performing  the  functions  of   a

Political   Secretary  but,  in  addition,   he   was

responsible   for  co-ordinating  a   the   publicity

services. When he left the post, we tried to fill it.

In  fact,  as  I said earlier, we found a  number  of

people who could fill the job. But one of the reasons

for their turning down the post, if I may say so, was

that they felt that the Opposition might consider  it

a very highly paid post, or that perhaps, among other

things,   the  salary  was  not  attractive   enough.

Unfortunately,  to  prevent further  questions  being

asked   by  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  and   his

colleagues, we decided to leave the post  at  $1,400.

As I say, if we do find a gentleman to fill the post,

then  I  hope  the Members opposite will congratulate

the Government for being assiduous in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



its search and having got a person quite capable of

ensuring that this Government carries out its work

correctly and properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that amendment (3)* is not being moved?

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (3) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (4) of sub- head 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No. Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (23) of sub-head 1.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this amendment is to get

information.  I  notice that apart  from  item  (23),

items (92), (106), (118), (140) and (141) are all  on

"Expatriation Pay". I wonder whether the Minister can

tell  us how many expatriates there are still in  his

Ministry and when they are due for Malayanisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, this expatriation pay is the

actual  amount  payable to the Supernumerary  Officer

(Broadcasting),  who  until quite  recently  was  the

Director of Broadcasting and is now attached  to  the

headquarters  of  the Minister. He is  an  expatriate

officer  and  is  therefore entitled to  expatriation

pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the Estimates were framed, it was not

known  that  this expatriate officer  would  want  to

retire  before  the  end of 1961 and  therefore  full

provision  was made for the year 1961 in the  sum  of

$3,000.  It  is now known, however, that the  officer

will  go on leave prior to retirement at the  end  of

this  year  and he has quite a lot of vacation  leave

due  to  him. Part of this provision will be utilised

as expatriation pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the number of expatriates still in the

Ministry,  apart from this individual, I think  there

are  two more: one is in the Engineering Section  and

one  in  the  Programme Section. 1 am not  sure  when

their  terms expire. But these are the two  remaining

expatriates left.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I

understand rightly, the Minister says that altogether

there  are three expatriates. One will be going away,

and  there will be only two left. But as I have said,

"Expatriation Pay" appears under several  items - (92),

(106), (118), (140) and (141).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think if the hon. Member

wishes  to  query those items, she should have  given

notice.  I do not know whether the Minister is  in  a

position  to  answer on these items. Could  the  hon.

Member  give  those items so that  we  could  have  a

record  of them? The Minister might then be  able  to

follow them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Item (92) at page 360.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> "Expatriation Pay" - there appears to

be an entry of $3,000 for 1960, and nothing for 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> And item (106).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is at page 361, "Expatriation

Pay - $3,000".



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Item (118) at page 362, and

item (151) at page 361.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Lady wished to bring

forward those items, she should have given notice  of

amendments in regard to them. If the Minister is  not

in  a  position to answer, he might be able to supply

the information direct to the Member later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As regards the last item mentioned,

i.e. under   "Museum  Division"   and   not   under

"Broadcasting", I thought the hon. Lady was referring

to  Broadcasting. In the Ministry of Culture,  Museum

Division,  there  is  one expatriate.  I  cannot  say

offhand,  but  so far as I can recollect,  there  are

only two expatriates still left in Broadcasting.  The

one  she  is  specifically interested in,  i.e.,  the

Director of Broadcasting, will be leaving at the  end

of the year. If she wants any further information,  I

can find out and let her know.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I shall be glad if the Minister

can  supply the information. In view of that promise,

may I beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 br reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 7.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment stood in the name of Mrs Seow Peck Leng

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this sub-head, $45,000 will be spent for

National Day celebrations. During the office  of  the

present  Government,  two National  Day  celebrations

have   been  held.  This  House  had  also   approved

expenditure to the amount of $52,000 last  September,

of which $41,320.80 was spent for National Day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



celebrations. This was explained by the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Culture in Hansard  of

21st September, 1960, Vol. 13, No. 9, col. 631.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I would like to say, Mr Speaker, is in

regard  to the policy of celebrating National Day.  I

do  not wish to raise any question, but I would  like

to  talk  about  the expenditure side.  The  benefits

derived  from  the sums expended will be commensurate

with  the  value derived by the State. The Government

cannot  deny that the Opposition could not take  part

in   the   National   Day  celebrations.   Therefore,

celebrations were not conducted as they  should  have

been  conducted - by all the people of Singapore.  What

is  objectionable to the Opposition, Mr Speaker, and

also to political Parties outside this Chamber is the

method  adopted  by  the  Government  in  celebrating

National  Day.  And I dare say in this  Chamber,  Mr

Speaker,  that  in the National Day  celebrations  we

observed that the decorations were done on Government

buildings,  but  what  is  regretted  is   that   the

commercial  buildings  paid  no  heed  to   celebrate

National Day except maybe if they felt that they were

under  pressure  to put up bunting or  to  hoist  the

National  Flag. The celebrations were very  different

from  the  celebrations that we used to  see  in  the

past.  I  feel, Mr Speaker, there must be  something

beneath it which resulted in many people refusing  to

take an, active part in National Day celebrations.  I

would   like  to  know,  Mr  Speaker,  whether   the

proposals for National Day celebrations for 1961 will

be the same as had been made by the Government during

the past two years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am sorry, Sir, that the Member

for   the   Southern  islands  seeks  to   revive   a

controversy   which  we  hoped  had  been   forgotten

because,  on the part of Government, it has at  least

tried not to discuss the matter. On two occasions not

only   the  Opposition  Parties  but  various   other

organisations and groups were invited to  participate

in  the celebrations. Unfortunately, for reasons best

known to themselves, the Opposition Parties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



decided to make an issue out of it on both occasions.

The last time, if I remember correctly, a large group

of  people  came  up  to say that this  National  Day

celebration was not an affair of one particular Party

or   of  the  Government;  we  wanted  everybody   to

participate in it, because, for us at least, this was

one  day  in  the  year when we could demonstrate  to

ourselves   that  regardless  of  different   creeds,

different political Parties, or any other differences

that  you  might have, on this one day we could  come

together  to  celebrate  it  as  a  national   group.

Unfortunately, the Opposition said that  this  was  a

political stunt by the Government, that it was really

a  P.A.P. affair, and the reason,  they  said,  was,

"Well,  you  are  having this procession  and  P.A.P.

members  are going to participate and they are  going

to fly their flag." We took the view that on National

Day P.A.P. members too should celebrate. Though there

were different groups, they should celebrate together

to  the  extent  of showing their identity.  Just  as

other  cultural organisations and trade unions  which

belonged  to different unions showed their  identity.

The  idea  was that, although we were all  different,

that though we belonged to different trade unions, to

different  cultural  groups, to  different  political

Parties,  on this occasion we were marching  together

as  one  united group. Unfortunately, the  Opposition

decided  to say, "No. We say: Celebrate this  without

showing  our  identity. Let us march  as  a  nameless

group." For that reason, they left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the Member for the Southern Islands said

that  many people refused to take an active  part  in

it, that is no quite true. As far as I know, the only

people  who  were invited and who did not  take  part

were  Members of the Opposition. The others, everyone

of  them,  accepted. The people who refused  to  take

part  in it as a matter of protest, whether right  or

wrong,  we are not interested in them. They  did  not

take  part  in it because they did not want  to  take

part  in  it, not because the Government  refused  to

have them. In fact, we welcomed them. We invited them

to  come and take part in the discussions leading  to

the organisation of National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



Day  celebrations.  Therefore, I regret  that  on  an

occasion like this, they decided to make it a  matter

of  political controversy. I had hoped that it  would

not  be. But if there were any objections, then  they

should come out openly and say it. The objection they

made  was  "The  other  groups  should  not  identify

themselves.  Everybody should just walk  in  one  big

mass."  None of the other groups objected to  it.  In

fact,  they were very glad - the Chambers of  Commerce,

cultural  organisations - to come and show  that  they

belonged to this or that group and they were prepared

to  march together. So that was the reason, Sir,  and

not  because the Government was being unfair  or  the

Government refused to have them.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

confused when the Minister for Culture explained that

the Opposition blindly did not wish to participate in

the  National Day celebrations. It has been  stressed

during  the  past two occasions that  the  Opposition

could  not  see  eye to eye with the methods  adopted

because  they benefited only one side. They benefited

the  Party in power, Mr Speaker. We were invited for

discussion merely to accept the resolutions which had

already been taken by the Minister for Culture.  This

is not the way of working together. It is merely like

expecting  the  Opposition to follow something  which

they  cannot  accept.  The way  to  co-operate,  when

organising  National Day celebrations, is  to  accept

the  views  of  the  participants. Whether  the  view

points  are accepted by all or not should be thrashed

out  at  the meetings. The Opposition never  rejected

blindly  on  this  issue, as in the past  year,  when

$41,320.80  was spent on decorations, and even  these

decorations  were a failure because of the  inclement

weather. The expenditure was a waste.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Culture  sought  to  give  the  impression  that  the

Opposition    Parties   were   not   interested    in

participating  in the National Day celebrations.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  you  will remember,  when  the  first

occasion   arose  to  vote  this  money, that   the

Opposition voted the money willingly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



on  the basis that it was important that National Day

should be celebrated. The point of difference between

the  Government  and ourselves is in  the  manner  in

which  this  National Day is sought to be celebrated.

We  on  the  Opposition side feel that the Government

seeks  to give it a party flavour, and we have always

been   against  the  Government  giving  it  a  party

flavour. It is a National Day. The Head of State, the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, is present on this occasion,

and  in the march-past he takes the salute. We on the

Opposition side feel that it is wrong that  the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara  should be placed  in  a  position

where  he  should be called upon to salute any  party

flag. The only flag which he should be called upon to

salute   is  the  State  flag.  That  is  the   basic

principle. The Opposition Parties say that the manner

in  which  the  Government seeks  to  celebrate  this

national  occasion is not correct, if they will  only

give  it  a  national  flavour rather  than  a  party

flavour,  they  will be completely correct  in  this,

because the State belongs to them and to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, when they say a party flavour,

what  do  they object to and in what way? If  in  the

celebration  you  confine it to only  one  party  and

refuse  the others, then it has a party flavour.  But

what   we   said  was  that  all  political   parties

represented in the Assembly were welcome, just as all

cultural  organisations  were  welcome.  Whatever  we

might  say  of  the  political parties - the  political

parties  of  the Opposition as well as the  political

party  of  our side - there are hundreds of individuals

who  have  helped and played a part in moulding  this

new  State.  Should we be ashamed of our symbol,  and

should  we be ashamed of being associated with  them?

We  should  not.  That is why we  welcomed  political

parties  of all shades, who helped to mould this  new

State, to come forward openly and be proud of what

they  had  done, and to show their symbols.  Just  as

cultural organisations and trade unions belonging  to

different  groups came and carried  their  signs  and

symbols.  Therefore, I do not, think  there  was  any

party flavour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



If  we  had  wanted a party flavour,  we  would  have

excluded  all  the others, and only  confined  it  to

ourselves. Then the Opposition would have been  quite

justified  in saying that we were using the  National

Day  celebrations  to propagate,  or  put  forward  a

particular party. All political parties come and join

us,  so that people can say, "Here are three or  four

political parties which on this occasion are marching

together, on the same occasion, to celebrate a common

ideal." The aim that they have is a National  Day  to

symbolise  the  desire  to be a  nation  despite  our

differences in politics; race and religion.  That  is

the simple thing, and I do not see any objection. But

the  Opposition always insisted that they would  come

only  if  none of the political parties  carried  any

symbols.  We are not ashamed of our symbols.  We  are

not  ashamed  of  the people who  have  put  us  into

power - all the political parties that have put us into

power.  We are prepared on that day to say, "This  is

the political group in power, and those are the other

political parties which represent the Opposition."  I

do  not see why we should try and boycott an occasion

like this on their insistence that there should be no

showing of any symbols.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard

it  repeatedly mentioned that we should build  a  new

nation.  If on the National Day of the new  State  of

Singapore,  we  display different party  symbols  and

party  flags, we immediately divide the loyalties  of

those  present so that the people and children  begin

to  think  in terms of, "Which party do you support?"

"Which party does our father support?" On that basis,

how  can  we produce unity? I know that some  parents

have  asked  the heads of schools whether they  could

keep  their  children at home when the  schools  have

agreed  to send certain quotas to participate in  the

mass  drill or the mass display, because the  parents

of school children also belong to different political

parties.  For  that reason, we believe very  strongly

that  if  the  Government  wants  to  instil  in  our

children  and in the people of Singapore  loyalty  to

one  nation, then there should be no discordant  note

on National Day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

assure   the  Minister  for  Culture   that   the

Opposition  places as much importance on  National

Day  as  the  Government  itself  does.  When  the

question of the National Flag was being mooted  by

the Government, the Government called a meeting of

all  political  parties. After  a  great  deal  of

discussion, agreement was reached. That agreement.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, has helped to make that a truly

National  Flag. If the Government had  over-ridden

the Opposition Parties and created a flag of their

own without the consent of the Opposition Partie s-

and  they  had  every legal  right  to  do  it.  I

suppose,  because they have a majority  number  of

votes - even if they had carried it through  without

the  Opposition consenting, it would not have been

a   truly   National  Flag.  But  better   opinion

prevailed in the Government, and we were all  able

to agree on a flag which has now become a national

symbol.  All of us accept it loyally, and give  it

the  reverence it should be given. Similarly,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, when the Government were trying  to

put forward a plan on the flag, they had their own

points  of  view. They departed to  a  very  large

extent from those points of view, and a compromise

was  arrived at. The compromise has helped to make

it  into  a  National  Flag. The  Government  have

certain   ideas  as  to  how  the   National   Day

celebrations should be conducted. But National Day

is  not a day for the Government. It is a day  for

the  people  of  Singapore,  and  the  people   of

Singapore  are  composed of P.A.P. people,  S.P.A.

people,  the  Workers'  Party,  and  may  be  even

supporters of the Member for Hong Lim, and  others

who  are independent. But those are the people  of

Singapore.  Does  it  matter  very  much  to   the

Government  if  they  yield  one  or  two   points

provided they can get complete unanimity with  the

Opposition?  Would  that  not  really   become   a

National   Day?  The  point  of  divergence,   Mr

Speaker, it seems to me, is whether the party flag

should  be  carried on the shoulders  and  hoisted

before  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. On that  small

issue, we are breaking down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, it is not that the

Government  did not invite people. The  Government

invited not only the Opposition parties but  every

cultural organisation. In fact, to a great extent,

the  National Day celebrations were organised  and

run  by  non-Government organisations.  They  were

organised  by cultural organisations  who  put  up

their own shows. The difference was over this  one

particular point. Should a political party on that

day  show  themselves? If you are P.A.P.,  do  you

show  yourselves  that  you  are  members  of  the

P.A.P.? If you belong to a particular trade union,

do  you show that you belong to a particular trade

union?  If  you  belong to a  particular  cultural

organisation,  do you show that you  belong  to  a

particular  cultural organisation?  And  everybody

agreed  they should. The only opposition was  from

the Opposition Members. None of the other cultural

organisations - there were about 80 or  90  of  them

opposed  it.  Everyone else agreed. Not  only  the

Government  but  other cultural organisations  and

bodies which were there said that it was perfectly

right; that on this particular day we should  show

that, though we were diverse and we held all sorts

of  views, here we were marching together  as  one

group.  I think I know why the Opposition  Members

did  not want to participate in it and show  their

party  symbols,  but  that  is  not  my  business.

Anyway,  let us not try and make an issue  out  of

this  and say that it is because of the particular

way in which the Government organised the National

Day  celebrations. As I said, there were about  80

or  90  different groups. Everyone was  satisfied,

except  the  Opposition parties. So does  it  mean

that 80 or 90 organisations should give in on this

particular issue - that everyone should show  their

symbols; - to what group they belonged - whether they

belonged  to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce,  the

Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the Indian  Chamber

of  Commerce, to what religious bodies? They  were

probably  parading their symbols and their  flags,

and  that  was the best way to show to the  people

that  whatever diversity there might be,  on  this

basic  issue  we were united. Yet the  Member  for

Tanglin says that by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



the  various political parties showing their colours,

the  children  are going to say that they  cannot  be

loyal  to  a  particular  ideal,  because  there   is

division,  in  which case there is no need  for  this

Assembly,  because  the children can  come  and  say,

"Look,  democracy  means  so many  political  parties

arguing  things out." But our idea is  this - the  fact

that different groups and different political parties

can  argue and still have loyalty to the basic  ideal

bears  the  stamp of democracy. In a similar  way,  I

hope that though we may say these things, whatever  I

might have said today, on the next National Day,  the

Opposition  will take a much more liberal  view,  and

that   it   does   not   matter  whatever   political

differences  there  are,  they  will   be   able   to

participate. In fact, as far as we are concerned,  we

will send an invitation to them for the third time to

participate  in  our National Day  celebrations.  The

first time was National Loyalty Week; the second time

was  National Day, and I hope that the next time they

will  be  able  to  participate in our  celebrations,

which  include  the Government and nearly  a  hundred

cultural organisations and groups.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

found  the  secret why the Members of the  Opposition

would not wish to participate as political parties in

the  National Day celebrations, it is perhaps because

of  their  confusion as to which symbols they  should

have - the Progressive Orchid-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minster for

Education  should  try  and confine  himself  to  the

principles  which have been laid before the  Assembly

with  great  clarity, and I think  the  Minister  for

Culture  has answered on those lines. Let us not  get

down to personalities.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

appeal made by the Minister for Culture regarding the

points raised by the Opposition about National Day is

a  matter  that has not been properly clarified.  The

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



for Culture can reconsider changing the programmes or

letting  them remain as they were last year.  Such  a

procedure  cannot  bring  about  a  union  but   only

misconception,  misapprehension and a  split-up.  The

Minister  for  Culture has said that he  has  invited

political  parties  in Singapore, including  cultural

bodies  and  other associations. But  what  has  been

known  in the past is that political parties  outside

the  Assembly  have not been invited to  discuss  the

manner  of holding the National Day celebrations.  It

appears that the Government only places importance on

political  parties. Yet it seems to me that political

parties outside the Assembly have not been invited to

discuss it, except the Opposition Parties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Minister for Culture sought to

draw  a  distinction  between  cultural  bodies   and

political parties. With great respect to the Minister

for  Culture, they are not on the same footing. Those

cultural  bodies are all national organisations,  and

the   bodies  that  the  Minister  for  Culture   was

referring to-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Not bodies, but parties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - are national bodies in the same way

that   they  include  members  of  various  political

Parties  and  all  national creeds. They  have  their

particular purpose which serves the State.  Maybe  we

are  wrong. Will the Government concede that they are

wrong? But this is a point of view which we sincerely

believe in. If the Government can understand it, then

we  may be able to come to some compromise on it. But

we  are  sincerely opposed to the exposure  of  party

flags before the Head of State, as he will be put  in

such  a  position where he will have to salute  those

party flags.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like to draw attention

to the fact that National Day celebrations exist as a

result  of  the  birth  of the  new  Constitution.  I

remember that when the Merdeka Mission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



was  proceeding  to London, there was  no  opposition

then  from the Government to the display of  slogans,

party  flags  and so on. All sections of people  from

all  political  parties  in  Singapore  participated.

Similarly,  when  the Merdeka Mission  returned  from

London,  various political parties displayed  various

party  flags with captions such as "Welcome Home  the

Merdeka  Mission to London". The fruit of the Merdeka

Mission was not designed for the particular affection

of  this  community. Now, we have reached  the  stage

where  we  should have a feeling for the Constitution

which we are now working. Why is it that when sending

off and welcoming back the Merdeka Mission there were

no  objections  raised at that time? In  fact,  every

political party had encouraged the display  of  party

flags  and  slogans.  But it might  be  that  in  the

National  Day celebrations, some of those wishing  to

participate might have their party flags  carried  by

50 to 60 people when other political parties would be

shouldering  their  party  flag  with  thousands   of

supporters.  State politics cannot be  divorced  from

the  people.  Politics play an important  part  in  a

democratic State. It is proper, however, as has  been

said  by the Hon. the Minister for Culture, that  all

political  parties in Singapore today  should  during

National Day demonstrate national unity, irrespective

of  political  ideology, religion or creed.  But  all

must aim at one ideal - a united nation in our State. I

feel,  Mr  Speaker,  we should during  National  Day

discard  all divergent views and different  political

ideologies, but we must show to the world that  in  a

State governed by a political party we are democratic

and  the political parties play an important part  in

its  administration. I cannot see any logical  reason

why  the  Opposition could not agree to  the  concept

that  all political parties should have the right  to

display their party flags during the celebration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park said that they were

surprised, suspicious or could not understand why the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara should  salute  a  political

party flag. I think the Member for Farrer Park should

remember  that  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  is  not

saluting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



the flags but that, because hundreds of thousands  of

citizens  of  Singapore are giving  respect  to  him,

therefore  he must return that salute of  respect.  I

think  it  is  only proper that the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  should duly return the salute of the  people.

All  this  goes  to show that there is a  possibility

especially  with  S.P.A. that  they  are  completely

lacking in members -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member must

understand  how  I am trying to direct  this  debate.

This  debate should be only on principles and not  on

asides, which can be offensive.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  wish to debate at length as if we are taking

part  in  a political election. We are debating  this

matter with the object of achieving our true aims. We

do  not  discuss what is the strength of a  political

party   and   its   membership.  But   if   something

undesirable  emerges as a result of  the  refusal  to

participate by a few sections, it would  not  be  the

fault  of the Opposition. We will bring home  to  the

people  that  the  manner  in  which  the  Government

celebrates the National Day celebrations is wrong. As

stated by the Member for Farrer Park, during National

Day  celebrations,  the State flag  should  have  the

respect of all people of Singapore and not just a few

sections of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development related the events

leading to the welcome organised by the Government on

the  return  of  the  Merdeka  Mission.  This  showed

clearly  the awareness of the Government to  organise

such  a  welcome with complete unanimity because  the

manner  in which it was organised was different  from

that  organised by the Government today. The previous

Government organised such a celebration by  having  a

sub-committee  comprised of  all  political  parties.

This  Celebration Committee decided that symbols  and

party  slogans would be permitted. It might  be  that

there  might be members in the Committee who did  not

agree, but on the principle of majority of votes, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



decision was accepted by all those represented in the

Committee.  So I hope it is not going  to  be  a  big

matter.  But  the  manner in  which  the  Government,

particularly  the Minister for Culture,  carried  out

the   celebrations  could  not  be  accepted  by  the

Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to answer

a  point raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for National Development. He did  say  that

when  the  victorious Merdeka Mission came back  from

England,  political  flags were  carried  about.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that was an appropriate moment  and  an

occasion when it should be carried about, because  at

that  juncture the Head of State was not involved  in

it. The basic objection on which we on the Opposition

take  our Stand is, if it is National Day and if  the

occasion merits the hoisting of the National Flag and

the presence of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, then such

an  occasion  is  an  occasion where  party  politics

should  not come up. If the Government is anxious  to

maintain  that the Parties should take  part  in  the

National Day celebrations and in the march-past, then

we  from  the  Opposition will put  forward,  in  all

seriousness, a suggestion to the Government for their

sincere consideration, that the Parties by all  means

take  part,  but we ask that each of the Parties  who

take  part carry national flags in their hands rather

than party flags.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like

to  say  a  few words on what has been  said  by  the

Member for Farrer Park just now. It is not surprising

to  us  and  it  is not wrong if during National  Day

celebrations all the various political parties  carry

their  own  party  slogans. If the political  leaders

could  demonstrate their loyalty, this will give  the

impression  to  the  people  that  they   have   only

different  views  and different political  ideologies

but  that there is no need to worry that the children

will have the impression that various political party

flags may mean different-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it being 8 p.m. Mr Speaker therefore left the

Chair  of  the  Committee and took the Chair  of  the

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to  report  that  the Committee of  Supply  has  made

progress on the Main Estimates, and ask leave to  sit
