  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Lau Ping Sum ---
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Communications whether exemption from the Certificate of Entitlement will be granted for vans and mini-buses purchased by the Handicaps Welfare Association and other voluntary welfare associations which provide transport services for the handicapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a general traffic management policy, all vehicles which contribute to traffic congestion should be subject to the same level of restraint. Exempting any particular group from such restraint would mean that the rest will have to bear a relatively heavier burden. My Ministry has therefore been very stringent in granting exemption from vehicle restraint measures like Additional Registration Fees (ARF) and Certificate of Entitlement (COE).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, all voluntary welfare organisations have been exempted from registration fee, ARF and import duty. We are currently reviewing this policy together with the Ministry of Community Development (MCD). In particular, we will study with MCD how best to help those organisations which provide special transport services for the disabled.

   <b>PULAU SAKENG</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Proposed landfill project)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider leaving Pulau Sakeng out of the proposed landfill project in view of the historical significance of the existing settlement which predates 1819.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for the Environment (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi) (for the Minister for the Environment: Sir, our landfill capacity is diminishing and will be completely used up by 1998. As there is no other suitable landfill site on the mainland, an offshore landfill has to be constructed and be ready for use by then.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Urban Redevelopment Authority, Sir, had conducted a very comprehensive study on constructing the landfill site in the outlying islands. It finally selected the proposed site as being the most suitable, with minimal impact on the existing surroundings as well as proposed land use.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed landfill will serve our needs up to the year 2045. Pulau Sakeng, or Pulau Seking as it is also called, is included in the landfill site as its surrounding shallow waters can be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reclaimed for the construction of a wharf and other supporting facilities. If Pulau Sakeng is excluded, the landfill space of the site will be smaller and exhausted seven years earlier. The wharf and other facilities will also have to be relocated at a higher cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Pulau Sakeng has historical association, Government has weighed this against the need for a landfill site that can last many years and be cost-effective to build and operate. The Member, however, can rest assured that, in implementing the project, my Ministry will exercise care to minimise the possible impact on the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that Pulau Sakeng is the last Malay kampong and is a very valuable part of our cultural heritage and that an economic value cannot be put on an inadvertent destruction of our cultural heritage?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> The Ministry is aware of this fact. But according to records, the residents are leaving the island. In 1980, it had 525 residents. In April this year, there were only 139 residents on the island and 19 of whom are actually single persons. The fact remains that the younger people are leaving the island even without resettlement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more importantly, Sir, if Pulau Sakeng were to be excluded, as I mentioned earlier, we need to spend $30 million on reclamation to build a wharf and supporting facilities elsewhere and the resulting capacity will also be reduced by one-sixth. If we were to recover this lost capacity, which amounts to about 10 million cubic metres, the perimeter bunds will have to be built in deeper waters. This would cost another $100 million. This means that we would need to spend altogether an additional sum of $130 million over and above the $1 billion that we are going to spend to build this landfill site.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Member will understand that the Government has to balance the need to spend this large sum of money with that of preserving the island.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, could the Minister of State inform the House what steps his Ministry is taking to protect the environment of that area?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, talking of the environment, we know for a fact that there are some coral reefs to the south of Pulau Semakau and steps are indeed being taken to preserve the coral site and ensure that the corals are not disturbed or destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister confirm whether the inhabitants have been asked to leave by the end of the year, and that is one of the reasons why the number is going down? And would it be possible for the Minister to revoke or shelve the order so that a dialogue can take place and we can assess the cultural value of the island?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> I am afraid I cannot confirm whether the residents have been asked to leave the island by the end of the year. But, as I mentioned earlier, even without resettlement, we found that people are leaving the island for the mainland and this trend, we believe, will continue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to dialogue, we can look into it but I am not too sure whether a dialogue will be useful in this case.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> I know that they have been given notice to quit by the end of the year. Would the Minister please consider revoking or shelving this order before a dialogue can occur, otherwise it will be too late to do that? Another supplementary question is: would the Minister give me the cost-benefit analysis of making a landfill in one of the other nearby islands rather than making a marine landfill, including Pulau Sakeng and the neighbouring islands?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I do not think we can revoke the order for the people to leave. We can have a dialogue perhaps to reduce whatever difficulties they have in trying to adapt themselves on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cost-benefit analysis, I am sure the URA has done a very complete and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> exhaustive costing and technical feasibility study of the outlying islands in Singapore and this, as I mentioned earlier, has been the final decision and suggestion of the URA.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister reconsider his decision because we go round building Malay villages and then we destroy what is authentic and real and predates 1819? Could I remind the Minister that although the younger people have left the island, the older people are there and every Sunday and weekends, the younger people visit the island and it is a thriving community of our living heritage?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I am afraid we cannot revoke the decision. With regard to the old residents living on the island, we know that too. As I mentioned earlier, the younger ones would be leaving and, in the long run, we believe the island will not be inhabited as people will continue to leave the island to live on the mainland. And mind you, even if we move the bunds to the south of Pulau Sakeng, and we allow the people to live on the island, the environment will not be that good, simply because the landfill site will be too near the people on the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister consider converting the island into a cultural attraction so that it becomes a tourist asset for us?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> We may consider that, but I do not think, frankly, it will be a useful or beneficial proposition.

   <b>NEW MEDICAL BENEFITS SCHEME</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I will be speaking on a new Government medical benefits scheme for the civil service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper on Affordable Health Care has recommended that our health care financing should be based on individual responsibility coupled with Government subsidies to keep basic health care affordable. It recommended that patients should pay directly for part of the cost of medical services which they
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> use in order to avoid the pitfall of over-consumption of medical services which are provided `free' to the patient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many employees see employer-provided medical benefits as something which they get over and above their wages. This is a misconception. In reality, the cost of medical benefits is borne by the employees themselves because it is part of the total labour cost. More benefits must mean less pay and vice versa.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the civil service provides almost free access to unlimited medical services. The Government, as the largest employer in Singapore, will take the lead in moving towards the system recommended by the White Paper by introducing a new medical benefits scheme to coincide with the forthcoming salary revisions for the civil service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new scheme is built upon the national system of health care financing, namely, Medisave and MediShield. The Government will make extra contributions to employee Medisave accounts in lieu of hospitalisation benefits. However, as Medisave does not pay for most types of outpatient treatments, the Government will retain outpatient benefits in kind. Civil servants will also be able to use MediShield II to obtain additional insurance protection when this is introduced, should they wish to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converting medical benefits to additional Medisave contributions has several advantages. It will provide for employees' hospitalisation needs, but at the same time discourage unnecessary consumption. It gives the employee the freedom to choose how to use Medisave funds. He can use them for other family members, or buy more insurance protection with MediShield II. Whereas presently all Division I officers automatically get Class A treatment, the new scheme gives them more freedom to opt for lower class wards if they wish to save money. Similarly, Division II, III and IV officers will not be tied to a particular class of ward, but will have the flexibility to upgrade or downgrade to suit their individual needs. Above all, the additional Medisave contributions
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will remain in his account and MediShield will still cover him even if he changes employers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>New Officers - Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new package to be introduced by Government will apply to employees who join the civil service on or after 1st January 1994. This new package is called Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient Scheme (MSO). Instead of hospitalisation benefits, Government will pay an additional 1% of gross monthly salary, tax-free, into the employees' Medisave account, up to the normal CPF limit of $7,000 of salary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Medisave cannot be used to pay for most types of outpatient treatments, the Government will continue to provide outpatient benefits under the MSO scheme. Currently, civil servants and their dependants get free outpatient treatment. This arrangement creates no incentive for economy. To promote greater individual responsibility in health care, civil servants will co-pay 15% of the outpatient expenses in future. Dependants who are eligible for benefits will co-pay 40%. Total subsidy for outpatient treatment per officer and family will be subject to an annual cap of $350. The amount is based on average expenditure of civil servants who used outpatient services in 1992. This should be sufficient as outpatient expenses are not expected to increase rapidly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensionable officers on the MSO Scheme will continue to receive MSO benefits after retirement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>President and Political Office Holders</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, Cabinet Ministers and other political office holders will convert to the MSO Scheme from 1st January 1994.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Serving Officers - Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will allow other serving officers to opt for the MSO
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Scheme, but it will not compel them to do so. However, the option, once exercised, is irrevocable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will revise the co-payment terms for the existing medical benefits scheme in line with the principle of personal responsibility. Currently, civil servants pay 20% of ward charges, while their dependants pay 50% of ward charges. The Government bears the remainder of the ward charges, plus all other hospitalisation charges, namely, investigations, treatment, surgical operations and drugs. From 1st January 1994, civil servants receiving medical benefits in kind will pay 15% of all hospitalisation charges, and not just 20% of ward charges. Dependants will pay 40% of all hospitalisation charges, instead of 50% of ward charges. Officers and dependants on this Scheme will also be required to co-pay for outpatient expenses, at the same rates of 15% for officers and 40% for dependants. However, there will be no cap on the subsidy for outpatient treatment because serving officers have hitherto enjoyed free and unlimited treatment at Government and restructured hospital outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Female Officers</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members of this House have asked for women to be given the same medical benefits as men. The Government has studied this question carefully in formulating the new scheme. The MSO Scheme gives female officers benefits which are closer to their male colleagues. Women on the Scheme will receive the same additional 1% Medisave contribution as the men. They can use their Medisave savings for other family members if they wish.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still a difference in treatment between female and male officers. Women on the MSO Scheme will not be eligible to claim outpatient subsidy for their husbands or dependent children. Similarly, women on the Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme will not have medical benefits extended to other family members. This is the status quo.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this is not the cost of extending equal benefits to women, but
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the principle that in our Asian society the husband is the head of the household. It is his responsibility to look after the family's needs, including their medical needs. This is how our society is structured. It would be unwise to tamper with this structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Doctors and Ancillary Medical Staff</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Government medical staff, such as doctors and nurses, receive completely free medical benefits. This is an anachronism. From 1st January 1994, serving and new medical staff will be treated in the same way as other civil servants. Restructured hospitals will also cease providing free medical benefits and instead adopt civil service practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Statutory Boards</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new medical benefits package will also apply to statutory boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Cost Implications</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current cost of providing medical benefits is approximately 1.4% of payroll. Government estimates that placing new officers on the MSO Scheme will cost about the same, which will be below the 2% cap on tax deductibility on medical benefits for private sector firms.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converting serving officers to the Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme will mean that the officers have to bear additional medical costs, amounting to 0.3% of the current manpower bill. It is, however, not Government's intention through this exercise to cut down on its manpower costs. The Government will continue to offer an attractive overall remuneration package to civil servants, competitive with the private sector, in order to retain and reward good officers and to attract fresh talent. Salary revisions for the whole civil service, which generally will more than offset the conversion to the Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme, will also be effected from 1st January 1994. Details of the salary changes will be announced when they are ready.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new medical benefits arrangements for civil service will promote personal responsibility for health and help to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> control rising health costs. We encourage the private sector to follow the lead taken by Government and convert their medical benefits in kind to additional Medisave contributions.

  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just ask the Minister for some clarifications?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, do I take it that all serving officers will continue to enjoy the same level of medical benefits, except that now they would have to make some co-payment? The level of medical benefits will be retained, as what they are presently enjoying, but they have to make some co-payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes, except for this co-payment scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Second point, Sir. What is the position of pensioners who are now already enjoying some medical benefits?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Pensioners will continue to receive their existing benefits which they received at the time of retirement. So that status quo is maintained.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> May I seek some clarifications from the Minister?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean that a civil servant can now opt to go to private sector GPs or get OPD-equivalent kind of treatment now that you have provided the co-payment system?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the pensionable staff, the Minister said that the cut-off point is 1st January 1994. Pensioners who retire on the eve of 1st January 1994 will enjoy whatever benefits that they already have. What about people who retire on 2nd or 3rd January 1994? How do you phase them out so that the forfeiture of some of the benefits will not be too painful?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned about the cap of $350 for outpatient expenses. What happens if the full sum is not used? Is it possible to provide incentives for non-use to the officer concerned, because you have saved that amount of money?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last question, Sir. There is a cap of $7,000 of salary for CPF contribution. It would appear to me that the higher salaried staff may lose out because of the limit. Is it fair that because of the salary limit imposed that these people will not enjoy the 1% compensation in medical benefits?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I will take his three points raised in turn.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, those who retire on 31st December 1993 will enjoy the existing benefits. Those who retire after 1st January 1994 would of course receive the new terms under the new package. But I have said that any loss of benefits would be more than made up by the civil service salary adjustments. That is part of the total package. I have said earlier that we view the total remuneration package of civil servants, or the private sector, as a combined package. You look at medical benefits as part of your total remuneration. And in devising this scheme, full allowance has been made for the increased cost to the civil servant in the conversion process, and this is more than made up for in the salary revisions which are planned.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, the civil servant who is going to retire after 1st January, I would presume, will enjoy the notional or, at least, the increased salary revision he is going to get, and that the retirement pay will be based on the new revised salary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> This is for retirement before 1st January?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> After 1st January.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> If the new pay package takes effect from 1st January, then of course that would be his salary base.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised is whether, if the cap of $350 is not used, it could be returned to the officer. There is no provision for that at the moment because this is a statistical figure, which is an average cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> What about the $7,000?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The $7,000 cap is imposed in the same way that we limit the contributions to CPF on the principle that those who are earning above $7,000 are already sufficiently remunerated. The salary adjustment built into the package will more than allow for the small loss they may incur by not receiving the 1% Medisave on the balance of their pay above $7,000
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I am afraid that the $7,000 is based on the gross salary and many civil servants may be affected by the salary revision and cross over the $7,000 mark, and you actually have more people not receiving the compensation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The cap is necessary. Otherwise the ratio between Division IV officers' compensation of the 1% and those who are in the higher salary range would be too large and therefore inequitable. I can assure the Member that any perceived or real loss of benefits due to the cap will be more than covered by salary adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tong Kok Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tong Kok Yeo (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to ask the Minister whether the revised salary will be on condition that the employee opts for the MSO Scheme. And secondly, whether the maternity benefits for female employees will also be incorporated under the MSO Scheme, namely, female employees will not be entitled to the medical charges incurred for maternity cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On maternity issue, I am not clear. I do not have the actual facts. I have to obtain the facts and let him know.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving officers have two choices. They can either opt for the MSO Scheme, in which case the terms of the MSO Scheme will apply to them, or they can elect to remain on the present scheme, in which case they would have to accept the Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme. So these are the two alternatives. He is free to choose.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [10th November, 1993],
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House endorses the principles and approaches set out in Paper Cmd 16 of 1993 on "Affordable Health Care" as the basis for Government policies to contain health care costs and to keep good basic health care affordable to all Singaporeans." - [Minister for Trade and Industry].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>1.00 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's health care philosophy as outlined in the White Paper on Affordable Health Care. I am happy to note that the Government has guaranteed Singaporeans access to affordable basic medical services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, health must indeed be a personal responsibility. We have to keep fit and healthy to enjoy a good quality of life. The Government, employers, unions, and the community at large have a crucial role to play. Firstly, to motivate the people to always keep healthy and fit and, secondly, when they are unfortunate to fall sick, to help them obtain good and affordable medical services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most effective way to keep health care cost down is through prevention. This calls for health education and disease prevention programmes which, effectively, reach all levels of the population. We must vigorously promote a healthy lifestyle, with good health habits, and especially to keep fit through regular exercises and to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be moderate and very careful in what we eat and drink. Employers can help their employees promote their health and well-being by implementing health promotion programmes at the various workplaces.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has pointed out that the national health expenditure is currently 3.1% of GDP. Government subsidies amount to 0.7% of GDP. The concern is that health care costs and demand for health services can increase rapidly beyond what the nation can afford. The proposed Government measures are aimed, therefore, at keeping health care generally affordable to all sections of the population, based on their need for medical services and what they are able to afford without imposing a financial hardship on their families. Here, it is crucial that the measures are carefully balanced against the provision of good quality health care for all sections of the population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question is: what is a good basic medical package? The White Paper states that "the basic package will reflect up to date good medical practice. It will contain essential and cost effective medical treatment of proven value." It also states that medical care and services in Class B2 and C wards at subvented hospitals and polyclinics, which are heavily subsidised by Government, will reflect this basic package.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an important consideration is that the basic medical package will be reviewed from time to time to incorporate advances in medical treatment. Here, we have to take heed of the ground perception of the quality of medical care and services, particularly, in the Class C wards. Some are not confident that good quality medical care and services will be available in these wards. They feel that they will not be able to get good quality medical care, good doctors and nursing care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government must ensure that good quality medical care will always be provided in the Class C wards. There must be the confidence that a reasonably good quality medical care is always available in these wards. When this is accepted, there
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will be less demand and pressure for hospitalisation at Class A and B1 wards and this will help relieve the financial burden on low and middle-income families when a member of the family falls ill and requires hospitalisation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next issue is the cost of hospitalisation in these wards, that is, the level of subsidy will not be reduced. Any increase in costs must be carefully taken. It must be kept gradual, keeping in mind what the lower and middle-income groups can afford.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me turn to the issue of employer medical benefits. Let me state at the outset that I agree that the provision of employer medical benefits should not transfer the responsibility of staying healthy from the employee to the employer, or shift the burden of payment to a third party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance has just announced the new medical benefits scheme for civil servants where new recruits will not receive hospitalisation benefits but, instead, will receive additional Medisave contribution over and above the statutory Medisave contribution. They will, however, still receive traditional outpatient benefits, but subject to a cap. It is intended to provide more freedom for them to decide on how to use the funds provided for their medical needs, including purchase of insurance coverage with MediShield II, or a Managed Healthcare System which NTUC Income and NTUC Healthcare Cooperatives are developing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more importantly, it provides a way to shift to other types of medical benefits which will not encourage over-use. In the case of the civil service revised medical benefits scheme, I think there will be some compensation in the form of additional adjustments to salaries and I hope that the two will match because workers fear that their existing medical benefits will be cut by their employers who will try to introduce changes to the medical benefits scheme to contain cost. We have to approach this issue by taking both managements' and workers' concern into consideration. This
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is a sensitive and emotive subject. By looking at the total remuneration package or the total salary, I think it gives us a way to find a solution to this problem. Any change to the employer medical benefits scheme should not reduce the value of the total remuneration or salary package.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to stress that employers must be fair and recognise that our union leaders are responsible. They want to help their companies enhance their competitiveness but, at the same time, they want to ensure that their union members and workers will continue to be provided with a good quality of health care. I would like to urge the employers and the unions to work together, share information on the challenges ahead and find solutions which safeguard the employees' health and well-being and strengthen the company's competitive position as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion. Let me stress that while we want to have measures introduced to keep the lid on health care cost, these measures should be reviewed from time to time and be carefully balanced against the need to ensure good quality health care for our people.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the NTUC has set up a Committee on Health Care Policies to examine the implications of the White Paper, especially on medical benefits for workers. The Committee is examining how employer medical benefits can be restructured to ensure that workers continue to be provided with good health care, without leading to excessive costs. As Chairman of the Committee, I wish to share our preliminary findings and position.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers currently enjoy both outpatient and hospitalisation benefits provided by employers. A recent analysis based on almost 1,000 collective agreements (CAs) in the unionised private sector reveals the following:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For outpatient treatment, the majority of companies (about 99%) allow workers free medical treatment if prescribed by a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> company doctor, or company appointed doctor. Most companies do not allow workers to consult a private doctor unless there is an emergency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hospitalisation benefits, while 20% of the CAs impose no limit to total hospitalisation charges, the remaining CAs exercise cost control through a cap on hospitalisation entitlement. Such caps come in the form of either a limit to the maximum number of days of ward stay, or a limit to the surgical or specialist fees incurred per year, or per disability, or a predetermined level of coverage under medical insurance schemes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controls on medical benefits exercised by employers have, to a large extent, prevented abuses. What is lacking are incentives to the worker and his doctor to save on medical costs. When a third party, either the employer or the insurance company, is picking up the tab, it is natural that the patient (the demand side) and his doctors (the supply side) will be less cost conscious.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply side, I fully support the Government's proposal to regulate key areas of pricing and operations of subvented hospitals and control charges of private sector Medisave patients. This will help ensure that treatment is carried out only when there is medical necessity and with the most cost-effective means.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the demand side, workers have to accept two things. First, they must realise that asking from employers better and better medical benefits, CA after CA, is not necessarily good for them. Second, they must accept certain personal responsibility in the utilisation of medical benefits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the public debate on escalating medical costs last year, some employers have expressed concern that unions have been pushing for better medical benefits in each CA negotiation. The NTUC has since advised unions that this may not be a wise thing to do. High medical costs will not only affect wages directly, it can erode the competitiveness of a company to the detriment of both the employer and the employees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find out whether our unions have taken heed of this advice, I did a check on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> all the CAs that have been signed in 1993. There are 126 of them covering almost 19,000 bargainable workers. I discovered that only four unions covering 9% of the workers have asked for their class ward entitlement to be upgraded. Two of them upgraded their ward entitlement from C to B2 and the other two upgraded from B2 to B1. On the other hand, there are three unions covering 12% of the workers which have actually lowered their class ward entitlement from B1 to B2 or from B2 to C on an optional basis. Workers who opt for a lower class ward will be given an allowance. The above observation shows that our unions have, by and large, taken our advice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the personal responsibility aspect, it is generally true that when an employee has to pay part of the medical services at the point of consumption, it will give him the incentive to use medical services responsibly. The NTUC will encourage unions to consider incorporating this aspect of personal responsibility in their future CA negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to enable unions to be receptive to such changes, we must address two legitimate concerns they have. The first is that such changes should not result in costs shifting from employers to workers. Workers should not become financially worse off for the same benefits they enjoy. Second, the effects on older workers have to be specially looked into as they are more likely to use medical services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be taking the lead as the largest employer. For new recruits, they will receive additional Medisave contributions over and above the statutory Medisave contributions. The Finance Minister has earlier briefed us on the new scheme but he has not touched on what the MediShield II Scheme will be like. Because for those who opt for the MSO Scheme, they will have to use their Medisave to purchase medical services. At the moment, they cannot use that to purchase an insurance scheme and we know that the existing MediShield Scheme is too conservative. So we look forward to the new scheme and we hope that the improved MediShield or MediShield II
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should provide sufficient hospital coverage for them and their dependants without depleting their Medisave. As choosing a level of medical services to suit one's needs is not a straightforward matter, the Government should provide consumer education to the new recruits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing Government employees are already paying 20% of their hospital ward charges. They are concerned about the co-payment they have to make for treatment charges and whether Government will give them enough compensation in terms of wages. This fear of uncertainty is particularly felt among the older employees. In fact, many of them hope that they can opt to stay in the existing scheme, ie, to continue to enjoy the treatment free of charge. And even if change is certain, they would want to know whether the Government would allow them to buy an insurance plan to cover their co-payment. In other words, because they are old and they know that they are prone to be hospitalised, they do not know whether they can afford the co-payment. So for the co-payment part, they would like to buy an insurance plan so that they are fully covered. I wish to seek the view of the Government on this matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the private sector, there are a number of possibilities for employer medical benefits to include an element of personal responsibility. First, it can be in the form of deductibles or co-insurance, although the latter will be more difficult to accept for older workers. Deductibles are likely to be acceptable because there is less uncertainty. Savings through the new introduction of deductibles can be passed back to the workers. Alternatively, employers can consider setting up reimbursement accounts that employees can use to satisfy deductibles and co-insurance or pay for uncovered health care services. According to our CA analysis, more and more companies are adopting medical insurance policies to cover workers' hospitalisation expenses. The percentage of companies with medical insurance policies is now 31% compared to 10% in 1989. These policies
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have no deductibles or co-insurance although there are caps on the entitlement. There is therefore a need to increase the element of personal responsibility in this regard.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, unions can consider co-payment if employers are prepared to extend medical benefits to dependants, just like the Government has done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, employers, with the support of unions, can convert their medical benefits to the Managed Healthcare System (MHS) which NTUC INCOME and NTUC Healthcare Cooperative will be offering next year. MHS is different from a normal medical insurance scheme. Physicians in the normal insurance scheme have no incentive to save on medical costs because they are paid on a fee-for-service basis. Under the MHS, which provides for primary, specialist and hospital care, physicians providing primary care will be paid on a capitation basis, ie, a fixed sum per member regardless of the actual utilisation of medical care. This will minimise over-treatment by the physicians, who will be given incentives to serve as "gatekeepers" to keep out unnecessary specialist and hospital treatments. At the same time, co-payments for consultation and cappings or deductibles for hospital care will be introduced to promote personal responsibility. A system of providing rebates to members who do not make excessive use of medical care will also be put in place. Monitoring the utilisation of medical care and the treatment outcomes will be done to ensure that members receive good quality care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managed health care is not new in Singapore. Our system of polyclinics, secondary and tertiary public hospitals offer a form of managed health care. We should bring managed health care into the private sector and the NTUC MHS will be an attractive scheme to treat patients in the most cost effective way. NTUC hopes to discuss with the Ministry of Health the details of the scheme so as to obtain their support to treat MHS as an approved health care plan to draw on Medisave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper on health care is a result of realising the immense difficulties faced by the advanced countries in the West, in their health care problems. This White Paper provides a health care programme which will not burden our State and our people. I fully support the philosophy of the White Paper that the State should provide health care to every one, including the poor and destitute who cannot afford to pay for their health care expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of space has been spent on explaining how to curb rising medical cost due to uncontrolled medical cost and consumption. I agree with the two approaches mentioned in the White Paper. Firstly, avoiding the stimulation on excessive medical consumption due to health care over supply of services. Secondly, we should curb those unnecessary medical demand due to over-subsidy and free medical care. There are many reasons for the long-term increase in health care cost. Many MPs have already spoken on this. But I feel there are two major reasons. Firstly, the general rise in costs and, secondly, the increased consumption of health care. The former is an economic issue which is directly linked to the rise in prices in the market place, and it is not easy to curb or to overcome it. But the latter, I think if we can curb the excessive use of our health care services, we will be able to moderate the rate of increase in health care cost. If we can curb or put a restraint on those unnecessary consumption of health care service, I think we will achieve our purpose. However, the recommendations in the White Paper seem to be in conflict with the general principle. We should study them more carefully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, doctor to population ratio. The White Paper mentioned that the present ratio is one doctor to 800 people and by the year 2000, the ratio will be increased to one doctor to 650 people. The number of specialists will be 40% of the number of doctors. This doctor-to-people ratio and the ratio of specialists to general practitioners are quite similar to those in the UK. We know that the UK government has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> met with immense difficulties in their health care system. So this makes me wonder whether the ratio that we propose is advisable. Is it higher than that in the UK? Is the rate correct? If you take into account the density of population in UK, we will find that our doctor-to-population ratio is much higher than in the UK. I think we should re-consider it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the principle outlined in the White Paper which mentioned that the medical demand is supply initiated, the over-supply of medical services, including doctors, the health care cost is bound to go up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Medisave. The White Paper recommends that we should increase the Medisave contribution rate in order to make up for the increase in health care cost. Eventually, it will be increased to 10% of the salary. Although Medisave is a good scheme, we should understand that Medisave is also a contributing factor towards rising health care cost. We observe that more than half of the newborn babies in Singapore are delivered in private hospitals and that 17% of patients who live in A class wards are earning salaries of less than $1,000 per month. Why is this so? I feel that this is because of the generous use of Medisave fund. I do not think it is a good move to increase the contribution rate to Medisave, because the direct result will be that there will be big sums of money in the people's Medisave accounts. It cannot be used for other purposes except to purchase medical services. People would then tend to use this money for their medical expenses, excessively and wastefully. I feel that there should be other ways in place of the proposed increase in the contribution rate towards Medisave, such as allowing the account holders to transfer a limited sum of money from their Ordinary Account to Medisave account to pay for their medical expenses. This will give them flexibility to make use of thei6r Ordinary Account for medical expenses or to use it on buying property and investment. In this way, it could heop in avoiding the rising health care cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, private medical insurance. I feel that this scheme, if not handled properly
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will lead to wastage in medical expenses. If we do not restrain the use of private medical insurance, we will fall into a trap similar to that of the US medical insurance. Fortunately, these private medical insurance schemes are not quite popular in Singapore. The White Paper mentions that we can use Medisave to pay for private medical insurance. I do not think it is a good move because this will encourage more people to buy medical insurance. The White Paper also mentions the fact that the medical insurance companies have been spending 22% of their budget on administration. If, including the profit of the insurance company less than 70% of the premium will be used on medical expenses. The medical insurance scheme, directly leads to the increase in health care cost. If we allow Medisave to pay for the private medical insurance, we will encourage people to participate in private medical insurance schemes. I do not think this is a good move. If there is any good reason for having a specific medical insurance, it should be run by a non-profit making enterprise, every citizen should participate in this scheme and with some form of co-payment like MediShield. In this way, the insured will use his own resources to pay for part of his medical expenses to avoid excessive and unnecessary medical consumption. With more people participating, it will be more cost effective and the premiums could be reduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also mentions about the implementation of MediShield II. However, the White Paper does not give details on the implementation of this scheme, except stating that the insured patients be allowed to use this to pay for A class ward expenses. This will certainly lead to the consumption of more medical services. People would then choose to stay in the A class ward because of this scheme, otherwise, he would just stay in a B1 class ward. This will run counter to the principle of the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the comments I have made above, I would like to support this motion.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck (Nominated Member):</b> May I first refer to Mr Low Thia Khiang's point that the Government is duty-bound to provide for the medical needs of the people. I think those of us who have read the White Paper can clearly see that that is precisely what the Government is trying to do. The Government spells out a health care philosophy based on the five fundamental objectives. If the Opposition Member has read them, he should say whether those objectives are fundamentally wrong or whether he has better ideas than those fundamental objectives. Because the very purpose is to ensure that we have a health care system that is: (a) sound, (b) equitable, (c) fair, (d) sustainable, and (e) not detrimental to the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government cannot promote an irresponsible free spending system that will bankrupt the country. Minister Dhanabalan had yesterday explained that all subsidies are ultimately paid for by the people. If we run into debt, then we are talking about following the western world that actually makes the future generations pay for what they consume today. I think that is not allowed and, in fact, it should be the duty of the Government to keep away from such pitfalls. The fact is that users of health care must pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree that we owe it to ourselves individually to keep fit and healthy. But from the report we are just talking about 14% of Singaporeans who are actually actively exercising. So the Government intends to give the individual maximum incentives to stay healthy, save on its medical expenses and avoid unnecessary consumption, resulting in huge wastage. On the question of incentives, probably we could venture a little further. As we all agree, prevention is better than cure. A fit and healthy individual actually benefits the company and the country as well as himself. Therefore, we should introduce even more incentives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the State, what about following the National Service reservists' fitness scheme where we could give them some incentives, maybe a personal allowance of $1,000 per annum, based on a certificate of fitness, and not entitlement, if they keep fit? What about rewarding those who do not consume the State's
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> health care expenditure? It is like the insurance no-claim bonus. And if they do not claim it, we can waive or pay for their MediShield premium because they are not consuming the State's expenditure on health care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about allowing discounted entries into sports facilities? Could it be that our sports facilities are charging exorbitantly that very few can actually have regular exercises? Even credit card companies give discounts for those who spend using their cards. What about lucky draws? We have a lot of condominiums to go by for lucky draws if they do not consume medical services. We have got to think of ways of getting people to maximise the incentives, and getting people to be concerned and actually put it on themselves. After a while it becomes natural that they will stay fit and healthy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of MediShield II is good. The unions are worried that employers would just pass the buck to the workers but I think the union leaders are responsible. So are the employers' group. Under such a tight labour situation, they cannot just get away. But as the two Ministers have spoken, at the end of the day, whatever the company pays for, it is part of the wage package. That is clear. But the 2% cap on salaries is not fair to the lower income earners. I think the executive workers are drawing a higher salary and topping up 2% on their salary is not fair. I am happy the Minister for Finance has said that for the civil service they are capping the 1% up to $7,000 of salary. But a fairer thing would be a quantum for the two groups: an executive group and a non-executive group. Probably even the age group has got to be taken into consideration. The civil service is talking about a cap of $350. So if the employers' group is also paying in that region, probably we could have, instead of percentages, a fixed quantum, to be fair to the lower income earners. It does not mean that the higher income earners will fall sick more often and need more medical attention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans are actually worried about the affordability of the future. That is why, on and off, when we talk about the cost of living, the retirees
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are a group that we single out. Very soon, many of us Singaporeans will be on the retiring bench. So one way to actually allay this fear is to have a special retirement account. On good years the Finance Minister has been very generous in giving a 5% or 10% tax rebate. Probably, in future, instead of giving tax rebates, where they actually net off the cash, we could start a Retirement Account where the 5% or 10% tax rebate could go into that account. Over the years, they could accumulate a huge sum and they know that when they retire there is a sum for them to draw on for their old age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health care cost component is something that we should look at. In the White Paper, we seem to have left out the doctors' participation. It is as if they do not matter. From what I read of the Singapore Medical Association's latest November Report, they were invited on Wednesday, 3rd November, to a feedback session to give their comments. They came out with a quick comment. They said that it was too short a time for them to study the White Paper. So it suggests to me that the different medical bodies have not been consulted. The report says that "the medical profession supports the general principle enunciated in the White Paper towards providing affordable health care for our people. It is our hope that the views described would contribute towards the successful implementation." So this suggests to me that they have not been consulted. Very quickly, they came out with the fear about the capping of the CPF and whether that will affect their income. They also go on to say, if I can quote the editorial:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One is likely to blame the doctor when health care costs go up. Besides the doctor's fees and the service fees described above, there are also administrative costs and it is important that these two are kept down. Doctors are at the mercy of free market forces too, the cost of premises and staff salaries ...'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what they are trying to say here is, do not just blame the poor doctors. But they are those who buy a lot of bungalows! The health care cost components are the doctor's fees, drugs, laboratory tests, hospital charges, operating theatre charges, and so on and so forth. Actually, the doctors also have the incentive to be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> doctors in that you are capping the number of doctors. As Assoc. Prof. Low has questioned earlier, is that capping itself sound in the long term? We seem to have missed out on the pressure from the fact that we are promoting ourselves as the medical hub.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mention is made in the White Paper about the impact of the foreign nationals seeking treatment in Singapore. The ratio is 1:650. But those who come here for medical treatment are the people who are coming here to exert the pressure. Very often, we know that specialists do charge the foreign nationals higher charges than Singaporeans. I was told of this, but I do not know how far it is true. How much of the incomes of these specialists and the hospitals actually come from foreign nationals? I think that part is not reflected in the White Paper. If we are promoting ourselves as a medical hub, more pressure will be here, and how does that impact on us. The pressure of charges from there actually goes up. The nursing staff and the administrative staff in the private sector hospitals like to treat the foreign nationals because they also tip them very well, they pay very well, and they are less fussy than Singaporeans. I was told of this when I visited them. There is no fuss in getting through the CPF and Medisave approval and things like that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is the medicine fee versus the non-medicine charges. We were told at one feedback session that the medicines that the Government has in the hospitals, they actually charge something like five to seven times their cost. We do not know whether there should be a cap in the way medicine is priced. Even for a simple non-medicine thing like cotton wool and the gauze, they are charged at very high prices and different clinics and hospitals charge them differently.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Just a clarification. Is Mr Chia referring to the subsidised hospitals or the private hospitals?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> In general. We got the feedback from someone who is actually in the business of supplying medicine.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> He said that the price that they tendered versus the price that is ultimately put up in the market shows something like five to seven times. There is no mention in the White Paper whether the medicine cost could be actually capped. The doctor is providing a service, so he charges a fee. Based on his experience and the kind of treatment, the length of visit, the type of sickness, he has to charge different rates. But must he profit out of medicine? Must he profit out of all these other supplies? He has also got people who go back to him just to collect medicine the second time. Is consultation fee applicable or should it be cheaper for repeat visits, which are basically going back to collect medicine?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have doctors talking about rentals and the premises that they have got to pay. My fellow colleague, Dr Toh Keng Kiat, has asked once whether there should be designated Housing and Development Board shops. They have to tender together with the jewellers and the traders and whether that could be transformed. At the way things are going, that may form a big part of the cost and we should study that. Could they operate out of void decks, for instance? Town Councils may allow void decks to be used. Could they operate out of their homes? I do not know. That will take away the element of rental cost. All these have to be studied.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of hospital beds, we already have reports that the private hospitals are worried that there are too many beds. And too many beds would mean that they will charge a higher fee. It does not mean that it will be cheaper. Unlike hotels, when there are too many rooms, the rates go down. In this case, they just pass it on because patients have no choice as to which doctor to go to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, I think the Government has done the right thing in that we must actually have a system where the people have got to pay when they consume, and there is no end to it. I am disappointed that the Opposition Members are not here to say how they feel. We may have reserves, but how long can these reserves last if there is no cap and no co-responsibility?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, there is one area that I am not very comfortable with, which is the control of ICUs. The reason is that ICU is the most expensive service. But is the White Paper telling us that there are too many ICUs around? There must be a need for them before you have that number of beds in the ICUs. So you cannot just, because of cost, reduce the number of ICUs. It must certainly be based on the needs and demand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper on Affordable Health Care has been published with the object of controlling the rise in medical cost and ensuring the people enjoy affordable health care. This White Paper deserves to be highly commended by all of us. However, there are some recommendations in the Report which can be further improved. Let me touch on only four points:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the White Paper recommends that the maximum growth in revenue for a hospital should be calculated by a formula of CPI plus X. This formula contains the variable "X", which will be determined by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance. When formulating this formula of CPI plus X formula, there is a presumption that CPI is something which is already accepted by all and, hence, uncontroversial. But the fact does not appear to be so. CPI has been hotly criticised and became an issue when we debated the Cost Review Committee's Report last month. Now, the White Paper has adopted the formula of CPI plus X as the cap for the maximum revenue of our hospitals. This will again give rise to controversy among members of the public. At the same time, X, as a variable, is also very ambiguous. It can be more, it can also be less. But very often it will not be a negative figure. If it represents something that is going up all the time or most of the time, then this will add on to the burden of the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the White Paper recommends that the proportion of doctors in subvented hospitals be fixed at 60% for general practitioners and 40% for specialist doctors. My question here is: by
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> so doing, will it give rise to a brain drain from subvented hospitals to the private hospitals? Because the private hospitals are better in financial resources and they can employ better trained and talented specialists, especially now that the Government's policy is to restrict the number of specialist doctors in practice in Singapore. This measure will, all the more, cause a possible brain drain of specialists from Government hospitals to the private hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the White Paper also refers to the total number of beds in the hospitals. These beds are meant for patients in general. My view is that in the White Paper there is lack of attention given to the aged sick, people who are sick because of old age. No attention has been given to this in the White Paper. These aged sick people do not really need plenty of medical care. All they need is the availability of hospital beds for them to recuperate or to sleep in. With the aging population in Singapore, and with the rising life expectancy in Singapore, there will be more and more of such "patients". Therefore, the White Paper should have made some provisions for these "patients".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, because the cost of training a doctor is high, and in order to control such costs, can we not consider the development of some kind of para-medics between doctors and nurses, so that these para-medics can provide the services in hospitals or the polyclinics to look after people who need only health care, rather than medical care?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak on this motion standing in the name of the Minister for Trade and Industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I find this White Paper quite sensible, contrary to what has been echoed about free market health care system not so long ago.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many of the aged and to many of the retirees, I think this White Paper and the policies it spells out are a great relief. This White Paper, I believe, rests on sound economic and social perceptions. It recognises at the outset that the public health care system constitutes a unique
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> case for market failure and that regulatory controls should be made in order to generate an outcome that is equitable, choice-friendly and affordable. In going from this starting point of goal-setting to the end point of achieving the outcomes, one has to trespass a whole minefield of controls, levers, pressure points, compulsions, regulations, and incentives. That is the menu of health care systems all over the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the White Paper is quite clearly written, I do not think that the process will be so simply administered neat, cut-and-dry. At the end of the day, some loopholes, some bypasses will be exploited, mismatch between means and ends in this complex system will recur. Nonetheless, by starting on the right footing, as I think this White Paper has, we will hopefully avoid the pitfalls of cost escalation in health care that is found in many of the developed countries, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, and, hopefully, avoid some of the mistakes in developing a viable and economically efficient and affordable health care system in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore spends about 3.1% of our GDP on health expenditures compared with 13% for the United States, 6% to 9% for the OECD countries, and about 6% for Japan. It may appear that we are very low compared to the developed countries, but we must remember that we are a relatively young population compared with them. In fact, the percentage of our people over 65, as found in the Report, in the total population is about half of theirs. As people age, more is spent on medical and health expenses. Hence, we should address the problem seriously now in order that we should avoid the problems faced by them presently. Yet while I can understand the range of regulations and control measures the Government intends to administer for our affordable health care system, I urge the Government not to throw away competition from the bathtub. They must basically allow competition to enjoin within the parameters set by the Government. The health care market should be wisely governed and not allowed to operate unbridled.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the White Paper, I have two points to make here. One concerns the cap the Government intends to set in terms of the average revenue per patient day. Just now my colleague, Mr Chin, has mentioned about the problem of X. It is indeed mentioned in the White Paper that the Government will set the maximum percentage growth in revenue allowed each year to the CPI plus X (where X is the control variable). This control variable is supposed to represent productivity increase and medical progress.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how the Ministry intends to compute this productivity increase and medical progress rate. If they know of a method, I am eager to know of it. Also, it is mentioned that this rate X will not be revised annually, but only once every few years. I remember in the Cost Review Committee Report debate, it was quite clear that one of the recommendations is that the increases in fees, etc. should be gradually done in order to make adjustments easier for the people. It seems to me there are some anomalies here. On page 39 of the White Paper, it is mentioned that "to give hospitals some stability in planning, X will not be revised annually, but only once every few years". But in page 40, the last sentence reads:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They should give people adequate warning of price changes, and make more frequent but smaller price adjustments instead of infrequent large adjustments."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope during the course of this debate some clarification on this may be made.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make is that the Government should appoint a special medical audit body to verify and ensure that the regulations and controls, and the charges and the rates, are observed in true spirit and in law by the hospital bodies. This will give periodic adjustments in rate-setting and standard-setting greater credibility. It will also ensure that timely feedback on the whole system is possible. The working of this complex system of affordable health care will be closely monitored by this specialist auditor body. It will help the Government in achieving its goal of affordable health care and provide, hopefully, true and fair views on the whole system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wan Soon Bee (Brickworks GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me begin by congratulating the Government on the publication of the White Paper on Affordable Health Care. The question of affordable health care has been one with which I have been most concerned for the past few years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constant interaction with the ordinary man-in-the-street, I understand how concerned our citizens are with the rapidly rising health care costs. The perception of many lower and middle-income families is that in time to come, they may not be able to afford the medical charges in our hospitals. I have often spoken in the past on the need to contain health care costs in Singapore. And I am glad that the Government has set up a Ministerial Committee to study the issue. I fully support the basic philosophy of dual responsibility which underpins the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience has also shown that pure market forces cannot be permitted to work freely in an area as vital as health care. Health care is a basic human need and it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that each and every Singaporean can afford it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If market forces were permitted to work without some intervention from the Government, very soon a large proportion of Singaporeans would find even the most basic health care beyond their reach. This would be totally unacceptable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I feel it is correct that the citizen should also bear a portion of the health care costs. First, we do not wish to foster a welfare state mentality in our citizens. Second, by making the citizen bear some of the costs, it will help discourage unnecessary consumption and wastage of precious resources. We have seen that countries where health care is free now face a problem of excessive and uncontrollable demand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in trying to curb the demand for health care and to cap health care costs, we must vigilantly guard against
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> taking things to such an extreme that citizens with genuine health problems are prejudiced. We must ensure that the basic package, which is being proposed in the White Paper, must be as comprehensive as possible. It must provide for all the basic health care needs of even the poorest Singaporean.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, on the whole, the White Paper has adequately addressed many of the concerns expressed both in Parliament and by the man-in-the-street. It is now up to the Government to implement the proposal in such a way that we achieve the stated aim of a good and affordable health care for all Singaporeans. We must present the proposed basic package in as positive a manner as possible so that the basic package will not be misconstrued as being second rate and providing only the bare minimum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, while I feel that the White Paper has addressed most problems, I am, nonetheless, concerned and feel that there are certain areas which will require more careful study. For example, while I agree that it is not always possible or wise to keep a terminally ill patient alive via high-tech and expensive machines regardless of his quality of life, I, nonetheless, feel it vital to provide proper safeguards and guidelines to ensure that a decision of such monumental proportions as deciding whether a human being is to be kept alive, or allowed to die, should be made only after the most careful consideration. In making decisions of this nature, our guiding principle cannot be the issue of costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that the Government must make adequate provision so that citizens who, through no fault of their own, are stricken with serious and chronic illnesses will not be financially debilitated by the costs of getting necessary treatment. For example, patients who require regular kidney dialysis face, together with their families, serious financial burdens. Many kidney patients are constrained to forgo necessary treatment, or to undergo dialysis less often than recommended, because they simply cannot afford the treatment. In such cases, I urge the Government to be compassionate and to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> provide greater financial assistance. I feel that these cases need to be treated as exceptions and, therefore, subsidised more generously.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point I should like to make is in connection with the private sector patients using Medisave. I understand that there will be a cap on charges above Medisave limits for such patients. While this is necessary, measures must be taken by the Government to ensure that such patients are not given second best treatment as a result of the control on the charges which may be imposed by the private hospitals. As far as encouraging competitiveness and efficiency amongst hospitals is concerned, I think we should be circumspect. While some competition is necessary, hospitals must be monitored to make sure that they do not cut corners just to maintain maximum returns on their investments or that health care is sacrificed for economic efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that more emphasis needs to be placed on the importance of preventive medicine. The best way to ensure that the nation's health care bill does not escalate is to teach our citizens to be as healthy as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that medical students, doctors and other health care givers must make it their top priority to inculcate in our citizens an awareness of the need to practise preventive medicine. Doctors and other health care givers should not simply be concerned with healing the sick, they are not simply dispensers of medicines. They should also be teachers. They must concern themselves with teaching patients how to stay healthy and prevent illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I welcome the recent efforts of the Ministry in vigorously promoting a healthy lifestyle for Singaporeans as well as in advocating the beneficial effects of exercises. Here, perhaps some incentives would be useful to encourage more people to participate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me sum up by saying that the guiding principle in providing affordable health care must always be to ensure that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> all the basic health care needs of even the poorest citizen are met at a cost which both the nation and the individual citizen can comfortably afford.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is undoubtedly a difficult task to balance the need to contain health care costs against the need to provide all the basic health care needs of our citizens. However, I am confident that the Government, together with the guidance of the Ministry of Health, will find a way to meet this challenge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is an excellent example of the responsiveness of the Government to the issues that affect and concern Singaporeans. The White Paper is indeed timely as many of us have been concerned about the rising costs of basic amenities and services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the hon. Members of this House have spoken about the various general issues that have been examined in the White Paper. I would like to limit my comments and suggestions to two areas. These are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The importance of ensuring that the reliance on competition and market forces to improve health care services is sufficiently balanced by Government intervention to keep costs down; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The need to ensure that employers are encouraged to provide sufficient medical coverage for their employees without creating a mentality of over-use of limited resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the first point. Ideally, it is not a good idea for intervention by way of capping medical fees. However, we do not live in an ideal world. Singaporeans who would carefully weigh and choose the options available in purchasing their daily necessities and even their homes are far less likely to be able to exercise informed choice when it comes to medical care. Most of us would spare no expense in obtaining what is perceived as the best medical care for ourselves and our loved
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ones. In our minds, there is a mystique about the doctor and, very often, we do not question his or her judgments and pronouncements. Our perception of what is best, or even what is good, is often not accurate when it comes to medical care. A lack of information and knowledge would result in Singaporeans spending substantial funds on cost ineffective treatments. An informed choice is often not possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where an informed choice is not possible, it is the role of the Government to monitor and guide market forces. In this respect, the proposal to control the balance billing for patients using Medisave in private sector hospitals is certainly welcome. The White Paper, however, is somewhat terse on the details as to how this control of balance billing is to be carried out. I would suggest that a scale of fees for treatments and procedures be set out. The present SMA Guideline on Fees can be a good starting point. Such a list of treatments and procedures should be sufficiently wide and extensive to ensure that common and necessary treatments are covered. If the list is generally accepted by medical practitioners and patients as a list of accepted and effective treatments, then doctors who depart from the list of treatments would have to explain the need for such departure to their patients, who can then make an informed decision whether to proceed with the treatment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am somewhat concerned about the suggestion in the White Paper that we move to a mechanism of Diagnosis-Related Group to control the total amount a hospital can bill for a particular type of illness, regardless of the number of days a patient stays in the hospital or the type of tests or medication ordered for him. On the face of it, this sounds like a good proposal to curb unnecessary stays in hospital and unnecessary treatment. However, the proposal would tempt some doctors and private hospitals who may be less high-minded to carry out all sorts of treatment right up to the limit of the cap and then to discharge patients, whether or not they have recovered. In countries like the United States, the availability of insurance coverage has resulted
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in some hospitals admitting and discharging patients based on the extent of coverage, rather than on the medical care required. If a wider role is to be given to the private sector to provide health care without increasing costs, then it is inevitable that a greater extent of control would be required for the good of all Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation that greater emphasis be placed on primary health care, especially in the training of doctors, would play a critical part in reducing the high costs incurred in the treatment in hospitals, whether public, subvented or private. A strong commitment towards personal responsibility for one's own health, coupled with a good primary health care system would result in a healthier population. This means that less people would be hospitalised, and therefore leading to greater savings for the individual, employers and the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to my second area of concern, ie, sufficient medical coverage for employees. Sir, the entire objective and thrust of this White Paper is the need to ensure affordable health care. The White Paper has encouraged employers to make voluntary Medisave contributions in lieu of part of their traditional medical benefits in kind. The tax free nature of such contributions would be capped at 2% of total remuneration. I am of the view that such a cap must be constantly reviewed and not only be decreased but also should be increased, if necessary. The fear that too much payment into the Medisave account would result in unnecessary health care expenditure would not come true, if there is a controlled fee structure for treatment and procedures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should not use the proposal to substitute in-house health care schemes with higher voluntary Medisave payments and cut back on health care benefits presently being given. It would be ironic that a proposal to ensure affordable health care is misapplied by some black sheep employers to reduce the coverage given to employees. I am confident that the good rapport between employers and the unions will ensure that the proposals are equitably implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has emphasised the importance of the promotion of personal reliance for one's health. Employers should provide opportunities, facilities and education for their employees to maintain and improve their health. Funds spent by employers on such schemes should not be subjected to a cap specified for tax-free medical benefits. Such expenditure is an investment both for the employer, who would enjoy a healthy and productive workforce, and for the employee, who would be able to stay in good health longer and reserve his Medisave funds for the inevitable ravages of old age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that the White Paper is a landmark document that is both comprehensive and farsighted. It boldly addresses issues and problems that will arise and proposes appropriate solutions. The next step is to obtain feedback from the ground and fine-tune the proposals. A good start has been made and I am confident that we will have a health care system that will serve us well into the next century.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, why are we here to review our health care service? Why are we discussing affordable health care now? Many people have complained that the expenditure on medical services by our Government took up only 2.5% to 3.1% of our GDP. Singapore has great achievements today because the people of Singapore and the Government have farsighted planning and they have always made preparations for eventualities. In recent years, the development in our medical services and health care has achieved very good results. Many developing countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and even developed countries like Sweden and the United States have sent their experts to Singapore to study our health care and Medisave systems. Many Western countries are facing the problem of rising health care costs. In the United States, about 40 million people do not enjoy
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> medical insurance. In Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, on the surface, the people are enjoying very low medical care but, in actual fact, they have to wait for a very long time before they could receive treatment for a very simple problems, eg, for surgical operations on cataract or piles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to read from the White Paper on Affordable Health Care published by the Government some of the good suggestions or recommendations they have made on controlling medical cost. This once again proves that the Singapore Government and the people are able to make preparation and to discuss problems before they surface. I support this attitude and approach and I also support the basic objectives and principles of the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper recommends that everybody looks after his own health care and be concerned over his own health. It is imminent to provide affordable and good health care for everybody while we let the market forces decide its cost with Government intervention only when necessary. While I support the principle set out in this White Paper, I would like to raise some of my personal views and to reflect some of the views of the workers on the White Paper. I hope that when the Government is implementing the recommendations of the White Paper, they would emphasise more on how to educate the people so that the people will have more confidence in the Government. The most important thing now is to let the people have confidence in us. Then we will be able to implement our plans smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, demand and supply. As I have said, I agree with the Government's control on medical cost and, if necessary, to intervene directly in the health care sector when the market fails to keep health care cost down. But we must also ensure that the employers will not pass the buck and will not reduce the medical benefits that are being given to their employees. Because when we implement this plan, the important thing is to control health care cost. So we must try and retain as much as we can the medical benefits
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that are now being given to the employees. As for those who are about to retire, particularly those in the lower income group and daily-rated workers, we have to look after their medical needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the demand side, as a unionist and a labour MP, we feel that we should educate the workers so that they would adopt a correct attitude when making use of medical services. Just now my colleague also mentioned that there were very few unions requested the employers to increase medical benefits for their employees. In fact, many of them are reducing the benefits given to them. As far as workers are concerned, the majority of them are adopting a very proper and reasonable attitude. We hope that the Government would ensure that those people who make use of B2+, B2 and C class beds would feel that they are getting what they have paid for so that they have more confidence in the Government, and that the people would feel that they are well looked after by the Government when they fall sick.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, all the expenditure of the country is being borne by the people who have to pay taxes. So we should look after them when they are sick. I believe our people would understand that they have the responsibility to look after their own health. But as an employer, particularly the Government being the biggest employer in Singapore, when they are implementing this new medical plan, they should not let the people lose confidence in it. We must let the people know that our purpose is not to reduce cost but to control cost in the long term. We must convince our people that they should share their medical cost by paying part of the medical expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the employer is concerned, medical cost is part of their labour cost. But we must not reduce the medical benefits in order to save costs. As it is, the Government has already announced that there will be a capping of 2% of the total payroll which can be tax deductible. This is a reasonable percentage at this point of time. But five years later, it may not be appropriate. We should let this capping stagnate at 2%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this White Paper, it is mentioned that part of the benefits would be replaced. In fact, many people are worried. I hope that as the biggest employer, the Government would further explain to the people so that they could understand the whole concept.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that we would allow Medisave to be used for outpatient treatment. When the lower income workers go to the outpatient clinics for further investigations such as an X-ray examination, they would have to pay cash for the treatment. Some of these workers who are in the lower income group cannot afford the outpatient treatment fees which they have to pay by cash and so they opt to be hospitalised so that they could use Medisave. I think that is not the right thing to do. We should review this and allow Medisave to be used for outpatient investigations such as X-rays, etc.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the basic medical package. The White Paper has recommended the setting up of a specialist consultation committee. I hope that this committee would regularly review the package so that the items included in the package will not remain the same all the time, because medical science is advancing every day. On the one hand, we do not want people to waste money by having too excessive medical investigations. But there are some surgical operations which need to be done, eg, coronary heart disease and some operations which are not available in the C class beds. I hope that this could be reviewed so that in future years, such an operation can also be included in the basic medical package. We can accept the package as it is today but it has to be reviewed from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has also mentioned the exclusion of certain chronic diseases which will have to be treated on a long term basis from the package. Of course, this would be a burden on the patient as well as his family members. Being sick is something which is inevitable. We cannot talk only about economic benefits all the time. We have also to look after old people who are suffering from chronic diseases. If they are to stay in a traditional hospital, it will be difficult. We should encourage
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> more people to set up voluntary or community hospitals. I know there are many organisations which have set up community hospitals to serve the chronic sick people. I think the Government should give them more support in their endeavour to set up such hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to touch on is the formula for the control of medical cost, ie, CPI plus X variable. This variable has also caused some alarm to the people, because this X variable would be decided by the hospital authorities and the Ministry of Finance. It has no direct link to our salary or wage increase. I think we should take this into consideration when we decide the X variable. I hope that the X variable should not be increased more than the actual wage increase of the workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking about how to control and reduce medical cost. On the other hand, we should emphasise more on how to encourage the people to keep fit, to be healthy, and to give them some incentive so that they would want to keep fit. Maybe we should give them better interest rate for their Medisave accounts. The Minister for Finance mentioned just now that female civil servants would also enjoy an additional 1% contribution to their Medisave accounts and that they could make use of this benefit to pay for their family members' medical expenses. We have been asking in this Parliament for more than 20 years for medical benefits of female civil servants to be extended to their husband and children, but the Finance Minister has persistently rejected our plea. I feel that we are also working very hard for our people. We are contributing to the country. Therefore, the Minister for Finance should consider giving us equal pay for equal work. There should not be discrimination between the male and female civil servants. We would have to continue "fighting" for this. Perhaps, we should have more female MPs in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I would like to raise here is how to make the people understand the purpose and contents of the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> We should let the people know how to effectively make use of all the medical and health care facilities, such as MediShield, Medisave and some form of medical insurance for retirees. I think we should let our people know that everyone has a responsibility to keep fit. Of course, we have one Opposition Member saying that keeping fit is the Government's responsibility, not the individual's responsibility. But I feel that we should make the people understand that it will be for their own good to keep fit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see in the newspapers every day many advertisements on "fat reducing tea" and all sorts of fat burners and other methods of slimming. I think we should also educate our people on how to choose the right type of medicine. They should also learn how to adopt preventive measures. For the factory operators, they should know how to look after their own health, such as their hands, their back and their eyes. We should inculcate in our people the habit of regular exercise. I think we should establish a committee for this purpose. In fact, I would suggest that the Government set up a "National Keep Fit Committee". The duty of the committee is to promote some long term health-care programme to educate the people on how to look after themselves and on occupational health and also the advantages of keeping fit. It will also help the lower income people to realise the importance of keeping fit. This National Keep Fit Committee will play a very important role and should have representatives from the unions and the medical practitioners. They could be formed in conjunction with the National Arts Council or the Singapore Sports Council.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the principles and objectives of the White Paper. I think the Government, as the biggest employer, should command the confidence of the people. When we implement the plan we should be more flexible. The most important thing is to let the private sector employers feel that the Government is doing the right thing and they should follow the example to provide adequate medical benefits to their workers and not reduce their medical benefits.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tong Kok Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tong Kok Yeo (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the White Paper has spelt out in great detail the Government's health care philosophy and the various approaches the Government will take to regulate and contain health care costs, the main objective being to ensure that Singaporeans receive good basic health care at a price they can afford. In this regard, it is reassuring to note that the Government has taken into due consideration the concerns, especially that of the lower income group, by ensuring that medical care in class B2 and C wards will reflect the basic health care package, and that these wards will be heavily subsidised by the Government and the Government should continue to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having noted the experiences and problems other countries have in their health care system, I find it difficult to disagree with the sound principles expounded so convincingly in the White Paper. Nevertheless, I wish to focus my comments on employer medical benefits. Medical benefits have always been part and parcel of the terms and conditions of employment. It has always been an item for negotiation in every collective bargaining exercise between employers and unions. Therefore, medical benefits constitute an important item in the outcome of the collective bargaining process. The role of trade unions in negotiating this item should not be in any way diminished or reduced by the proposals contained in the White Paper on employer medical benefits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1993 survey conducted by the National Productivity Board and the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore Institute of Labour Studies, more than 90% of employers, employees and unionists surveyed ranked health care as the most important benefit for promoting employee commitment and also the most important benefit in enhancing the quality of work life now and over the next five years. This convergence of priorities indicates the high importance the three parties accord to the useful role health care can play in promoting employee commitment and in providing workers with a quality work life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several advantages and merits in the new model of converting traditional medical benefit to additional Medisave contribution. However, I was trying to find a definition of what traditional medical benefits mean. However, we have heard the Minister for Finance earlier announcing the revised medical benefits package for the civil service. I would draw the conclusion that traditional medical benefits mean hospitalisation benefits. Therefore, employers will look towards the civil service model and for that matter are encouraged by the Government to follow. Employer medical benefits vary from company to company. What is traditional benefit in the case of the civil service means hospitalisation benefits. What is traditional benefit to one company may not be the same for the others. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that voluntary additional Medisave contribution is capped at 2% of the salary, efforts must be taken to ensure that the high importance accorded to health care by the employers and unionists is not eroded or diluted in the process.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question asked is whether the additional Medisave contribution will be adequate over the years as medical cost may rise over the years. Of course, pegging the additional Medisave contribution to the salary will ensure that such contribution increases as salary increases. However, this would not be true for those employees whose salary is stagnated. This category of employees is likely to be older and more prone to illnesses and therefore may have to pay higher premiums if such employees do take up coverage under MediShield II or private medical insurance. This concern is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> compounded if such employee uses his or her Medisave savings to also cover his or her family members who are not employed, for example, non-working spouse, schooling children, and parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has indicated that it will implement the additional Medisave contribution to new recruits in lieu of traditional medical benefits, and has encouraged the private sector employers to follow. This inevitably will have an impact on the role of trade unions in negotiating these benefits, as the additional Medisave contribution is capped at 2% of salary. I certainly hope, with the adoption of this new model, employer medical benefits over the years will not eventually evolve into a non-negotiable item.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government and private sector employers, in adopting the new model, will continue to bear their liability of medical charges arising from hospitalisation should their employees suffer from industrial diseases, or industrial accidents or accidents met in the course of performing work. These certainly cannot constitute traditional medical benefits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced its revised medical benefits scheme for the civil servants. It would take time to study and assess its impact on the civil servants at large. Private sector employers will of course look forward to how the Government implements this, and its impact on the employees will then depend very much on the implementation aspects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these comments, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will take this opportunity to elaborate on several of the key measures contained in the White Paper as well as address some of the points and concerns raised by Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, health care financing. Sir, a key element of the Government's health care philosophy is personal responsibility, and this includes each of us putting aside some money while we are economically active to meet our health care needs when we are elderly and after we have retired.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of Medisave has enabled Singaporeans to save for the future. When patients directly pay for medical services, whether in full or with the help of Government subsidy, they become more aware of the cost of what they are using. They are then more likely to use such services prudently and judiciously. This approach has enabled us to avoid the problems faced by the developed countries. Over there, their health care financing systems are mainly tax-based or insurance-based. And as the medical expenses are paid for by a third party, the patient becomes desensitised from the cost of the services that he is receiving. What is worse is that very often, the patient feels entitled to use as much medical services as he wishes since he has already prepaid in the form of either taxes or insurance premiums.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me relate to you a personal experience. In the mid-1970s, I was working in the USA on a job training programme. One day an American colleague I was working with told me that he would be away for the next week on holiday. So I was quite surprised. I said, "Well, good. Where are you going?" To my surprise, he gave me the name of a very good hospital down the road. So I was taken aback. "You are going on holiday to a hospital?" He said, "Yes. You know, under my insurance coverage, I am entitled to an annual check-up. This will involve three or four days' stay in the hospital. There is a nice park next to it. Between check-ups, I can go to the park, lie down and have a holiday." So he was entitled to his annual all-expenses paid holiday at the local hospital. I mentioned this story to several people recently, and I said, "Well, luckily, such things have not happened in Singapore yet." To my surprise, one of the people there said, "Well, you will be surprised. One of my managers is in fact already looking forward to his annual check-up in a private hospital, all-expenses paid." It is just as I have described.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the buffet syndrome is not unique to any particular nationality. Already in Singapore, we see it in many of our restaurants when there is a pre-paid buffet available. People load up their plates, and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have a good time. It is therefore important that we keep this nexus between the use of, and payment for, medical services utilised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, more than 80% of the patients use Medisave to pay for their hospital bills. Medisave balances have been increasing partly because most of the Medisave members are still young and their health care needs are still low. The average Medisave balance in 1984 when the scheme started was $1,750. This increased to $4,400 by the middle of this year. Currently, the Medisave contribution rates are between 6% and 8%, depending on the age group. As health care cost increases, which is inevitabe, the Medisave contribution rate will have to be increased as well. But we should try to delay this for as long as possible. And if the measures to contain health care costs, as laid out in the White Paper, prove to be effective, the long-term Medisave contribution rate may not need to exceed 10%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, insurance. As the Minister for Trade and Industry had stated in his opening remarks, high Medisave balances also increase the temptation for patients to draw on these balances more than they absolutely need to. That is why we introduced the insurance component in MediShield. MediShield reduces the amount of personal savings needed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MediShield currently covers one-and-a-half million people or almost 90% of all eligible CPF members. As a catastrophic insurance scheme, MediShield has been able to keep its premiums very low, and each year about 10% of hospital patients, mainly those with serious medical conditions and who require prolonged hospitalisation, receive MediShield reimbursements. We will improve on the system by enhancing and extending MediShield. This will be done in two ways. First, MediShield will reduce the existing deductibles while retaining the current premium rate. This will enable 20% to 25% of hospital patients to benefit from MediShield, instead of the current 10%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will introduce MediShield II with higher benefits. It will come in two
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> options. Option A covers patients who use A Class or private hospital beds. And Option B, which has lower premiums, will cover those using B1 wards. MediShield II, like the current MediShield, will have deductibles and a payment co-component. It will be a voluntary opt-in system, and Medisave can be used to pay for the premiums. The lowering of deductibles for MediShield and the introduction of MediShield II will take effect from 1st July 1994. The details will be announced in the next few months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people have time and again suggested that MediShield should extend its coverage to those beyond 70. MediShield has in fact gone beyond the conventional practice by extending its coverage limit from 65 years of age to 70. We will study the implications carefully before deciding whether to further extend the age limit in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another key cost containment measure is the capping of patient revenue in subsidised hospitals. The patient revenue comprises fees collected from patients and, secondly, subsidies received by the hospitals from the Government. The patient revenue adjusted for workload changes will not be allowed to increase by more than the consumer price index (CPI) plus X percent. That means, it will not be allowed to increase by more than the inflation rate plus an X percent factor. For the next two years, we have fixed the X component at 2%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this formula of CPI plus X will constrain the rate of cost increases in the subsidised hospitals and, in turn, restrain the increases in the charges imposed on patients. At the same time, this formula will allow hospitals enough resources to maintain the quality of their medical services and to introduce new medical developments that have been proven to be cost effective. The X factor will take into consideration the cost of labour and wage increases. And this is an important factor because in the hospitals, between 60% and 70% of the cost actually are labour costs. So when Singaporeans enjoy a 10% increase in salary, they can expect that the hospitals would have incurred a cost increase of 6%, almost
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> automatically. So, as long as all Singaporeans enjoy good salary increments, the hospital staff will likewise enjoy similar increments and health care costs will increase in proportionate quantum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the hospital's actual revenue is higher than the revenue cap, the subsidy from Government will be reduced by the same extent, that means, if hospitals increase their charges by, let us say, in total, $1 million annually, above the revenue cap, an equivalent sum of $1 million will be reduced from the subsidy. So, therefore, there is no incentive at all for hospitals to increase charges more than what they are allowed to under the cap, because any extra charges that they collect will be given back to the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitals are also expected at the same time to operate within their revenue collections. With their revenues capped, the hospitals will be constrained to service their patients within a fixed amount of resources and to conform to reasonable service norms. This would discourage the hospitals from ordering unnecessary tests and investigations because all those unnecessary tests and investigations cannot be charged to the patients. It will just be additional costs which the hospitals will have to bear. They will have to be very careful to ensure that whatever they order are necessary and not wasteful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidised hospitals will have to strive to improve the quality of their medical care within the resources available. If they are efficient they will be able to generate cost savings and therefore generate surpluses. They will be able to keep their surplus. It will be an incentive for them to do better. And they can use these surpluses to improve their services or to upgrade essential equipment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those hospitals which attract more patients, whether they are subsidised or non-subsidised, will generate more revenue from fees as well as from subsidies. There are, therefore, adequate incentives for hospitals to innovate and to improve their efficiency while maintaining a high quality of medical care. Otherwise,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> they are going to lose all their patients. The revenue cap mechanism will help to restrain cost increases and ensure that patients will continue to receive affordable quality health care in the subsidised hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, but it is not sufficient to have cost containment in only the subsidised hospitals. The public and the private health care sectors are closely linked. If the private sector doctors and other health care workers enjoy a significant increase in income, the public sector cannot afford to lag far behind. Otherwise, they will lose their key staff and jeopardise the care they are providing to the majority of Singaporeans. We must, therefore, apply similar cost containment mechanisms to private sector hospitals and doctors. We propose to do this through the Medisave mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is, in fact, the custodian of the Medisave funds. We have the responsibility to act as a purchaser of medical services for our Medisave account holders. MOH will set limits on balance billing for patients using Medisave in the private hospitals and doctors. Health care providers, who are willing to accept the stipulated rates, will be registered by Medisave and be allowed to take on Medisave patients. However, the providers are free to set their own charges for patients who do not use Medisave and this will include foreign patients.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the limit on balance billing will be implemented in two stages. Stage One will cover operation charges and doctor's daily hospital attendance fee. Stage Two will cover the fees charged by the private hospitals. We expect to implement Stage One by the end of 1994, and Stage Two for the hospitals, by the end of 1995.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some concerns that the setting of cap on private sector charges may actually result in doctors and hospitals all charging at the maximum allowable rate. Sir, that may happen. But I think what is more likely to happen is that the doctors who are already well-established will charge at the maximum allowable rate and doctors who are junior and who are still trying to establish themselves, will have to compete by charging
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> at a lower rate and also compete by ensuring that they are able to give better service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some others are also concerned that the quality of medical care may be compromised if charges are controlled. I want to assure Members of this House that the rates set will be fair to both the patients as well as to the doctors and hospitals. Private hospitals and doctors are likely to see a drop in income initially but it will still be a decent income.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, because their charges will be more reasonable, they may in fact attract more patients who would otherwise have gone to the subsidised hospitals. There will be no need for providers to compromise on the quality of medical care. We expect the doctors and hospitals to compete on price as well as quality within the caps. If a doctor or hospital decides to cut corners, he will risk losing his patients, or, worse, he may even lose the licence to practise. We will step up our medical audits to ensure that the quality of medical care is not compromised. In any case, Sir, the subsidised hospitals will continue to maintain the service quality and remain as a benchmark for medical service. The private sector must continue to compete effectively or they will lose their patients to the subsidised hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health will work with representatives of the private sector hospitals and doctors to come up with the balance billing limits. In working out the caps, we will consider the existing private sector costs as well as the fees charged by the Government and restructured hospitals. We will be fair to all parties concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the points raised by Members. Mr Lau Ping Sum has suggested that we should reduce the number of Class A beds, as those who can afford such beds should be encouraged to use the private hospitals. He also proposed that the community hospitals should only have subsidised beds and not Class A beds. Sir, we should ask ourselves whether the removal or the reduction of Class A beds from our hospitals will be in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the interest of the subsidised patients. Non-subsidised patients play an important role as quality controllers. Yes, they can afford to use private hospitals. But by choosing to use the non-subsidised services in a subsidised hospital, they confirm that the medical care in that hospital is of an acceptable quality. The Class A beds also serve as a benchmark for the private sector and help to restrain the cost of private medical care. This, in turn, helps to keep costs down in subsidised hospitals. There is no need for us to force those who are able to pay the full cost of the A Class beds into the subsidised wards. If they cannot get the Class A beds, some of them will actually just move into the subsidised wards. If they do that, this will only reduce the subsidies available to those who truly need these subsidies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key is to ensure that there are enough subsidised beds for those who cannot afford to pay the full cost of their medical treatment. My Ministry regularly monitors the occupancy rates of the various ward classes and we adjust the bed composition, when necessary, in line with patient demands. If demand for B2 and C Class beds increases, we will make available more beds. But on the other hand, if demand for Class C beds declines, as has been happening in the past few years, we would also have to adjust the numbers accordingly. In the case of the Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital, only 7% of the beds are A Class beds. The number has been reduced to the bare minimum and there is no need to reduce further.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peter Sung expressed concerns about an over-supply of specialists in the private sector and public sector as well. Sir, my Ministry controls the supply of specialists through the provision of specialist training positions in our subsidised hospitals. We closely monitor the supply and demand for specialist treatment and we allocate trainees according to the need for such specialists. Our aim is to train no more than 40% of each cohort as specialists. The remaining 60% will work as primary health care doctors. I can
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> assure Mr Sung that we share his concerns and we will make sure that we avoid an over-supply of specialists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Michael Lim stated that the subsidies distort usage patterns. He suggested that we avoid over-subsidising the patients and to educate the public on the true cost of health care. Sir, Dr Lim is correct. It is important that we focus the heavier subsidies on those who genuinely need financial help and that is why we have the different classes of wards - A, B1, B2 and C. This allows us to focus on the subsidies. We also ensure that there is a co-payment element because there is nothing worse than free treatment. It will just generate more demand and cause the standard of health care to decline, as we have seen in countries with free treatment. Of course, for those who are indigent and poor, they will receive free treatment, but after we have ensured that they are genuinely indigent and poor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lim had stated that some of the tests in his Cardiac Department appear to be too inexpensive, too over-subsidised. Sir, I am not too familiar with the details in his Department but I will ask the CEO in NUH to review what he is talking about and to apply the appropriate subsidy level to those that have been inappropriately priced. Perhaps, Dr Lim may wish to inform the CEO which of those items are involved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the variety of medical conditions, certain patients may occasionally require expensive tests, whether they are in Class A, B2 or C. Our system of subsidy also ensures that for the more expensive tests, we have a cap on the price that we charge for that test. So for those expensive tests, they are only ordered when they are needed and the patient actually receives a higher subsidy rate so that he is not deprived of that needed test. It is up to the doctors to exercise their professional judgment and order those tests only when they are needed. They should not order those tests because the patients demand for them, or because we have heavily subsidised that test and is now so cheap. Tests must never
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be generated upon patients' demands. They must be generated only upon the professional judgment of the doctors concerned. And if the tests are warranted and helpful, I think the subsidies would have been well spent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lim also requested for Medisave to be extended to more outpatient treatments. Mdm Yu-Foo has also made the same request. We are already extending the use of Medisave for outpatient treatments and these apply to those services or procedures that are more expensive and they apply to day surgery cases as well because we want to encourage patients not to be hospitalised if they can. This will help to keep their health care costs down. The guiding principle is that Medisave will be extended to outpatient treatment where the indications for treatment and procedure are clear and there is little risk of a doctor generating unnecessary demand for those services just because Medisave is available.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to avoid extending the use of Medisave to outpatient treatment too liberally because, firstly, the administrative costs will rise exponentially because there are many outpatient treatments and, secondly, the patient-load can be substantial. Thirdly, it will create demand for more of these services unnecessarily. However, I am prepared to take suggestions from Dr Lim. If he has any item that he wishes to propose, we would definitely review and consider it carefully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lim also stressed the importance of educating the public on the true cost of health care. I agree with him. Health care costs are expensive. There is no doubt about that. We cannot hide from that fact. It is better that every Singaporean knows it so that he would take the effort to practise a healthy lifestyle, live a healthy lifestyle, and increase his chances of remaining fit and healthy. Also, when he needs to use the medical services, because he knows that it is costly, hopefully it will make him to be more prudent in the usage.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the education process is a continuing process. We now have financial counselling for all patients upon admission to hospitals. They are told what is the cost if they go to A Class, which is the full cost, and what it will cost them in the other wards. Similarly, the private hospitals are also required to do financial counselling. And in the Government hospitals, every patient receives a bill which shows the full cost of the services received. At the end of the bill, he will also get a statement that he has received so much in subsidies and the actual bill size to him is the full cost minus the subsidy. This tells him two things. Firstly, what it costs the hospital to deliver that service to him. Secondly, if he is in the subsidised classes, it tells him how much of that cost has been borne by the Government. I think these two facts are important for him to appreciate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lim also mentioned about the difficulties of deciding borderline situations, whether to withhold treatment for a patient who is critically ill, especially one who is terminally ill and especially if the family insists that treatment should be continued. Mr Loh Meng See has also mentioned some concerns about people interpreting the basic health care package as a first step towards euthanasia. Let me strongly stress that we do not practise euthanasia. Euthanasia is the deliberate action of a physician to terminate the life of a patient so as to relieve him of his suffering, eg, by giving him a lethal injection. But we must recognise that death is a part of life, and dealing with death has always been a part of medical practice. Modern medicine has made it more of a dilemma now for doctors, of course. However, the process of death in terminally ill patients should not be unnecessarily prolonged through futile intervention. In trying to help, doctors and family members may actually be prolonging and increasing the patient's suffering. This is something which we all should strive not to do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors are trained to make professional judgment in the best interest of patients. In deciding on treatment, doctors are guided by treatment protocols which set out the standard practice which, of course, vary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> from patient to patient according to the circumstances. These are the everyday decisions that all doctors have to make, when and how to treat, when to intervene and when not to. When junior doctors are uncertain, they refer to their senior specialist for a second opinion and advice before coming to a joint decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical undergraduates receive lectures on medical ethics. My Ministry also organises a seminar on medical ethics and responsibilities of medical practice for all newly qualified doctors. To assist doctors in borderline cases, all hospitals now have their own ethics committee. My Ministry is now looking into the establishment of a national ethics committee to identify the ethical issues relating to medical practice and to develop guidelines on the ethical code of conduct for doctors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the points raised by Mr Low Thia Khiang. I was truly astonished yesterday when I heard Mr Low speaking in this House. I thought he wanted Singaporeans to be the last of the Mohicans. Every country in the world with a system of socialised medicine is sorely regretting it. And Mr Low was standing there in front of us preaching that the Government should be responsible for an individual's medical costs because no one wants to be sick. Sir, even China has openly declared that free medical care for the masses is now history. I am glad that he subsequently clarified, a bit reluctantly I thought, that actually what we heard was not what he had meant to say. He had meant to say that the Government should only intervene to subsidise those who cannot afford to pay the full cost of medical services. I am indeed glad that Mr Low agrees with the Government's approach to health care subsidies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also claimed that the restructuring of hospitals has resulted in higher hospital fees and consequently the poor now cannot afford medical care. At the same time, low income earners are unable to obtain help from Medifund. Perhaps he also did not mean what he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me throw some light on the matter again. Firstly, 75% of all class C bills in our hospitals are below $420. Three-quarters of all the class C bills are below $420. For a person earning $800 a month, this represents only seven months of Medisave contributions. And those who cannot afford to pay even this heavily subsidised bill size, maybe because they have been sick for a long time and therefore unable to work or because of their prolonged sickness they have depleted their Medisave, these people can still apply for a waiver of hospital fees. The waiver process extends not just to the poor but also to the low income earners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Medifund, the process is even simpler. Each hospital has its own Medifund committee and therefore can process the appeals and applications quickly. Medifund also extends special treatment to those who were born before 1940. It is a very generous scheme. If Mr Low is aware of any person who is not receiving medical treatment because he cannot afford it, I hope he will not hesitate to give me the details and we will definitely arrange for treatment to be extended to that person.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Low also touched on the five sub-specialities in the Singapore General Hospital without C class wards. Mrs Yu-Foo also mentioned this topic. Let me explain again. These five sub-specialities require well-trained staff and they are high cost disciplines. We have grouped them under B2 as a minimum so that we can better contain costs and therefore make it even more affordable for the low income earners. Patients who cannot afford the B2 rates can appeal for their bills to be reclassified to a class C bill. If this is still too high, they can also appeal for those bills to be waived. The hospitals will definitely consider them carefully and if they are genuine cases, they will be obliged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, low income patients who normally would have stayed in a class C ward therefore have the advantage of staying in a B2 ward while paying class C fees. So they are really given the best of both worlds.

   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>
  </div>
  <br>3.52 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the topic of basic health care. Mr Low has questioned the need to limit subsidised medical services to a basic medical package. Most people that we have talked to so far accept that it is not possible to offer medical services without any limit and at the same time keep health care costs under control, but there are concerns as to whether the basic package will be too limited.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me show Members these two volumes [indicating]. These two volumes contain the international classifications of about 5,000 disease conditions and about 3,000 surgical and non-surgical procedures. Of the 5,000 disease conditions in this book, only nine are not in our basic package. These include AIDS, gynaecological problems such as infertility and impotence, sexual deviations such as lesbianism and homosexuality, and disorders of the breast such as unusually large or small breasts. Of the 3,000 procedures in this book, only 14 are not included. These include heart, liver and bone marrow transplants, cosmetic dental work, sex change operations, IVF, cosmetic surgery such as face lift and breast enlargement or reduction. Only 23 of the items in these two large volumes are not in our basic package. And because these excluded items are mainly uncommon conditions, our basic package basically covers well over 99.9% of patients. Our basic package is therefore more than generous.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cheo Chai Chen touched on two issues - the health care costs of the elderly and those with chronic conditions. Mr Cheo was concerned about the indigent elderly singles. I would like to assure him that such persons would be eligible for public assistance and will receive free health care. Elderly persons facing financial difficulties in any case qualify for generous help from Medifund since they were born before 1940.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior citizens who fall ill or suffer from chronic illnesses can obtain medical treatment in our polyclinics. There, they pay only half the regular fees and the fees
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> can also be waived if they are facing financial difficulties. Mr Cheo worries that if elderly patients need to apply for fee waiver, it will result in delayed medical treatment. He proposes that since we have plenty of national reserves, the Government should provide more subsidies and, in fact, subsidise all elderly, without their having to resort to apply for a fee waiver. Sir, I would like to assure Members that it is an established hospital procedure that if patients have difficulties making payments, the hospital provides the necessary treatment in class C wards first. After the treatment has been given, it will make the payment arrangements. So no one is deprived of treatment just because he or she could not make the payment upon admission.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has healthy national reserves because the Government has exercised great prudence in spending the people's money. As a result, we have been able to invest in education, health and a superb infrastructure for the economy. The welfare system that Mr Cheo is still arguing for has been proven to be a failure. The European and Scandinavian countries, Australia, New Zealand and others are now trying desperately to unwind their welfare systems. Unfortunately, they are finding great difficulties. But unless they succeed, their economies will continue to be crippled by their welfare systems and the dependency mentality that it breeds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our system of focusing help only where help is needed is the most appropriate and effective one. It promotes responsible behaviour. People get to keep more of their money and decide on how to use it. The Government and community organisations provide a safety net for the few who genuinely need help. The alternative of the Government taking most of a person's salary through taxes and then deciding on how to put the money to use is one that we must avoid at all costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Loh Meng See has asked that we ensure that the cost containment measures do not end up jeopardising or compromising the quality of our health care or the safety measures that we have in place in our health care system. He
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cited the recent news about the AIDS-tainted blood in Germany and how it has caused irreparable harm to people's confidence as well as to the image of Germany. Sir, I can assure Mr Loh that stringent measures have been taken to ensure that the safeguards on our blood supply remain. We will audit and we will make sure that the system is maintained and that the health of Singaporeans continues to be protected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have certain measures in place, eg, our donor selection. Unlike many countries, we do not pay for the blood that we collect. So no one comes forward to sell blood. They come forward voluntarily to donate blood. But, nonetheless, we take measures to ensure that the donors are healthy donors. Not only that, we also have a very stringent screening process for the blood supplies. We test 100%. Every unit collected is tested. We test for sexually transmitted diseases, for hepatitis and we test for AIDS as well. And if any sample is shown to be even mildly positive, the sample is rejected and the donor is advised not to donate blood again in the future. So we do have the necessary measures in place to ensure that the blood is safeguarded. We will ensure that the other safety measures in the health care system, not just with regard to blood supply, are also maintained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh requested that my Ministry regularly reviews the list of standard drugs. He also requested the drugs for conditions like cancer and heart diseases and other common and complicated conditions be included in the standard drugs list. Sir, I would like to assure him that the drugs for cancer, heart diseases and other common conditions are indeed within the drugs list, and that my Ministry reviews that list every year to make sure that the drugs there remain relevant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the Members and Mr Loh have touched on the proposal to allow employers to pay some contributions into the Medisave account in lieu of the medical benefits. Sir, the White Paper now makes this option available. Whereas in the past, that option was never available. There are some advantages. Firstly, most
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> workers do not really use acute medical services. Most of them use outpatient services. The money that is being used to either purchase insurance for hospitalisation coverage, or being borne directly by the company, can then be paid into the Medisave account of the patients and that money can be utilised by that worker after he has retired. So that is one advantage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it gives that worker the flexibility to decide on what to use with Medisave, ie, whether to purchase coverage that entitles him to a C class bed and therefore save the rest of the premiums or to purchase a higher class coverage. Thirdly, it allows him the flexibility to purchase medical insurance and thereby safeguard coverage for himself, especially when he suffers from serious illnesses. For example, if he suffers from kidney problems and he cannot work and the company boards him out, he will be without coverage. By the time he goes to get an insurance coverage, the insurance company will not cover his pre-existing condition. But if he had already purchased that coverage under his own name, even if he is jobless or when he joins another company, that coverage is still active.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the medical benefits of most companies now come to less than 1% of the salaries. We will leave it to the employers and the unions to negotiate. Government will encourage, but not compel. So in the end how fast this proceeds will be determined by the employers and the unions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron Eusofe this afternoon mentioned that many people do not use Class C wards because they are not sure about the quality and requests that we assure patients that the quality of Class C treatment is good. Sir, we have been assuring patients all the time and we will continue to assure patients that Class C treatment is of a high quality. The outcomes of treatment are no different from the outcomes of patients in other wards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen asks whether we will allow workers to purchase insurance to cover the co-payment section. Sir, I had earlier explained why it is important that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> we do not rely on third-party systems because it is a prepaid scheme. The buffet syndrome automatically comes in. We will therefore not allow insurance to be purchased for the co-payment for him. It is good for the patient or the worker to pay a portion of the bill from either his own savings or his Medisave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also requested that the Ministry discuss with NTUC on its proposed MHS system. Sir, we are definitely willing to discuss with the NTUC and to see how we can be of assistance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Low Seow Chay also talked about the need to reduce demand for health care and to also have cost containment measures. Sir, he has asked whether we are training excessive numbers of doctors. He feels that even with the reduced number that has been recommended by the Singapore Medical Council, we will still end up with more doctors than necessary. Sir, the need for doctors will continue to increase in the coming years for two reasons. Firstly, our population is still increasing. It is growing every year. Secondly, our population is ageing. As we all know, when we get older, the need for health services increases. So we are going to continue needing more doctors. The question is, what is the right number. We have used other countries as models, studying what is their make-up, what is their proportion. We feel that the ratio of 650 to 670 population to one doctor by the year 2000 will be adequate. Yes, there may be a need for some more or a few less. But, by and large, our system will still remain a system that is able to deliver quality care at affordable prices. But we will continue to review. Every five years, we review our situation and, if need be, we will make additional amendment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he does not feel that it is wise for us to increase the Medisave contribution rate further and to build up larger Medisave balances. Sir, I think the key point is that at the end of the day what is the average Medisave balance of our Singaporeans. We already have a mechanism limiting the maximum amount to be kept in the Medisave account. We will adjust the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> maximum balance over time to ensure that the sum is enough but not excessive. Excess contributions are then transferred to the Ordinary Account of the account holder so that he can use those contributions to either purchase his home or for investment. This is as Dr Low Seow Chay has proposed. But I think he has gone one step further. He has proposed that we treat the whole CPF account as a Medisave account so that whenever they need they can transfer from their Ordinary Account to the Medisave account for use. Sir, in that case, he contradicts what he has been talking about because instead of stipulating a definite Medisave balance quantum, he is now extending it to the full CPF. For certain account holders, you are talking of hundreds of thousands of dollars. I think we better stick to what we have now, which is, stipulate a maximum, allow the excess to be paid into the Ordinary Account and, if there are special circumstances, we even allow the person to return those excess payments back to the Medisave account if the account holder suffers a serious illness that he now needs these additional funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Shi Teck feels that we should be giving Singaporeans more incentives to keep healthy. He mentioned that we should give everybody $1,000 contribution if he does not use medical services each year, give him a certificate of fitness, and pay for MediShield. When I was toting up the numbers, it means we will be giving to everyone much more than what we are spending in the whole health care system each year. But the key point is that he has misinterpreted the whole intent behind the statement that we should give Singaporeans the incentives to remain healthy. What is the biggest incentive for a person to remain healthy? Surely, it must be that by being healthy he will be able to enjoy a higher quality of life. He can live life to the fullest, he can spend quality time with his family and, best of all, he will not have to spend unnecessarily on medical care. That must be the biggest incentive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to promote the healthy lifestyle message to impress on Singaporeans that it is for their own benefit that they put in the effort to have a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> healthy lifestyle and to remain healthy, and not by giving them more money. But, of course, for employers, since they are giving medical benefits, a healthier worker means lower medical cost, it may be worth their while to look into how to link workers' efforts at remaining healthy with some motivational tools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he also questioned whether the Ministerial Committee consulted the private medical sector before coming out with the White Paper, since they are the ones who are the experts. He seems to get the feeling that we are blaming the doctors. Sir, nowhere in the White Paper have we blamed doctors for our situation. In fact, we have been praising our medical professionals that they are some of the best brains and they are well trained. Because of that, we have a good health care system. But the White Paper goes beyond pure medical professional matters. The White Paper actually deals with economics, the relationship between demand and supply and financing, and the influence of financing systems on behaviour. In terms of medical professional inputs, my Ministry has got ample supply of people in this area and we have taken their advice in terms of the medical professional factors. But we will definitely consult with the private medical sector in areas where they have an active role. It is right that we consult them and get their inputs because we will be implementing systems and procedures which will apply to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chia also made a very sweeping remark that the hospitals charge drugs at five to seven times the cost. Unfortunately, he is not here. I asked him for a clarification as to whether he was referring to the private hospitals or the subsidised hospitals. His answer was both. I will get my officials to contact Mr Chia to substantiate his allegation. But I can state categorically here in this House that the subsidised hospitals have a formula for charging drugs, and the formula is a very simple one.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia also mentioned about the ICUs. He said that we should not be controlling ICUs just because they are very expensive and that we should not be doing things arbitrarily. Sir, I wish to clarify that the Government does not do anything arbitrarily. Every action that we take are actions decided upon after consideration. We will make sure that the number of ICU is adequate, but not excessive.

  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I seek a clarification from the Minister, Sir? The Minister mentioned that 75% of C Class ward bills are below $420. Would the Minister provide the bill amounts for the B1 and B2 Class wards, and a detailed breakdown of the bill size for these wards?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I will be very happy to supply the data when Mr Low tables a question, because I do not have the data now. But when he was talking about affordability, I would imagine that people who have difficulties paying their bills, who are from the lower-income group, would be people who are using the Class C wards. They will not be people who will be using the Class A wards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> B2 and B1.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Or even B2. If they have some difficulties meeting the hospital bills, they should go for the ward with the lowest bill size. And that is why I only quoted the Class C ward charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I seek a clarification? Do I get it correct that a C Class patient, having been upgraded to B2, because he cannot get one of the five modalities of care at C Class, he needs to pay only C Class rate? I got a different answer from the Minister the last time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> My answer is exactly the same. If he had listened carefully, what I told him the last time was when a patient goes into a Class B2 ward, he will be billed at Class B2 rate. But if that patient cannot afford the Class B2 bill, he can request to be reclassified as a Class C
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> patient, and the bill size will be reclassified accordingly. This is exactly what I have just said also.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to have two clarifications from the Minister. The CPI plus X factor has been used as a formula to control increase in revenue for subvented hospitals. Will the Minister tell us whether, with each revision, as the CPI plus X increase, as revenue is equal to cost recovery plus subsidy, this revenue will come mainly from cost recovery, or will there be a tandem increase in the subsidy?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clarification is on the balance billing for Medisave. It may be premature now, but the Minister has told us that this will be after due consideration has been given to the cost of running a private medical practice. But he has not told us what happens when a patient requires the services of more than one specialist to look after him or, for a very sick patient, when more than one visit per day will have to be made to that patient.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the CPI plus X formula applies to the whole revenue. The subsidy will be based on the revenue cap. So it depends on the class of ward. If it is Class C, the hospital will get 80% of that new revenue cap. Of course, if the cost goes up, then we expect the hospitals will also increase their fees to cover the cost increase in that portion which is not subsidised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the balance billing, we are still working out the details, and I think those are implementation details which we will take up with the private sector later.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Clarification for the Minister. I would like to ask the Minister whether kidney dialysis is within the definition of all the diseases in that two volumes, and whether that is covered in the basic health care package.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we do provide kidney dialysis and it is also provided through the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). And because this is considered to be in the package, that is why MediShield also covers kidney dialysis, and which is why we encourage Singaporeans to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ensure that they do not opt out from MediShield, so that when they get kidney problems they can get the support from MediShield which covers the bulk of their dialysis cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. Would the Minister confirm that kidney transplant is part of the basic package?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, if Mr Low had read the White Paper carefully, it is inside there.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Cost Review Committee has pointed out that the cost of health care has risen in recent years. Many Singaporeans or their relatives who have been admitted to hospital already know that. We MPs who are running town councils also know that. We have seen instances of residents coming to ask for delay or waiver of payment of the service and conservancy charges, because the breadwinner of the family had been stricken with cancer or other serious disease and was warded in hospital. All the family savings were used up to pay for his hospital bills, and the family as a result was left in debt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government hospitals were restructured and the consequent removal of much of the Government subsidies, the medical cost in those hospitals escalated sharply. The policy then was to cut down the number of C Class beds. The Government policy at that time was to remove C Class wards in one or two Government hospitals. The reason given was that the C Class wards were not popular. Patients were allowed to use their Medisave to pay for their medical services and as a result, many of them opted for better service, either in the B Class or even the A Class wards. They did not want to be admitted to the C Class wards as they had enough in their Medisave to pay for the better class.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, the Government went ahead to reduce the number of C Class beds. As I remember it, many MPs in this House were alarmed at the rate the Government was cutting down the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> number of C Class beds. Obviously, now there is a change of heart on the part of the Government. This is reflected in the White Paper. In the White Paper, it says that "there shall be a cap on the revenue of Government hospitals and that Singaporeans are guaranteed affordable basic medical services. There shall be Government subsidies for the B2 and C Classes." This is certainly a departure from the tough stand taken by the Government a few years back. At that time the Government wanted the restructured hospitals to be self-supporting. That meant the restructured hospitals were thrown into a laissez-faire situation. They have to earn their own keep. Under those circumstances, they have no choice but to up their charges to ensure that they are not in the red.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government withdrew its helping hand, the cost of the restructured hospitals had to go up, and not only go up, but go up sharply. Naturally, the population was alarmed, especially the older folks. Obviously, the Government has taken note of the concern of Singaporeans over the rise in health care cost and has taken steps to contain the rising cost. The Government can only do that by giving a helping hand. I note that it intends to do so. The majority of the beds in subvented hospitals shall be subsidised. I hope that the standard of care of patients in the B2 Class and C Class beds shall not drop because they are subsidised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I agree with the Government's health care philosophy. But it appears to me that there are contradictions within that philosophy. On the one hand, the Government wants to promote personal responsibility for one's health and avoid over-reliance on state welfare or medical insurance. But on the other hand, the Government is committed to giving a good medical package to the people which includes 65% subsidised medical services in subvented hospitals. In this respect, the Minister should clarify. On the one hand, you say that Singaporeans must take care of their own health, in other words, pay for all their own health needs out of their own pocket. On the other hand, you say you want to subsidise 65%, so the Government does
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> recognise that there must be subsidy in hospitals, and not rely on individual persons taking full responsibility of their own health care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wonders whether the Government wants, in the ultimate scenario, every Singaporean to pay for himself all the medical services he needs, or the Government wants each Singaporean to be responsible for his own personal health, in the sense that he exercises regularly, eats simple food, and has a healthy lifestyle. But despite these efforts, should he still fall ill, the Government still makes available to him subsidised beds in subvented hospitals which are affordable to him. In my mind, the former scenario shall never prevail if he gets sick.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had better explain. Despite all efforts in keeping good health, he is stricken with a disease such as cancer. What I want to say is that the individual should not be held entirely responsible for the diseases which he inevitably suffers. Similarly, if he is stricken with a disease such as cancer, which has no effective cure at the moment, it is not prudent to depend on state welfare or medical insurance. It is important that those who fall sick should not be put in a position where they will worry as to where they will get the money to pay for the hospital bill. In this respect, I would like the Government to consider, in its medical package, implementing some form of national insurance scheme. I know the Government is against the buffet system. But we can have a national system where we cater only for a definite, specific number of services, something like the scheme implemented in Oregon State, USA, or in Canada, as mentioned at page 22 of the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of the health care philosophy, I would like to mention in relation to Government's subvented hospitals, is, "To rely on competition and market forces to improve service and raise efficiency". Again, how can we do
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> this when the Government intends to cap their revenue? In other words, how can they compete if you want to cap their revenue? Be that as it may, the competition among subvented hospitals may not be a good thing. Instead of competition, the Government should promote productivity. It has been shown that "productivity is directly linked to the production of competitiveness rather than its increase". This is quoted from Psychology Today, September 1986 issue, pages 22 to 26. It must be realised that trying to beat others and to do well are two different things as they actually work at cross purposes. In a cooperative situation, others are depending on each other person to succeed. While in a competitive situation, others are hoping that you will fail. I think it is not right that subvented hospitals which are built at great public expense should go all out to make money and become richer through competition. The purpose of subvented hospitals is to serve the public well, and this can be done by good innovative management. Government can give it autonomy or there must be less bureaucracy.
