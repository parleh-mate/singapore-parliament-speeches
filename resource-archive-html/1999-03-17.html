<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>DENGUE FEVER</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Harun A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment how was the situation of dengue fever in  1998;  how

effective  was  the Aedes mosquito campaign and whether  it  was

better than 1997's and, if not, what measures are being taken by

his Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

the  number of dengue fever cases continued to rise to a  record

high  of  5,258 in 1998.  Almost all the cases were  the  milder

dengue fever and not dengue haemorrhagic fever.  There was  also

an  increase  in  the  Aedes mosquito house-index,  which  is  a

measure  of  the incidence of breedings detected in  homes.  The

index rose from 1.03 in 1997 to 1.24 in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey conducted by my Ministry showed that our public

education  programme  on dengue has succeeded  in  alerting  the

public but it has not changed their habits generally.  Many know

that the Aedes mosquito transmits dengue fever

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>

and  the  conditions  under  which the  Aedes  mosquito  breeds.

However,  many  admitted  that they  do  not  carry  out  checks

routinely in their homes.  And this is where the problem lies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue with the public education and strict

enforcement  actions.  We will bring the campaign  down  to  the

Town Councils and work closely with them.

<div align="center"><b>(Suspension from businesses)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Harun A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  how many hawker stallholders and restaurant  owners

were  suspended from their businesses in 1997 and 1998; and  how

many of them were repeat offenders.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in 1997, my Ministry suspended the

licences of 10 hawker stallholders, 37 restaurant owners  and  2

stallholders in coffeeshops.  In 1998, the corresponding numbers

were 22, 31 and 22 respectively.  There was only one licensee, a

hawker   stallholder,  who  was  suspended  twice.   The   first

suspension was for two weeks and the second for four weeks.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>HAWKER STALLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reduction of rent)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Harun A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  whether  he will consider  reducing  the  rent  for

hawker stalls during the current economic downturn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the majority of hawker stalls

(14,814)  are already paying subsidised rentals, which are  well

below  current  market  rates.  However, there  are  some  1,600

stallholders who are paying market rentals.  These are those who

have  secured  their  stalls through public  tender  or  through

transfers  approved by my Ministry.  For these stalls  that  are

charged market rentals, the Government had, with effect from 1st

July 1998, reduced the rents by 10%.  In January 1999, the rents

were  reviewed again.  For those whose rents were  still  higher

than the market

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>

rental, as assessed by the Chief Valuer as at 1st January  1999,

the rent was reduced to 90% of the previous rent or the assessed

market rent, whichever is higher.  The revised rentals are valid

up to 31st December 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum be allocated for Head J of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head J - Ministry of Community Development.

Amendment No. (1),  Mr Abdullah Tarmugi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi):   Sir, allow me to reply to the rest of  the  Members'

amendments raised yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim observed that a significant number of BASCs

have  had to be closed down and, according to him, part  of  the

problem was that the facilities are planned centrally by MCD.  I

wish to assure Members of this House that MCD works closely with

community  and  grassroots  organisations  in  planning   social

services  in HDB estates, including the BASCs.  While  MCD  does

the   overall   planning  to  ensure  a  good  distribution   of

facilities, grassroots leaders and the CDCs are briefed  on  its

social services development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>

master  plan to share with them the planning considerations  and

criteria,  the  location  of these social  services  and  obtain

feedback to refine our planning process.  We can fine-tune  this

process further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the Member's comment that a number of BASCs

have closed down.  To-date, we know that three BASCs have closed

down, out of about 200 BASCs in Singapore.  Two were due to poor

demand  and  the other was affected by upgrading  works.   BASCs

are,  like  other facilities, developed through the  process  of

consultation  which I mentioned earlier.  While  the  number  of

BASCs  to  be developed is centrally planned, MCD works  closely

with theVWOs and grassroots organisations and advisors concerned

when determining their location.  BASCs run by private operators

or  those by VWOs that do not require Government funding, do not

require any prior endorsement by my Ministry. In such cases, the

decisions are made by the organisations concerned based on their

commercial  consideration.   They make  their  own  choices  and

decisions and therefore they may have to close if they get their

sums wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Sin Boon Ann's amendment. There are

54  voluntary  welfare organisations supported by the  Community

Chest.   MOH,  MCD  and  the Ministry  of  Education  also  fund

voluntary    welfare   organisations.    Programmes    of    the

organisations that receive public funds are assessed  vigorously

before they are funded to ensure viability and efficient use  of

resources.   All public funds and donations are  audited.   VWOs

are also registered under the Societies Act or with the Registry

of  Companies and Businesses, which require them to keep  proper

accounts  and  records of their income and  expenditure.   Their

accounts  are audited and submitted to the relevant  authorities

and  donors  can see these accounts which are also published  in

their  annual reports.  Organisations that raise money  directly

from  the  public  are  required to apply  to,  and  follow  the

guidelines  on fund-raising drawn up by, the Licensing  Unit  of

CID, the Registry of Societies and the Inland Revenue

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>

Authority of Singapore.  These are adequate and MCD need not add

to the bureaucracy.  Nevertheless, we will monitor the situation

and put in place measures to improve the situation, if needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon. I share the

concerns  of the hon. Member on the importance of family  values

and  social cohesion.  She has stated her case passionately  and

comprehensively.  I think I have addressed her concerns  on  the

need   to  strengthen  family  ties  and  values  in  my  speech

yesterday.   With  increasing  and competing  pressures  on  the

family,  the  inculcation of family values is  crucial  for  the

preservation  of the family as the basic building block  of  our

society.   We have Dr Ngiam Tee Liang from the NUS  to  chair  a

committee  to promote Singapore's family values.   It  works  in

close  collaboration with social service agencies, civic groups,

schools, the private sector and the unions.  Dr Ngiam is also  a

member  of  the Committee on the Family chaired by Mr Noel  Hon,

which  is  being  appointed this month, to look  into  strategic

issues affecting the well-being of the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to questions from Dr Lily Neo and Mr Ang Mong

Seng. I will take the questions by both Members together.   They

asked  on  MCD's  strategy to prepare for an  aging  population,

which  I  have already informed the House in broad terms  in  my

opening  speech yesterday.  I would like to thank  both  Members

for sharing their comments, especially to Dr Neo for sharing her

vision  on  elder  care.   We want our  senior  citizens  to  be

healthy, active and secure.  We must formulate the right elderly

policies, develop elderly friendly infrastructure and change the

mindset   of  the  elderly  as  well  as  that  of  the  younger

Singaporeans towards the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key strategy of MCD is therefore to strengthen public

education  programmes on aging.  We want Singaporeans  to  value

the elderly as a resource and to see growing older as a time for

further  development,  learning and continuing  contribution  to

society.   I  agree  with Dr Neo's point that  building  a  home

environment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>

that is safe and elderly friendly should be encouraged.  Mr  Ang

Mong Seng has also noted that not all senior citizens can afford

studio  apartments.  The IMC's review of housing for the elderly

will address concerns of both Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might like to know that MCD and HDB started a

number of projects to provide elderly friendly features in  one-room  rental  apartment  blocks for  the  elderly.   The  Senior

Activity  Centres  in  these projects provide  services  to  the

elderly and serve as focal points for mutual help.  They are run

by  VWOs  and  are  very much like the Centre  of  Activity  for

Retired  Elderly  (CARE) that Dr Lily Neo mentioned.   MCD  will

look into how our present concept of Senior Activity Centres can

be  improved  or even expanded to better meet the needs  of  the

well  elderly.   MCD  will ensure a coordinated  effort  amongst

voluntary  care  groups  in  the delivery  of  services.   Three

regional  Community  Care  Networks  and  a  National  Geriatric

Coordinating  Committee,  spearheaded  by  the  NCSS   and   MOH

respectively, are working towards a network of comprehensive and

coordinated  services at the local level, as well  as  to  share

best practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that the Elderly Development

Division  of my Ministry should work closely with the grassroots

organisations  in implementing services and programmes  for  the

elderly  which are practical and close to the ground.   I  share

his view. The Division will indeed work closely with PA and CDCs

to  explore how the grassroots organisations can play  a  bigger

role  in these areas.  I agree with Mr Ang's comment on the need

to  reskill older workers in order to keep up with the  pace  of

technological change.  We will have to look into this issue more

closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of elderly abuse which was raised by Dr Neo

yesterday,  I  wish to assure the Member that the Ministry  does

not condone all forms of family violence, including abuse of the

elderly.  Legislative and non-legislative measures have been put

in  place to manage and curb family violence and we will monitor

the situation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>

and will continue to improve on these measures, if necessary.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Women's Charter in 1996 both enhanced

and  extended protection to elderly victims of family  violence.

We  also  implemented a national networking system for  managing

family  violence on 1st July 1996.  This system is a coordinated

multi-disciplinary  approach  for  the  management   of   family

violence  cases  involving the MCD, the Police,  hospitals,  the

Family  Court, social service agencies and the crisis  shelters.

Any  victim  who seeks assistance will be informed  of  all  the

other  services available to him or her.  And he or she will  be

advised  on how to receive protection, counselling and  shelter.

Public education materials have been distributed to polyclinics,

hospitals,  NPPs,  FSCs  and other social  service  agencies  to

increase awareness of family violence and to inform them of what

they can do about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of elderly abuse is complex. There are

cases  where children may not intentionally abuse their  parents

but  neglect their basic needs.  Many families may also not know

how  to  cope  with the elderly who are suffering  from  medical

problems  such  as  senile dementia.  My Ministry  produced  two

video tapes on elderly care entitled "Caring by Elderly Spouses"

-    this  was  last  year   -   and  "Caring  by  the  Sandwich

Generation"  also produced last year.  Certainly,  more  can  be

done to support and educate care givers on the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will develop a protocol on the reporting and

management  of  elder  abuse this year.  This  project  is  also

intended  to  educate  the general public and  persons  who  are

likely to come into frequent contact with elderly persons on how

to identify signs of elder abuse and to help such abused persons

obtain assistance and protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the amendment by Dr Ho Tat Kin asking for

further developments on the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC)

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>

on  the  aging  population.  In my statement  yesterday,  I  had

briefly touched on the role of the IMC on the aged.  The IMC has

been   meeting  monthly.   It  has  been  briefed   by   various

Ministries,  statutory boards, non-Government organisations  and

the  voluntary  welfare organisations as  well,  to  familiarise

itself   with  the  various  policies,  programmes  and   issues

associated with an aging population.  Work groups are now  being

formed  to  conduct  in-depth reviews in the  various  areas  of

concern,  eg,  employment,  employability,  financial  security,

housing and social integration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ho that we must encourage the habit and

create  opportunities  for continuing  education  and  life-long

learning  for older Singaporeans.  This is key to employability,

financial  security  as  well as personal  enrichment  in  later

years.   He  suggested  setting up a  dedicated  university  for

senior  citizens.  Presently, senior citizens who wish to pursue

higher  education already have the opportunity to do so at  some

existing  institutions  of higher learning,  such  as  our  Open

University.   One  way  is  for the  university  to  tailor  its

programmes  to  meet the needs and aspirations of older  people.

In  any  case,  I will pass on this suggestion  to  the  IMC  to

consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Parliamentary Secretary will now reply to two

questions related to the People's Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community

Development  (Mr Chan Soo Sen): Sir, on behalf of  my  Minister,

allow  me  to  address  two  of the amendments  related  to  the

People's Association.  One is by Mr Low Thia Khiang on voluntary

organisations and social workers, and the other  is  by  Mr  Ang

Mong  Seng  on  community bonding.  Since both  amendments  were

raised in Mandarin, allow me to reply in Mandarin as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng said that grassroots organisations have

made  great  efforts in uniting our nation, and have contributed

greatly  to  our  nation building and national unity.   I  fully

agree with him.  Mr Ang has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>

also  mooted the idea of a "Unity Circle".  The 12  Cs  that  he

mentioned  yesterday are actually related to  unity  cycle.   We

look  forward to hearing more specific recommendations from  him

on how to put this idea into practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suggested that there should be National Day Observance

ceremonies at every community club or community centre.  I agree

with  him  and  I  will  urge all the  CCs  to  take  this  into

consideration.  He has also recommended that at the National Day

Parade, we should have some display of our defence facilities to

show  our people our defence readiness. The People's Association

will  bring  up  this  matter   with  the  National  Day  Parade

Committee for its consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang mentioned that the voluntary social

workers  are  not enjoying due recognition in our  society,  and

that  they  have  no status.  He commented  that our  grassroots

organisations have a lot of benefits, and he asked whether these

grassroots  organisations enjoy all these benefits because  they

are actually serving the PAP, and not the community. .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the last point that he raised. In fact,

this is not the first time that he has brought up the matter.  I

must  reiterate  that  the  grassroots organisations  serve  the

community  and not the PAP.  In fact, we make it  a  point  that

activities of the PAP  are kept clearly distinct from  community

activities.   For example, the PAP is not allowed to  carry  out

any  activities in the community centres, because the  community

centres  are run by community organisations.  If he  feels  that

the  grassroots  leaders are getting the benefits  because  they

serve  the  PAP, he is wrong. As Mr Ang Mong Seng has said,  the

grassroots organisations have contributed greatly in uniting our

nation and in enhancing our social cohesiveness.  Over the  past

30  years, they have observed the main objectives of uniting our

nation  and   enhancing  cohesiveness  among  our  people.   Our

society  has undergone great changes in the past 30 years.   The

grassroots  organisations are able to adjust themselves  and  to

continue being relevant to our nation.  Therefore, we feel  that

the grassroots organisations

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>

deserve the rewards or recognition that they are getting  today.

In  some  grassroots organisations, the volunteer  workers  have

dedicated the best time of their lives to community service.   I

think this is indeed very praiseworthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang also mentioned that our voluntary social

workers need to be given better rewards and recognition  in  our

society,  and  he is concerned about the welfare of  the  social

workers.  I fully agree with him on this point. I think  all  of

us  in  this House will also agree with him on this.  Yesterday,

my  Minister  mentioned that MCD will set up  an  inter-Ministry

agency  to facilitate volunteerism.   One of the main objectives

of this agency is to do a comprehensive overall review on how to

provide  better  rewards and  recognition  for  these  voluntary

social  workers.  If anyone has any suggestion,  please  let  me

know  and I will commit it to this agency for consideration.   I

think we should also attach more importance to volunteerism.   I

hope that by the 21st century we will have more volunteer social

workers coming forward to serve our nation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, a

clarification  from  the Parliamentary  Secretary.   When  doing

voluntary  work,  sometimes our VWOs exceed the  time  of  their

parking coupons and they were summoned for that.  Why can we not

provide  VWOs who drive the convenience of free parking  in  our

HDB or URA car parks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Parliamentary Secretary said that the work of

the  PAP  and  the grassroots organisations is not  related.   I

would like him to state categorically how do the PAP workers and

the   grassroots  workers  disassociate  themselves  during  the

general elections.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, regarding the parking

problem, as I have said just now, we can let the proposed agency

look into it.  Not all volunteer workers drive. So we will   see

whether   something can be done about it.  Let the  agency  look

into the matter and see what is the outcome.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the general elections, grassroots organisations do

not   participate  in  PAP's  election  work.   If   they   have

participated, that is because they themselves are  PAP  members.

We  do  not  deny  that  there are some  members  of  grassroots

organisations who are PAP members.  If they help the PAP in  the

election  work,  they  are  working in  their  capacity  as  PAP

members.   They  are not helping the PAP in  their  capacity  as

grassroots workers.  There is no association in the first place,

so, therefore there is no question of dissociation.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to speak on

the  need  for a review of public assistance rates.  I have  two

issues of concern to raise.  First, public assistance rates  for

the poor have not been revised for the past few years.  The cost

of  living has been very tight for the unsupported poor.   Their

source  of  assistance has thinned out, because of  the  current

economic   problems.   There  are  less  people  providing   the

necessary support.  In the light of this, there is a need to see

what  the Ministry of Community Development would be able to  do

in revising the public assistance rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that I would like to raise is a more

pressing problem.  This is in connection with the unskilled  and

unsupported  retrenched workers.  There are quite  a  number  of

them that I have been noticing this trend in the meet-the-people

sessions  and other community organisations.  I feel  that  this

group, for the first time, have run into difficulties.  For many

years since the last recession or even close to the 1950s,  this

phenomenon has not come about.  The problems of older, unskilled

retrenched workers probably need closer attention, because  many

of  them have families.  Some of them are in their late 40s  and

below  50, who have found great difficulty in getting employment

over  a period.  Because, in the first place, they are unskilled

and  that  many of the companies that they are working with  are

relocating to other economies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the short term, there is a need for PA rules to be

made flexible to provide temporary financial assistance for this

group  of  retrenched older workers.  Would MCD be  prepared  to

look  into helping these unemployed retrenched workers and their

families?  Perhaps may I suggest that a social support  fund  be

made  available to provide temporary assistance to  them  for  a

period  of time so that they would be able to get through  their

difficulties  until  they  find alternative  employment  through

further training.  This would be one solution to a problem  like

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a longer term measure, this issue is likely to

recur  when we run into another economic problem in future.   It

is  therefore  necessary for MCD, the Ministry of  Manpower  and

Singapore  Employers' Federation to work out a scheme to  follow

through   retrenched  workers,  particularly  older   retrenched

workers,  who  are unlikely to find employment,  or  would  have

difficulty  in finding employment.  This group of  people  would

perhaps  require  closer  attention of  the  various  Ministries

concerned, including NTUC, which together with its members could

work on a concerted effort to tackle the problems of these older

workers.   I would like to find out from the Minister  what  are

the plans it has to deal with these special problems.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, MCD reviews the

public  assistance given to the poor and needy  once  every  two

years.   I believe, this year, public assistance will be up  for

review also.  I would like to ask what adjustments will be  made

to  increase  the  amount given out under the Public  Assistance

Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than 28,000 being retrenched last year, I

understand   not  all  those  who  lost  their   jobs   received

retrenchment  benefits.   The  criteria  for  Public  Assistance

Scheme which till now still help only the very poor need  to  be

relaxed.   Older  retrenched workers,  particularly  those  with

outdated skills and with families to support will need temporary

help to tide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>

them   over  prolonged  unemployment,  especially  during   this

economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask what schemes will be put in place to provide

temporary  assistance to those who have  been  out  of  the  job

market for some time, especially those who have exhausted  their

savings?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, in the course of my

constituency work, I have come across many families who  are  in

need of financial assistance.  Very often, these people are in a

desperate  situation, either because they have lost their  jobs,

their loved ones have passed away or they have been deserted  by

their  spouses.  Invariably, where these families have children,

it  is  often  the children who suffer as a consequence.   These

residents  have  the gumption to come to my  assistance  or  the

assistance  of  my  CCC.   Invariably,  in  the  course  of  the

interview,  I  learn  that besides getting  in  touch  with  the

grassroots  organisations,  many  of  these  people   who   need

financial assistance or public assistance are not aware  of  the

many  schemes  that are available which can be  of  help  during

these  difficult  times.   These public assistance  schemes  may

include, for example, the Small Families Improvement Scheme, the

CCC   Welfare   and   Education  Committee's  Scholarships   and

Bursaries, the CDC Assistance Scheme, to name a few.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about those who never thought of seeking assistance

from  the  MP  or  the  grassroots organisations?   How  can  we

effectively reach out to them and extend the assistance provided

by these public assistance schemes?  For them, they operate in a

world  of ignorance, and unless we reach out to them, it may  be

that  they would never be able to take advantage of these public

assistance schemes that are available.  Additionally,  it  could

also  be  that  many of these people are just too  shy  to  come

forward  to  seek  the  assistance of  the  Government,  or  the

voluntary  welfare  organisations in  respect  of  these  public

assistance schemes.  The fact that for many of these  people  in

need of financial assistance, they need to be told of the public

assistance  schemes, either through the grassroots organisations

or through the voluntary welfare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>

organisations, tells us that these schemes are not  very  widely

known  or well publicised.   If we want to do more for the  less

fortunate Singaporeans, we should be more proactive rather  than

reactive.  We should, in the first place, take steps to  educate

Singaporeans  on what they can do or who they  can  turn  to  in

times of need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen public information campaign run by the various

Ministries, such as the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry  of

Health.   However, I have yet to see a concerted effort  by  the

Ministry  of  Community  Development in running  mass  education

campaigns through the public media to inform Singaporeans of the

public  assistance schemes.  I am not sure whether MCD's  choice

in  not using the public media to publicise these schemes arises

from  a reluctance to encourage a perception of Singapore  as  a

welfare  state.  Personally, I do not think using the  media  to

publicise  the  schemes that are available  is  a  step  in  the

direction.  On the other hand, using the public media  maximises

our effort in reaching out to those who are genuinely in need of

assistance and thus helps us to care for them in a way which we,

as   Singaporeans,  should.   Such effort  by  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development  is important, particularly  during  this

difficult  time when more people are unemployed than before.   I

would  like to ask the Minister whether more effort can be  made

by  the Ministry to promote awareness among Singaporeans on  the

various programmes and assistance that Singaporeans can turn  to

for help, if necessary.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  in the past, some 29,000 workers were retrenched or facing

retrenchment. According to a survey, the situation today is that

out  of  every  ten job seekers, only four jobs  are  available.

Another survey shows that 50% of the retrenched workers  have to

wait  for  nine  months before they can get another  job.   This

shows that it is not easy to find alternative jobs nowadays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32% of the workers will be unemployed for more than nine

months.  Being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>

unemployed  for  nine  months is a long  period.   These  people

depend  on  their past savings to tide them over  the  difficult

times.   After  the nine months, I believe their  savings  would

have  been exhausted.  These people would probably have to  look

to  the  Government agencies and other charitable  organisations

for  help.   We  know  that  the Singapore  Government's  Public

Assistance Scheme is quite stringent in its allocation of funds.

The  amount allocated is barely enough to meet the basic  living

expenses.   Those  who are in receipt of this assistance  cannot

have other sources of income.  I would like the Minister to tell

us whether there is an increase in the number of people who have

applied  for  public assistance during the past one  year.   For

those  who have been unemployed for more than nine months,  will

the  Government be more liberal and sympathetic towards them  so

that  they  can receive public assistance?  I am  making   these

suggestions  because those who are receiving  public  assistance

cannot depend on it for a living for long.  As soon as they find

a job, they would not ask for public assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the amount they receive in the form of

public  assistance  is barely enough to meet  the  basic  living

expenses,  and therefore the recipients' standard of living  and

quality of life have been affected   Their family members may be

very  young.    Therefore, a drop in the quality of  life  would

affect  their  health. Can the Government  consider  allowing  a

public  assistance recipient's family members to work part  time

to help make ends meet?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> According to

the  economic crisis  monitoring report of a number  of  clients

from  Family  Service Centres, the people most affected  by  the

current  economic  downturn  were  female  single  parents  aged

between  36-49  years  old and living in  2-room  flats.   Their

problems  were  primarily difficulties  in  securing  employment

after  retrenchment,  in  meeting  basic  household  needs   and

children's school related expenses.  Other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>

familial  problems were also apparent like marital conflict  and

mental health problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister: how does the public

assistance  scheme help such families?  What is the  means  test

being  applied and does the Minister think this is  an  adequate

formula to follow?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between June and December 1998, there were 1,504

applications  for public assistance compared to 814 applications

between  January and May earlier.  We are seeing an 85% increase

in  petitions.   During the last six months of  the  past  year,

there  were  136 applications for the Small Families Improvement

Scheme and 524 applications for assistance under RUAS.  Yet  the

Interim  Financial Scheme only gave out $91,924.  This seems  to

me  a small amount and my immediate reason is: is our means test

for  eligibility for financial assistance too mean?   Or  is  it

because there is just that small number of applications  in  the

first  place?   Or  perhaps the procedures are so  onerous  that

ordinary folks give up applying for them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said yesterday that the safety net was

adequate.  Yet, at the ground level, hotlines and social service

centres have registered a rise in the number of calls related to

financial  difficulties.  There is less money for VWOs  to  hand

out to distressed families due to shrinking funds and priorities

are  given  to  developing  credible programmes  for  long  term

benefit, a strategy which I do agree with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister help me understand whether the spending

of $91,924 in the last six months of 1998 was constrained by the

limited  availability  of  funds?  How  many  applications  were

rejected and on what reasons?  I am glad to learn from Dr Ho Tat

Kin  earlier that the Public Assistance Scheme is up for  review

this year. The question I would then put to the Minister is: has

the Ministry developed a misery index to redefine and categorise

the  broad range of the poor and near-poor who may be long  term

unemployed or unemployable?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made the call for identifying a misery index in

August last year during the motion presented by Mr Lim Swee  Say

and  Mr Seng Han Thong.  Please allow me to make that plea again

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we set up a cross-agency fact finding task force

comprising  Government statisticians, academics, social  workers

and  others  to identify the distressed and design  a  Singapore

specific  misery index with indices which are socio-economic  in

nature?   Some countries consider inflation and unemployment  as

the  significant measures.  If one includes other measures  like

retrenchment  and  bankruptcies, the misery index  in  Singapore

actually  would  indicate that Singapore was  quite  unhappy  in

1998,  to  quote a Business Times report by Anna Teo in  January

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bankruptcies increased by 44.3% in the first eight months

of  1998 over the same period in 1997, according to a report  by

Lianhe  Zaobao.  If  we  were to add more  indicators  like  the

decline  in  wages,  the  number of  mortgage  sales,  companies

winding  up,  CPF  default rate, rise in crime rate,  etc.,  the

misery index evidently will point to a rising gloom level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an index can be configured out of any combination of

appropriate indicators.  I am not clear at this point  what  our

statisticians  use  as indicators to assess  the  socio-economic

health of our society during this economic downturn.  Could  the

Minister clarify this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without such information, we will never be certain in

ascertaining the citizens' well-being and even less clear  about

who  we  should help, how much and for how long.  It  cannot  be

left  to  social  institutions like the NCSS to carry  out  this

survey  either  because it does not have the resources  nor  the

mechanism to process such comprehensive data.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public assistance as a specific instrument to help the

destitute may need a fresh perspective to redefine its execution

in  line  with  how  we determine the misery index  during  this

downturn.  Public assistance as a broad policy of assistance to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>

the  needy will also require new points about what kind of  help

is   more  critical  at  this  point.   It  does  not  mean  new

development   projects  or  social  institutions.    But,   more

critically,  it would mean direct and duration specific  support

programmes to distressed families.  I hope the energies spent in

an  exercise  will  help the Ministry make a stronger  and  more

forceful  request  for  a supplementary  budget  this  year,  if

necessary, and a bigger budget next year.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, before I move on

to  my  amendment,  let  me declare my interest.   I  sit  as  a

resource panel member for the GPC and I am also a member of  the

Maintenance of Parents Tribunal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all are grateful to the MCD for the fine work it

has  done.  It not only looks after the needy and the community,

but  I  think it carries two very important aspects of  software

without which I think we will be at a loss.  I speak of the work

of   the  People's  Association  (PA),  which  comes  under  the

Minister,  as well as the Feedback Unit.  It is a very important

instrument.  And I think over the years, both these institutions

have grown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's plea by the Members has made the writer of the

Gallery  column in the Straits Times, Miss Chua, to say that  we

all have been very socialist.  We are socialists, Sir.  Even the

Opposition, the Government Party and the NMPs believe in  social

causes.  That is why we are urging the Minister.  Unfortunately,

the Finance Minister is not here after the Budget.  I would urge

him  to  give just less than half a billion dollars to MCD.   No

money, no work.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> No talk.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> No talk, also. So I think it is very

important  to  urge the Cabinet that this is an  area  which  we

cannot afford to be less than generous.  We have to be generous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to the amendment now, Sir. I wholeheartedly

agree with my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>

Chairman,  Dr  Vasoo,  and Mdm Claire Chiang  earlier  that  the

public assistance scheme must be re-examined.  The time when  it

was  first  laid  down had changed.  I would ask  the  Minister:

would  he  consider in the near future to raise the ceiling?   I

also urge the Minister to go one step further.  We have Edusave.

We have Medisave. Can we save a substantial sum of money and set

aside  for a Community Fund?  I see no harm in being  a  bit  of

welfare state when there is a need, after all, the citizens have

worked out.  Give them something in return, and this is the time

now  when  we  should  consider those of our  citizens  who  are

jobless,  sick  and  disabled.  They are not asking  for  public

assistance  as  it is done in other countries, which  becomes  a

social norm.  Here they do out of necessity, Sir.  I, therefore,

urge the Minister to consider setting aside a fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, voluntary organisations and others are affected by

this  economic  downturn.   They  are  getting  less  funds.   I

disagree  with the political leadership that we should  not  dip

into  the  reserves.   There is no  need  to  dip  on  the  past

reserves.  The present Government has got enough surpluses,  and

part  of  the  surpluses could be set aside for  this  community

project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as time is running short, I would touch on another

aspect  of  it.   The  Ministry should  also  strengthen  family

values, as earlier Members have spoken.  I am glad that both the

Ministry of Health and MCD have come out with a package for  the

elderly.  I think the people who have worked behind it have done

a  good job, and I hope and pray the Minister will adopt all the

proposals.  I would like the Minister's comment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that

"guillotine" time on this Head is 1.45 pm.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, the problem of juvenile delinquency has

been  recently  highlighted,  and  there  are  concerns  in  the

community   about  the  increasing  number  of  young   juvenile

delinquents.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>

problem  has  to  be tackled from various fronts:  the  family's

participation, the Police will have to play a role; the schools,

the  community and the rehabilitation agencies.   If  all  these

frontiers  could work together, then there will be a possibility

to reduce the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of that, many young delinquents are placed in

institutions  for  rehabilitation, how are they  prevented  from

being  polluted by hardened delinquents?  I note  that  some  of

them who are very young are sent for rehabilitation.  There is a

need  to  implement  rehabilitation  measures  which  take  into

consideration  how to deal with these younger  persons  who  are

sent for rehabilitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area of concern is recidivism. It is common

after  these  juvenile  delinquents have  been  discharged  from

institutions.  The success of rehabilitation depends on  follow-up measures carried out.  What I would like to find out from the

Minister  is: what is the recidivism rate like and what measures

are taken to deal with the problem?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, many people think of juveniles as kids

who  are  left  to themselves and cause trouble in the  shopping

malls.  They stare at each other, they get into fights.  Many of

the  juveniles are beyond parental control.  Some  339  children

were  brought  before the Subordinate Courts because  they  were

beyond  parental  control.   More  juvenile  crimes  are   being

reported  and  more juveniles are being sent  to  reform  homes.

Statistics  also  show that young juveniles are committing  more

serious crimes.  Juveniles are no longer limited to boys.  Girls

also  form  gangs which are just as violent.   I was told  of  a

case  in a reputable girls' school where they actually set  fire

to  the  school  toilet  to  express  dissatisfaction  with  the

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, with the Internet, children are not just left

to  wander  by themselves in the shopping mall but also  in  the

whole  wide  world.   They can now be exposed  to  all  the  bad

elements that are found on the Internet, without having to  step

out of the home.  Children must therefore be trained

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>

to  be  smart, especially on the Internet.  The old  grandmother

teaching the children not to talk to strangers is just  as  true

today for the Internet age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some views that certain groups of incorrigible

juveniles  will not be suitable for treatment under the  current

juvenile  justice system because of their attitude and character

and  their  presence may make rehabilitation of  other  juvenile

offenders in the juvenile justice system difficult.  May  I  ask

the  Minister  how  true is this view, and what  statistics  are

available to support this allegation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inter-Ministry Committee to review the Children and

Young Persons Act has been formed, with the objective of looking

at  the adequacy of treatment options to deal with juveniles who

commit serious crimes.  May I ask what progress has been made by

this Inter-Ministry Committee?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in dealing with juvenile crimes, we should focus on

the  child and to see how best to reintegrate the kids back into

society.  The family is the primary institution of care for  the

young  and  good parenting is probably the single most important

factor  in  determining  the quality of the  upbringing  of  the

children.   Good  parenting  skills today,  among  many  others,

should  include  capability  to  detect  signs  early  to  guide

troubled children and developing strategies to help them.   What

programmes would the MCD provide to help parents to develop good

parenting  skills?  What measures will be taken to  involve  the

parents more in the rehabilitation of the juveniles?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, child abuse is on the increase and

public  education requires to inculcate both parents  and  those

who  are  in  care of their children to be more  fair  to  their

children.   I am not against the idea of using the rod.   But  I

think  it should be used sparingly.  By all means, instill  fear

in  the child, but do not go to the extent of abusing the child.

Many  of  the children, unfortunately, those who are abused,  do

not  receive medical attention.  The reason is that the  parents

or  the  guardians  fear  that they will  be  brought  to  book.

Besides education, may I ask the Minister whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>

he  will consider having a legislative measure in the long  term

to  see that those who abuse their children are brought to book,

if wise counsel fails.  A recent newspaper report was very, very

shocking when it reported that adopted children were abused and,

if  not  for the timely intervention of the teacher,  God  alone

knows what will happen!  So I urge the Minister to consider this

position.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, first,

I  would  like  to  withdraw  my cut on  National  Language  and

concentrate on multi-culturalism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite years of racial harmony and peaceful co-existence

among   the   various  races,  racial,  cultural  and  religious

diversity  in  Singapore will continue to present  a  number  of

important and potentially divisive questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of self-help groups has been one of the

key strategies in our approach to solve these dilemmas faced  by

us  and  the community.  Despite the success of these  self-help

groups, and for which they deserve much praise, I would say that

finding  a  morally defensible and politically viable answer  to

some  of these questions will remain a challenge facing us.   In

many  other  countries,  minorities and majorities  continue  to

clash   on   issues   such   as  language,   rights,   political

representation and education curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of recent, there has been talk within the community of the

potentially divisive issues with regard to racial discrimination

faced  by job seekers, of Malays in the Singapore Armed  Forces,

and of the emphasis given to the development of Chinese cultural

elites  and the establishment of the SAP schools.  We have  seen

recently  how  the announcement of a certain training  programme

initiative by the CDAC and the condition that it excludes  other

ethnic  groups  from participating in this programme  can  cause

unease.   Fortunately, in this instance, it turned out that  all

self-help groups will run similar programmes.  I am glad that we

are  now  able  to talk on these issues openly and  objectively.

While the answers and assurances given by the various

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>

Ministers have helped people to view these issues in its  proper

perspective,   it   is  quite  natural  for   different   ethnic

communities  to  view these issues and others  differently,  and

they  see  it  from  the  "outside".   Perhaps  those  who  have

experienced  greater  racial and cultural integration  in  their

workplace, in schools, in the SAF, and in the communities may be

better   able  to  understand  these  issues  from   a   broader

perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first say that I agree with the Government's

approach  of  having self-help groups on racial and ethnic  line

because  in  order to get beyond race, we must first  take  into

account  race.  There is no other way.  In order to  treat  some

people equally, we must perhaps treat them differently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realise that deep in our conscience, in our least

political moments, when relaxing in the privacy of our homes, we

are  very  much more likely than not to gravitate towards  those

whom we perceive as our own kind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of this recognition that we have groups that

have  been  able, through the various initiatives,  to  increase

their  ethnic identity and consciousness and contribute  to  the

self-esteem of ethnic minority.  They have been very  successful

in   reaching   out  to  the  community,  attracting   dedicated

volunteers  and introducing programmes tailored to the  specific

cultural and ethnic needs.  They have provided opportunities for

unified and cohesive approach in dealing with the issues of  the

community and containing potential problems within the group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to caution that the very success of these

self-help groups, based on powerful forces of race and  religion

and  ethnic  identity,  can bring about a number  of  unintended

consequences.   I  am particularly troubled  by  the  fact  that

unleashing  of  these  ethnic  energies,  while  successful   in

developing  the  social infrastructure of the ethnic  community,

can  potentially  develop  to become  an  alternative  to  other

secular programmes,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>

instead of being in support of the broader national objectives.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of education, for example. We have seen how

ethnic  communities  are  now able to provide  education  in  an

entirely  ethnic  environment,  beginning  from  the  young   to

adulthood.  While this may be a big step forward from the  point

of  view  of  the  community, it can be regressive  and  a  step

backwards  for  the  ethnic community  and  for  all  of  us  in

Singapore.   Experiences  in North America  have  shown  that  a

separate  ethnic  based education system has  not  succeeded  in

providing  lifelong  meaningful  employment  opportunities.   In

fact, they may become a catalyst of isolationist tendencies, ie,

extremism and hate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope can we have if a section of our community grows

up   into  adulthood  in  an  entirely  different  ethnic  based

education?   What  hope have we got if we allow  them  to  erect

walls  between us and making it less possible to reach  out  and

embrace  and  understand other communities in our  society?   We

have  seen how countries that have practised racial assimilation

for  years completely broken and fractured into divisive  ethnic

communities   when   the   social   and   economic   environment

deteriorates.  Can our society survive such a challenge?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that many of these ethnic issues

surfaced  during  the current economic crisis because  they  can

blame racial discrimination for unemployment.  They can blame on

the  education policy and the lack of a level playing field  for

poor scholastic achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned that these rules and practices within

some  of  these  self-help  groups which  contain  an  exclusive

element  in the Articles of Association will prevent  them  from

providing  some of these services to other racial  groups.   Why

cannot  the  reverse happen?  Why should we  deny  someone  from

another  race  who may have very good reasons to participate  in

the  programmes of some other ethnic communities?   We  need  to

adopt a more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>

inclusive  approach to make it easier for other members  of  the

community to take part in these activities.  We now have colour-blind policies but not necessarily colour-blind programmes.  But

this must be our ultimate goal and we can do this by making  our

programmes more accessible to other communities and seize  every

available opportunity for inter-racial collaboration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you allow some time for the other

Members?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> I will take another minute or

so, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, finish your speech, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> OK. I would therefore like to

urge  the Minister to make it compulsory for some programmes  to

have  multiracial participation if it is going  to  qualify  for

Government subsidies and incentives.  We have the best community

centres award each year.  Why not make multiracial activity part

of  these assessment critieria?  We have racial quotas for  HDB.

Why  not  have  racial quotas for our childcare and  pre-primary

kindergartens?  And I urge the Minister to take care of this  in

reviewing some of these policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiculturalism will remain an ideal we will have to

protect and constantly struggle to work for, because we have  no

other choice, but to try to achieve.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, since

time is running short, I would just like to ask the Minister  to

give  an update on the activities of the Family Development Unit

of Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

recently  Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong challenged the  Singapore

Badminton  Association to capture the Thomas  Cup  by  the  21st

century  and the Football Association of Singapore to raise  the

standard of our football so that we may one day qualify for  the

final round of the World Cup.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These may seem to be tall orders, but not entirely

impossible,  provided we  take practical steps to attain   these

targets.   First  of  all, we must identify our  obstacles.   We

should  analyse the problems in a very analytical and  objective

manner  so  that we can concentrate our efforts  to  strive  for

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we must enhance the professional status of

our athletes. The  prime time of these athletes is from 20 to 35

years  old,  after which they will need to have some  plans  for

their  second  careers.   We have just a few hundred   sportsmen

and  sportswomen who are capable of bringing glory to Singapore.

I  think we should help them to develop some retirement plans so

that  they   can  feel assured that life after  competitions  is

being  looked  after, and they can concentrate on their  present

efforts to do well in the field of sports they excel in.  We can

perhaps arrange for them to become coaches, trainers or physical

education   teachers   upon   their   retirement   from   active

competitions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you just ask the question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Secondly, it is about the

funds  available to our national sports associations.   I  think

all  our  associations are lacking in funds.  I  hope  that  the

Minister  for  Finance can allocate more funds to the  Singapore

Sports  Council to help the various sports in the next financial

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the lack of training venue and facilities.

Perhaps,  our National Stadium and the Singapore Indoor  Stadium

should  be  converted into a training village  to  promote  more

sports  activities.  As Prime Minister Goh has said, we want  to

capture  the  Thomas  Cup  by the next century,  the  Government

should  try its best to provide an environment conducive to  the

development  of the various sports in Singapore.   Every  effort

must  be made to make it easier for our athletes and players  to

train  and  give full play to their potential, in  order  to  be

developed into world-beaters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> I think I have only 10 minutes to

answer  all the questions.  Sir, I will cover the cuts on social

assistance by Dr Vasoo, Dr Ho, Mr Sin Boon Ann, Prof.  Low  Seow

Chay  and NMPs, Mdm Claire Chiang and Mr Shriniwas Rai.  On  the

help  for  retrenched  workers, as  I  mentioned  in  my  speech

yesterday,  there  is already quite a comprehensive  safety  net

available.   We have things like the approved Interim  Financial

Scheme, the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme (RUAS) and  the

CDCs  and grassroots organisations launching new schemes to help

the  retrenched, including one-off national grants, tie-ups with

hawker  stalls to offer hot meals and food and ration  vouchers.

All cases of hardship arising from retrenchment, especially when

the  breadwinner has difficulties finding another job,  will  be

dealt with sympathetically by my Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also links retrenched workers to other

Government  agencies  and  no child  will  be  denied  education

because  of  financial difficulty in the  family.   For  working

mothers  who have been retrenched, my Ministry has also extended

the period of Government childcare subsidy.  Low-income families

can also tap on the centre-based financial assistance scheme for

childcare  and  the back-to-work childcare scheme to  supplement

subsidies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low has asked if the Ministry allows PA recipients to

take  up  part-time jobs to supplement their  income.   Sir,  we

encourage and assist indeed PA recipients to get a job.  We will

take  off PA only after we are satisfied that they have a steady

income to support themselves and their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin asked whether we should push awareness of the target

audience  on PA and all other assistance available in Singapore.

Sir,  instead of going on a media blitz, as Mr Sin suggested,  I

think  it  is better for us to go direct to the people involved,

people  who  care and look after the less fortunate and  to  the

less  fortunate themselves.  We have, for example,  briefed  the

CDCs,  members  of  grassroots organisations  and  VWOs  on  the

schemes and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>

services MCD and its related agencies have to help all those  in

financial  distress.  We have a directory of services given  out

to  the  advisers to grassroots organisations, senior  managers,

town councils, HDB Branch Offices, PA, CDCs and VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also involved, and this is important, the CDCs and

RCs  on  an  outreach  programme for families.   This  programme

brings  together volunteers from the CDCs, the RCs and the  VWOs

to  go from door to door to inform families residing in 1- or 2-room  flats  of  the schemes and services they can  tap  on.   A

booklet of all major schemes is given to the families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang asked for more help for single parents.

I  assure  her  that every case in need will be helped.   Single

parent families who do not qualify for PA may receive short-term

financial  assistance.  And once they are on PA, they  also  get

other  forms  of assistance from other groups and their  school-going children will be referred to the Ministry of Education for

help in their schooling expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to means test, the test is actually very simple

and  people  merely need to call us or our agency if  they  need

help,  and  they need not apply in person and no forms  will  be

needed to be filled if they want any help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the misery index, the index which she

referred  to includes other miseries as well, quite  apart  from

PA.  So I am not too sure whether it can directly apply to us in

that  sense.   Anyway,  we  have  other  more  direct  means  of

ascertaining PA rates.  And for planning purposes, we have means

such  as the minimum household expenditure survey data.  We  are

reviewing  the  criteria for the PA scheme and sufficient  funds

have been set aside for PA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On juvenile delinquency, I agree with Dr Vasoo and Dr Ho

that arrests have indeed increased over the last two years after

a  drop  in 1996.  I would like to emphasise here that  parental

and family involvement is the cornerstone in effective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>

rehabilitation and parents who undergo orientation are  involved

in  the  development and implementation of treatment  plans  for

their  children.   Community involvement and support  also  help

strengthen and facilitate the rehabilitation process.  All these

are highly featured in our rehabilitation protocols.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On institutionalisation and after care, Dr Vasoo may be

happy  to  know  that we have set up the new  Boys'  Complex  in

Jurong  to replace the old and dilapidated Singapore Boys'  Home

A   and   B.    It  has  better  facilities  which   allow   for

implementation  of  more  rehabilitation  programmes.   What  is

unique here too is that it has a classification centre where all

newly  admitted  juveniles are assessed by a  multi-disciplinary

team  of  professionals  for possible risks,  for  their  social

emotional needs and the aptitude for training and education.  An

individual  care plan is then developed for more  effective  and

focused rehabilitation of each resident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification also allows the home to separate the boys in

different  dormitories  according  to  the  seriousness  of  the

offences and also the degree of their delinquency.  So  I  think

this  will  avoid  contamination which the Member  is  concerned

with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On incorrigible juveniles, as mentioned by Dr Ho, we are

indeed seeing an increase of such offenders.  But in fact, world-wide,  we  are  seeing  the emergence of very  small  groups  of

juveniles with extremely low or no rehabilitation potential, and

they  are  usually not remorseful about their offences  at  all.

The  number  in  Singapore, Sir, is actually  relatively  small,

about  five  to 10 cases each year in MCD homes.  They  are  not

responsive  to the homes' programmes.  They threaten the  safety

of   residents  and  staff,  and  they  are  defiant  and   also

disruptive.  The incorrigible juvenile is usually brought before

the  Juvenile Court for transfer to the approved school or Young

Offenders Section in the Reformatory Training Centre (RTC) under

the Prisons Department.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai talked about child abuse which has been

increasing.   I  agree with him.  It is a very serious  form  of

abuse.  I agree with him that children should be loved and cared

for  and  not be abused, least of all by their parents  or  step

parents.   I would like to assure Members that my Ministry  will

come  down  hard on child abuses.  While the number of  reported

cases  of  child  abuse has gone up over the past  three  years,

averaging  about  160  cases annually, the number  of  confirmed

cases of abuse has actually been quite stable, averaging between

25  and 28 cases annually.  I support the NMP's suggestion  that

members  of  the  community,  and particularly  the  neighbours,

should report all cases of child abuse.  The Member may wish  to

know that we have a child abuse hotline, managed by my Ministry,

and indeed this is an avenue or conduit which the public can use

to report child abuse cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure the NMP and members of the public that

identify people who report child abuse to my Ministry that  they

are  kept strictly confidential.  All reports of suspected child

abuse will be thoroughly investigated and looked into.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is "guillotine" time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, underlying all these appeals is that it is

not  no money but we do not have new money.  My GPC members will

its strategic plans to deal with the new problems.  With that, I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

No. (1).  Mr Loh Meng See.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased that the Government has continued to be

generous  in providing ample funds to the Ministry of Education.

In  fact,  a  larger  budget of $5.72 billion  has  been  given,

despite the overall tighter budget this year in the midst of the

very difficult economic times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I note that the cost of educating a primary school

pupil  per  annum has fallen from $3,415 in FY98  to  $2,832  in

FY99.   Similarly,  the  cost of educating  a  secondary  school

student  has  also decreased from $5,208 in FY98  to  $4,992  in

FY99.   If  the  per capita expenditure is not reduced  for  the

primary  and secondary school students, this will go a long  way

to  meet  the  extra educational needs of the  pupils  in  their

formative  years.  It would appear that the overall increase  in

budget  provisions  does not benefit the primary  and  secondary

school  students directly.  Here, we are talking about educating

a  student  population of 450,000.  Perhaps,  the  Minister  can

clarify on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Ministry has a critical role to realise

Singapore's  vision  of  "Thinking  Schools,  Learning  Nation".

Principals  and teachers are key.  They are the  forces  in  the

frontline   delivering  the  Desired  Outcomes   of   Education.

Principals  are given greater autonomy to manage their  schools.

Project-based  learning  has  been  introduced.    Schools   are

encouraged  to  organise  rigorous National  Education  and  ECA

activities.    Students   are  exposed   to   outdoor   learning

activities.   Innovative methods of teaching  and  learning  are

instituted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent incident of the Pulau Ubin tragedy and the Jin

Tai  School "mock attack" demonstrated certain weaknesses in our

school  management.  May I ask the Minister on how well-prepared

and  equipped are our principals and teachers to cope  with  the

challenges  of  the new learning environment?  Serious  mistakes

and unfortunate accidents can happen.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>

But how can we assure the public that serious and grave mistakes

do  not lead to the endangering of the safety and health of  our

students?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is adopting the ability-driven approach in

policy planning and practices.  The term "mass customisation" is

a  new  cliche and it has been used to represent this  approach.

The focus is on the individual's ability and developing them  to

the  fullest  potential.   All  abilities  are  required  in   a

knowledge-based economy.  The students are currently streamed on

the  basis  of  the  overall grades in the school  subjects  but

students have differing abilities in different subjects.   Would

the  Ministry be flexible to organise students on the  basis  of

different strengths and abilities in different subjects to  help

them improve and do better?  In a knowledge-based economy, every

individual needs to have a good basic education to build up  his

learning  capabilities.  Our young will grow to be  self-reliant

if  they  can  benefit  fully from their primary  and  secondary

education.  You will realise that I have been focusing my speech

on  the  primary  and secondary education.   They  would  become

employable  in  different jobs in a future of multi-careers.   I

wish  to  urge  the Ministry to work harder to  achieve  further

improvements in our students' performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellence in school performance should not be confined to

areas that are easily quantified and measurable.  Many important

areas  of education that benefit the students are intangible  in

nature.    There   has  been  the  over-emphasis   on   academic

performance  and  not enough emphasis on the non-academic  areas

like project work, ECAs, social and community work.  Perhaps the

school  ranking  system could be modified to  reflect  this  new

emphasis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of moral character of the person has become

more  crucial  with the wide access to information  through  the

Internet. Imparting of positive values and teaching our young to

discern  between  right from wrong are virtues  best  taught  in

their  formative years.  Students who display poor  conduct  and

behaviour

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>

should  be  corrected  early.  The Pastoral  Care  and  Guidance

Programme, if successfully carried out, would have the long term

positive impact on the students.  I wish to urge the Ministry to

continue to devote more resources in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our students to become more creative. But music is

not fully exploited as a normal learning activity.  Research has

shown  that music even helps babies in their mental development.

The large number of children taking music lessons attests to the

value   parents  place  in  the  overall  development  of  their

children.  Should not the school provide music learning for  all

students  rather  than  treating music  as  a  special  elective

subject  catering to a select few?  Sound Blaster was  developed

by  Creative  Technology's Mr Sim Wong  Hoo  who  himself  is  a

harmonica  player.   His  love  for  music  has  paid   handsome

dividends.   So, I think it is important for us  to  bring  back

music  where  I  believe  many of  us,  when  we  were  younger,

benefited from the music lessons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we are proud of our achievements in the

field  of  education.   Our educational system  has  been  rated

highly  by other countries and international agencies.  We  have

had a good start.  We have a strong and firm foundation on which

to  build further.  The Government is right to invest heavily in

the  education  of  our young.  This long-term investment  would

bear   fruits  only  a  generation  later  after  this   present

Government  is  long  gone.  This  is  an  act  of  a  good  and

responsible Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Desired Outcomes of

Education  articulate  explicitly  what  the  education   system

intends  to  develop  in our children at  each  stage  of  their

education.  Mr Wee Heng Tin, Director-General of Education,  has

succinctly described the end result as a whole child, who  apart

from  skills and knowledge, possesses sound morals, strength  of

character,   healthy  habits,  team  spirit  and  an   aesthetic

appreciation for the world around him.  Each child grows into  a

responsible and committed citizen.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are indeed desirable qualities and values for our

young to possess.  These are also the qualities and values  that

our  young must possess to fit into the challenging future.   To

achieve  the  Desired  Outcomes, our  education  system  has  to

change.   It  is important that we manage this change  properly.

Our  education  system has served us well.   Our  students  have

performed  superbly in international tests.  They have  competed

well  in foreign universities.  Many countries want to copy  us.

Hence,  the need to change may not be clear to the people.   But

if they know and understand the rationale for the changes, their

support  will  be stronger and more forthcoming.   The  Ministry

needs to continue with its efforts to explain to the people  the

reasons for change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principals and teachers are major players, helping our

children  to  achieve  the  Desired  Outcomes.   Principals  and

teachers  are  major  change agents  in  the  process  and  must

themselves first adapt to the changes.  They must be comfortable

with the changes if they are to help the children.  But how  are

they  coping  with the changes?  Could the Minister  give  us  a

review  of the current situation in respect to our teachers  and

principals?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has done much to work with the teachers but I

am  still getting feedback from teachers that they feel a lot of

stress.  They feel that they are still largely assessed  on  the

academic performance of their students.  Meanwhile, the emphasis

on  non-academic  aspects has increased.  New initiatives,  like

school clusters and autonomy, add to the pressure.  These create

new administrative duties such as attending meetings, taking and

writing  of minutes and coordination of activities.   They  also

need to go for training as a result of new technologies like IT.

To  cope with the work, they often stay back late in school  and

come  back  on Saturdays.  They find the life of a teacher  very

stressful.   How  many  teachers,  especially  those  with  long

services,  have resigned in the last few years as  a  result  of

stress?  What further help can we give to teachers to ease their

stress and keep them in the service?  Should we also not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>

be  making changes to the way we train our teachers for  a  role

that has changed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals play an important role in introducing and

managing  change.   A  principal who  is  a  good  manager,  who

understands the difficulties and constraints faced by staff, can

help  to  ease in the change.  A principal who is a poor manager

adds  pressure  on  his  or her staff.  In  a  rapidly  changing

environment,  a principal may become over-enthusiastic  and  may

take  on  more  than  he can comfortably  handle.  He  may  then

overlook details and fail to anticipate potential problems.   An

overload  of  activities initiated by a principal can  also  put

stress on the teachers.  We are more aware of the efforts put in

by  the  Ministry to help our teachers than those  to  help  our

principals.   What training and help have been provided  to  our

principals,  especially  those newly promoted  ones,  to  better

manage their schools?  Recently, there were a few mishaps in our

schools.   I  wonder  if the Minister could share  with  us  the

findings of his Ministry on some of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me hasten to add that, on the whole, our principals and

teachers  are coping well with the changes.  But any  effort  to

help  them to better adapt to the changes required will  benefit

them  and  the children under their care even more.  The  school

also  needs  the  involvement of parents and  the  community  to

achieve  the  Desired Outcomes.  The school needs the  home  and

society  to  endorse  and reinforce good  behaviour  and  values

imparted by the school to the child.  To get the children to  be

more  involved  in  the  community,  the  Ministry  started  the

Community  Involvement Scheme. To foster the support of  parents

and  the community for the schools, the Minister late last  year

set  up an Advisory Council of the Committee and Parents Support

System.  It is a far-reaching idea.  The school is a part of the

community.    Their  children study there.   The  community  and

parents  are  interested  in how the schools  in  the  community

operate.  Could the Minister update us on the progress made with

these efforts to involve the community and parents?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one suggestion which I would like the Minister to

consider.   At  the  moment,  there is  no  national  forum  for

interested  parents,  community leaders, school  principals  and

teachers to discuss common issues.  I would like the Minister to

consider organising such a national forum.  We can consider  the

model  of the triennial conference of grassroots leaders the  PA

uses  to bring together grassroots leaders across Singapore  and

PA  staff.   Many good suggestions surface during the conference

and  these ideas have moved forward the grassroots organisations

and  their  effectiveness.  The conference made  the  grassroots

leaders  felt recognised, motivated and wanted.  I believe  that

such  a  conference  could  bring  together  parents,  community

leaders  and  educators  and  will similarly  motivate  everyone

involved  to do more for the school to the ultimate  benefit  of

the students, school and the community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to thank

the  Minister and his team of officers at the Ministry, and  all

the  principals and teachers for their hard work in 1998.  A lot

of  changes  and improvements have been done.  As  Singaporeans,

our education system is something all of us can be proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this afternoon, I just want to bring up one point.

One  of  the  Desired Outcomes of Education,  obviously,  is  to

prepare  young Singaporeans to be the knowledge workers  of  the

future.   One day, two students were challenging each  other  on

who  is  better prepared to be a knowledge worker  of  tomorrow.

One said to the other, "Assuming I am a prisoner and you are the

policeman.   I  am handcuffed and I need to go  to  the  toilet.

You,  as a policeman, would not want to follow me to the toilet.

What can you do to stop me from escaping?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other student said, "No problem. All I have to do is

to  take a rope, put it through your handcuff, and then hold the

two  ends of the rope outside the toilet.  There is no  way  you

can escape, is it not?"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to simulate this, maybe I can ask Mr Low Thia

Khiang  to  help me out with this.  See, there is no way  I  can

escape, because, in a way, the two loops are in a dead lock.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> You can take out your handcuff!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> No. Assuming this is a real handcuff.

There is no way I can get out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the student acting as prisoner said, "I give it to you.

I think you are ready to be a knowledge worker of the future."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student acting as policeman then said, "Very good, but

now  I  challenge  you back.  Are you ready to  be  a  knowledge

worker  of  the  future?  Will you be able  to  find  a  way  to

escape?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This other student said, "No problem, I could escape in

just  one second."  Because the way to look at the situation  is

this.  You define the problem as two interlocking loops.  I  can

always  redefine the situation as one of two loops, parallel  to

each other, circulating my arms.  For me to disengage these  two

loops,  all I have to do is to bring the first loop through  the

second loop and then see what happens?  The rope goes through my

hand and it comes out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I use this example to illustrate the point that to be

knowledge workers of the future, our students not only  have  to

acquire  knowledge,  not  only  have  they  to  learn  to  apply

knowledge but, more importantly, they have to learn to  innovate

with knowledge.  In our human brain, we have countless number of

brain  cells.   The  challenge is to  help  our  students  build

connections to link up as many brain cells as possible,  because

I  was  told by the experts that the more connections there  are

among  our  brain cells, the better, the faster we are  able  to

think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate it if the Minister can update this House

on  what have been done up to now, and what will be done in  the

future  to  continue  to  stimulate  the  minds  of  our   young

Singaporeans so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>

they  can  be  more  creative  and  innovative,  and  to  become

competitive and productive knowledge workers of tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was just wondering how the hon. Member

expects us to record all that in Hansard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, may I propose that Hansard goes

multimedia?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I would like to urge the

Minister to consider increasing the emphasis on volunteerism  as

an additional school activity for achieving the Desired Outcomes

of  Education.   This  is in line with our  national  effort  in

promoting  volunteerism as a way of life for  all  Singaporeans.

Let me elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, by building community service as part of their

course  work,  students  in primary and  secondary  levels  will

develop  an  ethic  of service.  We have so  far  committed  our

students  to  just six hours of community service per  year.   I

feel that this is not enough.  Some public school systems in the

United  States  stipulate that students  complete  75  hours  of

service  between  the 6th and 12th grades as a  requirement  for

secondary school graduation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, studies have shown that by regularising and

intensifying  service contacts with the community, students  who

devoted   their   time  to  service  learning   also   do   well

academically,  develop higher order thinking, social  and  civic

responsibility, greater acceptance of cultural diversity  and  a

higher  level of self esteem.  This is in line with the  desired

outcome of our education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second argument for increased community service for

students  is  the  enhancement of an ethic of  citizenship.   By

engaging in community service, students become active members in

identifying  the  needs  of,  and  seeking  solutions  for,  the

community.   Such  first-hand  experience  helps  to   translate

classroom  exhortation  on being caring  to  seeking  real-world

solutions,   an   exercise  of  reflection   and   action   that

incrementally engage our young as active members, as concerned

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>

citizens.   This is the best stake-holding experience to  foster

in our young a sense of belonging, by making them feel that what

they  are doing for Singapore makes a difference.  Sir, it is  a

powerful emotion of participation and commitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would further urge the Minister to consider allocating

some  start-up resources to tertiary student bodies  to  develop

outreach programmes with respect to community service as well as

leadership  programmes  to train and maintain  campus  volunteer

coordination activities.  These volunteers best serve  as  "peer

mentors" to our young students at the secondary level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third argument is: by increasing the number of hours for

service engagement, there is room for mixing student groups from

different  ethnic backgrounds and academic streams,  maybe  even

from different schools and tertiary institutions to cooperate on

a project.  This not only promotes multi-cultural understanding,

it  also creates a mutually learning environment for students to

be  exposed to differences and new opportunities of finding ways

to  relate to and learn from one another.  We may transform  the

ugly Singaporean to becoming appreciative Singaporean, if I  may

borrow the Minister of State Mr Peter Chen's characterisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry will strongly encourage school

principals to work with various social service organisations  in

the  vicinity to develop a volunteer service network.   In  this

respect,  the  setting up of COMPASS (Community and  Parents  in

Support   of   Schools  Advisory  Council)  was  a   commendable

initiative.  A consistent, system-wide approach in the planning,

scheduling,  orientation and training of volunteers  in  various

service  engagements  has to be in place  to  sustain  students'

interest  in community service.  Perhaps an outstanding  service

award  can  be  given by schools to students  who  perform  well

academically as well as show community spirit through a  genuine

interest  in helping others.  The NKF Champion's award  launched

in 1997 by Minister

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>

Teo  Chee  Hean is one such initiative. Hopefully, by  repeating

these initiatives at every school, the ethic of volunteerism, as

a  way of life and citizenship, will be a powerful catalyst  for

community enhancement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, one long-term

objective   of  the  Education  Ministry  is  to  increase   the

opportunities for young Singaporeans to seek further  education.

Our  education system strives to reduce the drop-out rate  among

students at all levels of schooling.  This is a noble aspiration

which will hopefully be pursued further.  To raise our students'

performance  through  competition, the  Education  Ministry  has

implemented a school ranking system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see normally is that schools at the top are those

that are already known to be very good.  On the other hand, year

after  year,  the  majority of neighbourhood  schools  form  the

category at the bottom of the ranking list.  If Singapore  wants

to  prepare our young citizens in the best way possible for  the

era  of knowledge-based economy, we should help them to maximise

their  potentials,  regardless of  whether  they  study  in  the

outstanding  schools or ordinary neighbourhood schools.   Hence,

while we accord recognition to the leading schools at the top of

the  ranking  every  year, I hope we will not  neglect  to  give

attention to neighbourhood schools whose academic performance is

not  on  par  with  the  better schools.   We  should  give  all

encouragement  and support in terms of basic facilities,  effort

and  also  good teachers to neighbourhood schools so that  their

students,  the  majority  of  whom  are  children  of   moderate

families, could improve their performance in school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to see value-added performance

being given due attention and recognition in placing schools  on

the  ranking list every year.  Whether we like it or not, socio-economic  and  income levels of families have an impact  on  the

educational  performance of students.  Many  adult  Singaporeans

who  have  succeeded  today come from such  families.   We  took

advantage of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>

available  opportunities  to compete and  improve  ourselves  in

education  and career.  If students from moderate and low-income

families could achieve good performance in education, they  will

certainly find sweet success.  This is among the characteristics

of Singaporeans.  We should support and motivate the cultivation

of  values  which  help  in  the creation  of  this  value-added

performance.   I raise this question because I believe  that  it

will   help   in  developing  self-confidence,  motivation   and

capability among our young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage children from moderate families and those

whose  past  performance did not achieve good  results  to  take

advantage  of  all available opportunities in  schools,  I  hope

their  "value-added performance" will be given extra  points  in

school  ranking.  We wish to see our children whose  performance

was  not good at an earlier level achieve better performance  at

the next level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learn that the Ministry of Education now does not rank

schools  only.  It is also implementing ranking among  teachers.

I  am  not  sure whether this will produce a favourable outcome.

But  if  ranking  among  teachers can help  in  improving  their

performance, this is good enough for me.  If it is  accepted  as

good,  I  would  like to suggest that teachers who   help  their

students  in achieving "value-added performance" be  given  more

points in the ranking.  We should send the correct signal to our

educators  that  no  matter how low is the  performance  of  the

students  who  enter  their schools, these  students  should  be

helped to realise their potentials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I would like to ask the Education Minister about

his  assessment  of our students'  "value-added performance"  at

various  levels.   Have  we seen a visible  improvement  in  our

students'  achievement?   What we  do  not  wish  to  see  is  a

situation  whereby "what is pursued is not obtained, while  what

we  have falls out of our grasp", meaning that while value-added

performance  does  not improve significantly, the  stress  level

experienced by teachers rises.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related subject, our schools have received much from

the  Edusave funds to provide special courses for our  students.

Does the Ministry decide on different criteria or guidelines for

different   courses?   Many  schools  obtain  the  services   of

organisations outside schools to run the courses.  How does  the

Ministry  determine  that the courses offered  to  students  are

good?

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to

raise concern over the anguish felt by many students and parents

in lieu of the early operating hours in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the Straits Times that Tan Ming Ming

(not  her  real name), an eight-year-old in Primary  2  gets  up

every morning at 5.00 am to catch a school bus at 5.45 am.  This

is  so that she can be in school by 7.20 am.  This is a familiar

story and a cause of much anguish expressed by many parents.   I

think  we  need  to  review this correctable  situation.   I  am

suggesting  that  whenever possible, as in the case  of  single-session schools, the schools should start later, at say 8.20  am

earliest. This will enable school buses to stagger pick-up times

and   ease   the   traffic  flow  in  the   mornings   somewhat.

Furthermore,  the  peak rush hour for the  office  workers,  who

usually   start  work  at  9.00  am  would  not   be   adversely

compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many single-session primary and secondary schools

that still stick to the 7.20 am start times when, in fact, there

is  no  more  need  for  it to be so. A change  will  avoid  the

frustrations in the early and dark hours of the morning for many

students  going  to school.  This will reduce  the  pressure  on

parents  who  have  to get up to prepare the breakfast  for  the

children  who, in turn, complain that they have no  appetite  at

such  a time in the morning.  This will mean that students  have

to eat lunches in schools and stay longer in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in fact, is a good thing, which brings me to my

second point, relating to the "after school care". Sir, there is

a place

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>

for  all  schools to provide "after school care"  to  those  who

require  this facility.  This would be especially easy with  the

single  session  schools.  We should cater for a changing  trend

where  many families become dual-income earners.  This trend  is

going  to stay, and parents would be delighted to know  that  as

they  work, their children are safe and are supervised in  their

work  after  school.   This  latchkey system  can  also  prevent

children from mixing with the wrong crowds after school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact now that many students get private tuition

that can cost hundreds of dollars per month and tax heavily upon

the  resources of the family.  Perhaps the extra  help  or  even

group  tuition  given  after school will  lessen  the  financial

burdens in many families.  Although more Before-and-After-School-Care  Centres  are being set up in HDB void decks and  community

centres, I feel that schools would really be ideal for this type

of care.  The convenience and lower cost will be plus points for

such care at schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education can allow schools to employ part-time staff, encourage volunteer parents and tap resources from

grassroots  and voluntary groups to mind the after  school  care

programmes.  Space constraints have been given as the reason  by

many  against the idea.  The truth is that a converted classroom

or  a  simple portable cabin or container is all that is needed.

Sir, I hope the Ministry of Education could look in further  and

improve in these two areas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Education has

received  the most number of amendments.  It shows  how  popular

the  Ministry is and how all Singaporeans, including Members  of

this House, take education as a serious issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak on two aspects of the school.

First,  SAP  schools.   Last week, Mr Shanmugam  spoke  on  this

matter.    After  his  speech, the Prime Minister  spoke  to  Dr

Vasoo,  Mr Shanmugam and myself on the issue.  We gave  him  our

feedback.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>

DPM  Lee  informed the House that we had moved from the colonial

days  when  schools were based on language.   That  is  why  the

Government has the Sang Nila Utama Secondary School and the Amar

Pulavar  Tamil Secondary School and there were numerous  Chinese

primary schools and secondary schools.  Things have changed  for

the  better. We have now moved to SAP schools.  There have  been

some  reservations.   I  hope  the Minister  would  address  the

reservations that Mr Shanmugam has raised in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed this matter with several friends, inside

the  House as well as outside the House.  The views seem  to  be

divided.  Many feel that the minority communities are not  being

sensitive   to  the  majority  community.   They   say   Nanyang

University  has  been  closed, so  have  many  Chinese  schools.

Unless  there is a national effort to keep the Chinese  language

and culture alive, it would disappear from the scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nowhere is this more visible than if you look at the

dress  of  my Chinese friends.  The Indian and Malay communities

still preserve this national dress for both the ladies and  men.

The  Chinese  members  of  Singapore have  totally  adopted  the

western  dress.   Whether it is good or bad, I  am  not  passing

judgement.   But  just one classic case.  Over  the  years,  the

cultural values have changed.  All I would urge is that whatever

education  system  we choose, it must suit our  national  multi-racial and multi-cultural needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my advice to those members of the minority

communities  who  want SAP schools for Malays  and  Indians.   I

would  urge  them  not  to do so.  To do  so  would  be  counter

productive.  You are going to allow these people to be  isolated

in  small cocoons and they will never have much to do with other

communities.   It  is not very sound to have  this  proposition.

The  lead  must  come from all the communities and  through  the

meritocratic  process, it will throw up some of  the  best  from

this stream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to another aspect. I would call it

"Privatisation of Schools".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>

The  Government's move with independent schools is a  good  one.

Can  we  move one step further?  Would the Minister consider  in

the  long  term that schools be run by Town Councils?   Get  the

community  involved in the running of schools.   Many  countries

have  done this.  I know some Members are laughing.  They  think

it  is  an  idea  that  is not worthwhile.  But  if  independent

schools  can  work, why cannot schools be run by the  community?

In many countries, the community is involved in education.  Some

of  the best schools are run by the community.  The Minister may

want  to consider this in the long term process.  If he  is  not

prepared  to do that, is he prepared to allow the administration

of the school to be passed to the community?  I leave it to him.

The choice is his.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point which I would like to raise is this. Would

the Government give encouragement to private schools so that  we

could  become a hub for education not only at the tertiary level

but  even  at  the  secondary level?  We can become  a  hub  for

education in this part of the world.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I understand the

reasons behind the setting up of SAP schools, and I support  it.

Having  said  that,  I am also concerned about  the  SAP  school

students  having little opportunity of interaction with students

from  the other races, ie, the Malays and the Indians.  It is  a

concern of our minority races as well as it is a well known fact

that  a  sizable  number of able Chinese  students  attend  such

schools and some are going to be leaders of this country.   That

is  why as far back as 1990, the former Member of Parliament, Mr

Chandra  Das, brought this issue to the House.  I also  remember

in  1995,  the  Nominated Member of Parliament, Kanwaljit  Soin,

also  brought up this matter in this House.  Both expressed  the

worry  that  there is little mixing of SAP school students  with

others.   On both occasions, I offered a way out of this concern

by calling for the twinning of a SAP school with a national-type

school.   Obviously, no one paid attention to my  call.   Or  Mr

Shanmugam  would not have to come to this House again and  bring

up the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>

same matter.  Let me quote what I said in 1990, nine years ago:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The twinning of schools would allow the schools involved

to  develop programmes in the non-academic areas.  For a  start,

like  games, having a common rugby team with players  from  both

schools,  common  football team, netball team, and  also  common

cadet  or scout groups.  If such programmes work out well,  then

other  areas, including sharing academic teaching methods, could

be  explored.  These schools should be sited preferably close to

each other."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam gave a profound and thought-provoking

discourse on the concerns of the minority.  He goes beyond  just

the  SAP  schools.    He questioned the very  fundamentals  upon

which this society was built, ie, multi-racialism.  Amongst many

other  topics,  he  expressed  similar  fears  that  SAP  school

students may not be able to empathise with other races.  I quote

him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whatever we say, I think it undeniable that their empathy,

their  understanding of the minority communities would  be  less

than  that  of  their predecessors who grew up in  schools  with

members of the other races.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, on that very day, there was a call by the

Association  of  Muslim  Professionals  to  study  SAP  schools'

policies  on  racial  bonds.  This morning,  NMP  Zulkifli  also

expressed similar fears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister gave what I thought was a frank

and  honest response. To me, it was a good response.  I am  sure

Mr  Shanmugam understands but I am not so sure that  his  ground

does.   People want assurances, not by words, but  by  deeds  in

such  situations.  Therefore, we must translate  our  intentions

into  really working models at the ground level.  I believe this

can  be  done.  The reason why my original idea of twinning  was

not  taken  up seriously was probably due to a lack of awareness

of  the serious misgivings amongst the minority races.  However,

having listened to the Deputy Prime Minister's suggestion of the

cluster school concept, I am inclined to go along with it.   But

the cluster school concept must be clearly defined.  And it must

expand its administrative role to include activities of the kind

I  suggested in my twin school concept. DPM suggested  that  the

SAP schools should be part of the cluster of schools so that the

students from the SAP

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>

schools will have greater opportunities to interact with non-SAP

schools  within that cluster.  I  like that idea.  It should  be

explored further.   But it must be properly structured  with  an

appraisal system and an appraisal team monitoring it,  and  with

good  publicity given.  This way, I hope our minority races will

feel more comfortable about our SAP schools.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can never totally address this problem because of

the  way  that  SAP  schools were set up.  But  we  can  try  to

minimise  the  minorities'  concerns  with  the  cluster  school

concept.   However, it is not just at our SAP school level  that

we  want  to  see better interaction.  There is  more  to  this.

While  it  is  the moral duty of the majority race in  a  multi-racial society to look after the interest of the minority races,

our  minorities  must  also  make special  effort  to  come  and

participate  in  the many activities organised by  the  CCs  and

Residents'  Committees at the community  level.   I  lament  the

current  low rate of participation.  Great effort by every  race

should be made to make our multi-racial society work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister would take what I suggest seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, having heard Dr Tan

Cheng  Bock  and Mr Rai on their opinions on the SAP schools,  I

feel  that their worry is unnecessary.  They feel that  the  SAP

schools  have deprived  the Chinese students  of the opportunity

to mix with students from the other ethnic groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, interaction can take place in other forms, and

not just be confined to the schools.  Interaction among students

from   the  various  races  could  be  achieved  through   their

neighbourhood activities or in their places  of work. We have to

look at the matter from a more comprehensive point of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have SAP schools in Singapore, then can we

make sure that in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>

every  school  in  Singapore, there will be  a  fixed  ratio  of

students  from  the various ethnic groups?  I think  it  is  not

possible to achieve that, unless we can do like what the HDB  is

doing,  ie,  to  have this quota on the various races  in  every

block  of  flats, and have a similar quota in our schools.   For

example,  we  must  have a certain number of Malay  students  or

Indian students in each school.  Is it necessary?  There may not

be  enough  Indian or Malay students from certain neighbourhoods

to fill the quotas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the system of streaming has been implemented in

Singapore  for many years.  Although the Ministry  of  Education

can  present data to prove that  streaming has helped to  reduce

the  number  of  drop-outs  among our  students  and  they  also

emphasise that students from the various streams are given equal

treatment, we should nevertheless conduct a study on whether the

streaming system is beneficial or detrimental to the development

of  our human resources, which is very limited in Singapore, and

also  whether  every  student  can  bring  into  full  play  his

potential after 10 years of basic education.  I suggest that the

Ministry  of  Education  consider abolishing  streaming  in  our

primary schools and based on the school examination results  and

the  wishes of the parents, to decide who are suitable  to  take

Higher Chinese after Primary Four.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for streaming in secondary schools, I feel that the

Ministry of Education should review the Normal Stream course  in

our  secondary  schools.  Under the present examination  system,

Normal  Stream students will have to first of all pass  the  `N'

level  examination before they are allowed to take the `O' level

examination.   I  feel that this is an unnecessary  obstacle  to

them.  Since they are promoted to Secondary Five, they can  take

the `O' level examinations, but then the four years of secondary

education  is  not  much  of a help  in  taking  the  `O'  level

examinations, because there is a large gap between the `O' level

and  the  `N' level education.  So these students actually  have

great  difficulty adapting.  It would be difficult for  them  to

take the `O' level examinations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Ministry of Education could consider abolishing

the  `N'  level examinations and let all the `N' stream students

take  five  years of secondary education and then take  the  `O'

level  examinations, irrespective of how they fare  in  the  `O'

level examinations.  I hope that, after 10 years of education in

school,   they  can  at  least  learn  some  basic  ability   of

comprehension  and acquire some skills in meeting  some  of  the

challenges  facing them with our move towards a  knowledge-based

economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Peh Chin Hua is not here. Mr

Sinnakaruppan.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the

Education   Ministry  unveiled  a  very  impressive  Information

Technology  master plan for our schools some two years  ago.   I

would  like to congratulate the Ministry for its bold vision  to

adapt  our  schools, our principals and our teachers to  prepare

our children to face the rapidly changing world of IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to find out from the Minister what

progress has been made  with respect to this overall master plan

to-date, and whether the Minister is satisfied with the pace  so

far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has also stated that it plans to equip the

schools  with a student-computer ratio of 2:1 by the year  2002.

Sir,  I  would like to know what ratio has been achieved to-date

and  whether  we are targeted to meet this target  by  the  year

2002.   In  this  regard, I would also  like  to  find  out  the

Ministry's approach in the implementation of IT in our  schools.

While  it  is  important  and  necessary  for  the  Ministry  to

determine  how many computers each school gets and  the  various

hardware  that  is  necessary to make it Internet-ready,  it  is

important that the schools are given sufficient flexibility  and

a free hand to implement various IT programmes within the school

given  the hardware.  It is not appropriate for the Ministry  to

determine  exactly what the schools should do in IT, because  IT

is an area that requires a lot of creativity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback that I have received from some principals

and teachers, they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>

feel  that  the  process  of IT implementation  in  schools  has

somewhat   been  very  bureaucratic  and  that  some  of   their

enthusiasm  has  been stifled because of this  approach  to  the

implementation of IT in schools.  I hope that the  Minister  can

look into this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to know whether all our teachers in

the  schools  have  been trained in the pedagogical  aspects  of

using  IT  in  the  classroom, and whether the  older  teachers,

especially  those in their 50s, are able to cope  with  such  IT

training.   Also, after receiving training, are there sufficient

computers  in the schools, particularly in the staff rooms,  for

the  teachers to continuously hands-on with computers either  in

preparation  for their classes or just to keep them  updated  on

the developments on IT?  I would like to know how many computers

are  allocated  to staff rooms, whether there  is  a  particular

teacher-computer  ratio  as  we have  for  the  student-computer

ratio.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask whether the Ministry has

introduced   computer-based  home  or  project  assignments   in

schools.  I hear from some parents that this has been done,  and

that  some of these parents, especially parents who do not  have

computers  at  home,  are fairly concerned that  their  children

would  lose  out  to  those who come from  homes  equipped  with

computers  and therefore they feel that their children  will  be

affected by such assessment as they count towards the end of the

year  examinations.   So I would like to know  whether  this  is

being  done and, also, whether in the medium term, the  Ministry

plans  to  level  this playing field whereby  they  will  assist

students  coming from lower income families with  some  sort  of

financial  schemes  to  also purchase  computers,  so  that  all

children will have access to computers.  So I would like to know

whether  the  Ministry  has any plans to introduce  any  finance

scheme to enable this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, information

technology  appears  to be the buzzword now.   The  Ministry  of

Education has taken great effort to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>

promote  IT in schools.  I support and believe that the Ministry

is  moving  in  the  right direction.   The  Ministry  has  also

invested significantly in the provision of IT infrastructure  in

the  schools  and  has also sent teachers  for  training  in  IT

courses.   On  the surface, the IT plan appears to be  flawless,

but,  in  reality,  we have to ask ourselves whether  there  are

weaknesses in our attempt to promote IT in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the key to success is to develop an IT

culture in the schools and also to have IT-trained teachers  who

are   able  to  nurture  our  students.   Nowadays,  it  is  not

surprising  that  even  primary  school  students  have  to   do

presentations, and many of these presentations require  the  use

of  information technology, including the knowledge of  computer

software.  It appears to be the in-thing that the teachers  will

not  just ask the school children to do their projects but  also

to  present  their  projects in perhaps  PowerPoint,  MS  Office

software, or some other software.  This puts tremendous pressure

on our school children.  If the school children who have parents

who  are  familiar and conversant with the Internet and computer

software,  the parents may teach them the use of these softwares

for their presentation.  This, of course, will be ideal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to ask ourselves: how many of our school

children  have parents who use the computers and are  conversant

with computer software?  If these children do not have computers

or  do  not  present  their projects in  the  proposed  software

format,  they  will feel very, very stressed and will  be  under

tremendous  pressure, because many of these  projects  do  count

towards their final assessment of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to teach the students how to crawl before

they  can  walk,  and how to walk before they can  run.   As  we

expose our students to computers at a young age, there must be a

systematic  way  to  teach  them.   We  must  not  stifle  their

enthusiasm or give them so much

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>

pressure  that  they want to stay away from computers.   If  the

teachers  expect  the  students to use a  certain  software  for

presentation, they must teach the students how to use it or even

make sure that there is access to computers for the children  to

use  it, especially since many parents are not familiar with the

software.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, teaching IT is not just the teaching of

application of software or the use of Internet.  I think another

very important area in the teaching of IT is also the proper use

of  IT.  Let me give you an example.  A parent complained to  me

that  he  noticed that the grades of his daughter were  dropping

and  getting worse.  So the first thing he did was to remove the

telephone.   But  that  did not solve the  problem  because  the

daughter was still plugged on the line via the Internet and  was

spending  several hours on the computer.  So the next  thing  he

did was to remove the computer and the grades got better.  So my

point  is that, yes, we do want to encourage the use of  IT  and

computers, but again if these tools are not used properly,  they

may  not  sometimes  help our children but  actually  make  them

worse, because they use them for not very useful purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is likely that our younger teachers will

probably  be more familiar with computers.  However,  I  believe

that  many of our older teachers do face difficulties  and  they

find  it  very  difficult to cope with the  changes  in  IT  and

computer  software.   The Ministry must  do  more  to  help  the

teachers help the children.  Therefore, I would like to urge the

Minister  to optimise the use of hardware available by  ensuring

that  our teachers are confident, conversant and comfortable  in

the  use of IT, and be in the position to lead our students into

the IT era.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, as we look ahead to

achieve our vision of having a world class workforce in the 21st

century,  we  have  to start by addressing our education  system

because  this  is  where  attitudes, aptitudes  and  skills  are

developed that will last for a life time.  If we do a  good  job

in establishing the right fundamentals, we will be successful

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>

in achieving the goal of developing the knowledge workers of the

future.  The `Thinking School, Learning Nation' is therefore  an

appropriate  programme if we are serious  about  achieving  this

goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we need to make some structural changes to our

education  system if we are serious about moulding our  children

to  be  the knowledge workers of the future.  Our current system

creates some obstacles in promoting creativity, to encourage our

children to do things differently, to experiment and to question

conventional  wisdom.  Sir, these are the same  qualities  which

will help us groom more technopreneurs and entrepreneurs in  the

future.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that we need to make a number of changes.

Firstly,  the streaming of our children as early as  in  Primary

Four  and  at  the  various levels after that, based  on  purely

academic  performance, recognises and rewards only one  category

of students, those who can score well in examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree with the original concept of streaming which

allows  students to develop at their own pace, however,  I  feel

that  we  have  not been successful in achieving  the  objective

because I believe schools actually channel the best resources to

the upper streams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stigma for our students who are streamed to the

lower  streams because of the way our system treats them.   This

includes  the teachers, parents and their peers.  I have  spoken

to  a  number of parents whose children are in the upper streams

or  in gifted programmes and these parents themselves fear  that

their  children's attitude towards children of lower streams  is

unhealthy.  I really fear that we are developing a class  system

by  placing labels on our children starting at a very early age.

I  also  recall a case of a child who was streamed to EM3.   His

parents came to see me during my meet-the-people session to help

transfer  their son to an EM2 stream.  Right in front  of  their

son, they told me that if their son

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>

remains  in the EM3 stream, his life would be destroyed forever.

I  fear  that  such attitudes will create a serious  self-esteem

problem, a sense of hopelessness and of not willing to try again

for such children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can we modify our school system to use non-academic

measures  for  streaming and for promotion?  I suggest  a  large

proportion of the decision criteria be based on project work and

EQ measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Even if we continue with the streaming system, can we

ensure  that all students mix well with each other to avoid  the

drawing  of  lines?  I suggest that students  from  the  various

streams  spend at least 30% to 40% of their school time  in  the

same  class.   In  this way, they can learn to  appreciate  each

other's  abilities and limitations and perhaps help  the  weaker

students to do better because of a more conducive environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can we recognise and reward those who may not score

well  in  examinations,  but have the  other  abilities  that  I

mentioned earlier in my speech?  I would like to suggest that we

introduce project work as a gradable subject where students  can

use  their  non-academic skills to do a few projects  throughout

the  year.   The grades obtained for such projects can  then  be

used  to measure the performance of the student.  I believe this

is practised in schools in the USA and Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I feel the society's attitude needs to change,

our  education system too needs to transform so that we  do  not

penalise  people who are not academically smart, but have  other

unique qualities.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, there is no

doubt  that  we  are all in agreement as to the  need  for  more

project  work, the need to raise creativity among  our  students

and  also to improve IT competence.  My comments are in relation

to what this means for our young children today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three issues to raise. These are conditioned by an

experience I had with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>

my  son who was, at that time, in school and given a project  to

do.   It had to do with the history of the Second World War  and

he  was  trying to find out what were the causes of  the  Second

World War.  His idea of doing this project was very simple.   He

asked  me  how  many  databases I have, and  I  said  there  are

Microsoft  Encarta, Encyclopedia Britannica and  another  called

Grolier  Encyclopedia.   All these are available  in  electronic

form.   He  then put all of them in the computer, extracted  the

various  parts,  did  a search for World War  II,  got  all  the

articles out and he dutifully cut and pasted parts of it into  a

very nicely coloured paper which he then called his project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was forced to ask him, "Where is this creative

element that you are supposed to have in doing a project of this

sort?"   He  said it is creative `cut and paste'.   He  did  not

believe in putting the whole thing in and he had to select.   So

the second question I asked him was, "Do you know that there  is

a  very  fundamental value in research and, that  is,  you  must

never plagiarise?"  He said that was a new word to him and  what

did  that mean.  The simple answer, of course, is that  you  can

read  as  much as you want and you can use as many resources  as

you  have.  But part of the creative nature of study is to  make

sure   that  the  materials  you  get  from  all  these  various

databases, you can summarise, you can put it in your  own  words

and  you  can  give  your  own view.  This  is  something  which

apparently is quite new to many of our students.  They are  very

comfortable  with  using  electronic databases  by  cutting  and

pasting from it, and they see no moral issue on that point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is this. It is clearly laudable to have more

project works, raise creativity and improve IT competence.   But

I  think  it  is also necessary to ensure that our teachers  are

able  to  teach  in  a  way that would inculcate  good  research

practices,  and we can never start too young as far as  this  is

concerned,  among  our  students.   With  the  availablility  of

electronic databases, and so on, it is so easy to do research by

doing a search as it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>

were  and that should not be the creative part, that should  not

be  the end-all of creativity.  So I believe that there is a lot

to  be done in terms of not just student training but also staff

training  to  monitor our students and inculcate  in  them  good

research  values.  Also, in terms of project works, I  think  it

requires  a lot of staff supervision.  Does that mean  that  all

schools  would have to increase their staff, not  just  to  make

them  more IT competent but also to increase the number of staff

that  are  available to supervise such work?   Thirdly,  project

work  takes  time.   How is that to be traded  off  against  the

traditional  studies that they have to do  at  this  time?   And

finally,  a  point that has to do with the new  proposals  about

taking  project work into account in admissions.  The evaluation

of  project  work  is always an issue that has  to  be  tackled.

There are three problems here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, how do we ensure that the project work done is that

of  the  students,  especially we have  huge  schools  and  huge

numbers  to contend with?  Secondly, how do we ensure a  certain

sense  of commensurability among the scores between schools  and

classes  in  the nation?  Unless and until we have solved  these

problems,  it would be very good to take time and look  at  this

issue,  find  how  this can be solved before  we  implement  any

scheme  whereby  project work would be  taken  into  account  in

admission to our higher tertiary institutions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, let me declare

my  interest.  I teach at the NUS and I am also a  parent.   The

second  factor,  parenthood,  clearly  makes  me  an  expert  on

education,  like so many of us.  And I am sure it  is  a  factor

that makes the work of the Ministry more interesting, not to say

difficult, having so many "experts" to answer to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seriously, Sir, I move my cut on non-classroom and

project  learning  in the context of concern  to  many  parents.

This arises because of two recent events.  First, the tragic and

accidental  drowning of two students while on a school-organised

outing  to  Pulau  Ubin.  Second, the injuries  and  indignation

suffered by students at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>

Jin Tai when a live re-creation of national education in history

went  awry.  I do not wish to discuss the particulars  of  these

cases.   I  am  sure the Ministry and the school concerned  will

carry out a full investigation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish instead to point to a more general concern. Both

incidents are instances of non-classroom based learning, of  new

efforts to let our students learn beyond traditional reading and

writing.  Experience instead is the tool to educate these  young

minds.  This, I believe, is a newer emphasis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these recent and unfortunate incidents, there may be

some,  both  in  the public and in the schools  themselves,  who

might  question if these forms of non-classroom learning  should

continue.   Are they worth the risk, some may ask?   The  safest

and  easiest  answer  will be to go back to the  classroom,  the

books, reading and writing, and to stop these newer forms of non-classroom teaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I would urge the Ministry and the schools and

parents not to take this option.  Non-classroom learning  has  a

continued place among the tools of the educator.  A policy  that

turns  away  from  the  newer forms of  learning  would  not  be

desirable  to my mind.  Yes, safeguards are necessary and  risks

should be minimised.  But some risk is inevitable and indeed,  I

would  argue, must therefore be acceptable.  There is wisdom  in

the  old saying, "Nothing ventured, nothing gained; no risk,  no

gain."   I  would  therefore  urge  the  Ministry  to  steer   a

consistent  and continued path in this regard and continue  with

non-classroom  learning,  despite  these  incidents   or   other

controversies that may arise in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On project learning, I too welcome the move. More, I hope

the Ministry will encourage such forms of learning to be done by

teams   of  students  and  for  areas  that  are  beyond   their

curriculum.    Sir,  in  the  real  world,  we  are   constantly

challenged in areas and subjects that we are not experts  in  or

have not previously studied or prepared for.  When we face these

challenges, we are most often in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>

teams  in  the  workplace.  In this way,  project  learning  and

teamwork  would help prepare our students, our youths,  for  the

real  world that they will emerge into.  It would encourage them

to  teach themselves both as individuals and within the team  in

areas  that are relevant but that cannot be covered in a limited

syllabus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of such an area for team and project learning

is  about the region and the countries around us.  Sir, while we

have  a  National Education, I think that regional education  is

also  a worthwhile arena for our students to learn.  This crisis

has  taught us how interconnected we are as economies and indeed

societies.   This  lesson needs to be learnt, not  just  by  the

Government or adults in our society, but also by our youths  and

students.   There is a power in first-hand knowledge that  might

be  gained  from  students' visits, non-classroom  learning  and

their   own   research  and  exchanges  with  our   neighbouring

countries.  Regional education may not be another subject in our

syllabus.   But  it can be a suitable subject for  non-classroom

and project learning.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on

a  lighter subject about mandating life skill programmes in  all

upper  primary and secondary schools, including junior colleges.

I would like to say this, however, as one of the desired

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>

outcomes  of  education.   I observe that some schools  offer  a

limited  curriculum  on  home economics.   Most  of  our  girls'

schools  conduct home economics classes whereas  the  top  boys'

schools like Chinese High and Raffles Institution do not in  the

entire  secondary  years.   ACS and Catholic  High  School,  for

example, on the other hand, have home economics at secondary one

and  two levels.  The girls' schools, on the other hand, do  not

teach  them  how to change light bulbs, use an electric  saw,  a

screwdriver or other simple technical skills.  Some neigbourhood

schools have such classes; others do not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking in my interest as a parent. Evidently, the

tasks of teaching our children to cook, sew, change light bulbs,

fix  and  repair household problems can be taught at home.   But

this  can be more effectively achieved if these skills could  be

woven  into the school curriculum to make their activities  seem

less  of  a chore and more of a fun moment to break the monotony

of  studying  in school.  This emphasis will be welcome  to  all

working  parents who can be assured that as a result  of  school

training,  their teenagers could cook themselves a  decent  meal

and attend to house-care needs when they are not around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also propose that some hours be devoted to teaching

students  social  etiquette, personal grooming and  presentation

skills.  I feel that they form part of the growing up repertoire

of  skills  for the young which, if learnt, give them a  greater

sense of self-confidence in conducting themselves in public  and

making  their ideas heard.  Some top schools have these classes;

others  do  not.   A cluster of top boys and girls  learn  these

through debate sessions.  The success is not broad based enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I propose that the Ministry revisit this issue of

teaching  our youth how to acquire life skills with  respect  to

home economics, home maintenance as well as presentation skills?

I hope a higher degree of standardisation could be encouraged at

all  secondary  school levels for girls and boys  to  learn  all

these skills.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I strongly believe that homework is

an  integral  part  of our school curriculum and  that  homework

helps  in  reinforcing  the people's understanding  of  concepts

taught  in  the classroom.  I have two points to raise regarding

homework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the amount of homework. The amount of homework

given to our pupils varies from teacher to teacher and class  to

class, and there is apparently no coordination as to how much is

given  on  a daily basis to a particular class of pupils.   This

results in a very unbalanced homework load and the pupil has  to

spend far too much time doing homework for a particular subject,

and as a result, does not have sufficient time to concentrate on

other subjects which may be just as important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether there is any Ministry

guidelines  as  to how much homework is assigned to  pupils  and

whether   it  is  possible  for  principals  and  the  head   of

departments  and  form teachers to coordinate with  the  subject

teachers  the amount of homework that is given on a daily  basis

so that the homework load can be balanced throughout the week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I would like to make is that because

of the heavy homework load and the high level of difficulties of

some  of this homework given, many parents actually end up doing

the   homework  for  their  children.   Indeed,  this  is   very

prevalent,  and I heard many feedback on this. I would  like  to

relate  just  one  anecdote in this regard.  A  friend  told  me

recently  that his son, who is studying in Primary 5, came  back

from school one day, feeling very dejected.  My friend asked his

son  what was the problem and his son told him that his  teacher

was not impressed at all with the homework that he had submitted

and the teacher actually praised the boy who was sitting next to

him for the excellent submission.  My friend's son asked the boy

sitting  next  to  him  how did he do so well.   The  boy  said,

"That's  easy.  I  just  ask my father to  do  it  all  for  me.

Sometimes when he is busy, I would ask my tuition teacher to  do

it for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>

me."  That was the response.  My friend's son came back home and

asked his father, "How come you did not do the homework for  me?

Next time I want you to do the homework for me so that I can  do

well."   The  point  in this anecdote is that the  children  are

forming  wrong  values  and  the original  intention  of  having

homework  is  lost  and because of the difficulty,  as  what  Dr

Michael Lim had earlier pointed out, children are being asked to

do  even  computer assignments at home, they find that they  are

unable  to cope and as a result, more and more parents  have  to

actually get involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point here is that all these defeat the very objectives

of  the  homework assignments. While on the one hand,  obviously

there is a need for the Ministry to educate the parents on their

role  in helping children with their homework, more importantly,

the  Ministry  must take a holistic view to review  the  various

issues  relating  to homework.  I hope the Minister  would  look

into this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, with the rapid rate of change, Singapore

has  become  a  nation  of  superlatives  in  many  areas.   The

aspirations  and expectations of Singaporeans have  also  become

different and in keeping with the changing times.  Life here has

certainly been good and we understand what "comfortable"  means.

In  the light of this, schools in Singapore also need changes to

meet  the  new  trends  and to provide  enhanced  and  conducive

environment for our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to beseech the Ministry of Education to

provide  air-conditioning in all our schools.  We  now  consider

air-conditioning  a necessity, not a luxury,  in  this  tropical

climate.    Both   students,  as  well  as  the  teachers,   can

concentrate  better and perform better in cool  classrooms.   In

time, more students will spend longer hours in the school.  Air-conditioning  will certainly help the students get  through  the

hottest part of each day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost will always be of primary concern. However, if it is

value-added and allows for better performance in our young,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>

air-conditioning  school classrooms would have been  worthwhile.

It  would have been a good investment indeed.  Someone has  even

calculated  that it would cost just about one dollar  per  month

per child in order to have air-conditioned classrooms.  This  is

not  much and some schools have already started air-conditioning

classrooms for privileged groups of students.  This causes  envy

and  jealousy  in those deprived groups.  This is not  ideal  as

uniformity  and  fairness to all should  be  our  policy.   Many

schools have air-conditioned computer rooms and libraries.   The

reasons  given  for  air conditioning them would  apply  to  the

classrooms equally well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we strive for excellence in our education system,

let  us  not  forget that investing in basics and  down-to-earth

items,  besides information technology may also help  us  attain

our  goal.  I would urge the Ministry of Education to look  into

this.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the sea of learning is

boundless.  But the ultimate objective of learning is to be able

to cross the sea to get to the opposite bank.   The question is:

what is the purpose of getting to the other side or the opposite

bank?  Are you learning just because you want to make good money

or  to  absorb  more  knowledge  to  enrich  yourself?   If  the

students' objective is just for personal benefit, it is a  self-centred  mentality.  As a matter of fact, hidden at the opposite

bank  are the precious traditional values.  If our students  can

be  bothered  to go and dig out this treasure, it  will  benefit

them for life.  It is a well that never runs dry.   The question

is: how do we help our younger generation comprehend this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the classic book of Great Learning, there is a great

enlightenment to us.  It says,  "First, cultivate  the  persons;

next,  regulate the families; then rule the state.   There  will

be  peace  and harmony for the whole world."  I am sure  we  are

very familiar with this passage and I shall not elaborate on it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to discuss with you another passage from

this  book.   It  says "Wishing to cultivate the person,  first,

rectify  the  heart.  Wishing to rectify the  heart,  first,  be

sincere  in the thought.  Wishing to be sincere in the  thought,

first,  extend  knowledge  to the  utmost."   This  passage  has

inspired me to realise that if a person's heart is not rectified

and  does  not treat others with sincerity, then no  matter  how

profound  his knowledge may be, no matter how high his  academic

achievements may be, he will  not necessarily be a  blessing  to

society, to the nation and to mankind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when we teach our students, it is not just the

passing down of knowledge to enrich the mind.  More importantly,

we  should  inculcate in them the correct values, to  bring  out

their civic-mindedness, to strengthen their moral perception  so

that  they may extend their knowledge to the utmost and seek  to

be sincere in their thoughts, rectify their hearts and cultivate

their person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the new policy on Chinese language announced

recently by the Ministry of Education.  However, in implementing

this  new policy, the Ministry of Education and all the teachers

of  the  Chinese  language need to be  aware  that  there  is  a

difference  between the students learning the  Chinese  language

and their absorption of good traditional culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language is a bridge. It is the medium through which we

absorb  good traditions.  In other words, learning the  language

to be proficient in Chinese is not the ultimate objective of our

learning the language.  For students taking Higher Chinese,  the

language  bridge is broader.  For those who do ordinary Chinese,

the  bridge may be narrower.  As for those who are taking  CL'B'

in  the  future,  they are actually walking  on  a  single-plank

bridge.   However,  they all head for the same  destination.   I

hope  that when the Ministry of Education implements the  mother

tongue policy, the inculcation of traditional values should  not

be  diluted.  Students from the various courses must be  allowed

to go

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>

deep into the connotations and quintessence of their traditional

cultures,   and  to  live  through  life  with  the  spirit   of

selflessness, irrespective of the languages and the races.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, thank

you  for  allowing me to respond at this point in time.  Members

have  raised  quite a number of different issues.  Allow  me  to

deal with some of them before we proceed any further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we draw all these different strands together? Last

year,   if  Members  will  recall,  the  Ministry  of  Education

published   this  document  called  The  Desired   Outcomes   of

Education.  Some Members, last year, had seen it for  the  first

time.   So  I will request the Clerk to distribute this document

once  again so that Members can see it again and be reminded  of

it.   [Copies  of  document distributed to hon. Members.]   This

document  spells out the end-objectives of formal  education  as

well as the intermediate objectives of primary, secondary and JC

education.   There  was  widespread  support  for  the   Desired

Outcomes  of  Education from Members of this House, the  public,

parents,  principals, teachers and students.  The concern  then,

as it is now, was on how we are going to achieve these outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, the Ministry of Education has

initiated  several  programmes that  will  bring  us  closer  to

achieving   these  Desired  Outcomes   -   the  IT   Masterplan,

National Education, the Community Involvement Programme, COMPASS

and  the  reduction in curriculum content by up to 30% that  was

announced  last year which will help us shift the focus  of  our

education  system  from  merely  acquiring  ever  more   content

knowledge to creativity and thinking skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programmes are all desirable in themselves but, more

importantly,  they all form part of a whole.  The end  objective

is  re-aligning our education system more closely  to  achieving

the Desired Outcomes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to draw Members' attention to another

aspect of the changes that we are making to the education system

-    the re-alignment of the way we assess students and appraise

schools.   We can introduce new programmes.  We have heard  many

exhortations  today for teachers and students  to  work  towards

achieving  the  Desired  Outcomes.  But unless  we  change  what

counts, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to  change

the  orientation  and  the focus of our education  system.   Our

assessment systems for schools and for students must be  brought

more  closely  into  alignment  with  the  Desired  Outcomes  of

Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we assess students affects their motivations and

what  they  and  perhaps, more importantly, their  parents  will

emphasise  and  devote  their time and  effort  to.   Similarly,

schools have a tendency to focus their efforts primarily on what

is being measured.  The Ministry of Education has never assessed

schools  purely  on the basis of their academic results  in  the

national  examinations, but there is overwhelming interest  from

schools themselves, parents, teachers, the press and the general

public  on  the  academic performance of schools  and  students,

because, in their eyes, that is practically the only thing  that

counts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change behaviour, we have to change what counts - both

for  students, and for schools.  Hence, over the last  year,  we

have  reviewed the university admission system, and we have also

looked again at the way that we appraise our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me begin with the university admissions. We

want our potential graduates not just to excel academically, but

also to demonstrate character, creativity and commitment to  the

nation.   It is both timely and necessary to move the university

admission system away from a sole reliance on 'A' levels towards

a  more  holistic evaluation of a person's potential to  benefit

from  university  education.  This change is  not  merely  about

selecting  students to go to the university.  This  change  will

send a clear signal throughout the whole education system  -   I

dare say

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>

from  kindergarten  all the way through to 'O'  levels  and  'A'

levels  -  regarding the qualities we desire in our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on University Admissions chaired by Prof Shih

released its draft report in January this year.  We will have an

opportunity to debate the recommendations later on.  I know some

Members are still waiting to speak on it and we can discuss this

later.   But  my  point  here is that the change  in  university

admission system should not be seen in isolation.  It should  be

seen in the context of realigning the whole education system  to

achieving the Desired Outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel, we are broadening the scope of the way schools

are  appraised.  We will move beyond academic grades  to  school

achievements  in  other  areas that contribute  to  the  Desired

Outcomes.   When  the  Desired  Outcomes  were  published,  many

wondered how we were going to achieve the outcomes, how  we  are

going  to  measure them, since many of them are  intangible  and

unquantifiable.  How can schools ascertain if they have achieved

the  Desired  Outcomes?  How would schools know  what  they  are

capable  of, and whether they have done their best?   Without  a

system  of  measurement, principals and teachers  will  be  left

wondering  just how much they have achieved, and  will  have  no

means  of  deciding  how far they have to  go,  what  are  their

weaknesses,  and where they have to improve.  May I request  the

Clerk  to distribute the other two pieces of paper that  I  have

with me.  [Copies of paper distributed to hon. Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education and the educational professionals

have  been  thinking this issue through in the past year.  After

several  rounds of discussions and consultations  together  with

principals and other professionals, we have decided to  adopt  a

quality  assurance approach to school appraisal  based  on  self

appraisal.    The  new  approach  looks  at  both  results   and

processes.   The ultimate goal is not merely good  results,  but

sustainability of good results.  Sound processes are  what  will

assure  sustainability of results.  And the  notion  of  results

themselves has also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>

been broadened to include not just academic results, but results

in other activities that contribute to the Desired Outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-appraisal is itself a powerful process that will drive

improvement  in  our schools.  Self-appraisal  emphasises  self-evaluation  and  self-knowledge.  When  using  this  model,  the

principal  and  his staff will ask themselves  some  fundamental

questions  about  what is going on in the school  and  what  the

outcomes are.  This self questioning will prompt them to reflect

on  the  schools' efforts in addressing their concerns and  work

towards improvement.  The appraisal process will require schools

to  continually question current practices and move them  to  be

the best they can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This framework of self-assessment is known as the School

Excellence Model.  In the diagram that Members have in front  of

them, there are nine criteria there in the model, and they  fall

broadly into two categories: Enablers and Results, each  with  a

weightage  of 50%.  We can adjust this later on with experience.

Enablers are concerned with processes  -  how the school is  led

and  managed, how resources are deployed; while Results look  at

outcomes   -   key  performance results,  staff  competence  and

morale, impact of programmes on students and  on others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthwhile to note that under key performance

results,  we  are  still looking for academic  achievement,  ECA

achievement  as well and physical fitness levels.  But  academic

achievement  is only one of the many criteria in  the  appraisal

model,  just  as cognitive outcomes are only one aspect  of  the

holistic  outcomes desired of education.  In fact, most  of  the

Desired  Outcomes will have to be achieved through  non-academic

school programmes, and this is reflected in the appraisal model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linked to the School Excellence Model is an award system

for  schools.  There are three levels in this pyramid system  of

awards. The base of the awards is a broad

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>

one, and comprises different Achievement Awards given to schools

for  achievements  in various fields in the current  year.   The

next  higher level consists of the Sustained Achievement  Awards

and Best Practices Awards which reflect the school's ability  to

sustain good processes and outcomes over a number of years.   At

the  apex  will be the School Excellence Award, which recognises

schools  for  overall  excellence  in  education  processes  and

outcomes, sustained over many years.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limit to the number of schools that can qualify

for  these awards. This would give the schools, the students and

the  parents an indication of where they stand and how they  can

improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Value-Added Awards that are presently given to schools,

a  point  raised  by  Mr  Hawazi, have been  most  effective  in

achieving  improvement in the performance of students  and  this

will  continue.   It will be one of the Achievement  Awards  and

Sustained  Achievement Awards.  School ranking, as  it  is  done

now,  will also remain, as it is a useful indicator for schools.

However, ranking by academic results will henceforth have to  be

seen in the context of a number of other indicators, and not  as

the  be-all  and end-all.  This is certainly the  way  that  the

Ministry  of  Education will look at it, and we  hope  that  the

public and parents will also look at it that way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School Excellence Model will be field tested in mid

1999.  All schools will be using the model for self-appraisal in

the  year 2000.  The Ministry of Education will conduct external

appraisal of schools based on this approach from 2001.   Schools

will, on average, be validated once every five  years or so, but

they  can ask to be validated more often than this if they  feel

they are ready to progress on to the next level of the pyramid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Desired Outcomes define our goals in education. We aim

to  achieve these outcomes through various initiatives.  I  have

listed  them  before  - IT Masterplan, National  Education,  the

Curriculum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>

Review,  a  review  of  the university admission  system  and  a

quality assurance approach to school appraisal.  That is what we

do  and  how we measure it.  All these aim to develop our  young

for  life,  not  just for their schooling days; and  to  develop

their potential to the full, not just in academic areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires our education system to shift from an

efficiency-driven to an ability-driven paradigm.  Ability-driven

education  has two thrusts - maximal development of the  talents

and  abilities  of  our  young, and maximal  harnessing  of  the

talents  and abilities of all Singaporeans for the good  of  the

nation and the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our present system, education is driven by the needs of

the economy.  We project manpower demands in various sectors  of

the  economy and train people to fit into jobs in those sectors.

Our  economic agencies attract the investments that create jobs;

our  educational institutions train Singaporeans to  fill  these

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the paradigm for a knowledge economy will be

different.   There are no pre-determined sets of jobs,  waiting,

like  holes to be filled by students coming out of our education

system.  Instead, it is the collective talents and abilities  of

all  Singaporeans that will define the economy and what jobs and

opportunities are available.  Students leaving our school system

will increasingly have to create their own opportunities.  Life-long   learning   becomes  a  necessary  part  of   opening   up

opportunities  for the future. We are working hand-in-hand  with

the  Ministry  of  Manpower in this  sector.    Hence  education

itself  becomes a competitive advantage in the economy.  And  to

maximise  that advantage we must consciously draw out individual

talents and develop  them to the full.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, the Ministry of Education will be shifting

towards  an approach of mass customisation.  I know this  sounds

like  a contradiction, but let me bring you an example from  the

car industry, although cars and people are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>

not  comparable.  Nowadays, when you buy a car, you  choose  the

brand  and the model.  You can further decide the colour of  the

exterior,  the  veneer of the interior, whether you  want  power

windows,  air-conditioning, what kinds of seats and so  on,  and

all  within  that  same model.  The car is still  mass  produced

because  that  is  an  efficient way of  doing  it,  but  it  is

customised to what can best match the buyer's needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Education, the mass provision of educational resources

and  opportunities  should  not stop  us  from  looking  at  the

possibility of customising to individual student's aptitudes and

abilities  wherever possible.  I am not here proposing  that  we

give  each child individual attention by providing him dedicated

tutors  for  each  subject who will coach him  alone,  designing

syllabuses  just  for  him  and so  on.   This  is  clearly  not

practical.   This  is  individualised  customisation,  not  mass

customisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But within the limits of mass production of education

services,  we  should move some way towards  meeting  individual

needs.  If I may be allowed to use another analogy, it is like a

set-lunch  menu. We used to have only one set-lunch  menu  which

every  one, regardless of his appetite or taste, was obliged  to

eat.  Understandably,  some  found  the  food  unappetising  and

unpalatable and decided to leave the restaurant. With streaming,

which is also a rudimentary form of mass customisation, we  have

a  number  of set menus to cater to different needs.   Streaming

has  been  very successful in increasing the proportion  of  our

students  who  move  on  to higher levels  of  education.   That

enables  us  to meet the needs of different groups  of  students

better, and that is where we are today.  The next challenge  for

the  Ministry is to allow some variations in the courses in  the

set menus, and to gradually expand the variations allowed within

the  resources  that  we have available.  The  Chinese  Language

Review  is  a case in point.  It is a recognition that  students

are  different  and  have  different  linguistic  abilities  and

strengths in different areas, and the system should try to cater

to them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now studying how we can adapt the system to meet the

needs  of  students better, at a systems level,  at  the  school

level,  and  even  in  the classroom.   We  will  move  in  that

direction  over  the  coming year.  As with everything  else  in

education, it will take some years and many steps to get there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But an ability-driven system is also about maximal

harnessing  of the talents and abilities of our  young.   If  we

were  to  focus solely on developing our young without grounding

moral  and  social values nor sinking their cultural  roots,  we

will   be  producing  a  generation  of  Singaporeans  with   no

obligation  or commitment to serve the community, no concept  of

social  identity and no sense of belonging to  the  nation.   We

must  inculcate  in our young a strong social conscience  and  a

mindset  that sees Singapore as a home to live in, to strive  to

improve, and to defend if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Members who have expressed the view that

no  child should be seen as a failure, and every child should be

seen as a success.  But each child's success can be in different

areas.  Everyone has his strengths; and talents and abilities in

different  areas can be pooled together for the overall  success

of  the  nation.  We in the Ministry will continue to apply  our

minds  to  see  how  we can maximally develop  and  harness  the

talents and abilities of our students.  The Ministry will do its

best  with  the  resources allocated to us.   We  will  maximise

education outcomes given our resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate the many suggestions and comments from

Members.  Bringing about change in the education system  is  the

work  of  many years.  We will not see the fruits of our  labour

for  another five, perhaps ten years.  It requires a clear  idea

of  where we are going, and this is encapsulated in the  Desired

Outcomes  of  Education.  And it requires purposeful  change  to

align our programmes, processes, and assessment systems with the

Desired Outcomes, so that what we do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>

in education and in the education system is focused on achieving

these goals.  I continue to look forward to support from Members

of  this  House, parents and the public as we strive to  do  our

best for our young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to address some of the specific points that

have  been  raised by Members.  Mr Loh brought our attention  to

the cost of educating an individual student.  If Mr Loh were  to

look at page 218 of the Budget book, he will see that the latest

numbers  are there.  The earlier set of figures that  he  quoted

was from the FY98 Budget book which has since been revised.  The

main reason for the lower cost per student is the 10% cut in the

Government's share of CPF and the further salary  cut.   86%  of

the  schools' budget comprises manpower cost and that is why the

cost  has  come down.  For secondary schools, the cost has  gone

up, however, because the number of secondary school students has

come  down.   It is the Tiger Year effect for the secondary  one

students  this year.  But this lower spending in the  operations

budget has been more than offset by the increase in the spending

in  the  development  budget, which will  also  go  towards  the

students.  For example, all the spending on the IT Masterplan is

now counted out of the development budget.  That is a very large

number.   I think it is about $150 million.  This year  we  have

some 39 schools under construction compared to 19 last year  and

11  the  year before.  All these will eventually have  a  direct

benefit to the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on, Sir, to what time school should start.

Frankly, Sir, if the schools are operating single session as the

secondary schools will be from next year onwards, it  is  up  to

the schools to decide what time they want to start.  But from  a

practical  point of view, I think that most schools  will  still

want  to  start  relatively early in the day for  transport  and

other  reasons.  But it is a matter which the schools can decide

for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on to some specific issues on the IT

Masterplan.   We  are now into our third year of  implementation

and student

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>

access  to computers, levelling the playing field is really  the

main  motivation  why  we have undertaken  this  IT  Masterplan.

Because if we did not do this, then only students, children  who

come from better off homes will have computers at home, and they

would have no access to computers at home and if the schools  do

not  provide them access to computers, they would have no access

to computers.  One of the main motivations for going into the IT

Masterplan  in  a major way is to provide a level playing  field

and  access  to all students.  More than 130 schools  have  come

under the Masterplan so far, Phases 1 and 2, and we are now onto

Phase 3 where the remaining 230 schools will be coming on in the

next   two  years.   Phase  1  and  Phase  2  schools  are   now

electronically  networked school wide.   There  are  still  some

lumps, as to be expected, but we are working this through.   The

ratio  of computers to students is now about 1:5 in the  schools

that have completed the Masterplan.  We have enough resources to

move  to  1:2.  But we want to do so only when the  schools  are

ready.  I am confident that the schools know what to do with the

computers  at  the ratio of 1:5 but I am not so  confident  that

they are ready to deal with computers at the ratio of 1:2.  When

schools  are ready, we will move ahead with them and  will  have

some  flexibility as to what to do with the resources  that  are

available.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For teachers, we are providing the schools with a ratio of

one  computer to every two teachers, ie, notebooks.  And we also

have  a very generous computer loan scheme for teachers so  that

we  expect  that all our teachers should be very  well  equipped

with computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for training of teachers, 9,500 teachers have already

been  trained under the IT Masterplan, each receiving  something

like  30  to 50 hours of workshop training.  In the next  phase,

some  13,500 teachers will be trained over the next  two  years.

We  have  about  60  senior IT instructors  in  the  Educational

Technology  Division doing this training school  by  school.   A

common misunderstanding is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>

that  these teachers have been trained merely to use technology,

word  processing, or PowerPoint,  connecting wires, and  so  on.

In  fact, the IT Masterplan's main focus in training of teachers

is  to train them to use IT as a tool to empower sound pedagogy,

and  time-honoured  principles of teaching  children  to  think,

conceptualise  and  so  on, are emphasised,  and  re-emphasised,

during  these  IT  training programmes.  Apart  from  that,  all

schools also now have broadband access to Singapore One.   There

are probably one or two Singapore One access points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to move on now to home economics. Home

economics incidentally is a compulsory subject for both boys and

girls  at  the lower secondary level.  Independent  schools  are

independent, and I leave it to them to decide whether they  want

to do so or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to address a point raised by Mr Loh Meng

See  and  Mr  Simon Tay with regard to non-classroom activities.

Sir,  I  view what has happened, the unfortunate event at  Pulau

Ubin,  with concern.  And we deeply regret that this unfortunate

incident  occurred.   The  Ministry is  now  looking  into  what

actually  happened  and  we  will learn  the  lessons  and  take

appropriate  measures to prevent such incidents from  recurring.

We have also looked into the recent episode at Jin Tai Secondary

School.   I think clearly there should have been better planning

and closer supervision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will take stock of the lessons learned, share

these lessons with the schools and advise them accordingly.  And

we  will continue to remind them of the importance of exercising

appropriate  precautions  when  planning  and  conducting   such

activities.   But  I completely share Mr Simon  Tay's  viewpoint

that  to  over-regulate the activities that schools can organise

would  stifle initiative and diminish significantly the learning

value of these activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, the approach that the Ministry will take is to

continue to encourage schools to be innovative and to plan

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>

activities  that  are  meaningful and  relevant,  enriching  and

challenging.  However, safety is a primary concern and must be a

key principle in the conduct of such activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I move on now to the subject of SAP schools which

several  Members have spoken quite strongly about.  Sir,  it  is

not  surprising that in a multi-racial and multi-lingual society

like  Singapore, with the kind of colonial history that we have,

there is such a wide range of views expressed in this House  and

by  members of the public with regard to the issues of language,

SAP schools, and so on.  But we must understand, as Deputy Prime

Minister Lee explained the other day, where our start point was.

Our  start  point was a very diverse education system  in  which

there  were  very  small numbers of very elite English  language

stream schools.  But most of the population were educated  apart

from  each  other,  separately, different  languages,  different

syllabi,  different curriculum, their own activities,  different

languages.   The  question which we have to  ask  ourselves  is,

compared  to  that  time, are we closer as a  society?   Is  our

education  system bringing the people closer together than  what

was  before?  And I think the answer has to be a resounding yes.

When we were faced with an education system which was as diverse

as it was, there were several ways in which the Government could

have proceeded in those days.  We could have continued with  the

education  system in all its diversity - Chinese schools,  Malay

schools,  Tamil  schools,  and so  on.   We  could  have  had  a

bilingual education system, which was a different one, in  which

each person learns his own mother tongue at first language,  and

English  as  a  second language, or perhaps Malay  as  a  second

language, and hope to bind the society that way.  Some countries

have  decided  to  go that way in the design of their  education

system  and the selection of their language policy.  For us,  we

could have done that.  But I think we would be a different  kind

of  society, a society which has got much deeper separations and

cleavages than we have today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have decided to do is to unify our education

system,  to  have  one  common  system  standard,  and  standard

curriculum,  for all the schools.  And we decided  on  a  common

language.  And, again, deciding on a common language  is  not  a

simple  matter.  Different countries have decided  in  different

ways.   We settled on English for a number of practical  reasons

and,  again,  because  we are a multi-racial  and  multi-lingual

society.   What  other language could we have settled  on  which

would  not  have  raised even more serious  concerns  among  the

different   communities  that  we  have  in  Singapore?    Other

countries  have  decided  in  different  ways.   Malaysia,   for

example,  has  decided on Malay as national language,  and  they

have  unified their education system around that.  But even then

there  are  outliers such as the independent Chinese schools  in

Malaysia  which  teach  in  a different  language  and  quite  a

different curriculum.  Other countries have decided in different

ways.   Hong  Kong, for example, as a territory, as a  SAR,  has

decided  to  go  with Cantonese as a common  language  in  their

schools,  with a small number of schools allowed to continue  to

teach in English.  We have decided on our way.  And I think  for

us,  this is a pragmatic and a better way of proceeding with our

education system, and we unify different languages and races  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reaffirm that our policy objective in the

teaching  of  the  mother  tongue languages  is  to  have  every

Singaporean study his mother tongue for as long as possible  and

to  as  high  a  level as possible.  This fundamental  bilingual

policy in our education system, which has served us well,  which

has  enabled  us to unify the country, while at  the  same  time

allowing  each community to feel that it has the  room  and  the

space  to  develop itself and to retain its own unique  identity

and characteristics, will remain.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on the topic

of University Admissions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee on University Admission System has

recommended

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>

changes  to  the admission criteria into our local universities.

It has recommended that instead of using the sole requirement of

the  GCE  `A' Level Examinations, the new requirements  of  SAT1

(Scholastic  Assessment  Test  1),  project  work   and   extra-curricular  activities be included.  The Committee has  proposed

that the new SAT1 component be implemented in the year 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to suggest that we allow more time for the teachers

and  students  to  prepare  and adjust  to  the  new  university

admission criteria.  By making the change in year 2002, it means

that   this  year's  GCE  `O'  level  students  are  immediately

affected.   It  is  better to start with this  year's  Secondary

Three  students and thus deferring the change to year  2003.   I

hope  the Minister would consider this point before deciding  on

the  date  of implementation of the revised university admission

criteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their study, the Committee did not allude to any

inherent  weaknesses and deficiencies of the current  system  of

university  admission.  The public would be interested  to  know

how   the   candidates  would  be  affected  with  the   changes

introduced.   With  the  additional requirements,  would  we  be

making  it  more difficult than before for our students  to  get

into university?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are already occupied with a heavy workload.

They  do  not have time for other pursuits.  Will the adding  of

the  new  requirements be giving more stress to our students  in

the already highly competitive educational environment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well known for producing examination smart

students.   The  students will take pains to  prepare  for  SAT.

Will  the scores of SAT1 be any different from the GCE `A' level

examination  results?   How  do we expect  the  students  to  be

differentiated  when comparing their GCE `A' level  results  and

the  SAT1  scores?  Even then, how can we be sure that  the  new

system would do a better job of assessing the future performance

of students?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The university is a place to enrich a student's educational

experience.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>

exposure to university learning helps stimulate the intellectual

faculty of students and in the training and discipline of  their

minds.   It would appear that the university would benefit  most

in  having the students cut out for them.  Should the university

not  take  steps in evolving the curricula content and  teaching

methodologies to bring the best in our students?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain courses require students to possess strong people

and  social skills.  Should we include only students who possess

such   skills   to  those  courses?   Should  we  capture   such

requirements?   Should  students not be  required  to  take  the

psychometric tests to determine their character, personality and

interest before qualifying them for any particular course?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not better to have a class made up of students of

varied  backgrounds,  talents and  capabilities  than  one  with

students  of similar attributes and abilities?  Would university

life be more interesting and less boring?  Sir, I really do  not

have the answers.  Perhaps the Minister can shed light on them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I am glad that the Government has

taken the initiative to review the university admission criteria

for  our  local  universities so that we can keep  up  with  the

changing times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the criteria used for university admissions

greatly  affect the whole education system starting from Primary

One, and this education then drives the attitudes of our people.

If  the  system  is based on academic results alone,  as  it  is

presently, then we will have an examination-orientated  approach

in  our  schools.  Our whole system of education and  employment

and of offering scholarships is based on an almost 100% academic

measure  of success and as a result, our practice of meritocracy

is purely based on academic achievements.  While examinations do

offer a suitable benchmark to measure students' performances,  I

feel  such  a system is going to be less relevant in the  future

where  being academically smart alone will not be sufficient  to

be  successful  in  the market place of the 21st  century.   Our

current system is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>

unfair  to  students who have other abilities  like  creativity,

innovation,  leadership  qualities  and  others  that   can   be

categorised  as EQ measures.  It is also unforgiving  to  people

who  may  have  had a transient problem resulting  in  them  not

scoring very well in an examination, while they could have  done

so   should   circumstances  be  better  for  them  during   the

examination.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key recommendations of the Committee on

university  admission  is  to reduce  the  heavy  dependence  on

academic  measures  and to include EQ type  measures.   While  I

support  the reduction of academic measures to 65% of the  total

score  in  determining admission to the university, I feel  that

replacing  the remainder with 25% of a reasoning test  like  the

SAT  examination has merely resulted in shifting of an  academic

or  examination measure from landmark examination to a new  type

of  examination.  Sir, what is going to happen is that  students

will  now  spend  a  lot  of time and money  preparing  for  SAT

examination and the net effect may be negative, especially since

many  will try to do the rote learning approach as they  do  for

current examinations.  In fact this is already happening now, if

you  look  at  the Straits Times report in today's papers.   The

Secondary  Four students are rushing to purchase SAT  assessment

books  and enrolling themselves in classes to prepare  for  SAT.

So we have just shifted the problem from one type of examination

to another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can agree to a reasoning type of examination, I

feel  that  the  overall contribution to the admission  criteria

should be much smaller than the 25% suggested.  I would like  to

suggest the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Reduce the reasoning test contribution to a maximum of

10%  of  the  total score.  In this way, the students  will  not

spend too much time preparing for any one of these examinations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Add a new criterion based on continuous assessments on

EQ factors like leadership, creativity, teamwork and others, and

allow  these  to contribute to about 15% of the total  admission

criteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Allow ECA to contribute directly to the admission

criteria rather than using it just as a bonus criterion  as  was

proposed  by the Committee.  Project work and ECA could together

contribute an additional 10% to the total score.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to consider this modification to what

the  Committee has proposed because I feel that we  will  better

achieve the objectives established by the committee.  If it goes

by what they have proposed now, I do not think they will achieve

their desired objectives.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chew Heng Ching is not speaking. Dr Teo

Ho Pin.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, in order to make sure that

our  universities admit more all rounded students, we must adopt

a  fair  and equitable university admission system.  We need  to

train  quality  graduates who will provide the competitive  edge

for our economy, and the "glue" to nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations as put forward by the Committee on

University Admission System have certain limitations as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For `A' level students, the proposed admission

requirements  do not place much emphasis on key attributes  such

as   leadership,  creativity,  perseverance,  independence   and

resourcefulness  qualities  of  students.   The   combined   90%

weighting  of GCE `A' level and SAT requirements are essentially

academic  criteria, and thus will not make any marked difference

to the present system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the proposed 10% project work and 5% ECA bonus

point  will  not  provide adequate incentives  for  students  to

develop  their  other  abilities.  Sir, project  work  does  not

provide a good gauge of a student's ability and is difficult  to

obtain a fair assessment.  Furthermore, it is difficult

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>

to  determine whether the student does it or not.   The  use  of

project  work  will  not provide a fair and  uniform  method  of

assessment  for all students thus leading to unfair  advantages.

Thus,  project  work should not be introduced  as  part  of  the

university admission system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation of a mere 5% bonus point for ECA will

drastically retard all ECA activities in schools.  In fact,  ECA

provides an excellent avenue to develop and assess the abilities

of a student.  Many ECA activities, especially uniformed groups,

provide  a structured and holistic approach in allowing students

to  acquire different types of skills, such as leadership,  team

work,  perseverance,  creative  thinking,  independence,  moral,

physical and other social skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me cite the example of the National Police Cadet

Corps  (NPCC).  Today, we have 19,500 cadets in over  a  hundred

schools  in  Singapore.  These cadets undergo a  wide  range  of

training  ranging  from  drills, discipline,  crime  prevention,

civil  defence, water survival, to shooting and adventure camps.

Cadets who achieve good conduct, strong commitment, consistently

good performance, positive attitude towards learning and regular

attendance  are  promoted  to  various  ranks  and  given  award

commendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participation of such ECA involves time and commitment.

It  shapes the character of individual.  The achievements in ECA

clearly  reflect  the  true qualities of a  student.   Thus  due

recognition  must  be  given  when  considering  the   admission

criteria  to universities.  Therefore, I would propose  that  at

least 25% of the university admission system should be allocated

to ECA activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, a fair and equitable university admission

system  would  consist  of  50%  weighting  on  GCE  `A'   level

examinations,  25%  on  SAT score and 25%  on  ECA.   This  will

provide a balance between academic abilities, aptitude and other

talents  to be considered when admitting the students  into  our

universities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the admission

criteria  in  the universities are being reviewed in recognition

of the fact that Singaporeans need to be creative and innovative

if  the  country  is  to  stay competitive.   The  Committee  on

University  Admission hopes that the changes will transform  the

ethos and attitudes of the people towards education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not for one moment question the Committee's honest

belief in its goal.  I also recognise the limited nature of  the

Committee's  remit.   But  if  we  want  to  transform  people's

philosophy towards learning, if we want to nurture our  creative

and innovative spirit, then much more needs to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to make

radical  changes first, to the education system and  second,  to

the  way  we  develop  the potential of our  scholars.   If  the

objective  is  to encourage creativity, we have to start  young.

We  cannot leave it to the time when applications are  made  for

entry  to  the universities.  By then, attitudes of parents  and

students towards education would have taken shape and it will be

very difficult to set them onto a new path of thinking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot expect, for example, that the introduction of the

SAT  will cause our parents and students to suddenly re-evaluate

their  approach to education.  And as one of the speakers before

me  pointed out, today's newspaper article in the Straits  Times

is  very  instructive because parents and students, if you  read

the article, look at the SAT as another form of assessment to be

beaten by coaching and mastery of assessment books.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must start young and there are two dimensions to this

issue.  First, the teachers.  They must be encouraged and  given

time  to  work  with  school  children  on  issues  outside  the

curriculum.  Teachers now have to contend with a great  deal  of

pressure.   They  have  to  finish the syllabus  and  get  their

students  to score so that the average grade of the school  goes

up  year after year.  Where is the time or the incentive to work

on  the  child's creative and innovative side, on matters  which

are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>

vital for the all round development of the individual, but which

are non-examinable?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other dimension is parents who have been brought up in

a  social and job environment where examination and test results

are  everything.  Therefore, the obsession with grades.   School

children  now  have  very little time for  anything  other  than

school  work.   Because  of this drive for  top  marks,  working

parents  have  very  little  time or incentive  to  nurture  the

child's creativity.  It will be a rare Singapore parent who will

say that he does not really care how his son or daughter does in

school  so  long  as  he develops his reasoning  and  analytical

skills.   It  is  at  the end of the day all about  assessments,

tests and examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there will always be a few, fortunately, despite the

difficulties,  who  will do well in examinations  and  have  the

potential  to  be creative and innovative.  If given  the  right

environment,  these  youngsters  will  develop  the  spirit   of

enterprise  and derring-do which we all want to see flourish  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What opportunities do these few have to realise their full

potential?   Let us take the example of our best and  brightest.

They  are  given scholarships to the best universities all  over

the  world  and  are  required  by  their  bonds  to  serve  the

Government  or a statutory body or the armed forces  upon  their

return.   There  is nothing wrong with that.  It has  served  us

well.   We  need  the  brightest to  man  our  institutions  and

experience has shown that the system runs efficiently because of

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have been paying a price for this practice which is

that our top brains are not being given the best environment  to

fully  develop their potential as innovators and technopreneurs.

Instead,  they  are put in institutions which depend  for  their

effectiveness  on hierarchy, discipline and an almost  religious

adherence to rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that our scholars are discouraged from

exercising discretion

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>

and initiative in the Government or in the armed forces.  What I

am  saying  is that there is a far better environment for  their

full  potential  to  flower.  That  they  can  make  a  dramatic

difference  if they are dropped in the deep end of  the  private

sector where they have to sink or swim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty we face is our small numbers. In other

countries,  for  every  top student who  goes  into  the  public

service,  you have another five, 10, 20 who go into the  private

sector  and inject vibrancy into it.  We do not have the  luxury

of  these numbers.  I am not suggesting that only our top brains

can  energise  the  private  sector and  therefore  sharpen  our

competitiveness.  Many others can and have done so.  But we have

to play with the odds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five to eight years of service, not many of these

scholars  leave the Government or the service to which they  are

bonded.  Having established their career paths, they are  likely

to stay to carry on to the top.  Those who leave come out with a

mindset  which has been developed in those five to  eight  years

that they have been with the Government and it is very difficult

to transform the mindset of someone in his early 30s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposition is that we need to re-evaluate our

priorities  in education as well as the system of deployment  of

our  top  scholars  if  we are serious about  remaining  at  the

cutting edge.  We have to decide, given our small numbers,  what

we  are prepared to sacrifice if we want an effervescent private

sector  full of ideas, energy and initiative.  We need to strike

a new balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A change to the admission policy for the universities will

not by itself bring about a change in ethos.  We need to do much

more.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.28 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, first, let me declare my interest in

this  amendment.  I am a lecturer at the National University  of

Singapore.  The recent review to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>

improve the university education is timely.  We are living in  a

rapidly  changing  world.  Singapore is  moving  fast  into  the

knowledge-based era.  We have to prepare our young to operate in

such a future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new university admission framework was proposed in the

review.    It  widens  the  admission  system  making  it   more

comprehensive.    The   admission   framework   includes   three

additional  requirements:   the Scholastic  Achievement  Test  1

(SAT1),  project  work and extracurricular  activities  for  our

students  who  have  taken the GCE `A' level examination.   This

signals that in the future more than just academic excellence is

needed to be a university student.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the inclusion of project work and extracurricular

activities  in  the  new admission framework.   Working  on  and

learning  from  these projects, our students can  broaden  their

mindset.   The  projects  will  enhance  their  creativity   and

encourage innovation.  But I do not see the need to include SAT1

for  our  students who have taken the GCE `A' level examination.

Firstly, SAT1 purports to test reasoning skills, something  that

the `A' level examination is said not to do as well.  Before  we

ask  the  students to do these additional tests, do we know  how

the  results of these two tests correlate?  Although it has been

argued that these two tests measure different capabilities, what

happens  if  these sets of capabilities are strongly  correlated

for  most  of  our students?  Would it then not be  a  waste  of

effort to force all our students to take SAT1?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, SAT1 is time-consuming to take. It is an

additional activity.  It will take time to prepare.  It will put

more pressure on our students and parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if we are using SAT1 to signal to our students to

change how they should study, then it is a blunt tool.  I do not

see  how  SAT1 by itself is going to change the mindset  of  our

school  students.   It  will  be  more  effective  to  make  the

necessary  changes to our education system from Primary  1.   We

have 12 good years to nurture our students.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, SAT1 is adopted by the US universities because

the US does not have a common national examination, like our GCE

`A'  level  examination.  The SAT test is a  common  measure  to

gauge  their students from various high schools using  different

syllabi.  The SAT results are used with the high school  results

for  university admission.  In fact, SAT1 and 2 together can  be

said to take the place of the `A' level examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, SAT1 is not cheap to take. It currently costs

each  student  US$38 to take the test.  Assuming an  annual  `A'

level  cohort  of  12,000 students, it  will  cost  a  total  of

US$456,000.  At the exchange rate of S$1.75 to US$1,  this  will

work out to some $798,000.  This assumes that each student takes

one  test each.  What about preparatory classes and tuition  for

the  tests?   Knowing Singapore parents, they  will  want  their

children  to  be  very prepared, especially now  that  it  is  a

requirement  for university admission.  If, say, conservatively,

a  quarter of the students take tuition or preparatory  classes,

with  each  paying  $500, this will work out  annually  to  $1.5

million.   In  total,  the  SAT1  test  would  cost  parents  an

additional  $2.3  million  if SAT1 is  made  a  requirement  for

admission  to  the  local universities.  This  is  only  a  very

conservative estimate of the total expenditure by parents on SAT

tests if SAT1 becomes compulsory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I support the inclusion of SAT1 as a

requirement  for foreign students who have not taken  their  `A'

level  examination.  The inclusion of SAT1 for the admission  of

polytechnic and mature students who have also not taken the  `A'

level examination is also meaningful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I think the efforts by the universities to

review the admission framework is timely and necessary.   A  new

framework will make the admission more comprehensive.   However,

I  am not convinced of the necessity to require our students  to

take SAT1 in addition to the `A' level examination.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, for many Singaporeans, a

university  degree  is a holy grail.  So, it is  not  surprising

that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>

the  proposed changes to the university admission criteria  have

aroused  considerable  interest.   In  general,  I  support  the

intent,  principle and purpose of this review of the  Committee.

The  broader  admission  criteria would certainly  give  a  more

complete  picture  of the individual student's  capability,  not

just  with academic results but also on their reasoning  skills,

their  ability to conduct independent enquiries through  project

work and also through extra curricular involvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is really over the impact the broader admission

criteria have on our students.  In our quest for a more holistic

assessment  of  our students, I think we must  be  vigilant  and

guard  against over-burdening them with examinations and  tests.

Whether the GCE `A' level examination constitutes a 100%, 75% or

50%  of  any  admission criteria, the amount of  effort  that  a

student  will expend in preparing for the examination  would  be

the  same.   I think students will need to, and want to,  expend

that  time  on their examination in order to secure the  minimum

results required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the introduction of SAT1 would add a qualitatively

different  point  in  the  assessment  criteria  for  which  the

students  must  prepare  separately.   The  SAT  is  a  test  of

reasoning skills, and it may be true that studying for the  test

other than to get accustomed to its format, or taking it several

times, is unlikely to yield much benefit.  But I think we should

try  telling that to our students and their parents.  I am quite

sure  that  the  introduction of SAT1 as part of  the  admission

criteria  will  lead to the mushrooming of a whole  new  service

industry to prepare students to take SAT1 examination.  This  is

not unprecedented.  We have seen it in other parts of the world,

including the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, project work, unless introduced gradually and in

a  manner  complementary to the existing  curriculum,  would  be

reduced  to merely being another admission criteria requirement.

The cumulative effect of these changes, I fear,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>

may  be  to increase the pressure on our students and  they  may

adopt  a  more  jaded  attitude to  what  is  otherwise  a  very

important  change  and signal to them that  we  are  emphasising

creativity and innovation and they need to address those aspects

of their talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether this important initiative could therefore

be  implemented in tandem with other measures and considerations

in  order  to  mitigate the possible adverse consequences.   For

example,  could  the  system  be implemented  with  considerable

flexibility?  If a student does well in GCE `A' level, but  does

not make a mark in SAT1, can the student still be considered for

admission, or vice versa?  In other words, can we use  this  new

system   to   broaden  the  pool  of  possible   entrants   into

universities rather than to narrow the pool?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, could we consider SAT1 requirements in terms

of  a  minimum  required score for admission to university?   In

other  words, we only need it as an indication of the  reasoning

ability  but beyond the threshold point, additional  points  may

not  be of great consequence.  The advantage of this is that  it

will  reduce the incentive for students to repeatedly  take  SAT

tests in order to try and raise their scores.  In addition,  the

reduction in the curriculum in junior college, which I think  is

already  under way, needs to be put in place well  before  these

additional  requirements are put in.  At the same time,  if  the

teachers  are  adequately prepared to guide these  students  and

help  them  understand better what is SAT1 test, that will  also

serve the objectives of this review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I support the principle of the review. But I do

have  some  problems with its practical impact and its potential

effects  on students and I hope that the Minister would  address

these questions before finalising the implementation.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, may I first declare my

interest  as a member of the Law Faculty and who is involved  in

the selection process.  We have to agonise every year to take in

150 law students over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>

a shortlist of 500 and in this instance, I would like to say the

proposal  to  include the SAT in the admission  requirement  may

have  unsettled many parents and students, though as one who  is

involved  in the selection process, I would welcome  it  on  the

basis  that  the more information one gets about  the  potential

student,  the  more  likely it is that we  can  make  the  right

decision about admitting him or her into the university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents and students have, for a long time now, got used to

the  idea  that  the  `A' level grades should  be  enough  as  a

determinant of standards for admission.  The `A' level  is  seen

as  a culmination of 12 years of study and Singapore may well be

one  of  the  few places in the world, if the new proposals  are

implemented, where both English `A' level and US SAT  tests  are

administered to gain admission into university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the points that I would like to raise have already

been  raised  by  my  colleague from the university  and  by  Mr

Iswaran.  So, I shall restrict myself to mainly three points.  I

believe that parents and students will need to be convinced  why

or  how the new SAT will be helpful because there is no question

that  more  expenditure and more time will have to be  given  to

this  new test.  In this regard, I would like to mention that  I

read  an  article  in  the Yale Law Journal recently  where  one

professor, writing on admission to law school, mentioned tongue-in-cheek  that  while the SAT administration may  tell  us  that

preparation  is  not very useful for the taking  of  SAT  tests,

there  are  a  large  number  of very  solvent  SAT  preparation

companies in the United States.  The point very simply  is  that

not  only  would kiasu parents react to a new test by  requiring

their  children to do a lot more exercises and so on, it happens

everywhere where the SAT test has taken place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a proposal, before the SAT is to be

taken  into  account in terms of weightage, whether  it  is  not

possible now to ask students to take their SAT test but  instead

of giving a weightage to it, to use it, as Mr Iswaran

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>

has  suggested just now, only if the students do not meet  the

cut-off  point  for  `A'  level in gaining  admission  into  any

faculty.  This would give us sufficient time to monitor  over  a

period  of 3 years how these students will do, both in terms  of

`A'  level as well as in terms of SAT performance.  And with the

results  of  the  study, we may be able to see whether  the  SAT

really  does  make a real difference in terms of  admission,  in

terms  of  the  quality of the students we are getting,  and  in

terms, more importantly, of the performance of the students once

they are in the university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if it is found that the SAT-type test is useful

and  important, it should be integrated into the junior  college

curriculum so that students do not need to sit for it separately

from  the  usual  `A' level examination.  This  will  allow  the

schools to factor in the test as part and parcel of their school

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if given time to assess the quality of the SAT in

measuring  ability, parents and students may have an opportunity

to  see  the credibility of such a test only after these studies

have been made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore end by saying that I hope that the scheme

will  be  slowly  introduced and that there  will  be  time  and

opportunity for the SAT to be proven to be a very good  test  in

the admission requirements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Committee  on University Admissions has recommended  changes  to

the admission criteria for universities.  The suggestion is made

because  in  a knowledge-economy oriented world of  tomorrow,  a

university graduate must have wide ranging skills, and not  just

the skill of absorbing knowledge.  The Committee also feels that

that  the new admission criteria will therefore change the broad

direction of our education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not believe that the introduction of this

American  style  Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)  will  help  our

university  students to possess extensive skills  and  cultivate

the spirit of life-long

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>

learning.   First, this Scholastic Aptitude Test  evaluates  the

candidate's  comprehension  skill  and  the  ability  to   solve

equivocal problems.  I think if after 12 years of education, and

having  attained  `A' level results which  are  good  enough  to

satisfy  the university's admission and eligibility requirement,

our  students still do not have the comprehension skill and  the

ability to deal with tricky problems, then there must be  either

some  big  problem  with  our education  system  or  significant

defects with the design of the examination papers.  Therefore, I

think  the Ministry should review the present education  system,

restructure  the curriculum and the way examination  papers  are

set.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this Scholastic Aptitude Test is another obstacle

for  the  students' admission to the university.  It  will  also

bring  additional  financial burden and  mental  stress  to  our

students  and  parents.  Examinations may serve the  purpose  of

evaluating  the  students' proficiency in certain  subjects  and

their mental capabilities.  But the evil of examination is  that

when  students,  teachers, parents and schools  place  too  much

emphasis on the examination results, it would defeat the primary

purpose of education itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we should not depend too much on examinations

to  decide  whether any particular student should be  given  the

opportunity  to  further his studies.  Because  education  is  a

process  of  exerting  subtle influence  on  the  character  and

thinking of our students.  So if we just use the basis  of   the

pass  rate  in  examinations to decide whether a school  or  our

education system is good or bad, I think it is too simplistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Scholastic Aptitude Test will become another type of

examination  in  Singapore,  a subject  to  test  our  students'

comprehension skill and their ability to solve tricky  problems.

Worse  still, this is an examination which is outside the school

syllabi.    Although  some  people  say  preparation   for   SAT

examinations will not raise their score, one thing for  sure  is

that there will be a lot of American experts in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>

this type of SAT examinations coming here to set up schools  and

claim  that their method is the most effective one.  So, like  a

swarm  of  bees,  our  parents will rush towards  these  tuition

schools,  and  this will become another burden to  our  parents,

teachers and students.  I think our parents will have to spend a

lot of money because of this examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this examination, no matter how many times you take the

examination,  you  can  always use the highest  score  for  your

admission  requirement. So, in our kiasu situation in Singapore,

the parents and students will keep on taking the examinations in

order  to improve their score, and this will increase the burden

of our people.  Why should we do that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is SAT relevant to our national conditions?

First,  this  examination  uses the pairing  of  two  groups  of

English  words to evaluate the students'  standard  of  English.

Theoretically,   if   a  student  can  satisfy   the   admission

requirement, then his standard of English should have reached  a

certain  standard of proficiency.  There should not be a problem

taking  an  examination  in English.  But  using  vocabulary  in

English  to test students' comprehension skill and their ability

of  logic  involves  a student's depth in understanding  English

vocabulary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Straits Times report on 17th January, the Dean of the

American Education Centre in Singapore was quoted as saying that

Singapore students may have difficulties in the vocabulary  part

of SAT.  To students who speak mother tongue at home and English

is just a medium for academic research, this examination will be

an  unfair obstacle to them.  If the Ministry of Education feels

that  the  ultimate method of evaluating the effect of education

is  through  the  examination system, then is  the  Ministry  of

Education going to consider having some subjects like our  sense

of  patriotism  in  our examinations?  Or like  in  Japan,  they

tested the students' integrity when they want to go into medical

school.    I  urge  the  Ministry of  Education  to  review  the

necessity  of having  SAT in Singapore in order to  prevent  the

need for those who cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>

make  the  grade  to go overseas to further their  studies,  and

those  who cannot afford to go overseas will be deprived of  the

opportunity  to  go to university.  They would thus  become  the

scapegoat of the new admission system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, before the recommendation that SAT

should  be  part of university admission from the year  2002  is

accepted, we need to examine a number of issues carefully.  This

is  especially since the SAT has become a controversial issue in

the  American  system,  which has  been  using  SAT  scores  for

university  or  college  admission for  several  years  already.

There  are conflicting research studies and statistics  compiled

over  what  SAT actually measures and doubts cast as to  whether

one  can use the test to predict the future performance of  high

SAT scorers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a population of 4 million people, we need to maximise

our  human resources as much as possible.  We need to give  them

the opportunities to get higher education, and we should try  to

have  more  students admitted into our universities.   Following

from this, is there really any need for SAT to be applied across

the  board? Or perhaps it might be better used as a tool to look

at  those  whose 'A' level results are just below the borderline

admission  criteria for university.  The question is,  what  are

the  factors  which led to the recommendation of a weightage  of

25% for SAT scores as part of university admission?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It interests me quite significantly that our colleague, Dr

Teo Ho Pin, has suggested that 'A' level results should be given

50%  of weightage for university admission; another 25% from SAT

and 25% from ECA.  Sir, I would like to stress, that there is so

much  to  learn at 'A' level, and ECA should not be  used  as  a

major criterion for university admission, no matter how well  we

want to open the opportunities for our students with varied  and

different  talents to enter into university, and  contribute  to

the multitude of talented Singaporeans who can contribute to our

progress in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think giving ECA as much as 25% in weightage is too

excessive.  For all the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>

knowledge that has to be learnt in two years at 'A' level, as  a

foundation  for  university  education,  giving  the  'A'  level

results only 50% in weightage is, to me, very imbalanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the SAT study should also look at the wider social

picture  and  determine  whether  a  system  that  prepares  all

students  equally to sit for SAT can be put in  place.   Despite

some  studies which show that SAT coaching really does not help,

I am sure we are going to see parents and students scrambling to

prepare for SAT examinations and tests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do agree that we have to re-evaluate our education

system by introducing changes, but short notices should not be a

habit  of  ours.  I would therefore agree with my Education  GPC

colleague,   Mr  Loh  Meng  See,  that  we  should   delay   the

implementation of the new university admission system by another

year or two.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I would like to

speak on freedom of speech at local universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intake of NUS and NTU including post-graduates in

FY1999  is  expected to be about 25,000 and 14,900 respectively.

They  are  the  best and brightest students in  our  land.   The

universities'  aim  is to produce graduates with  the  necessary

skills and knowledge for employment, and promoting research  and

innovation.  But I am told that the universities' administration

is rather strict on students when it comes to political matters.

The  environment in the universities is rather  restrictive.   I

would  urge the Minister to make the universities to  be  places

where free expression and inquiry are possible, so as to prepare

our graduates to develop the faculty of critical thinking.  I do

not  think that we should train all our graduates to be yes men.

We shall stagnate intellectually if we do so.  I think Singapore

must  have  a pool of intellectuals who can think independently.

Only then can Singapore make a quantum leap into an economy that

produces  high value added goods.  Only then can real prosperity

come  to  Singapore, rather than, like the present time, compete

with other neighbours and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>

the rest of the world based mainly on lowering costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, I am also told that freedom of expression is

curbed  in  our universities.   Apparently, articles printed  in

students' magazines and in newsletters have to be vetted  before

they can be published.  Also, if political organisations in  the

universities  want to release press statements to express  their

views on issues, those statements must first be approved by  the

university authorities.  I am further informed that formerly  no

such  restrictions  were  imposed on university  students.   Why

should the situation be changed now?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, perhaps I should address Mr

Chiam's  point first.  NUS and NTU students are free to  express

themselves in writing in university publications and even to the

media.  They write regularly to the press, as long as they do so

in  their personal capacities, and our universities do encourage

the  students  to express themselves.  NUS and NTU also  believe

that students should be prepared to take full responsibility for

their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In NUS and NTU though, the students' articles that are

submitted for publication in official student publications, such

as  those  of  the  students' unions, clubs and  societies,  are

perused  as  a  precaution against any legal  infringements.   I

think,  as  a  lawyer, Mr Chiam would appreciate that.   Such  a

requirement  comes from purely a legal perspective, because  the

university, by its statutes, becomes responsible for what occurs

in  the  university  and  what is in  the  publications  of  the

universities,  and  it is not for a desire to restrain  students

from  freely expressing themselves.  Mr Chiam himself has spoken

at the university a number of times.  So there is no question on

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you allow me, Sir, to return to the issues on university

admissions.  First, let me thank Members for their questions and

suggestions  on the university admission system (UAS).   I  know

this is a topic that is close to the hearts of many university

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>

professors, parents, teachers and students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not look at the university admission system on

its  own.  As I explained earlier, we should look at it  in  the

context of the entire education system.  The recommendations  on

the  UAS should be seen in that context, and it is part  of  the

larger  changes that we are trying to put in place in the  whole

education  system,  in  the 12 years  prior  to  university,  in

university  and  beyond  that.  And  in  that  regard,  I  agree

completely with Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Davinder Singh  who  have

raised the same matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities are also working towards giving their

undergraduates  a  broader education, within limits,  and  using

open-book  examinations  and other  things  while  they  are  in

university.  But the exit gate itself from the school system and

the university system has significance, because what is required

of  students at this point has a great impact on the motivation,

attitude  and behaviour all the way down the line.  For example,

we  are focused only on SAT, but there are other aspects to  the

university  admission system, eg, ECA, project work and  so  on.

If  we say that leadership, creativity and communications skills

are  important,  and  yet  we do not  make  them  count  in  the

university admission  -  some people argue that we should  stick

with the 'A' levels and nothing else  -  if we do not make these

other  things  count, then we are really sending a  signal  that

none  of these things really count.  So, I believe that if  want

to make them important in the minds of students, we have to make

them count.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the same time, it is also unrealistic to expect

the  university admission system to solve all our  problems,  to

choose people who will be successful, without doubt, later on in

life  and  so forth.  Many other qualities, including character,

motivation,  perseverance in the face  of  adversity,  determine

success  in  their later life.  What we can do is to  hope  that

with  the  new  university admission system, to  make  the  more

important  attributes  count.  So  while  I  do  agree  with  Mr

Inderjit Singh

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>

and  Mr  Loh Meng See that EQ, leadership, creativity,  teamwork

and  personality  are important, we should not  place  the  full

burden  of  this  on  the  university admission  system.   Where

relevant,  courses such as Medicine, Law and Architecture  could

stipulate aptitude tests and interviews could take into  account

things  like  commitment to the nation and so  on,  where  these

things are of particular importance.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have raised specific concerns in three areas: SAT1,

ECA  and  project work.  Let me first deal with the question  of

balance  among  the  different  elements.   There  is  no  magic

formula.  Some US universities state the elements that  go  into

admission  decisions but do not stipulate  weights.   I  do  not

think  in Singapore we are ready for such a system which is  not

transparent.  Most Singaporeans would still prefer a transparent

system where the weights and criteria are clearly specified  and

known to all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin thinks ECA is not being given enough weight.

I  am  glad  though that he has not suggested that all  students

must  pass  a  swimming  test  or a life  saving  course  before

entering  university.  I think we are already taking a big  step

by  enlarging the university admission criteria beyond just  the

"A"  levels.  This step alone would already send a strong signal

on what we value in education.  Before we take any further step,

it is better to let the new system run in and, as Prof. Chin has

said,  let us evaluate what is happening and how the new  system

works.   The  Committee  chaired by  Prof.  Shih  can  certainly

revisit  the percentages, and make recommendations about  future

directions, if necessary.  I will ask them to take the  comments

that  Members  have  made  into account.   But  we  have  to  be

realistic.  If we take into account all the things that  Members

have  suggested, instead of 100%, we will probably end  up  with

300% of weight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked what is the value of using SAT1 when we

already have the "A" levels.  Several Members have asked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>

about the correlation between SAT1 and "A" levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAT1 and the "A" levels measure different facets of

intellectual ability which a person must possess to benefit from

a university education.  The "A" levels, being content-based and

rigorous,  measure  mastery of content and  skills.   The  SAT1,

which  relies  less on content and more on generic reasoning  in

the  verbal  and  quantitative areas, provides a  measure  of  a

person's reasoning ability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we do not have studies on Singapore, data from other

countries,  for example, US and Israel which have  studied  this

matter  extensively,  show  that a combination  of  national  or

school  examination result, and a reasoning test gives a  better

prediction for university performance than either one alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and Mr Hawazi have proposed using the SAT1 as an

alternative  assessment  tool for students  who  may  have  just

fallen short marginally on their "A" level results.  I do  agree

that if we have students who score very highly on the "A" levels

and  very poorly on the SAT, or who score very highly on the SAT

and  very poorly on the "A" levels, resulting in their not being

able to qualify for university, we should look at these students

very carefully and try to decide why that is so and whether they

merit  a  place.   It  is  not  surprising  that  test  coaching

companies  have  made claims of immense improvements  in  scores

from coaching.  That is what they are in the business for.   But

I  think they would also concede that it is not the coaching per

se  but  the  discipline and effort needed to  study  which  are

important.   I  am  sure  that Singaporean  students  who  apply

themselves to their work will have little to worry about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience in the US is that beyond a certain level,

extra coaching and taking the test repeatedly do not improve the

score.  I think Singaporean students will learn that also  quite

quickly.  A certain amount of preparation for the SAT1 though is

needed, but primarily to become

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>

familiar  with the test format.  Obviously, if you do not,  when

you  walk into a test, you do not know what you are going to  be

tested  on and you have never seen such a paper before, you  may

not  do  very well.  But once you have acquired some familiarity

with  the test format, further practice and repetition will  not

cause  scores  to go up dramatically.  So what  we  are  talking

about  is not two years of study in the JC to prepare for  SAT1,

but at most several weeks of preparation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan also talks about the cost of taking a SAT1 and he

went  through  some very impressive calculations for  this.   In

truth,  the cost of taking a SAT1 is about US$38, ie, S$65,  and

the  cost of taking one "A" level subject is about S$70.   Those

are the comparable costs that we are talking about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has expressed concern about how the SAT1

might  be  culturally biased and disadvantage  those  from  non-English speaking homes.  This is a valid concern which has  also

been  expressed by some parents and students.  The Ministry will

look  into setting up our own reasoning test, but this will take

time.   Sweden  and Israel took many years to set up  their  own

version  of  SAT.   The  SAT1  would  appear  to  be  the   most

internationally  recognised  and  accepted  test  for  assessing

reasoning  skills.   Therefore, the  Committee  has  decided  to

recommend the use of SAT1 for this purpose.  Proceeding with the

SAT1 in the meantime will give us the experience and help us  in

devising our own reasoning test in due course.  In addition, our

university  graduates and JC students have often been criticised

for  not  reading widely and not reading beyond their  textbooks

and  so on.  If having to take the SAT1 will cause them to start

reading  more widely from a younger age, it is not  such  a  bad

thing after all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, there is no perfect test which will allow us to

measure  all  the desired qualities we want in our  young,  from

intellectual curiosity to leadership and creativity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECAs have been an integral part of our education system for

a  long  time.  I am sure many Members here will attest  to  the

value  of  active participation in ECA, among them  Mr  Inderjit

Singh and Dr Teo Ho Pin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is how much ECAs should count for. We are making

them  count  now.  Having deliberated on it for some  time,  the

Committee has chosen the route of bonus points, as it strikes  a

good balance between encouraging students to strive for not just

passive  participation  in ECAs but quality  participation,  and

sending a signal that academic potential and achievement,  while

important for university studies, are not the be-all and end-all

of  education.  The bonus points, despite being called  "bonus",

do  count  because  a student with bonus points  would  be  more

favourably placed than one without.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has suggested doing away with the project

component  due  to difficulties in assessment.  Prof.  Chin  has

also  commented  on  this.  Project work is very  beneficial  in

developing    independent    learning,    critical     thinking,

resourcefulness, teamwork and so on.  As someone  said,  in  the

normal working environment, if you are assigned a piece of work,

the  natural  tendency is to go and ask your colleagues  and  so

forth  how  to  do it and to work together.  But in  the  school

system,  that is described as cheating.  We do want to encourage

students to work together and to learn how to work together.  So

if we think that this is important and we do want students to do

that,  and we want to ask the schools to spend some time guiding

the  students in doing project work properly, as Prof. Chin  has

pointed out, then we should try and make project work count.   I

understand  that there are some difficulties, but this  sort  of

assessment is not new to our schools.  We have various forms  of

open-ended  assessment already.  In fact,  there  are  some  "A"

level  subjects  which  depend  on  project  work  for  a   very

significant   proportion  of  their  assessment,  for   example,

Computer  Studies.   Essays are also marked  subjectively.   But

there  is  a  way  of devising a reliable system  for  assessing

students.  So examiners can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>

devise  ways to grade the students in project work consistently.

Through regular interaction between teacher and student as  well

as  oral  presentations, we should be able to develop  a  system

which is sufficient to actually assess the students' work.   But

we are giving ourselves a little more time to do that and we are

talking  about  introducing it in  the  year  2004.   Given  the

benefits  to  be  gained, we should find workable  solutions  to

using  project  work as one of the  means of  assessment  rather

than abandoning the idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has recommended that the universities, JCs

and  the  Ministry  of  Education set up a  joint  committee  to

monitor standards across all the schools.  This would be similar

to  the  practice  in universities of having external  examiners

assess a sample of students' work.  This is one possibility that

the Ministry will look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are putting in place fairly major changes to the

university  admission  system.  Students, teachers  and  parents

will need time to adjust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members' comments and suggestions will form part of the

wider  feedback  that the University Admission System  Committee

will  continue  to study carefully over the next two  months  as

they  review and refine their proposals.  I expect the Committee

to  submit its final report to the Government by the end of May,

following  which  the  Ministry of  Education  would  study  the

proposals and put up its recommendations to the Government.   An

announcement  on  the  new  university admission  system  should

therefore be expected by the middle of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Hawazi have expressed some concern

that  the  year 2002 is too early to implement the new admission

system.   One idea for the Committee to consider is whether  the

new admission system should be implemented from 2003, instead of

2002.  This would allow the students entering the first year  of

JC  and in particular those doing the three-year Pre-U course in

the  centralised institutes a little more time  to  prepare  and

adjust.  The Ministry will certainly consult

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>

the  Committee, the JCs and the CIs on this matter and  we  will

announce our decision in June.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the University Admission System Committee has

adopted  the  right approach in its review and I  support  their

proposals.  There is no perfect criterion or measurement  of  an

individual's  ability or aptitude to succeed at  university  or,

for  that  matter,   to succeed in life.  The  main  reason  for

revising  the admission system is not that we have been terribly

wrong  in  selecting  students so far.  By and  large,  we  have

selected   students  to  enter  university  quite   well.    Our

universities will still continue to take in a large majority  of

"A" level graduates.  The new system, in fact, will by and large

admit  the same students as under the existing system, but  with

additional  flexibility to take in those with the  aptitude  for

university education who might not have been selected purely  on

the basis of "A" level results.   From the way I look at it,  it

is  not  that  we are creating extra obstacles, as some  Members

have  expressed  the  view,  but  that  we  are  providing  more

opportunities  and a wider way of assessing students.   But  the

most important function of the new admission system lies in  the

signal it would send throughout the education system, and to the

rest of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, I must stress, I am not talking just about the

SAT1 but the ECA, project work part in the admission system.  We

should  look at it from the whole package.  As the International

Academic Advisory Panel for the universities has put it,  having

the "A" levels as the sole admission criteria trains students to

overcome  only one type of obstacle.  Having other  requirements

would  signal  to  our students that they should  develop  other

qualities and skills necessary for their individual as  well  as

our national success in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, we are pursuing a two-pronged

approach.   We  want to implement a university admission  system

that   gives   the  appropriate  signal  for  holistic   student

development  in  our schools.  We also want  to  strive  towards

"Thinking Schools" and the "Desired

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>

Outcomes of Education" in the way that teaching and learning are

carried  out  in  our  schools  and  universities.   With   this

strategy, we hope to cultivate a climate that would allow us  to

bring out the best in our students, so that they would not  just

be  prepared to tackle an examination, but be ready to adapt and

do well in a rapidly changing society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on, I forgot to mention this to the other

Members who have raised a variety of points.  We would take into

account the points raised by Mr Loh on music, Mdm Claire  Chiang

on  community  involvement, Mr Shriniwas Rai  on  community  and

business   support   for  schools,  Mr  Hawazi   on   enrichment

programmes,  Mr  Sinnakaruppan and  Mr  Simon  Tay  on  regional

education  and other points and suggestions raised thus  far  by

Members.   Other  points  on teachers  and  air-conditioning  of

schools, we will deal with them later, if we have time.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to

seek clarification from the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my

earlier  question on streaming.  I would like  the  Minister  to

explain specifically what is the signal and ability that SAT  is

trying  to send to the students, parents and teachers.  I  think

what he has explained is too abstract and too vague.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he taken into consideration the potential burden that

SAT  would  place on parents and students?  And  how  would  the

objectives  of  SAT  justify  all these  additional  burdens  on

students,  parents and teachers?  Would it not  be  possible  to

revise  `A'  level examination questions to assess  the  ability

that SAT would have tried to assess?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, since the Minister has admitted that language

in SAT could be a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>

concern,  I  would like to know whether there is  any  immediate

measure  or remedy that the Ministry of Education is looking  at

before  we go into full swing of putting SAT as a criterion  for

admission into the university.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, do you want to clarify something?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I mentioned that when a political

organisation  in the university wishes to issue a  statement  to

give  their  point of view, they must first get the approval  of

the  university administration.  The Minister has not  commented

on this.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, we do not encourage our students

to   take   part  in  partisan  political  activities   in   the

universities.   In  fact, we do encourage our students  to  read

widely,  to be interested in current affairs, national  affairs,

and  so  forth.   But  we do want them to concentrate  on  their

studies.   We do not want them to be distracted by all kinds  of

other things which Mr Chiam may be thinking about.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I do not think he should make fun

of me.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I am not making fun of Mr Chiam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, they want to make a public

statement  on some issues to express their point  of  view.   If

they  want  to make a statement, do they need first to  get  the

approval of the university administration?  That is my question.

Yes or no?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, as I have explained, I read on a

regular basis views expressed by students in the newspapers, and

so on.  I am really quite surprised.  I do not think they really

need Mr Chiam to speak up for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on to the points raised by Mr Low Thia Khiang

on the SAT and `A' levels.  I did not quite understand the first

point on streaming.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I raised a question on streaming

earlier which I think was not answered.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> First of all, on the cultural content

of  SAT, I think we do recognise that there may well be a little

bit  of  cultural  bias, in a sense.  But I am really  a  little

surprised  with  the arguments that Mr Low is raising.   Earlier

on,  he said that actually our students should be well prepared,

because  if  they proceeded all the way to the `A' levels,  they

really  should  have no difficulties doing this.   Now  I  am  a

little  surprised  because he is taking the other  side  of  the

argument to say that they do have difficulties.  I am not really

sure what Mr Low is trying to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do accept that there are some culturally biased elements

in  the SAT, but I do not think that they would be so serious as

to  cause  the SAT to be invalidated.  And I think this  is  the

point which Mr Low himself agrees with.  Because he said earlier

that  if  we  do  teach our students well in  the  12  years  of

education and through JC, they should have no difficulty  taking

the SAT.  So I am really surprised that he should now raise this

point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I clarify the point that he

mentioned?    I   think  the  Minister  missed   my   point   or

misunderstood me.  I said that, in theory, because we are  using

English as a medium of instruction, the students should not have

difficulty in understanding the language of the SAT1.   But  the

language part where it tests the reasoning of students by  using

pairing  of  words  in English, some of these  words  are  quite

difficult  even for English-educated students.  I think  it  was

mentioned in the feedback by a number of takers, which  appeared

in the Straits Times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question here is, yes, you do have sufficient working

knowledge  of  English and it is sufficient  as  a  tool  to  do

academic  research, but do you have a depth in the  language  to

understand  the  different pairs of words that are  designed  to

test  the  reasoning?  I think it is more than just the language

standard that we are expected here.  As pointed out by the  Dean

of  the  American School here, the language can  be  a  problem.

Because the depth of the language here, generally speaking, may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>

not  be the same as that in America and Britain where they speak

English as a mother tongue.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I am quite confident that

students will be able to manage.  We basically already  have  an

English language based education system.  Our students take most

of  the  subjects  in  the  English language  for  12  years  of

education.  And we do want our students to read widely.   We  do

encourage  them  to  do so.  As a matter of fact,  many  of  our

students  of all academic aptitudes and abilities take  the  SAT

and  do  quite well.  Many of them, after having taken the  SAT,

gained admission to US universities.  So I do not really see the

difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of `A' levels and extra stress and so forth, I

think  there  is  a balance here to be struck.  Today,  the  `A'

level  examination  is a very high stress process.   It  is  one

throw  of  the  dice.   You  take  the  examination  once,   and

everything depends on that examination.  If you want to take  it

again,  or  if you do not do well enough, you have to wait  till

the next year to take it again.  With the SAT, what has happened

basically  is  that there is a wider balance  in  the  selection

criteria.  In effect, what has happened is that the weightage to

the  `A'  levels  has declined in comparison to  all  the  other

factors in the university admission system.  The SAT, of course,

like  any test you take, will have some element of stress.   But

because the SAT is a test which can be taken a number of  times,

it  does not have the quality of a one throw of the dice, as the

`A' level has today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you look at it overall, yes, you could say that there

is  a  balance there.  But it is not clear that it will increase

the  stress  level  and  so on, for the students.   There  is  a

balance to be struck.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I think the Minister would do

well  to  summarise exactly what is the signal and ability  that

SAT  tries  to  achieve, and what signal would it  send  to  the

parents, teachers and students.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low Thia Khiang, we are going a little

out of the topic.  If you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>

want  to  know more, you could raise a Question for Oral Answer.

I  am sure the Minister would be pleased to answer you.  We  are

pressing for time.  We have to move on.  Mr Loh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on the training and

development of principals and teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the rapidly changing work, learning and living

environment, there is the urgency for principals and teachers to

be  well  prepared to guide our students adequately through  the

educational system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent incidents of the Pulau Ubin tragedy and Jin Tai

School suggest that our principals and teachers are still not up

to  the  mark.  They need training in new skill areas to  manage

better in the changing school environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Ministry may review the role of NIE and

restructure  the overall training institutions of the  Education

Ministry  and  to  provide in-service training to  the  existing

teachers.   The Minister could perhaps give us a  brief  of  any

potential changes that will be taking place in that regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many new teachers are being recruited in recent and coming

years.  They are young and energetic and may bring in fresh  new

ideas to the schools.  How do we ensure that their enthusiasm is

not  inhibited  by the time they are posted to the  school?   We

should  take pains to induct the new teachers properly  so  that

the transition from NIE to the school is smooth and welcoming to

the new teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to pay careful attention to the posting of

right  teachers  to  the right schools.   We  should  blend  the

teachers  to  make  them  into  strong  effective  teams.    Any

reshuffling and re-deployment of principals and teachers  should

be  handled  sensitively  so as not to disrupt  and  affect  the

morale  of  the  whole  school.   Though  it  is  important   to

institutionalise  the  school  system  and  not  to  allow   the

`cultist'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>

phenomenon  to  take place, it is important to  appreciate  that

every  school  has  its peculiar traditions  and  character.  We

should allow our schools to develop a distinct identity of their

own  with  local variations to be in sync with the neighbourhood

and the community to which they belong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience is a very valuable asset in teaching. I sense

that  older teachers are leaving service prematurely and  opting

for  early  retirement.  I would equate age  with  maturity  and

wisdom,  and  certainly we need many more wise teachers  in  our

schools.   How can we encourage the very good ones to  serve  as

long  as possible?  Are there ways to engage the senior teachers

in roles and capacities where they can continue to make valuable

contributions to the schools?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have many teachers who have contributed long, loyal

and  faithful  service to our schools.  Have we forgotten  about

their  training  and development needs?  Do we  have  an  active

programme  of  in-service training?  Are the NIE facilities  and

resources   fully   tapped  for  the  long-term   training   and

development of our principals and teachers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognition and reward system is a powerful means to

direct  and encourage a person's behaviour and work performance.

If  we were to encourage principals and teachers to be good role

models  in  life  long  learning,  a  credit  system  should  be

developed  to encourage and recognise them for their efforts  in

self-learning and development.  The main beneficiaries  will  be

our  students.   I hope to have the Minister's comments  on  the

points I have raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, I wish to focus on the specific topic of

teacher training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years we have seen a number of fundamental

changes  in  our  education system in terms  of  focus  and  new

initiatives,  including  IT, National Education  and  creativity

being  some  of the focal points.  This, to me, underscores  the

importance of our teachers being dynamic and up-to-date not just

in their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>

knowledge but also in their pedagogic techniques and methods  in

order  to  keep up with the latest developments in their  field.

This  again  reinforces  the need for  continuous  training  and

learning by teachers in as much as we stress it for our  workers

and students as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know there are training requirements at key

milestone  points  in  the teachers'  career  at  the  point  of

recruitment, the NIE programme and also when they are  about  to

become HODs (Heads of Department) or when they eventually become

principals or vice-principals.  However, I would like to ask the

Minister   what   other  in-service  training   programmes   and

facilities   exist   to  complement  these  milestone   training

requirements.  In particular, are there facilities or programmes

in  place  for  teachers to, for example, learn about  the  best

practices  in school administration or to learn more  about  new

initiatives in pedagogic techniques, or even to just share their

own experiences in professional circles.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether it is a

policy  or  a  kind of administrative requirement that  teachers

spend at least two weeks in a year - that would be approximately

4%  of their time in a year - in training for themselves.   This

is  roughly  the  norm  that is used in the  private  sector  or

business  circles.   I  am curious whether  a  similar  norm  is

adopted in the education system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, 30 years ago, I was

studying in Primary One.  In those days, a rainy day will  bring

me  and  my classmates extra delight because we would be happily

moving  our desks and chairs from one corner to another  corner,

where the roof was not leaking, and we would move our desks  and

chairs  there.  This was because the roof of my alma  mater  was

made  of  attap  leaves.  In the last 30 years we have  achieved

remarkable   economic development.  Today,  I  was  told  by  my

contractor friend that roofs of our school buildings are made of

titanium, a precious metal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very pleased to note that our students are

receiving good education in beautiful country-club-like premises

and  serene  environment.   However, education  is  an  on-going

"heartware" engineering project. It involves heavy investment in

human resources.   Investment in software (Teacher Training)  is

more important than investment in hardware (Building).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Education would place more

emphasis on the  strengthening of our teacher-training programme

and  the  development  of  curriculum.   More  funds  should  be

allocated to fortify our curriculum  packages,   and enhance the

efficacy  of  pedagogy.   Provide more training  and  retraining

opportunities for our teachers.  This will be beneficial to  the

students who are the future masters of our nation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>

<b>Wong):</b> Sir, thank you very much for giving me a chance to come

in  at  this point.  I have been waiting the whole afternoon  to

speak on teacher training because teacher training is absolutely

crucial  to  all  the wonderful things that we talk  about,  the

changes  in  the  education system and the  desired  outcome  of

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the last few speakers for raising

this  matter as well as some earlier speakers, including Dr  Tan

Boon  Wan,  on  the  importance of  teacher  training.   Indeed,

whether we are able to achieve our Desired Outcomes of Education

depends  critically  on teachers in schools  and  to  meet  this

challenge, the Education Service needs to recruit its fair share

of good people and train them to do the job well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House a little bit about the

nature  and  size  of the challenge that the  Education  Service

faces.   Currently,  the  Education Service  has  nearly  24,000

teachers.   To  maintain the current staffing  position,  it  is

estimated  that  MOE would need to recruit an average  of  2,000

teachers  annually  over  the next 10 years  to  compensate  for

retirement and attrition.  The more teachers we can recruit, the

more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>

resources we can give to our schools.  The Ministry has  stepped

up  its  recruitment efforts over the past two years.  For  both

the 1997 and 1998 recruitment cycle, we recruited an average  of

about  2,000 teachers.  These are significantly higher than  the

1,000 we were averaging between 1994 and 1996.  After accounting

for  retirement  and resignations, the net increase  in  teacher

strength in the last two years averaged 650 per year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have plans to recruit 3,000 teachers over the next two

years.  This represents a stepping up of recruitment by 50% over

the  regular  annual intake.  We are making good  progress.   We

have had lawyers, accountants and engineers joining the teaching

profession and many of them, after they have started teaching in

the schools, tell us they find the job immensely challenging and

satisfying.  We certainly hope that as many of them as  possible

will continue to stay with us even when the economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demands on our teachers today are very great. In

recruiting new teachers into the Education Service, we not  only

have  to  look  at the academic credentials, but  also  have  to

assess  their  aptitude  and interest  for  teaching  and  other

factors,  such as character, personality and values.   It  would

not  be  realistic  for  MOE to aim to  recruit  only  from  the

graduate  pool.   NUS  and  NTU currently  produce  about  9,000

graduates each year.  As it is, MOE is already recruiting  about

1,000 graduates each year.  This is about one out of every  nine

graduates.  If we recruit only from the graduate pool, it  would

mean  2,000  out  of 9,000 graduates, or one out  of  every  4.5

graduates.  This would drain the other sectors of the economy of

graduate manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we must have teachers of sufficiently

high   academic  qualifications  so  as  to  uphold   the   high

professional standard of our teachers as well as their  standing

in  the eyes of the parents and the community.  MOE's target  is

to  recruit teachers from the top one third of each cohort.   We

need to set a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>

target  so  that our teachers have standing, as I  said  before,

with  the students, parents and the wider community.  This means

that we will be recruiting from the university graduates and `A'

level  holders  pool  and the academically stronger  polytechnic

diploma  holders.   This would enable us  to  strike  the  right

balance  between minimum qualification and what is realistically

achieveable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of academic credentials, MOE looks at the

applicant's  aptitude  and interest in teaching,  communications

skills and values, and so on.  These are important attributes as

teachers  are  the  role  models for their  students.   We  have

maintained  stringent selection criteria in spite of the  larger

intakes over the last few years.  For example, last year,  1998,

out of 4,000 graduates who applied, only 1,600 were selected, of

whom  about  1,100 eventually took up our offer of  appointment.

However,  recruiting  good people is  only  the  first  step  to

building  a  quality Education Service.  We have to  equip  them

with the right skills, values and attitudes required of teachers

in  Thinking  Schools.  Teacher training  is  therefore  a  very

critical  node  in our entire education system  and  crucial  in

realising our vision of a Learning Nation also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March last year, I chaired a committee comprising senior

MOE  and NIE officials to carry out a fundamental review of  the

teacher  training system.  The objective of this review  was  to

better  prepare teachers to meet future challenges in the  light

of  changes taking place in our education system.  The Committee

has  now  completed  its  work.  Its recommendations  have  been

accepted  by the Ministry and will be gradually introduced  this

year.   I do not intend to go into the detailed recommendations,

but  will instead outline the broad directions proposed  by  the

committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would first like to highlight two key challenges that

our  teachers are facing, given the changes taking place in  our

education system.  First, our teachers need to cope with  a  new

type  of learning environment where the teachers may not  always

know more than the students.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>

Our  students  today  have  access to  a  tremendous  amount  of

information  through  the Internet and other  resources.   Their

learning is no longer confined to the classroom.  Teachers  must

be prepared to explore, experiment and learn together with their

students.   This  is  a departure from the  old  paradigm  where

teachers were dispensers of knowledge.  They must facilitate the

students'  learning,  teach them how to  access  and  critically

evaluate information and how to arrive at solutions to problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, teachers are also role models for their students.

They  need  to exemplify the values and attributes we desire  in

our students.  These are not just about fundamental moral values

as  such.   Our  teachers  must strive  to  be  role  models  in

thinking, learning and innovating.  If we desire our students to

be  inquisitive and think for themselves, then the teachers must

encourage  the  spirit of questioning and  experimentation.   To

help  students develop their different abilities to the fullest,

the  teachers  must know almost instinctively how  to  recognise

those  abilities  in their students in the first  place  and  be

knowledgeable  about  how to help their  students  with  special

talents  or  needs.   In other words, the teacher  must  have  a

different set of teaching skills and a different mindset towards

teaching altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help teachers meet these challenges, my committee has

reviewed  the current teacher training system and come out  with

broad  recommendations which can be categorised into three  main

areas:  (1)  improving initial teacher training; (2) encouraging

teachers   to   continually   upgrade   themselves;   and    (3)

strengthening the partnership between MOE, NIE and schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial teacher training covers two stages - the foundation

training  which the new recruits receive or undergo at NIE,  and

the  induction and on-the-job training that they receive  up  to

the end of their first year in school after graduation from NIE.

The  majority  of  our  trainee teachers  spend  only  one  year

undergoing foundation training in NIE.  In this one year, we not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>

only  have to provide them with pedagogical and content training

but  also  imbue  in  them the values and mindsets  required  of

teachers in the new teaching environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the limited time available, it is not possible for

NIE  to  achieve everything.  We have to prioritise  and  decide

which  components of teacher training are most critical at  this

foundation stage.  If developing the character and motivation of

our students is of utmost importance, then it must be so for our

teachers  also.  Our primary emphasis at the foundation training

stage  should  therefore  be on values education  for  teachers,

followed by knowledge and some core skills and competencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is values education? By values education, we mean a

commitment   to  the  mission  of  the  Education  Service,   an

understanding  and appreciation of the philosophy and  evolution

of  our  education policies, knowledge of national and  regional

issues   that  affect  Singapore,  commitment  to  the   maximal

development of the student as well as commitment to  their  own,

that  is,  the teacher's own continued professional and personal

development.  Towards this end, my committee has drawn up a  set

of  Desired  Outcomes  of Initial Teacher  Training  which  will

henceforth guide the design of the teacher training curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other changes are also having an impact on some programmes

of  the foundation training.  The profile of the intake into the

Education  Service  is changing.  The majority  of  our  trainee

teachers,  about 1,000 to 1,100 out of the 2,000 per  year,  are

graduates  from NUS and NTU, who do a post-graduate  diploma  in

education.   These  form the backbone of our  graduate  teaching

force in the secondary and primary schools.  Together with those

`A'  level recruits who take the BA/BSc cum Diploma in Education

programme  at  NIE (and who number about 100 to 150  per  year),

graduate  teachers constitute roughly 60% to 62% of our  trained

teacher  output  each year.  However, the Diploma  in  Education

(Dip-Ed) course, which takes in both

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>

`A'  level and polytechnic diploma holders, is recruiting  fewer

`A'  level entrants over the years.  This is mainly because  `A'

level  holders now have much more opportunities to pursue either

a university or polytechnic education as compared to before.  As

a  result, more of our new non-graduate teachers are polytechnic

diploma holders.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, we recruited 226 polytechnic diploma holders and

293  `A' level holders for the Dip-Ed course at NIE.  Last year,

the  number  of polytechnic diploma holders recruited  was  436,

almost double the figure two years ago, while the number of  `A'

level  holders has declined by 15%, to about 250.  We can expect

this  trend to continue.  These polytechnic diploma holders will

bring  with  them different strengths and weaknesses from  their

`A'   level  counterparts.   This  means  the  teacher  training

curriculum must be flexible enough to cater to the needs of  the

teacher  trainees with different academic backgrounds.   At  the

same time, we will ensure that the training is rigorous and that

there  is  no  compromise in standards expected of  our  trainee

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides reviewing the curriculum, my Committee has

recommended  that the NIE BA/BSc cum Dip-Ed degree programme  be

re-positioned  to  attract  academically  stronger   polytechnic

diploma holders.  Currently, direct entry into this programme is

restricted   only  to  `A'  level  holders.   There   are   good

polytechnic  diploma holders who may be interested in  teaching.

We  want  to  open up the degree programme to those  polytechnic

diploma  holders who have gone through the NIE Dip-Ed  programme

and   have   taught  in  the  schools  for  a  certain   period,

particularly those who have demonstrated good performance in the

Education Service.  For some polytechnic diploma holders who are

able  to  meet  NIE's pre-requisite requirements,  we  can  even

consider  them  for  direct entry into NIE's  degree  programme.

With more polytechnic diploma holders upgrading

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>

through  degree  programmes,  the  proportion  of  our  graduate

teachers will rise further in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation training alone will not bring teachers fully up

to  the  basic level of competency needed for them  to  function

effectively  in  schools.  MOE and schools  themselves  have  an

important role to play in providing induction and basic training

during  the  teacher's first year in school.  The  Ministry  has

started  centralised  induction training for  all  newly-trained

teachers.   In addition, guidelines are being drawn up  to  help

schools  conduct  their own school-based induction  training  to

attune  the new teachers to their particular school culture  and

ethos.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Committee has recommended that all new teachers be given

four-fifths  of  the normal responsibility load in  their  first

year.  This off-loading of new teachers is in recognition of the

fact that new teachers in their first year have special needs of

adjustment and training and will need time for this.  They  will

only  be given the normal load upon confirmation at the  end  of

their  first  year in school.  The new teachers will  spend  the

released  time on classroom observations of experienced teachers

and undergo on-the-job training, including co-teaching with more

experienced  teachers.  The Ministry will  implement  this  with

effect  from  1st  January  2000,  and  will  factor  this  into

consideration when allocating resources to schools.   The  final

decision on how new teachers are to be off-loaded will rest with

the  principals.  The principals are people on the  ground,  and

they  are  in  a better position to decide how best to  allocate

resources to meet the needs of their teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above initiatives on Initial Teacher Training are aimed

at  providing  teachers  with  a strong  foundation  of  skills,

knowledge  and  values, and helping them to settle  in  the  new

schools comfortably.  In this respect, our senior teachers, whom

Mr  Loh also spoke about, who have accumulated years of teaching

experience,  can  make  a valuable contribution  by  serving  as

mentors, by hand-holding and guiding these new teachers who have

just started their career in teaching in the schools.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come now to the second broad recommendation of my

Committee.  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Iswaran as well as Mr  Loh,

have  spoken  on  the need for in-service or  continual  teacher

training.  Indeed, the skills and knowledge our teachers acquire

at  the initial teacher training stage will not be enough to see

them  through  their entire career.  Our teachers will  need  to

constantly  refresh their skills and knowledge to keep  up  with

the  latest developments in education.  They should see  initial

teacher training and continual teacher training as a continuum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are opening up more opportunities for teachers to pursue

further  studies.  With the liberalisation of  the  Study  Leave

Scheme  in  1998,  384 non-graduate teachers  were  granted  in-principle  approval  to  pursue full-time undergraduate  studies

last  year.  This represents a nearly five-fold increase in  the

numbers  granted approval, compared to the previous years.   But

for the majority of the classroom teachers, upgrading will be in

the  form  of  training  conducted either  by  the  school,  the

cluster,  the  Teachers'  Network  or  NIE.   Our  teachers  are

entitled  to 100 hours of training each year, which is  slightly

more  than  the two weeks of training provided by some companies

as  quoted  by  Mr Iswaran.  We recognise that  there  are  many

demands  placed on the teacher's time today, so  we  are  always

looking  at  various ways to give teachers more time  for  their

professional   development.   We   are   already   stepping   up

recruitment  as much as possible, so that we can  allocate  more

teaching  and non-teaching resources to schools, and  this  will

give  principals more flexibility to meet the training needs  of

the teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Committee has come up with a number of proposals to make

continual  training  more  "teacher-friendly".   First,  courses

will,  in  future, be structured in a more modular  form.   This

will  enable teachers to offer courses in smaller "bites".  They

can  progress at a pace that they are comfortable with.  Second,

continual  training  will,  as far  as  possible,  be  delivered

through distance learning or by having NIE lecturers go down to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>

schools  and  cluster centres to facilitate  training  sessions.

This  is  to minimise inconvenience to the teachers.   Continual

training  will  become very much a part of  a  teacher's  school

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, most continual training courses are offered as

standalone   courses,  which  do  not  lead  to  any   form   of

certification  or  significant  milestones.   My  Committee  has

recommended that an accreditation system be developed to  enable

teachers to gain credits for relevant modules attended, so  that

they  can  eventually chalk up enough credits  for  professional

certification  or higher qualifications.  This is  to  give  due

recognition  to  the  efforts put  in  by  teachers  to  upgrade

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a period of time, we hope to see more of our non-graduate teachers upgrading to degree status, and more graduate

teachers going on to obtain higher qualifications.  This  is  in

line  with  our vision of a Learning Nation, and is  a  positive

development for the entire Education Service.  Not only will  it

enhance the professionalism of our teachers, it will also  boost

the standing and morale of the entire Education Service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, my Committee also studied how we can strengthen

the partnership between MOE, NIE and the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as teachers are role models for their students, NIE

lecturers   are   role  models  for  their   teacher   trainees.

Foundation training in NIE must therefore be a model of the very

same  effective  practices  expected  of  teachers  in  Thinking

Schools.   In  this  way, trainee teachers  will  have  personal

experience  of  the  desired  values  and  attitudes,   creative

teaching methods, the use of educational technology and  so  on,

and  these  trainee teachers will be fully equipped to  practise

the same when they are posted to schools.  At the same time,  as

Mr  Loh so rightly pointed out, there are many new teachers that

we  have recruited into the Education Service.  They bring  with

them  fresh ideas.  We must be open to these ideas, both  within

NIE as well as the school system.  Through suggestion

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>

schemes, the WITs culture, and greater sharing opportunities, we

hope to create an atmosphere, a culture of receptiveness and  an

attitude  of continuous improvement amongst our entire  teaching

force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to help NIE stay closely attuned to the actual

classroom  situation  in schools, my Committee  has  recommended

that  MOE  and  NIE should systematically plan  for  the  cross-posting  of  NIE lecturers and teachers as part of their  career

development, to give them wider exposure to different aspects of

the  education system.  Experienced teachers will be  posted  to

NIE as adjunct lecturers or full-time staff.  NIE lecturers will

also be posted for short stints in MOE HQ or the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, it is important for newly-trained

teachers  to  feel confident that the training  that  they  have

received  in NIE is practical, realistic and prepares them  well

for  the situations they are likely to face in school.  NIE  has

done  a  good  job  thus far, but increasingly  as  our  schools

evolve,  we will need a closer partnership between NIE, MOE  and

schools  to ensure that teacher training keeps in step with  the

rest  of  the  education system.  A joint Committee has  already

been  formed between MOE and NIE, and various working committees

have  started  deliberating on the implementation  details  that

will  bring NIE's curriculum, teaching methods, as well  as  its

organisational  systems and processes to be  in  line  with  our

changing emphasis in teacher training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's success in the 21st century depends on the

ability  of  the  education system to equip our young  with  the

skills,  values  and mindsets to cope with an uncertain  future.

Our  teachers, who have been entrusted with this responsibility,

must  exemplify  these  same attributes. A  strong,  nimble  and

responsive   teacher  training  system  will  be   critical   in

developing  these attributes in our teachers.   I  am  confident

that  the  changes to the teacher training system  that  I  have

outlined, will bring us closer towards

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>

realising  our vision of Thinking Schools, Learning  Nation.   I

believe  I  have also answered many of the points  raised  about

teacher training by Members of this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, many

teachers  are  asking  whether  the  Government  could  consider

allowing   them  to  take  up  some  suitable  part-time   jobs.

Recently,  a  teacher  from the Catholic  Junior  College,  Miss

Annetha Ayyavoo, took part in a Supermodel Pageant overseas  and

won  the First Prize.  When she came back to Singapore, she  was

called up by the Ministry of Education for investigation.   This

is regrettable!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving into the 21st century very soon. If we want

to  transform Singapore into a creative society where "a hundred

flowers bloom", we should be more flexible in dealing with  some

obsolete rules in the Instruction Manuals of our civil servants.

We  should not go by the book.  There should be more flexibility

from time to time.  In my view, as long as it does not harm  the

operation  of  the civil service system and affect  his  or  her

existing  work, a civil servant should be given   more space  to

pursue their hobbies or interests, or to take up part-time jobs.

Only  then can we enable Singaporeans to create a more  creative

social environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, if a teacher wants to take up some part-time jobs,

such as tutors,  textbook writers, textbook vetters or to pursue

their hobbies or jobs that they enjoy doing, they must, first of

all,  get  the approval of the Ministry of Education.  Moreover,

the  remuneration  from their part-time job including  the  fees

paid  to  him for the articles he contributed in the  newspapers

will  have to be surrendered to the Ministry of Education.  This

is  contrary to the Government's effort to promote diligence and

creativity  in  our  people.  If every teacher  is  so  strictly

obedient,  go  by the book for fear of violating any  rules  and

regulations,  then  they will not dare to venture.   They  would

just  refrain  from making new experiments.  Then,  how  are  we

going to cultivate in our students the spirit of creativity?   I

think this is not a good sign.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coincidentally, the Government issued a circular in

November  last year to all civil servants that anyone who  takes

up  a part-time job will have to surrender all his earnings from

the  part-time  job to his department.  I think  the  Government

should  reconsider this matter.  Members of this House  are  not

full-time  MPs, they are part-timers, so to speak.   We  do  not

have   to   surrender  our  allowances  to  our   companies   or

organisations  where  we are supposed to be  working  full-time.

Some  of  our  MPs are teachers.  They do not have to  surrender

their  allowances to the Ministry of Education.  Why then should

civil servants be required to do so?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, teachers in the Government schools are not allowed to

take  up part-time jobs.  However, teachers in the aided-schools

are  allowed  to do so.  Teachers in the Government schools  are

naturally  not  very  happy about it.  I hope  the  Ministry  of

Education can clarify this.  While we are moving towards a  more

creative  Singapore  in  the 21st century,  we  should  be  more

flexible in dealing with the approval of part-time jobs for  our

teachers.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, we can all agree educating

our  children  must  be  the  most important  responsibility  of

parents.   Yet, for obvious practical reasons, we have dedicated

this  role, the most important job, to teachers.  Children spend

a  large part of their lives with their teachers to prepare them

for the world.  With so much information available elsewhere,  I

would  argue that it is possible to get more information outside

school,  or  even perhaps in an encyclopaedia.  But the  teacher

does more, because what you learn in school, you learn in a  way

which  you  cannot  learn  in any other place  or  circumstance.

Teachers  have  a  special  task only  teachers  can  do.   They

inspire,  lead,  guide,  stimulate, and sometimes  to  goad  and

irritate.  In schools, students learn to explore, to inquire, to

ask question and to experiment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers used to occupy a special position in our society.

More often than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>

not,  they were also leaders of the community, and regarded with

respect  and  high  esteem. I, however, suspect  that  over  the

years,  the  special position that teachers  have  occupied  has

somewhat deteriorated.  Worse, I sense that parents are now more

casual  about openly criticising teachers, even in front of  the

children.  I know of parents who are fully equipped with a  list

of  complaints as they prepare to encounter teachers  in  school

during  parents and teachers meeting.  It is becoming common  to

hear  of  parents  wanting to transfer their children  to  other

schools, because they think teachers are not doing a good job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, tuition teachers, most of whom are teachers

themselves,  are better treated and better paid by parents.   We

need  to  do  more  to uplift and enhance the social  status  of

teachers  through national awards and recognition.  Although  we

have  the  National  Day awards, they are  sometimes  not  quite

visible.   Generally, many are still shy of using  their  titles

like  PPM  and  BBM.   Perhaps we can think  of  other  ways  to

recognise good teachers and principals, eg, to appoint  them  to

various Government and social institutions.  But, ultimately, it

is  society,  parents and children themselves  who  should  show

greater  respect for teachers.  I would suggest  that  with  the

beginning  of  every  academic year, it is made  compulsory  for

parents to meet teachers through orientation programmes, so that

they  get to know more of the school and the teachers whom  they

have  entrusted to do this vital job.  It is very much like what

is  done in the SAF for parents of new enlistees.  One day in  a

year  is certainly not too much for parents.  Hopefully, through

such  interaction with parents and better understanding of their

roles  and  the continuous effort and emphasis to recognise  the

good  work  of  teachers,  the social position  and  respect  of

teachers can be put to where they really deserve.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, early childhood education has been

left  primarily  to the private sector with a significant  input

from   the  PAP  Community  Foundation's  kindergarten  centres.

Almost all children

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>

entering  primary  school  have  had  at  least  two  years   in

kindergarten  where  there  is some degree  of  preparation  for

primary   education.   However,  this  preparation  for  primary

education  is  done  at different phase and different  intensity

with  different centres focusing on different things.  Do  these

kindergartens  meet the Ministry of Education's expectations  of

what  they  should  do  to  prepare  the  children  for  primary

education?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, does the Ministry expect the kindergartens

to  prepare  children for primary education?  If  so,  what  are

expected  of  the children who enter primary one?    Considering

the  importance  of pre-primary education as  a  foundation  for

primary  education, it is very important therefore, to  me,  for

the  Ministry  to  issue  clear  guidelines  in  the  areas   of

curriculum  to  all  providers and operators  of  nurseries  and

kindergartens.   If our pre-primary educators and  parents  know

exactly  what the children are expected to know when the  latter

enter  primary  one,  our  children's learning  journey  can  be

smoother.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, as time is running out, allow me to

very briefly respond to the three Members who just spoke.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua said that the Ministry should not stifle

the  creativity  of teachers by requiring its teachers  to  seek

prior  approval before they engage in part-time  work.   I  must

stress  that  teaching  is  a very demanding  profession.   When

people choose to serve as teachers with MOE, we would like  them

to  give full attention, energies and commitment to the job.  My

Ministry  currently allows part-time work on a selective  basis,

and  only on the condition that the teacher's performance is not

affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh said that there is a civil service rule requiring

all civil servants to return the money that they earn from their

part-time work to their departments.  There is no such so-called

rule.   The Public Service Division's circular that he  referred

to  says  that  where  a civil servant uses  official  material,

knowledge, time or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>

resources to help him engage in outside work - say, as an author

writing a book - he would then have to pay the royalties and the

fees  earned  to  his Government department.   But  if  a  civil

servant   is  involved  in  publications  done  in  his  private

capacity,  eg,  work related to his personal hobby  or  interest

that   involves  no  official  material,  knowledge,   time   or

resources,  he  is  allowed to retain the fees  or  remuneration

arising from such work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin spoke about the need for parents

and  the  wider  community  to  accord  more  respect  and  more

appreciation  to  teachers.  I cannot agree with  him  more.   I

think  the  parents  and  the  wider  community  need  to   have

appropriate appreciation for the heavy responsibilities  of  the

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, over the last few years especially, done quite a

lot  to  raise the image and the morale of teachers.  He  talked

about  giving  awards and so on.  Indeed, we do  have  teachers'

awards.   We  have  the Caring Teachers award every  year.   For

Chinese  teachers, we have the Inspiring Chinese Teacher  award.

And  do not forget, we have initiated last year, the President's

Award for Teachers, which is the highest kind of recognition  we

can   give  to  a  teacher  for  his  or  her  contribution  and

performance.   Literally,  there were thousands  of  nominations

submitted  for this President's Award, and this is a  reflection

of  our  teachers' efforts, as well as the fact that  a  lot  of

people  out  there,  in spite of Mr Zulkifli's  perception  that

there seems to be a declining respect for teachers, who want  to

give  due recognition to teachers who have made a difference  to

their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the parent/community relations are concerned, I

think  later  on in the debate, we would have an opportunity  to

talk   about  the  Ministry's  latest  initiative,  ie,  COMPASS

(Community and Parents in Support of Schools).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me respond to Mr Hawazi briefly on early childhood

education.   My Ministry regulates the private kindergartens  by

registering  them, setting curriculum guidelines and accrediting

teacher training.  The kindergartens plan their curriculum based

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>

on  our  guidelines,  which  are focused  on  the  developmental

milestones  of  children at the ages 3 to 5.  MOE believes  that

kindergartens should prepare children for learning, and we  will

be  revising  the  guidelines for early childhood  education  to

ensure  that early childhood - the period that the child  spends

in  kindergarten  -  should be a time when the child learns  and

develops through various activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children in the pre-school years will develop language

use,  understanding  of  numbers, learn  some  good  social  and

personal  habits,  and learn to appreciate  music  and  to  gain

confidence through basic skills, simple sports and  so  on.   My

Ministry  is  looking into spelling out the desired entry  level

competencies for formal schooling, with special attention  being

paid  to  language  development and social and affective  goals.

These  entry level competencies will be realistic and  will  not

require  pupils  to be able to do at the pre-school  stage  what

they will be taught at primary one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, we will be looking into guiding the

kindergartens   further  in  matters  of   curriculum,   teacher

training, quality and so on.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, thank you for your indulgence. I

thought it will be useful to address the point that Mr Low  Thia

Khiang  brought up earlier.  He basically asked  that  with  the

university  admission  system, what do  we  expect  parents  and

students to change?  What values do we expect?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will begin with a little story. I went to Japan in

August  1997,  to  pay  a visit and to understand  the  Japanese

education  system.  They brought me to a high  school,  a  very,

very modern high school, one of the newest high schools in Japan

-   aluminum  finishing,  glass walls  and  so  on.   They  have

wonderful  computer  facilities,  enough  to  make  any  of  our

schools,   which  are  already  very  well  equipped  by   world

standards,  enough  to  make  their  mouths  water.   They  have

wonderful student to computer ratio.  They brought me around the

school.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>

showed  me the laboratories, wonderful facilities.  I  spoke  to

the  physics  teacher and he explained to me  how  he  is  using

experiential  learning  and  so  forth  to  teach  his  students

science,  physics  and  all that.   They  would  go  out  to  do

experiments  in the garden and things like that.   So  I  was  a

little  puzzled.  I asked him, "How do you reconcile  this  with

preparing  your  students  for  the  Tokyo  University  entrance

examinations  system?"  And his reply surprised  me.   He  said,

"Ah,  for  the  students who are preparing  for  the  university

entrance   examinations  system,  we  have  a  more  traditional

syllabus.   This  is  for the students  who  are  not  going  to

university."   That  really took me aback.  I  discovered  later

that  some  three-quarters of the students in  the  school  were

girls.   It is a very new school, innovative curriculum, and  he

explained  to  me that for the girls, it is OK.  For  the  boys,

they  have to prepare them seriously for the university entrance

examination.   So it is too much of a risk to send them  through

this kind of system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the moral of the story, Sir? The moral of the

story  is  that if we stick to our present university  admission

system,  which is based solely on the 'A' levels, one  throw  of

the  dice  on  the 'A' levels, nothing else that we  do  in  the

education  system makes a difference.  Parents and the  students

will  continue to focus their efforts on getting that extra mark

in  the 'A' levels.  ECA and all the other things do not matter.

What do we hope to see with the new university admission system,

which  I  stress  again, goes beyond adding  in  the  SAT1?   It

includes  adding in ECA and project work.  What do  we  hope  to

see?  We hope to have a more balanced system, a system which  is

more  aligned with achieving the Desired Outcomes of  Education,

and  a  system  which  recognises  effort,  discipline,  content

knowledge via the `A' levels; which recognises reasoning ability

and  a  more  general  ability  of  the  student  to  cope  with

university  education, via SAT1 even though he may not  have  As

for  his  `A'  levels.   ECA,  where  we  have  EQ,  leadership,

tenacity,   the   ability   to  face   difficult   and   unusual

circumstances;  project  work,  where  again  things  like   EQ,

application of knowledge, team work and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>

so  on.   So,  what  we  are looking for is  a  broad  range  of

attributes  which we want our students to have.  If  we  do  not

change our university admission system, nothing else that we are

trying to do in the education system is going to work.
