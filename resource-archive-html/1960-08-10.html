<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

behalf  of  the  Government at the opening  of  the

present  session  of  this Assembly.".'-(The  Prime

Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will continue with the  speech

which I started yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of this debate, the Member for

Hong  Lim  accused  the Government  of  failing  to

implement  democratic practices. Before the  Member

for Hong Lim introduced his 16



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



resolutions into this House, I personally know that

these  16  resolutions brought up by the  Hong  Lim

Branch  were  read out by the hon.  Member  at  our

Party  Conference. The resolutions  were  rejected.

Subsequently the hon. Member again raised the issue

of  the 16 resolutions at the Badminton Hall  rally

where  he  made accusations against the Government.

At  the same time, he boasted that he was the  real

fighter  for the detainees and for the interest  of

the trade union movement in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really amused at the

antics of the Member for Hong Lim. If he is so very

much concerned about the deregistration of the four

unions  and  the  detainees. I would  like  him  to

answer  this question: when did he start  to  fight

for  the  welfare of the detainees  and  the  trade

union movement? Has he ever undergone the hardships

experienced  by  the trade union movement?  Has  he

ever gone through the experience of being detained?

Anybody  can  give the answer, Mr Speaker - that  he

has not experienced all that. This is an attempt on

his  part  to  gain  power for  his  own  ends,  by

hoodwinking  the people of Singapore. I  know  full

well,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, about  the  circumstances

relating  to the deregistration of the unions,  the

trade  union movement in Singapore as a whole,  and

the  position  of the detainees,  as  I  have  been

personally detained on two occasions in  the  past.

The Singapore Trades Union Congress interviewed the

Minister for Labour and Law and exchanged views  on

the four deregistered unions, after which they were

satisfied.  Before the Member for Hong  Lim  raised

this  issue,  we from the S.T.U.C. and  the  other

unions  had  already submitted  our  views  to  the

Minister  for  Labour and Law. But the  Member  for

Hong  Lim - Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not  want  to  use

unparliamentary  words as I may  be  asked  to  sit

down - might  have borrowed or stolen  the  views  of

other  trade unions. I still remember a story  told

to me when I was at school about Sang Kanchil and a

heron.  Sang Kanchil is very intelligent  and  wily

and  can outwit all the other animals. But all  the

same, he has one weakness - his insincerity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>





Although  he  is  wily,  he is  insincere.  Tigers,

elephants  and crocodiles can be outwitted  by  the

wiliness of Sang Kanchil. The story goes like this.

One  day,  he asked a heron to cross a river  on  a

river crate with him with the thought of outwitting

the heron. When Sam Kanchil felt sure that he could

manage  to get across safely to the other side,  he

caused the river crate to sink. The result was that

Sang Kanchil was drowned but the heron was able  to

fly  to  safety. This is analogous to an  insincere

man  who will ultimately drown himself. I hope that

the  labour  movement and the people  of  Singapore

will not be confused by the 16 resolutions. We must

be  on  guard against any action initiated  by  the

Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to refer to

the  speech  of  the  Member for  Aljunied.  I  was

shocked  to hear the blind accusations of the  hon.

Member  against the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for National Development. He accused  the

Parliamentary Secretary of trying to win  over  the

constituents  of the Southern Islands  so  that  he

would be successful as a candidate for that ward in

the  next general elections. Sir, this is like  the

story  I  related just now about Sang Kanchil.  The

members  of  the P.A.P. do not go about their  work

with a view to offering themselves as candidates in

the  next  general elections. This is a  false  and

nonsensical  accusation calculated to  confuse  the

people.  Can  the Member for Aljunied  substantiate

his  accusation  that  the Parliamentary  Secretary

invited the peng-hulus of the Southern Islands  and

told  them that it was his intention to stand as  a

candidate  for  that  ward in  the  coming  general

elections?   If   he   cannot   substantiate    his

accusation, then it is false. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

think  the  hon.  Member has run out  of  ideas  to

further   confuse  the  minds  of  the  people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party will constantly be on

the  look-out  against any activities initiated  by

the   Member  for  Hong  Lim  and  the  Member  for

Aljunied.  We  will  continue to  oppose  insincere

leaders in the interest of the people as a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, for the past few days,  I  have

been  listening to the speeches of Members  of  the

Opposition.  All  of these speeches  are  feats  of

acrobatics    showing   purposeful    abstruseness,

distortion   of  Government's  policies   and   the

creation of disharmony. Since the formation of  our

Party,  we  have never deviated from our consistent

stand.  We  have  been expressing  our  independent

character and have never been controlled by others.

Before  the general election, the P.A.P. had  told

the  people that it was non-Communist. We  did  not

conceal  our policies and we have been trustworthy.

During  the general election, we were also  telling

the  people that we were non-Communist in order  to

win over the people. The situation in Singapore has

been  fundamentally secure since  the  P.A.P. took

over  the  government  after  its  victory  in  the

election  14 months ago. This fact shows  that  the

P.A.P. policies  are  successful  and  right.  The

former  Chief  Minister. Mr Lim Yew Hock  has  not

remembered  this  fact  and  does  not  absorb  our

experience. On the contrary, he still wants  to  go

back   to   the  road  of  anti-people   and   pro-colonialism. He has been very stubborn and has  not

reflected  on  the  lesson of the  failure  of  his

S.P.A. even  up  to the present moment.  Now,  the

Member  for  Cairnhill wants to pull  us  into  the

water and make us go along his old road of failure.

Since we have expressed our non-Communist attitude,

we  will never change it, no matter what misleading

and  challenging  words we may encounter  from  the

Opposition Members. Our present task is to seek the

welfare  of the people and serve them in  a  better

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has become very

belligerent and challenges us to a light in the by-elections.  The people are not interested  in  this

and  it is, in fact, wasting people's resources and

energy. We will not be so childish as to do this. I

would  like  to  ask the Member for Cairnhill  why

does he want to drag us into the water and what  is

his motive in wanting us to be anti-Communist? He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



wants to have an effortless gain by making us  fail

in  our pledge by betraying the people and creating

disorder.  Is this not a naive fancy  of  his?  Mr

Speaker, the Member for Cairnhill talks a lot about

anti-Communism, and is very much interested because

he  wants  to  become a hero of the  anti-Communist

movement  in  Singapore,  thereby  earning  another

title  for that, like the one he has received  from

the  Federation of Malaya. Even if he should obtain

a  title  for  being  a hero of the  anti-Communist

movement,  would  it  benefit the  welfare  of  the

people and solve the unemployment problem? Could he

achieve results by being just anti-Communist?  What

the  people, both the Chinese and English-educated,

are  greatly concerned is whether there is security

of  livelihood and the possibility of  solving  the

unemployment  problem, and not merely the  question

of  whether  the  State is anti-Communist  or  pro-Communist. The road that the Government  is  taking

is  the  most practical road, that is, to find  out

ways and means to create situations for the purpose

of  solving  the unemployment problem and  to  look

after  the  livelihood of the  people.  This  is  a

practical   and  effective  way  of  checking   the

development of pro-Communist activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the speech of the Member for Cairnhill is lengthy, but it has not expressed any

anti-colonial   feelings  at  all.   Many   of   my

colleagues have clarified that we are not tools  of

either  the colonialists or the Communists,  and  I

doubt whether the Member for Cairnhill himself is a

tool of the colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, after hearing the speeches of the Members of the Opposition, I am of the opinion that

they   have   not   contributed  any   constructive

criticisms  of Government's policies. An Opposition

Member's responsibility is to speak for the  people

and   to  make  useful  suggestions  to  raise  the

standard  of living and welfare of the people,  and

not  simply to oppose this and oppose that. Members

of  the Opposition have not done this. For the past

few  days,  their lengthy speeches are  misleading,

and their purpose is to make political capital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



out  of them. They have not even suggested how  the

basic  problems may be solved. For example,  a  few

days ago, the Member for Joo Chiat said that he had

reared  chickens.  Does he mean  to  say  that,  by

having  reared  chickens, he is a qualified  farmer

and   understands  the  hardship  of  the  farmers?

Deceiving  people by this means does not amount  to

an  expression of concern for the farmers. In fact,

the  farmers  already know how  to  increase  their

production. The problem is how best to market their

products. This is also a problem of rural  economy,

and  a problem relating to land. He did not mention

all  this. So, let me remind him that without going

to  the farmers and without knowing their hardship,

one  cannot serve the farmers. The Member  for  Joo

Chiat said that Japanese hens and leghorns can  lay

about  240  to 280 eggs per year. The Deputy  Prime

Minister has touched on this. But I would  like  to

point out his childish, political cheating -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I heard the

expression "childish, political cheating". If  that

is so, then, of course, that is an expression which

should  not  be used. Perhaps the hon.  Member  can

assure me that that was not the expression he used.

If  it  is  the  expression he used, then  he  must

withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think, Mr

Speaker, just now I was -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I have a reply? If the

expression "childish, political cheating" was used,

then  it  has to be withdrawn. If it was not  used,

then  the hon. Member can tell me that it  was  not

the expression used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  withdraw  the  words "childish,  political

cheating".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the farmers have reared

these  two  breeds  of chicken. Because  the  local

climate is different, these hens cannot lay as many

eggs  as the Member for Joo Chiat claimed. The  egg

production  is, what the Deputy Prime Minister  has

said, about 260 a year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out here that the Deputy Prime

Minister's  speech  is based on  facts  taken  from

books.  We  must know that in Australia and  Japan.

the  climate is different from ours, and this yield

of  egg  production  is possible.  But  over  here,

because  of our climate, we cannot expect the  same

results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that the Opposition Members are weak in their judgment. The correctness

of the Prime Minister's judgment can be proved here

by all these facts.



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, at the Assembly sitting a

few  days  ago the Member for Tanglin, among  other

things, complained like a babbling old man that too

much  time  had  been wasted in  this  Assembly  in

debating  the  internal  matters  of  the  People's

Action  Party. Besides that, the hon.  Member  also

complained  that  the  analysis  of  the  political

situation in Singapore, as presented in the  speech

of  the Prime Minister the other day, confused  him

and  that he did not understand the analysis.  Sir,

in fact, the Member for Tanglin said that he wanted

to  know the significance of that part of the Prime

Minister's speech which reads [Hansard, 3rd August, 1960, col. 64]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What is the worst that can happen in the

immediate future for us as a Government? it is that

the  Government may find itself out-maneuvered  and

out-propagandaed by these Left-wing adventurers, in

which  case the P.A.P. will have to take the  count

in  this  fight, and the Communists will be counted

out for many years to come.'



<br><br>It  would  appear  that he did not  comprehend  the

meaning  of  that statement of the Prime  Minister,

that it is the business of the Government to ensure

that  if a collision is to take place between these

Left-wing   adventurers   and   the   colonialists-imperialists,  the P.A.P. should let  them  break

their heads on each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully convinced that the Member for Tanglin

did  not  understand  and was confused  about  such

matters,  because his inability to  comprehend  has

already become chronic, and the reason



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



is  not  difficult to seek. His whole  intellectual

approach  operates  on the old  wave-length,  which

means  it  cannot receive messages about happenings

in  our country which are being sent on a new wave-length.  His approach to our problems still  clings

on  along  political  lines of the  pre-Rendel  and

Progressive  Party era. It is too well  known  that

during those years political questions were decided

by  tete-a-tetes with the colonial governors and at

cocktail parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin ought to realise that

times  have changed. We have moved on to an age  of

mass  politics.  The  social  forces  which  decide

political  problems now move and act in ways  which

are  no  longer similar to those found in the  pre-Rendel  years. Mr Speaker, Sir, for  example,  the

attitude  of  the Member for Tanglin  to  political

parties  is  typical of the approach of politicians

in  that age. The pre-Rendel political parties,  as

exemplified   by   the   Progressive   Party,   the

Democratic   Party,   later  the  Liberal-Socialist

Party,  and the Labour Front have no roots  in  the

people. The leaders of those political parties  did

not reflect major political forces. As such, splits

and dissensions within those parties had little  or

no  impact on the political life outside their  own

ranks. The P.A.P. on the other hand, because of its

deeper  roots in the political life of the  people,

therefore  mirrors the line up of political  forces

as they really exist in Singapore. It is clear that

the  Ong  Eng Guan affair is important  and  merits

attention  in so far as it provides an  opportunity

for forces which have been referred to as Left-wing

adventurers    to   challenge   the   non-communist

socialist approach of the P.A.P. Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, allow me to give a more frank elucidation. The line-up of forces in this Assembly

does  not  actually mirror the political forces  in

this country. The decisive political manoeuvres are

taken  either on this side of the House or  outside

the  Assembly. The alternative force to the  P.A.P.

cannot be found in any of the political parties  or

individuals represented on that side of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this claim is not arrogance on our part. It is a statement of fact. Perhaps by now

Members of the Opposition are able to see that  the

Prime Minister's analysis when he opened the debate

on  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's policy  statement

itself shows that both the actions and speeches  of

Government are designed primarily to influence  and

manoeuvre  against  political forces  outside  this

Assembly.  In this Assembly yesterday, it  appeared

to  me  that  the  Member for Joo  Chiat,  who  had

maintained a self-imposed silence for the  last  14

months, and who had himself claimed that he had not

been  deaf  nor  blind  during  that  period,   had

admitted that there is no alternative to the P.A.P.

at  present. But, of course, it does not matter two

hoots  to  us  even if the Member for  Tanglin  and

others  do  not  make this admission,  because  the

actions  of the People's Action Party are based  on

facts  and  the  truth regardless of whether  other

people admit them or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the opposition forces we have to contend with are the opposition Members, then our

task   would   be   a  very  simple   one   indeed.

Unfortunately, the position today is not so. I have

explained about the position of the S.P.A. members

and the Member for Hong Lim can only be looked upon

as  a puppet being used to further the ends of  the

people outside this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be clear to everybody that the issue

before us is whether or not non-Communist socialism

can  succeed  in our country. If the  non-Communist

socialist  system based on parliamentary  democracy

fails,   then   the  alternatives  are   either   a

resurgence  of  colonialism  or  a  resurgence   of

rebellious  violence. I trust the whole  Opposition

will understand what I have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the other day, the Member for the Southern Islands touched on the question of merger.

My  apologies  here.  It seems  that  he  does  not

understand  that the communal problem, the  problem

of uniting the various races into one strong united

Malayan nation, is a problem which not only must be

faced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



and  solved by the Singapore Government alone.  The

truth  is  that that problem is similarly faced  by

the   Federation  Government  also.  The   Alliance

Government  in the Federation of Malaya is  busying

itself  with  various ways and means so  that  non-Malays, which number almost 50 per cent there, will

show  their undivided loyalty towards this country.

Briefly,  if  the communal problem  can  be  solved

slowly  in  the  Federation, it  follows  that  the

communal problem in Singapore will follow suit.  In

fact,  in  as much as the Federation Government  is

constantly   anxious  and  vigilant,  I   repeat - is

constantly  anxious and vigilant in regard  to  the

doings  of  Malay  or non-Malay  communalists  over

there,  the P.A.P. Government in Singapore  is, no

less  vigilant  and  alert  towards  all  types  of

communalists and Chauvinists in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a dedicated and revolutionary Government

comes into power at the close of a colonial era, we

must  all, including the honourable Members of  the

Opposition,  expect  to  find  drastic  alterations

taking place to change the emphasis of the services

provided  for  the people, and also  the  speed  at

which  old  ways are to give place to  new.  As  an

honest Government, the P.A.P. has already admitted,

in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, that errors

and  mistakes took place as a result of  our  early

zeal.  But  it  would be wrong  to  let  our  self-admitted mistakes entirely overshadow the very real

advantages of the swift moving changes and policies

in  our  first  year of office. A feature  of  that

first  year  has  been  the  time  given  over   to

planning. I am sure Members of the Opposition  must

agree that any sensible Government should plan, and

that  the  effective implementation  of  Government

policies for the good of the people as a whole  are

only  likely  to  yield good results  if  based  on

careful  thinking and careful planning  right  from

the blueprint stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to indicate some of the

achievements  of the first year as they  affect  my

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of emphasis from the curative to the

preventive aspects has taken place in several ways.

Legislation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



for  compulsory immunisation against Diphtheria and

the   compulsory  vaccination  of  school  children

against   Tuberculosis  will  help  to  spread   an

awareness  of  the need to control  these  diseases

among  the  younger population. Immunisation  among

very  small  children through Maternity  and  Child

Health  Clinics was stepped up against  Diphtheria.

Whooping  Cough, Tetanus, Small-Pox, and  T.B.  In

spite of rapid changes, the Ministry managed to  do

30,000  Diphtheria immunisation and  60,000  B.C.G.

vaccinations  during  the year.  In  addition,  Mr

Speaker, some 60,000 Tuberculin tests were made  as

the   voluntary   campaign  among  primary   school

children was intensified. I am sure we are all glad

that the absence of the so-called tropical diseases

has continued during the year and that Singapore is

free   from  Cholera,  Plague,  Yellow  Fever  anti

Malaria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ante-natal and post-natal services were

intensified   in  25  Maternal  and  Child   Health

Clinics,   22  Visiting  Centres  and   8   Village

Midwifery  Centres. Of these, some 28  are  in  the

rural areas and we shall continue to encourage home

confinements among the city and rural population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mass Health Education Campaigns, we

all  know  that a Blood Donation campaign organised

by  the  Ministry registered 6,000  donors  out  of

which  2,500  have already donated  blood.  Studies

were  made  for  the  implementation  of  a  Family

Planning  Campaign and plans are well  advanced  to

stimulate intelligent planned parenthood among  the

adult population. During the past year plans for  a

Mass  Health Education Campaign to cover nutrition,

maternal  and  infant care have been completed  and

these  should  be implemented within  a  reasonable

period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be glad to hear of our efforts to

eliminate  obvious  inadequacies  existing  in  the

Health  Services.  Integration of Government,  City

Council  and  Rural Board Services has  reached  an

advanced  stage.  The  Thomson  Road  Hospital  now

operates as a general hospital for acute cases, and

it  is  only  a  matter of time  before  the  whole

hospital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



is  fully functioning in the service of the people.

Two  new Out-patient Clinics have been prepared  at

Jalan Kayu and Lim Ah Pin Road, and both will  help

in  relieving the pressure eventually on  the  Out-patient   Service  in  the  General  Hospital.   In

changing   the   functions  of  the  Thomson   Road

Hospital,  we have not forgotten the chronic  sick.

The   renovation  of  four  blocks  at  Wood-bridge

Hospital to house this unfortunate category of  the

sick has been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to remind Members that TB, is still

our  greatest scourge. The Report of a Pilot Survey

conducted under the Colombo Plan, was completed  in

1959  and set the incidence at 3.7 per cent of  the

population  in this country. On my instructions,  a

Committee enquired into the incidence of T.B. among

industrial    occupations.    Unfortunately, the

Committee  was  unable to relate  specifically  the

incidence of the disease to particular occupations,

but  the  Committee's labours have  indicated  what

kind  of data is lacking before preventive measures

can  be devised. We are now making arrangements for

the  necessary data to be obtained in a Mass  X-ray

Campaign planned for the end of this year.  I  have

already   mentioned  legislation  to   compel   the

vaccination of our children. Members will  be  glad

to  know that every baby born in the Kandang Kerbau

Maternity  Hospital is vaccinated  with  B.C.G. as

soon  as possible after birth, provided the  parent

agrees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ample opportunities for staff training were

offered  during  the year and the courses  selected

for  training will help raise the standard  of  our

Medical Services and also assist our talented staff

to   obtain  higher  qualifications  of   a   world

standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By example, precept and instruction, we have

sought  to  ensure  that  kindness,  courtesy   and

consideration to patients and the public  is  given

in  all  hospitals and provided at all  Out-patient

Clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech has mentioned

our  efforts to recruit Chinese and Malay  educated

persons  into  the Nursing and Midwifery  Services.

This policy will be continued.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Parliamentary Secretary has given an

indication  that  we will make efforts  to  recruit

doctors from overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection let me quote from the P.A.P.

Election Manifesto. We said last year:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It cannot be denied that in Singapore the

medical  situation  leaves  room  for  improvement.

There are six Government hospitals, 650 doctors, of

whom  350  are private practitioners. The ratio  of

population  to doctors is about 2,300  persons  per

doctor.  This compares unfavourably with Japan,  as

well  as with advanced western countries. With  the

rapid increase in population special steps would be

taken to increase the output of doctors in the next

few years...'



<br><br>and again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The number of doctors produced each year by the

University  of Malaya is not sufficient to  sustain

the  rates of expansion envisaged in our programme.

As  will be seen, a large number of doctors will be

required to staff the district hospitals, a chronic

hospital   and  a  network  of  people's   clinics.

Accordingly, it will be necessary to import doctors

from  abroad  and  from available information,  the

best   sources  of  recruitment  would  be  Western

Germany, Japan, India and Hong Kong.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have been informed, we have had

negotiations   with  the  representative   of   the

Japanese Government and as a result, we shall  have

available,  at  our  service, 27 Japanese  doctors.

These  Japanese  doctors  shall  be  on  two  years

contract  to  the  Government of  Singapore;  their

passage fares to and from Japan shall be met by the

Japanese Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that those doctors shall be made

available for service in Singapore before  the  end

of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to announce that the Singapore

Government has been in close consultation with  the

Government of Israel with a view to enlisting their

assistance in order to improve the Health  Services

in   Singapore.  The  Government  of   Israel   has

expressed  its  willingness to  assist  us  in  the

supply of Specialists, and has also offered two  or

three places in the Hebrew College of Medicine  for

Singapore citizens wishing to take up undergraduate

courses.   Two  Israeli  Professors,  Prof.   Moshe

Rachmilewitz, Prof. of Medicine, Dean of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



Hebrew University, and Prof. Prywes, Associate Dean

of  the Hebrew University, are now in Singapore for

a  two-week  stay  to appraise for  themselves  the

medical facilities available in Singapore prior  to

the  Government of Israel sending their specialists

to work here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Israel has also stated that it

would  like to send out a Medical Research Unit  to

work  in collaboration both with the Government  of

Singapore   and  the  University  of  Malaya.   The

University of Malaya has expressed its desire to co-operate  with the Medical Team that the  Government

of Israel wishes to send out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has also received

applications  from  medical  officers  from  India,

Ceylon  and  other  Commonwealth  countries.  These

applications are being considered and it  is  hoped

that by the end of the year at least twenty Medical

Officers   shall  be  recruited  from  Commonwealth

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this recruitment the present pressure of

work   upon   our  doctors  would  be  considerably

relieved  and a far higher standard of patient-care

would be achieved. In addition, the recruitment  of

doctors  from overseas countries would  enable  the

Ministry  to  proceed  with the  expansion  of  the

health  services,  i.e. the  full  occupation   of

Thomson  Road  Hospital, the  occupation  of  eight

vacant  wards  at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and  the

occupation  of  the  new  Gynaecological  Block  at

Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the presence of doctors from

overseas will enable the Government of Singapore to

release   more   local  doctors  for  post-graduate

studies.  More  scholarships will be  provided  for

local doctors for such studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are 25 local doctors on post-graduate study courses in the United Kingdom and

Australia.  It  is  my intention to  provide  every

facility for local doctors to proceed overseas  for

post-graduate study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health is giving close attention

to its development projects and the planning out of

its  staff  training programme. It can be  expected

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



standard  of  medical care in the  State  would  be

considerably improved by about the middle  of  next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have limited myself to the cold hard facts of

planning and achievements during the course of  the

year. Let these speak for themselves as our efforts

in  the coming year will, I am confident, speak for

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I now come to the accusation that has been levelled against the Government by the

Member  for  Cairnhill. I fail  to  understand  the

Member for Cairnhill. He has misled this House  and

attempted to mislead the public by saying that  the

Parliamentary    Secretary   has   ridiculed    the

conferment  of the honour and title "Tun".  I  have

been closely following the speeches of Members.  It

might  be that he was basing his speech on  rumours

outside.  I  would like to deny categorically  here

the  accusation  made by the Member for  Cairnhill,

because  there  was not a single  Member  from  the

Government  side  who had derided the  honours  and

titles of the Federation Government. I know it  was

only  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  National Development who spoke in reply to the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan, that if  the  Prime

Minister  had declared his unequivocal stand  as  a

non-Communist, he might have been conferred a title

as  had  been  conferred on the ex-Chief  Minister.

This  was the statement made in this Assembly.  The

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

National Development has clearly reiterated our non-Communist  stand. He has also explained that  every

fighter  in the struggle for freedom does not  hope

to receive or seek honours and titles from the sky.

It is hoped that the fruits of our struggle will be

of benefit to the people as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, I was surprised to

hear  the  Member  for Aljunied when  he  read  his

speech like a schoolboy and defended his colleague,

the  Member  for  Hong Lim. The programme  for  the

Southern  Islands was initiated by  the  man  whose

name has been mentioned in this Assembly, that  is,

Mr Meadows. Then the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



Aljunied  went  on  to show the  sincerity  of  the

Member  for Hong Lim who is said to have  allocated

$200,000   for  the  development  of  the  Southern

Islands,  which is now being looked  after  by  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

National Development. I would like to say  that  at

the   beginning  of  this  year  the  Parliamentary

Secretary offered the services of two graduates  of

the    University   of   Malaya   to   carry    out

investigations in a voluntary capacity and to  draw

up a scheme in order to assist the fishermen of the

Southern Islands. What did the Member for Hong Lim,

who  was the Minister for National Development, say

at that time? He rejected the offer with the excuse

that  there was no money and that the sum allocated

was  not  for the Southern Islands. In  April  this

year,  Mr  Speaker, it was only after this  matter

had  been  discussed  at  the  Executive  Committee

meeting  of the P.A.P. that the Minister agreed  to

set  aside  the sum of $200,000 which was mentioned

by  the  Member  for Aljunied. He  is  not  in  the

Executive  Committee. Therefore, he does  not  know

what  he  is  talking  about  and  he  only  mouths

whatever  is  fed to him. A scheme  to  help  Malay

fishermen  by  way  of giving  them  she-goats  has

already  been submitted to the acting Minister  for

National  Development,  as  was  mentioned  in  the

speech of the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday. I am

really  sorry for the Member for Kampong  Kembangan

and  the  Member for Geylang Serai  on  account  of

their short-sighted view on the subject of culture.

It   is  a  well-known  fact  that  culture  is  an

influencing   factor  in  the   livelihood   of   a

community. The term `culture' can be defined as the

mode   of   living  of  a  people,  embracing   its

political,  economic and social systems. Therefore,

if  Malay culture were to be made the basis  for  a

national  culture,  in  the political  sphere,  for

instance,  then  we  would  have  to  dissolve  our

Legislative  Assembly;  we  would  have  to  reject

parliamentary democracy in its entirety as it is  a

political concept which is imported from the  West;

the  labour unions would have to be banned in  this

country  as  this is another social  concept  which

originated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



from  the West. If it was insisted upon that  Malay

culture  should  be the core in all these  cultural

fields, then it would mean that we would have to go

back  to the era of 200, 300, or 400 years ago when

there  were neither elected legislatures nor labour

unions.   Is  that  what  the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan is striving for?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter of the National Assembly - which is the

outcome  of  the  Cultural Congress  of  Malaya - has

enunciated    five    cultural    precepts,    i.e.

nationalism,   sovereignty,  unity   of   language,

kinship and religion. The characteristics are (a) a

movement for a Malayan national culture germinating

freely from the people, (b) the movement taking the

form  of  organisations or efforts from  individual

skill, and (c) activities in the fields of economy,

politics, sociology and art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps their intention is merely that the Malay

language  should be the basis of national  literary

and  dramatic  art. If that be the case,  then  the

advice  of  the  Member  for Kampong  Kembangan  is

superfluous   for  the  reason  that   the   P.A.P.

Government   has  already  recognised   the   Malay

language  as the national language of this country,

and in the future Malayan literature will certainly

be  based  on  the Malay language as  the  national

language,  because `Language is  the  soul  of  the

nation'.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I fully support the  address  of

the  Prime  Minister thanking the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  for  his  speech in this  Assembly  on  the

opening day of this session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is it the intention of the

Opposition  that the P.A.P. Government should  have

done  everything  in  the interest  of  the  people

within the short space of the last 14 months?  This

is  not  possible  because the  protection  of  the

interest  of  l½  million people is  not  something

light.  The Opposition should not be so  unjust  in

their  accusations against us on this side  of  the

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill yesterday issued a

challenge   to  the  Government  to  hold   general

elections now. Does the hon. Member think  that  we

are  foolish  enough to ignore the  wishes  of  the

people who have voted us in? The holding of general

elections costs a lot of money and this money could

very well be used in the interest of the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill and the

Member   for   Tanglin  said  that  the  Government

recruited  P.A.P. members into the Work Brigade.  I

refute this accusation very strongly because it  is

not   true.  We  took  in  anybody  who   made   an

application. We did not take in only members of the

P.A.P.  We,  as representatives of the people,  who

hold  power today believe in unity and we  are  not

afraid  of telling the truth, of the good  that  we

have done for the people as a whole during the past

14  months, and of the plans for the future because

we   are   always  working  and  not  just  sitting

comfortably  in  this  House. The  Opposition  have

criticised us as much as they want to but deep down

in  their hearts they know that we on this side  of

the  House  have  done  many  good  things  in  the

interest  of the people during the past 14  months.

We are prepared to listen to the criticisms and the

views  put forward by the Opposition. Mr  Speaker.

Sir,  sometimes a bitter pill makes good  medicine.

We will carry on and do our duty in the interest of

the people as a whole, and not in the interest of a

minor  section of the people. We will not go  about

it in a blind way to the detriment of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember that during a round-table conference on self-government for Singapore,

U.M.N.O. demanded through its representatives, the

Member for Geylang Serai and the Member for Kampong

Kembangan, that there should be a provision in  the

Constitution to the effect that Malay should be the

national  language.  In  an  emergency  meeting  of

U.M.N.O. it was decided that this was an  internal

affair  and that a provision to that effect  should

not be put into the Constitution. We have said that

Malay is the national language of this country, and

this has immediately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



been  implemented  when the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

delivered  his speech last year. What then  is  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan worried about?  Is  he

trying  to win over the Malays in the same  way  as

the  16  resolutions put up by the Member for  Hong

Lim?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for the Southern

Islands said that he was not satisfied with the aid

given  to the Malays in the field of education.  He

said that the British Government had given help  by

instituting special Malay classes. It appears  that

the  hon.  Member still thinks about  the  days  of

colonialism. Is it not a fact that since  the  time

of Sir Stamford Raffles, only primary Malay schools

were  established in Singapore and that  there  has

not  been a single secondary Malay school  at  all?

Has  the  hon.  Member forgotten that Malay  school

children  have been regarded as "stepsons"?  Is  he

trying  to  gain the confidence of  the  Malays  by

trying  to close his eyes to the real situation  in

the country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we on this side of the House,

who  are  voluntary workers in the field of health,

know  that  the last one year has been  a  year  of

planning;  but  it has also been  a  year  of  many

changes for the people in the rural areas. In  this

connection,   maternity  hospitals,  child   health

centres,   anti-natal  care  clinics  for  pregnant

mothers and post-natal care clinics for mothers and

infants  have  been  provided.  There  are  27  big

clinics, 22 visiting centres, 8 centres for village

midwifery  service,  and 20 clinics  in  the  rural

areas.  In  addition, village  midwives  have  been

stationed  in  28  clinics in the rural  and  urban

areas. These clinics are open to all the people  at

all  times.  Advice is given to the people  in  the

villages about health matters and mothers are  told

how  and  where  to be treated. Serious  cases  are

referred  to the Kandang Kerbau Maternity  Hospital

for special treatment. The Government will continue

to  build more health centres in areas where it  is

considered to be necessary. Mr Speaker, Sir,  more

clinics,   out-patient  departments  and   district

hospitals, which will enable the villagers  to  get

medical treatment will be built in the rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our health service programmes the needs of the

people in Malay kampongs will not be neglected  and

efforts will be made to send fully qualified  Malay

midwives and nurses to help the villagers.  In  the

villages   where   Malays  are  predominant,   many

opportunities have been offered during the last one

year  to  Malay  girls with Malay school  education

wanting to become midwives and nurses. This  policy

will  be carried out and will encourage more people

to  make full use of the opportunities. This is our

policy on health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we will not sit down quietly

but  we will continue with our work for the benefit

of  the  people  because we are the representatives

elected by the people.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite of its colonial

past  and  certain  existing  objective  conditions

beyond  the control of the Government, the  process

of transforming the Police Force into a popular and

friendly  force to safeguard the interests  of  the

people has made progress in the last 14 months  and

will  continue  in the year ahead. Apart  from  the

efforts  of the Assemblymen in bringing the  people

and the Police together through periodical meetings

and  the organisation of vigilante corps, the  keen

response to join the Police recently by youths from

the  Chinese-educated  stream  in  particular,  has

helped to broaden the base of the Police, and  thus

make  it  more alive to the problems of the people.

This  effort by the Government and the public  must

be  met  by a greater realisation of the Police  of

its  role  and  its duties to the  people  and  the

State.  The spirit of dedication to the service  of

the  people must be kept up and heightened  in  the

year  ahead. There is no place in the Police  Force

for  those  who  are corrupt, lazy,  arrogant,  and

unresponsive to the challenges of the times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficiency and high standard of the Police

must  be  maintained and improved. Discussions  are

now under way on the proposal to recruit a corps of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



University  graduates  to  strengthen  the  officer

corps  of  the  Police, and  also  to  undertake  a

certain specialised field of work. The number  must

of necessity be small and a scheme so worked out as

not  to  affect  the legitimate  prospects  of  the

officers who have risen from the ranks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, no matter how good and well intentioned

the   policy  of  the  Government  may   be,   such

government   cannot  function  well  if   the   men

responsible for the execution of government  policy

do  not  understand  the political  philosophy  and

intentions  of  the government in power.  For  this

reason, the Government is considering the inclusion

in  the  year ahead of political education  in  the

curricular  of the Police Training School  for  new

recruits  as  well  as regular lectures  for  those

already  in  the rank and file. The  main  contents

will  be the political philosophy of democracy  and

the  Five-Year  plan of the Government,  and  other

matters  directly  connected  with  problems  which

affect  the  society in which we live.  Apart  from

attempting to make the Police, the servants of  the

State,  understand the policies of the  Government,

the   other   purpose  of  the  proposed  political

education  course is to make the Police more  alive

and  responsive to the feelings and problems of the

masses they come into contact with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our efforts to bridge the gap between the

people and the Police, and to build up an efficient

and  strong  Police Force, may come to  nil  if  we

allow   certain   irresponsible  individuals,   for

reasons  of their own, to work up ill feelings  and

hatred, particularly of law-abiding workers towards

the  Police.  On one or two occasions  lately,  the

Police  has been the target of attack and political

intimidation  by  forces seeking to  undermine  the

good  relations that have been gradually  built  up

between  the  people and the Police. Their  reasons

for  doing  this  are  clear.  These  irresponsible

elements  want  to undermine the authority  of  the

Police.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we are in control, the role of the

Police  will always be to safe-guard the rights  of

the people, the authority of the Government and the

democratic system through which we seek to  realise

our  Five-Year plan of bringing greater improvement

in the living standards of the people. And this can

only   be   achieved  if  stable   conditions   are

maintained  for industrial expansion and industrial

peace  with justice to the workers. So long as  the

Police are called upon to maintain peace and order,

they  will  do their duty. If the Police have  done

wrong or if the individual officers are arrogant or

corrupt, by all means, criticise the Police so that

errors   may  be  rectified  and  similar  mistakes

avoided.  But such criticism should be constructive

with  a  view  to  improving the Police  Force  and

increasing  its  efficiency. Such criticism  should

not undermine the effectiveness of the Police as an

instrument  to protect the rights and liberties  of

the  people  according to the law. Equally  greater

diplomacy  is required on the part of  the  Police.

While  they  should be firm with evil-doers,  they.

should deal politely and sympathetically with  law-abiding citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government will take firm action

against  criminal elements, we would be failing  in

our  duty  if  we  did not at the  same  time  take

effective  steps, to make sure that those  who  are

committed to penal institutions are reeducated  and

rehabilitated  so that they may, on their  release,

be  fit  to  lead decent and useful lives  as  law-abiding members of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under colonial administrations of the past, the

emphasis  was  usually laid on the purely  punitive

aspects  of penal institutions. Very little thought

or  action  was  directed to  the  re-education  of

offenders, with the result that we have  an  unduly

high   proportion  of  residivists  or   persistent

offenders among our prison population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social and political renaissance which is

sweeping Asia today has also expressed itself in  a

dynamic  and  positive approach to the problems  of

crime and criminals in such Asian countries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



as  India, China and Ceylon. We in Singapore do not

propose  to  be  backward in this respect.  Indeed,

with   the   establishment  of  the  Pulau   Senang

settlement for the rehabilitation of secret society

detainees,   Singapore   has   already    attracted

international interest and attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to take steps to

transform  all penal institutions in  Singapore  as

centres for the rehabilitation of offenders, and to

institute effective after-care arrangements  as  an

integral    part   of   the   total   process    of

rehabilitation  begun  in the  prisons.  The  first

steps  in this direction will be taken as  soon  as

the  Government receives the report of the  Prisons

Inquiry  Commission. The Commission is expected  to

submit its findings and recommendations in the near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An honest and dedicated civil service is vital to

make  the State machinery work efficiently so  that

the  policies  of the Government may be  translated

into  action with imagination and tact. The Corrupt

Practices Investigation Bureau has a specific  task

of  fighting corruption in the Government  service.

Their  work  in  the past year, however,  has  been

hampered by the shortage of staff and the out-dated

regulations  dealing  with disciplinary  procedures

which   have   proved   to   be   unrealistic   and

impracticable  in  many cases.  The  Prevention  of

Corruption Ordinance passed two months ago will  no

doubt   strengthen   the   Government's   hand   in

investigation of cases of corruption. However,  not

all  the  cases  investigated will  go  before  the

Court.   Many   of   the  cases  are   dealt   with

departmentally   on  the  State  Advocate-General's

advice.  Effective action against corrupt  officers

is  hampered  by  exacting procedural  requirements

which  are more appropriate for the Judicial Court.

At  the  moment, proceedings in cases of corruption

are   protracted   either  because   the   ad   hoc

disciplinary committee members, all drawn from  the

civil  service, have little time or are lost  in  a

mass of unnecessary details.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience, it has been found that the

strongest deterrent against corruption is  a  swift

and  severe  retribution. When a case is  prolonged

for six months to one year, the effect is lost. For

this  reason,  action  will be  initiated  for  the

amendment  of the regulations governing discipline,

and   with   the  approval  of  the   P.S.C.,   the

appointment  of a permanent disciplinary  committee

with  a panel of members composed of civil servants

and those who are not civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps are being taken to recruit special

investigators and it is heartening to note  that  a

good number of University graduates have applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demoralising effect of yellow culture on the

youths, be it in the form of publications, films or

other  forms  of entertainment, is too  obvious  to

require  further elaboration. Vigorous  steps  have

been  taken  in  the  past  year  to  suppress  and

eliminate yellow culture, and will continue in  the

year ahead. From experience, it has been found that

because of the free flow of literature between  the

Federation  of  Malaya  and  Singapore,  the   mere

detention    of   books   under   the   Undesirable

Publications  Ordinance is not as effective  as  it

should  be. In the year ahead, therefore, increased

use of section 3 of the Ordinance may be necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of stricter censorship, 60 feature

films  have been banned from public screening  from

June  1959 to June 1960, as compared with  only  10

for  a similar period in the previous year. A start

will  be  made in the course of the year to  review

some  of  the  films approved for public  screening

during  the past few years. Special regard will  be

paid to the subject matter of these films to ensure

that undesirable themes are not presented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has no desire to slow down its

anti-yellow culture campaign. At the same time,  it

realises that it is a long and difficult battle and

requires the vigilance and cooperation on the  part

of  Government  and the people. We are  aware  that

irresponsible pedlars of yellow culture  are  still

actively



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



seeking   ways  and  means  to  evade  Government's

attention.  Already there is a revival  of  singing

troupes  in  the amusement worlds.  We  hope  these

promoters will bear in mind that, apart from  their

profit   motive,  they  have,  like  any   ordinary

citizen, a responsibility to the society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the P.A.P. Government hinges on

its  industrial expansion programme to provide  for

more  employment  opportunities to  the  increasing

working  population. It is obvious that a stop  has

to  be put to the entry of persons from abroad  who

will  compete for any new jobs that may be created.

The  present  high standard of social services  too

should  not  be  jeopardised by a large  influx  of

immigrants.  The  resources of the State  obviously

are  not  meant to provide jobs and social services

for  the non-citizen immigrants. Consequently,  the

value  attached  to citizenship has been  enhanced.

For  these reasons and in the interest of promoting

national consciousness and loyalty, the immigration

and  citizenship laws were amended at  the  end  of

1959  and  early 1960. Although the full effect  of

these  amendments will be realised in the next  one

or two years, nevertheless, some discernible effect

has been felt. Already the number of immigrants has

fallen from about 7,300 between June 1958 and  June

1959 to 4,400 for the same period between June 1959

and June 1960, a drop of nearly 3,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity card, which was introduced in 1948,

has  outlived  its original purpose.  The  identity

card   has  now  become  an  important  and  almost

indispensable document for obtaining various  forms

of  assistance from the Ministry of Labour and Law,

such as public assisttance, legal aid or relief  in

times  of natural disasters; but most important  of

all  is  the use made of the identity card  in  the

preparation of electoral rolls under the system  of

compulsory  voting. While the  importance  of  the

identity  card has increased and its use broadened,

yet  the  identity  card  itself  remained  in  its

present  crude  and temporary form  which  is  very

unsatisfactory from all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



respects. The Government, therefore, has set  about

exploring  the best method of changing the  present

identity  card system since last year.  Preparation

is now ahead for the introduction of a plastic card

which is more durable and more difficult to forge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the year ahead will see greater

efficiency and improvement being made to the Police

in their service to the State and the people and  a

sustained  effort against all forms of  corruption.

The  Government is confident that with the  support

of  the people, it can achieve what it sets out  to

do  in the year ahead as outlined in the speech  of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in this Assembly.



<br><br>4.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, after reading the policy  speech  by

the  Lee  Kuan Yew Government, I found  it  is  not

basically different from that of the Lim  Yew  Hock

Government, one which was thoroughly criticised  by

our  Prime  Minister.  In the  past  few  days,  my

comrades  had already clearly analysed  that  under

the  one-man "collective leadership" of  our  Prime

Minister,  the  present Government has  practically

turned  into  an  agent  for the  great  compradore

class,  an  abettor of the British rulers.  It  has

turned into an abettor of American imperialism. Mr

Speaker, I believe you are also clear about it! Our

turn-coat  Government  now  finds  that  the   Asia

Foundation  is  not  adequate enough, and  so  our

Minister for Finance has gone to America to  borrow

capital   from  Uncle  Sam.  Not  only  this,   but

yesterday, the Member for Cairnhill again winked at

the   Lee  Kuan  Yew  Government,  suggesting   the

organisation  of a so-called "Grand Alliance".  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we dare not look down upon the  Lee

Kuan  Yew  Government.  It is  still  "strong"  and

"stable", because it is in control of great  power.

It  has  the  Police;  it has the  support  of  the

colonial forces. The only regrettable thing is that

it  does not have the overwhelming support  of  the

people, the reason being that it has turned against

the general masses of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Lee Kuan Yew Government, which is against

the  people,  when finding itself forsaken  by  the

general  masses, and in order to prolong its  dying

life,  has to bring out every trick it has  at  its

disposal  to lobby Assemblymen, control the  Press,

suppress  free speech, intimidating and  soliciting

to  their extremity. Mr Speaker, I have heard that

the  allowance for Assemblymen from the  P.A.P. is

going to be increased and that there would soon  be

Deputy Parliamentary Secretaries in our Government.

In another few weeks, maybe there, would be another

group  of  Assemblymen who will be sent  abroad  on

"official duties" - I dare not say they are going  on

holiday excursions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, my comrade, the Member for Aljunied, has

received a reply from the Government rejecting  his

application  to hold a mass meeting in the  Shenton

Field on Sunday. The reason? Very simple. They said

the application should be for a piece of Government

land  in  Aljunied. But according to my  knowledge,

there  is not a single piece of Government land  in

Aljunied  big enough to be used as a  place  for  a

mass   meeting.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   you   should

understand that when a person has come to  the  end

of  all his means, he has to act without regard  to

the means used, whether good or evil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Mr Speaker, you will agree with me

that,  being  a representative of a rural  area,  I

quite understand conditions in rural areas. When my

comrade,  the Member for Hong Lim, was the Minister

for National Development, there was an addition  of

more  than  two  hundred public standpipes  in  the

rural  areas. But when Mr Meadows took over, there

was  not a single standpipe constructed. Only after

this  incident  had occurred were  another  10  odd

stand-pipes  constructed, and then  there  appeared

such headlines, "Development of Rural Areas", "Care

for  the  Village  Folk" - one after  another - in  the

newspapers. I believe there are better  and  better

plays  later.  What  kind of a game  is  this?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,I sincerely appeal to the  Lee  Kuan

Yew  Government not to treat all the people in  the

world as fools!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, let us remember that at the

time  of  the Lim Yew Hock Government, the one  who

was  responsible  for  rural  development  was  Mr

Meadows.  In  the present Lee Kuan Yew  Government,

the one who is responsible for rural development is

also Mr Meadows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these five days, we have heard grand speeches

consisting of thousands of words, and we have  seen

many brilliantly-written essays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how eloquently you speak, you

cannot blind the bright and discerning eyes of  the

people.  Does this Government really care  for  the

poor people? No! We say no. The people of Singapore

also say no. Only they themselves said they do. Mr

Speaker, Sir, let us look at how they "courageously

rectify  errors"  concerning the  pawnbrokers;  how

they generously give tens of millions of dollars to

the  Turf  Club;  how they protect  the  compradore

class,  forgetting their original stand.  You  must

understand  what they are. What I do not understand

is this: why does this self-styled "working for the

welfare of the poor" Government not let the man  in

the  street-taxi-drivers (for example, giving  them

petrol coupons) and the working class - have a better

livelihood?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many more things which I do not

understand. I must request -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Punggol

could  speak  a little slower, I think perhaps  the

interpreters will be able to keep up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I have many other questions on which I hope I could

be enlightened:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If the Lee Kuan Yew Government still follows

the  Party  Manifesto declared when the  Party  was

formed, why does he not dare to reaffirm the P.A.P.

1954 revolutionary manifesto?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the Lee Kuan Yew Government is not

following the Lim Yew Hock Government, and  is  not

going against the wishes of the people, why does it

not dare to reaffirm the firm stand in the struggle

against colonialism?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Lee Kuan Yew Government has agreed that

the  present Constitution cannot satisfy the  needs

of  the people and said that in the last year,  the

political  and economic conditions have never  been

better.  Why  should there not be plans  to  reopen

talks with Britain?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Lee Kuan Yew Government has repeated the

wish  to  merge with the Federation. Why are  talks

not  held  with  the Federation to  understand  the

difficulties?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Has the Prime Minister fought for the release

of detainees in the Internal Security Council?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) If the Lee Kuan Yew Government is really

protecting  the trade union movement, and  hope  to

see  it  well  developed in the  interests  of  the

workers,  why  should  its  action-ordered  in  the

morning   and  changed  in  the  evening   not   be

reprimanded?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Before the Prime Minister assumed office, he

was  proud to say that Asians could rule Asia.  Why

does    he    not    Malayanise   all    expatriate

administrative posts immediately?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The Lee Kuan Yew Government knows how to

order  the  T.U.C. under his control  to  call  for

meetings  to discuss supporting the Prime  Minister

of Malaya in his South African policy. But why, has

not  a  mass  meeting been held  so  that,  through

concrete  action, we can support the Tunku's  South

African policy and boycott South African goods?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) If the Lee Kuan Yew Government is really the

people's  Government and one which looks after  the

poor  people,  why  are the poor  people  specially

picked out for heavier taxation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) If the Lee Kuan Yew Government really wants

to  build  our  State  into a peaceful,  happy  and

prosperous   society,  why  should   the   Gambling

Ordinance not be repealed? And why should the Anti-Yellow culture campaign not be strengthened?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope to get unequivocal

answers   "which  are  not  derived  after  looking

sideways and talking about something else".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Lee Kuan Yew Government can execute the

above  policies  as  contained  in  the  Hong   Lim

Resolutions,   we  shall  then   cast   our   votes

supporting  the policy speech of the Lee  Kuan  Yew

Government.



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, I

rise  to second the motion in the name of the Prime

Minister.  There is a difference between last  year

and this year in the debate on the motion of thanks

for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. Last year,

the  speech  was  delivered by the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara who was a colonial official and adorned with

a  uniform which symbolised the colonial authority.

On  the Opposition there were only the S.P.A., and

U.M.N.O.  This  year the speech is delivered  by  a

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara who is a Malayan  and  who

wears a Male van dress which has no vestige of  the

colonial era.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Opposition side besides the S.P.A. and

U.M.N.O.,  there is an additional  group  of  three

persons who have been expelled from the P.A.P.  The

attacks  made  by the Opposition on the  Government

were  also  different from those of last year.  The

S.P.A. alleged then that the P.A.P. Government  was

begging  the  capitalists to  make  investments  in

Singapore. This year, the S.P.A. repeats  the  same

old  tune  which  they hummed during  the  election

campaign-that capital has flown away from Singapore

and  that  there are intimidations and restrictions

under the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim claims that he is a

genuine  anti-colonialist  and  alleges  that   the

P.A.P. has  deviated from its declared policy  and

become  pro-colonialist. Mr Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,

there  is a difference between the P.A.P. and  the

other  groups  on the Opposition side.  The  S.P.A.

wants  and has always wanted to maintain the status

quo



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



whereby  the  rich  becomes  richer  and  the  poor

becomes  poorer. For the P.A.P. it is a  fight  for

political  independence to create a more  just  and

equal society where there is no exploitation of man

by man. The P.A.P. fought the last election with  a

Five-Year  programme  which  is  embodied  in   the

booklet  entitled "The Tasks Ahead". From  the  day

the  P.A.P. assumed office it  has  sincerely  and

consistently   been  implementing   its   Five-Year

programme. For instance, the Labour Ministry  under

the  P.A.P.  Government: this  Ministry  under  the

previous   Government  was   so   ineffective   and

inefficient that the interests of the workers  were

not protected. It was used for the interests of the

capitalists.  Sir, there is a great contrast  since

this  Ministry  came into the hands of  the  P.A.P.

Government.   Under  the  present  Government   the

Industrial Relations Section, the Labour Court  and

the  Inspection Section for the last one year  have

done much work to assist the workers, work which is

equivalent  to  several times that done  under  the

previous   regime.  The  Inspection  Section   has

collected  a  colossal sum of money  from  numerous

employers   who  have  defaulted  in  payments   of

overtime,  public  holidays  and  other  provisions

provided  under the Ordinance. What  we  have  done

last  year for the workers has proved that we  have

not  deviated from our Party policy, as alleged  by

the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has accused the P.A.P.

Government  for  deliberately retaining  expatriate

officers  to  run the Government on behalf  of  the

Party. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us examine what

Malayanisation means to the Member for Hong Lim. In

the  City  Council when he was the Mayor,  the  Gas

Department  was and at present is still  under  the

control  of expatriate officers. The head  of  that

department  then  submitted a request  to  purchase

additional  machinery.  I  wanted  to   query   the

department  for its justification to purchase  this

additional  machinery. But what did the Mayor,  now

the  Member for Hong Lim, tell me? He said that  as

that department was entirely in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



hands  of expatriate officers, we should not  bring

forward any query which might cause displeasure  to

the  expatriate officers who might resign from  the

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> He seems to have such a high

opinion  and  confidence in Mr Owen. When  he  was

Mayor  at the time the expatriate official who  was

holding  the post of Treasurer went on  leave,  why

did  he  not  appoint Mr Owen, whom he thought  so

highly  of, to act as the City Treasurer?  Instead,

he  appointed another expatriate officer to act  in

the post, although, apart from Mr Owen, there were

other  local  officers  who  were  more  senior  in

service than this acting expatriate officer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point

of clarification, please.



<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker</b>: If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Labour

and  Law  is, as my friend the Member for  Aljunied

has said, a different social being from when he was

a City Council -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker</b>: That is not a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, I will come to the point. He has forgotten that we had only 13 votes in the

City  Council, which number was later increased  to

14. We were not in a position to make staff changes

whenever we wanted to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, since the

Member for Hong Lim so proudly claims that he is  a

champion of Malayanisation, is there any logic when

he  says that at that time we had only 13 votes  in

the  City  Council and we were therefore not  in  a

position to change the officers in the department?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the other day the Member for Hong Lim also mentioned that members of the Work

Brigade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



were  specially  brought down  from  Pasir  Ris  to

applaud  the  Assemblymen as they walked  from  the

City Council to Assembly House. The opening of  the

Assembly  is  a  national occasion. A  paid  public

holiday was granted to the Work Brigade. There  was

no reason why they should not have wanted to attend

the opening ceremony. In fact, on National Day,  if

it  were not for the rain, the Work Brigade and the

People's  Association would have been on parade  in

full  view  of the public. Perhaps the  Member  for

Hong Lim was annoyed that he was not clapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned also that the House would be

surprised  to  know  that the Government  preferred

appointing  an  expatriate as Chief Justice  rather

than  confirm  Mr  Justice Tan  Ah  Tah  as  Chief

Justice. The Member for Hong Lim himself subscribed

to  the proposal that Inche Ahmad Bin Mohd. Ibrahim

be  given a salary higher than a puisne judge,  and

he,  together  with  his other Cabinet  colleagues,

agreed  that the State Advocate-General  should  be

given  higher  priority in the table of  precedence

than  that of a puisne judge. Yet he now says  that

the  case  of  Mr  Justice Tan  Ah  Tah  has  been

overlooked  because  of the  action  of  the  Prime

Minister.  This clearly proves that  he  is  a  man

always ready to make any false accusation should it

suit his purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other day he also

mentioned  Shaw  Brothers. It  is  true  that  Shaw

Brothers   donated  $200,000  to   the   Government

unconditionally  to  be used in  whatever  way  the

Government  deems  fit. Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,

there  are many young people in Singapore,  and  in

order to provide them with a place for recreational

and  educational  purposes, the  Government  thinks

that  it is advisable to make use of this money  to

build  more community centres. Is this not for  the

benefit of the people? The hon. Member claimed that

the  Government tried to protect the Shaw Brothers.

This  House  will recollect that not long  ago  the

Finance  Minister, whom he hates so much,  has  had

the courage to introduce in this House an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



amendment  to  the Cinema Ordinance  by  which  the

cinema magnates have to pay more taxes than before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are the things

that  the Member for Hong Lim has done and  uttered

in  this House to show to the public that he is  an

ardent   anti-colonialist,   and   to   create   an

impression that the rest of the P.A.P. Members  are

enjoying the spoils of being in the Government  and

thus  forgetting  about our  struggle.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am not being personal  with  the

Member  for  Hong Lim, but I will tell him  what  I

think  of  him. It is because of his  meanness  and

because  of  his  greedy  and  selfish  methods  to

achieve personal glory that I have denounced him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the S.P.A. always instil

fear  in the people with the hope of deceiving them

from supporting the P.A.P., but they have failed in

the  past  in many instances. Now, the  Member  for

Hong Lim is trying to adopt the same tactics as the

S.P.A. by attempting to deceive the people that  he

is  the  only ardent anti-colonialist and that  the

other  members  of the P.A.P. are pro-colonialists.

It  is  a  matter of time before he will be exposed

and  meet the same fate as the S.P.A. He failed  to

make use of the P.A.P. to promote "Ong Eng Guanism"

and  he now turns round to denounce the P.A.P. that

it  has deviated from its declared policies and has

become  pro-colonialist. Mr Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,

the  P.A.P. has  survived  the  past  attacks   by

colonialists  and  other  forces  because  of   its

consistency in its policies. Let the Opposition not

be   under  the  impression  that  by  scaring  and

smearing  the  P.A.P. it will abandon its  struggle

and  join  forces with the Right-wing reactionaries

or  with the Left-wing adventurers. The P.A.P. has

been   and   will  consistently  and   determinedly

struggle to achieve an independent, democratic, non-Communist and socialist Malaya. This is the Party's

long-term  objective. The P.A.P. is a  Party  which

has   its   political  beliefs  and  it  progresses

according  to  the  actual  situation.  We  do  not

believe  in shouting empty slogans like the  Member

for Hong Lim for publicity or for personal glory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, we fought the elections

With a Five-Year programme and we have stated in no

uncertain  terms that during these  five  years  we

will  try,  within the limitations of  an  internal

self-government and the resources available in  our

country,  to achieve economic expansion. With  that

objective, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for  the  years

ahead,  the Ministry of Labour will not  only  look

after the interest of the working class who are  at

the  moment  employed, but will  also  raise  their

standard of living. But, on the other hand, we must

not  overlook the fact that there is a great number

of  the people who are still unemployed. Apart from

whatever social legislation that we will introduce,

we  will  work closely with the Ministry of Finance

under  the  guiding principle of  industrial  peace

with justice to offer more employment opportunities

to our population.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, during the  last  few  days,

Opposition  Members have levelled their  attack  on

the  Government.  Some of them blamed  us  for  not

going  Right,  that  is,  to  take  an  open  anti-Communist  line.  Others alleged that  we  are  too

Right, and that we should go more to the Left. They

expected  us to shout empty slogans of  "Down  with

Colonialism".  They expected us to close  our  eyes

and   toe   the  line  of  the  extreme   Left-wing

adventurers  without facing realities.  There  were

also  others  who  are incapable  of  grasping  the

political situation Singapore is facing. They could

only  deal with matters of imaginary fantasies  and

attacked  Government on minor  matters.  Some  went

even  as  far  as to accuse us of not believing  in

fatalism!  After 14 months of silence,  the  Member

for  Joo  Chiat had nothing better to say  than  to

talk on how to rear chickens!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to waste

the  precious  time of this Assembly  to  reply  to

their  criticisms, because many  of  my  colleagues

have  already  dealt with them. To  sum  up,  their

criticisms can be classified into two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



categories. One is the theory adopted by the Member

for Hong Lim and his two followers. Their theory is

very  simple:  to  harp every  day  on  "Down  with

Colonialism", George Thomson, Blades, Meadows,  and

a  few  other falsehoods. The Member for  Cairnhill

asked   why  we  did  not  deny  all  these   false

accusations. If we waste time on denying all  these

falsehoods, then we will not have the  time  to  do

anything  else.  The Member for  Hong  Lim  perhaps

believes in Hitler's theory, that is, if you repeat

a  certain falsehood every day, it will one day  be

more  or  less  believed by the masses.  Therefore,

after  he  had spoken, his two followers harped  on

the  same  theme, like the playing of records  over

and  over  again.  The other category  consists  of

those who want us to be openly anti-Communist.  The

Member for Cairnhill said that if we are not anti-Communist, then we are not democratic. This perhaps

is  his own political theory. From what I know, the

opposite   of   democracy  is  not  Communism   but

dictatorship,  and  the opposite  of  Communism  is

capitalism.  Many  Communist countries  claim  that

they  are  practising  a democratic  system.  Anti-Communism   is  not  a  political  and  philosophic

theory;  it  is a negative political attitude.  The

mere  act  of  putting on a hat, the  arresting  of

people,  and suppression cannot destroy  Communism,

and it cannot also raise the living standard of the

people. We want to raise the living standard of the

people   through   the  system   of   parliamentary

democracy. This is a new and daring approach in the

politics of Singapore. What I wish to emphasise  is

that  the  line which the P.A.P. is taking  is  the

line  of  peaceful revolution. We are  striving  to

achieve  our  aim  of  establishing  a  democratic,

socialist,  non-Communist Malaya  through  peaceful

revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this aim, we must consider the

objective  political situation and  environment  in

Singapore  and  Malaya, and we must  adopt  a  more

flexible  and practical strategy. In the  long-term

interest of our people and our country, we  do  not

propose   to  close  our  eyes  and  rush   forward

recklessly. For if we do so, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



will  fail in our peaceful revolution, and  at  the

unnecessary sacrifice of many of our people. We  do

not  propose to gamble with the fate of our  people

and our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success or failure of a political movement

depends  largely on the ability of its  leaders  to

have a correct political analysis and to choose the

right line of action. If we turn back the pages  of

the  history of the Asian revolution, we  can  find

many  clear  examples  of the danger  of  political

adventurism.  Take,  for  instance,   the   Chinese

revolution.  In  1927, the Chinese Communist  Party

blindly followed Li Lik San's dogmatism and started

a   revolution  in  Shanghai,  where  there  was  a

concentration of the proletariat. They  suffered  a

disastrous defeat. At that time, Li Lik San was the

brains behind the policy-making body of the Chinese

Communist  Party.  He followed  the  dogma  of  the

Marxist,  believing  that a revolution  could  only

succeed  in  places where there was a concentration

of proletariat. History has proved that this theory

failed!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese Communist revolution succeeded

because of the correct analysis of Mao Tze-tung  in

that  the  peasants should be the backbone  of  the

revolution.  This,  however,  does  not  prove  the

validity  of  Marxism.  It merely  shows  that  the

correct  strategy is one which has  regard  to  the

facts  and fit the facts. In plain words, one  must

take correct measurements before making a shirt  to

fit one's body, and not try to disfigure one's body

to   fit   a  shirt  made  without  taking  correct

measurements.  Li Lik San's failure has  proved  an

important   point,  i.e. any  political  struggle,

notwithstanding   the  courage  and   revolutionary

enthusiasm of its supporters, will only  meet  with

disaster and unnecessary sacrifice on the  part  of

the  people if the leadership is too subjective and

it takes the wrong path.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to explain here that I was not comparing

the Member for Hong Lim with Li Lik San. The former

is  a political opportunist of the present Romantic

age, who has not shown any talent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



for  political analysis, and the latter was a Left-wing adventurer who had committed an error of Left-wing  infantilism and dogmatism. The former  should

by no means be put on the same level as the latter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just said that any political movement

which   ignores   the  objective   realities,   the

political  conditions and environments,  and  which

seeks  to  follow the dogmas of a foreign political

theory  is bound to fail. The failure of the  armed

revolution  in  Malaya could also be attributed  to

the  above and to the lack of understanding of  the

objective realities and environment of the  Malayan

political situation. The failure was also a  result

of not evolving a doctrine deduced from facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts in the past few years have proved that

the  P.A.P. could get the support of the people and

could  successfully overcome many political storms,

because  its  leadership  always  understood   the

objective,   the   political  realities   and   the

situation.   Our  leaders  have  made   a   correct

political  analysis and chosen the right  path.  We

realise that in the present circumstances the armed

revolution in Malaya is bound to fail, and we  have

therefore  chosen the path of peaceful  revolution.

What   we   are  striving  for  is  to  achieve   a

democratic,  non-Communist,  socialist  Malaya.  We

believe that so long as we continue to move towards

the  right  direction, we will one day realise  our

dream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve our long-term objective, we must

strive for a merger. But merger is not as simple  a

problem  as  the Member for Hong Lim imagines.  Who

does  not wish to have immediate negotiations  with

the Federation of Malaya on the merger problem? But

can   this   be  done  in  the  present   political

situation?  The Member for Hong Lim is not  unaware

of  the  difficulties facing this problem. When  he

was  Minister for National Development, he did  not

raise  this  suggestion  of negotiations  with  his

former    colleagues,   because   he    knew    the

difficulties.  Only  after he  had  raised  the  16

resolutions, one of which was about merger, did  he

realise that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



his  political fortune was fast fading.  They  were

meant as a "charm" to ward off political opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had suggested negotiations on a merger in

order to mislead the people into believing that the

present leaders of the P.A.P. are not interested in

the merger, and that he was the only one interested

in  it. Empty slogans, though they make more noise,

will  not lead us to a merger. The P.A.P. has  made

an analysis of this problem. We feel that the first

step  to  achieve  the merger is  to  clear  racial

suspicion  and  communalism, which were  the  left-overs   of  the  colonial  era.  Through  practical

action, we are instilling into our people a  spirit

of loyalty and national consciousness. The National

Loyalty  Week,  organised by  the  Government  last

December  and  other  measures  to  bring  about  a

cultural  interflow have produced visible  results.

We  believe that so long as we continue  with  this

effort,  and  so  long as the  people  continue  to

cooperate  with  us,  we will attain  our  ultimate

objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish now to review the past year's work and

future plans of the Ministry of Culture. The P.A.P.

Government  have established a Ministry of  Culture

because  we  feel  that in our effort  to  build  a

socialist    country,   political   and    economic

revolutions alone are not enough. We have  also  to

carry out a cultural revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divide and rule policy implemented by our

former  colonial  masters  had  caused  unfortunate

cultural   barriers  among  the  different   races.

Colonial education had also left us with a lack  of

national consciousness among the people. One  other

thing   of   the   colonial  past  was   that   the

appreciation of art was confined to a  small  group

of  the  privileged. All these are  obstacles  left

over  by  the  old  society and  they  have  to  be

overcome in our effort to build a Malayan culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year, the Government have carried

out  many measures aimed at fulfilling our cultural

revolution.  Broadly speaking, our  objectives  are

three-fold:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To eliminate yellow culture and to promote

healthy cultural activities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To cultivate national consciousness and a

spirit of national loyalty; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To promote cultural fusion and create a

Malayan culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now first deal with the National Cultural

Brigade, which was mentioned in the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year, the Ministry of Culture,

through  Aneka  Ragam  Ra'ayat,  have  aroused  the

interest  of  the  people in  the  appreciation  of

healthy  cultural  activities.  We  feel  that  the

passive methods of eliminating yellow culture alone

will not help us to achieve the aim of our cultural

revolution.  We  wish  to  build  a  foundation  of

healthy,  meaningful cultural activities  from  the

debris  of yellow culture. Previously, our colonial

masters not only did not encourage healthy cultural

activities,  but had openly allowed yellow  culture

which catered for the lower instincts of mankind to

intoxicate our youth. Under the influence  of  such

environment,  the  people could only  go  for  such

entertainment  of  a  lowly  debased   nature   for

recreation.     Certain     worthwhile     cultural

performances, of course, were performed.  But  they

were  confined to a small circle of so-called high-class society and privileged group, because of  the

high  prices  of the tickets. Because of  the  past

environment,  many  artistes  had  also   to   hide

themselves  in the ivory tower and to  play  music,

dances  or  drama to only a limited audience.  They

had therefore for a period lost touch with the rest

of the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present cultural task is to eliminate this

unhealthy  state  of  affairs.  We  want  to   make

cultural activities part of the daily life  of  our

people,  and we want to bring art to the people  so

that  in  their  leisure they will  also  have  the

opportunity  of appreciating music, dances, drama,

paintings,  and other forms of art.  We  also  hope

that  they will take an active part in such healthy

cultural activities so that life will become richer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



and  more meaningful, and so that the people of all

races   will   also   cultivate   the   spirit   of

understanding and cooperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year, cultural organisations and

cultural  workers  have given us  good  support  in

promoting healthy cultural activities. It cannot be

denied that the past year has been a boom year  for

cultural  activities in the history  of  Singapore.

The  enthusiastic  response of the  people  of  all

communities  towards  the  National  Theatre   Fund

proves  that the people are interested  in  healthy

cultural  entertainment, The past year's experience

tells  us that if we wish to popularise art and  to

expect further creative development in the field of

art  and  culture,  we should not  depend  only  on

voluntary   amateur   cultural   organisations   to

shoulder the entire burden alone. We know that  the

majority   of   the  cultural  workers   are   non-professionals.  They are amateurs, and  have  their

own  jobs.  They can only participate  in  cultural

activities during their leisure hours. Thus, in the

promotion of healthy cultural activities, they have

often  found it a handicap because of the  lack  of

time  and  energy. Therefore, the  purpose  of  the

National  Cultural Brigade is to enable a group  of

cultural  workers  to carry out full-time  work  to

augment   the  deficiency  of  voluntary   cultural

organisations, so that there will be better results

in our efforts to promote a Malayan culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, many of the so-called community

centres  were  used by a small group of  privileged

class  to  make money. Gambling, dancing and  other

`funny' things were rampant in .these centres. With

the formation of our National Cultural Brigade,  we

intend  to  use  members of  the  Brigade  to  help

organise  cultural activities,  which  will  be  of

physical  and  moral  benefit  to  our  people.  We

believe   that  as  more  community   centres   are

developed,  and  with the effort  of  the  National

Cultural Brigade, healthy cultural activities  will

be  popularised  throughout  every  corner  of  the

island.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other important aims of the National Cultural

Brigade   are  to  instil  a  spirit  of   national

consciousness and the promotion of cultural  fusion

with  the ultimate objective of creating a  Malayan

art  and  culture. This is a task which  cannot  be

fulfilled  by  the  solitary  effort  of  voluntary

cultural organisations or within a short period. In

order  to  proceed  with this heavy  and  important

task,  we must attract into the Brigade experienced

artistes  of  all  races who are prepared  to  work

hard. They will undertake the task of research  and

other  creative cultural work. We will also  invite

cultural  experts of all races to form a  panel  of

experts for the Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish now to mention the organisation of the

Brigade.  Generally speaking, the Brigade  will  be

divided  into two sections. One group will comprise

artistes of higher educational level, and who  have

creative abilities. They will do research  work  in

music,  dances,  drama, and art  of  all  races  in

Malaya,  and  to arrange and edit them.  They  will

also  help in the work of creating music,  dancing,

or drama of a Malayan content. The other group will

comprise   those  who  have  good  experience   and

technique   in  performances,  such  as  musicians,

actors,  dancers  and artists.  They  will  perform

cultural items produced by the research section and

introduce  them  to the various community  centres.

They   will  also  help  to  provide  new  cultural

programmes  for  the Aneka Ragam Ra'ayat  and  help

organise   cultural  activities  in  the  community

centres.  The panel of experts of the Brigade  will

comprise   experienced  leaders  of   the   various

cultural fields of the various races. This panel of

experts will not only advise the Brigade, but  will

meet  from  time to time to exchange views  on  the

promotion of cultural interflow and to explore  the

ground  for  the  creation of  a  Malayan  art  and

culture.  Further  details of  this  plan  will  be

announced soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to accomplish our cultural revolution,

we  do  not  intend to fold our arms and  wait  for

results.  We  intend  to take  active  measures  to

cultivate  the  artistic taste of  the  people,  to

instil a national consciousness among them, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



promote cultural fusion, and ultimately to create a

Malayan  art and culture. The Cultural  Brigade  is

only  one  of  the  few weapons to  accomplish  our

cultural revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the establishment of our Institute of National

Language and Culture, I had, two months ago,  given

a  full explanation when I moved the Second Reading

of the Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan Bill.

As  I  said, the Institute, apart from  publishing

translations  of outstanding works  of  literature,

and promoting the growth and spread of the National

Language,  will  also  encourage  original   works,

literary  and scientific, with a Malayan background

by  local  writers. Regarding the  organisation  of

this  Institute, we shall soon have good  news  for

the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker</b>: Order. Will the Member  take

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

speaking  of  television, the Member for  Hong  Lim

distorted the aims of the Government in wanting  to

establish  a  T.V. station. He  claimed  that  the

Government was afraid to face the public  and  thus

had  to use T.V. as a political propaganda machine.

This  argument is not only laughable but  childish.

T.V. is now recognised by countries of the world as

an excellent medium to educate the masses. Not only

in  Western  countries has it become  popular,  but

also  in  Communist countries such  as  Russia  and

China. Was he trying to say that the governments of

these advanced countries have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



established T.V. stations because they  are  afraid

of  the masses? In fact, in the present atomic age,

a  city  without television cannot be considered  a

modern city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to think of it, the Member for Hong Lim

has developed a fear of T.V. since he was expelled

from  his  post.  In  fact, the plan  to  establish

television was mooted by the Government  long  ago,

and  I  understand the former Minister for National

Development  was very interested in T.V.  He  might

have  been  thinking  that in  future  his  unusual

physiognomy  would be appearing in  T.V. and  that

there would be a big applause by spectators, and by

himself too. Now that the fulfilment of this  dream

has  vanished, T.V. to his mind has suddenly become

a  propaganda machine to bridge the gap between the

Government and the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When can Singapore have T.V.? We cannot at

present give a definite answer to this. I can  only

say  that the Government is positively studying the

plans  proposed  by foreign T.V. experts.  At  any

rate, the innovation of T.V. will be beneficial  to

the  people of Singapore. The Government will  make

good  use  of  T.V. to  educate  the  people,   to

inculcate  in  them  a national  consciousness  and

loyalty,  and to foster the fusion of the  cultures

of the various races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has asked why we do not

deny  the accusations levelled at us by the Members

for Hong Lim, Aljunied and Punggol. Just now I have

said  that the eyes of the people of Singapore  are

bright  and  discerning, and that these meaningless

utterances do not merit our denying them one  after

another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim said that the Press

reported Thomson's article in 2,500 words,  whereas

his  article was only allowed 500 words. I wish  to

clarify  this. Thomson's article was not issued  by

the  Government,  but was copied  from  the  Police

Gazette  by  the Press. Perhaps the  Press  thought

there  was more material in Thomson's article  than

in  the Member for Hong Lim's. The Chief Editor and

editors  of the Press are responsible people.  They

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>





see  for  themselves what news should be  magnified

and what news should be abridged. If the Member for

Hong Lim wishes to have more columns devoted to his

articles  then  he  should make  more  constructive

proposals,  such as on raising the living  standard

of  the people, etc., and not harp on the same tune

every day. I have been a reporter for 13 years, and

I know reporters do not like to "fry old rice".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Member for Hong Lim accused the

Minister for Culture of intimidating Mr Huang Tze-Chin  of  the Sunday Mail. I have to explain  this.

After  the publication of the article by Mr  Huang

Tze-Chin,  the Minister for Culture  felt  that  he

(Mr  Huang)  seemed to be toeing the line  of  the

Left-wing  adventurers, and he reminded  the  Press

concerned. Mr Huang Tze-Chin personally telephoned

the  Minister saying that he wished to  talk  about

that article with the Minister. It is true that  he

spent  a  long time with the Minister. Consequently

he  returned to the Press office and told the Chief

Editor  that  he had prevailed upon  the  Minister.

Does  this mean intimidation? He himself said  that

he had prevailed upon the Minister and not that the

Minister had intimidated him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point: just now the Member for Punggol

said  that the P.A.P. Government has now  lost  the

support  of  the people. It should be  turned  this

way.  We  have  today  lost the  support  of  three

persons.  The  Member for Cairnhill  challenged  us

yesterday  to a General Election. I wish to  remind

him  that  his former Chief Minister, Mr Marshall,

had  also challenged us likewise, but where  is  he

now?  I  should think that a bird in  the  hand  is

worth more than two in the bush.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  have  been debating the motion on the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech for the last six days. This

is  the  evening of the sixth day. There is  little

assurance  that  this debate will  finish  tonight.

What the House has been debating,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, to my mind, after listening  for

the  last  six  days,  is not the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech, bit the domestic affairs  of  the

political party that happens to be in power  today.

While  I  have  every sympathy for  their  domestic

difficulties  which have led to  public  exposures,

Mr  Speaker, I feel that probably this is not  the

proper  forum  to  discuss their domestic  affairs,

particularly when much dirt comes out in the  wash.

However, gone is the proud and arrogant attitude of

the  people sitting in front of me when  they  were

here  on  the last occasion debating the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech. One got  the  impression,

Mr  Speaker,  that next to God  in  the  order  of

creation  was  the P.A.P., that there  was  nothing

human  about them, and that their advent  to  power

was  something  God  had ordained  and,  therefore,

immutable and indestructible. We are now 14  months

from  that  last  historic  occasion,  and  we  now

discover, when we look under the table, that  their

feet  are  not six feet above the ground, but  that

they  are well and truly set on the ground and that

they  are made of clay. If they could have  got  on

with  the  business of government in  an  objective

manner,  if  they had realised their responsibility

and  be  humble in the realisation that  power  has

been  placed in their hands in order that they  may

serve  the  people, then I think the  mistakes  and

errors  of the last 14 months could well have  been

avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may now turn to the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's speech as reported in  Hansard,

and  start from the beginning. The introduction  to

the  speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is a very

cleverly contrived introduction written by  a  very

skilful  hand. And in it I see the inimitable  hand

of  the  Hon, the Prime Minister. It is a statement

which really apologises for the Government for  not

having  done  anything during  the  last  year  and

promising a great deal for the future. In col. 4 of

the Hansard, vol. 13, No. 1 of 20th July, 1960,  it

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The people were aware what they could and could

not expect of a P.A.P. Government.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main reasons why the P.A.P. was

returned to power in the manner in which they  were

returned  is  because  they gave  the  country  the

impression  that they were a united,  cohesive  and

well-organised party. The admiration of the  people

of  Singapore was excited on that account,  whereas

their opponents were a derelict group who could not

agree  among themselves. For that reason, a lot  of

the  people who did not agree with the ideology  of

the  P.A.P. voted for them, because they felt  that

in  the P.A.P. at least they had a Government which

knew  its  own mind and, therefore, could  set  the

ship  of  State on its correct course and  keep  it

firmly on an even keel. That was the opinion  of  a

number  of  people who, although somewhat perturbed

about  the future, having listened to some  of  the

speeches  of  the P.A.P. during the  election,  yet

felt  that the need of the time was for a firm  and

stable government in the economic context of  Asian

adventures. The P.A.P. got the Government and,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, during its 14 months of  office  one

wonders  why this strong Government that  has  been

elected  by an overwhelming majority was unable  to

achieve anything in a practical manner. I think  we

now  know the real reason - that they were a  divided

Government.  And  when there  is  division  in  the

Cabinet,  precious little can be done,  as  history

tells  us, unless the dissident vote in the Cabinet

is expelled at the earliest possible opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I congratulate the P.A.P.

Government on having taken this step so  that  they

would have a Cabinet which is of one mind and  will

go  forward  with the programmes and the objectives

that it has set itself. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

for me to say who is right and who is wrong in this

matter.  We do not know the whole facts.  When  one

listens  to  the  statements from  behind  us,  one

imagines  one is hearing the truth. Then  the  very

minute  when Members of the Government get up,  one

thinks that they are telling the truth. Sir,  there

is  something in between which we do not know  and,

therefore, I do not propose to judge them. But as a

citizen of Singapore and as an elected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



Member of this Assembly, I would like to see  that,

so  far as the Cabinet is concerned, there must  be

complete  unanimity.  What  is  discussed  in   the

Cabinet  is  a  matter  for  the  members  of   the

Cabinet - for  them alone - and not for  anybody  else,

not  even  for  your  ears, Mr  Speaker.  What  is

discussed in the Cabinet is completely secret.  But

over  the last four or five days, Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  have had a number of occasions in this Assembly

when   what   was  discussed  in  the  Cabinet - even

memoranda - was  sought to be produced  which  should

only  be  available to the eyes of Cabinet members.

Therefore, Sir, there was a weakness in the  P.A.P.

Government which had resulted in in-action on their

part  in  so  far  as  the beneficial  effects  for

Singapore   were  concerned.  I  think  the   Prime

Minister  must  take a great deal of responsibility

for   the  present  situation.  He  is  the   Prime

Minister.  He  is  the  head  of  the  Cabinet.   I

appreciate,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that in the  Cabinet

they  are  all equal. But if I may borrow a  phrase

from  the Hon, the Minister for Finance who is  not

here tonight, the Prime Minister is more equal when

he  is  in  the  Cabinet  than  any  other  Cabinet

Minister.  I  think it was his duty,  not  only  to

himself  but  to  the country, to have  taken  very

early steps to get rid of this dissenting voice  in

the  Cabinet.  So, therefore, to  that  extent  the

Prime  Minister must take a great deal of blame  on

his shoulders for not having acted earlier, and for

having acted at a late hour when he did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Opposition, so far as

the State of Singapore was concerned, there were  a

lot   of  rumours  flying  around  that  there  was

dissension  in the Cabinet - that Ong  Eng  Guan  was

challenging the leadership. The rumours were  thick

and rife, Mr Speaker, Sir, for one reason, because

the   Press  dare  not  publish  anything.  To  the

Minister  for Culture, I would say this, that  when

the  Press is not free to print and publish  things

as it thinks fit, then we must be content to assume

that  rumour  is  right and gossip  is  right,  and

anyone  is  liable  to believe the  most  dangerous

gossip which might be to the great detriment of the

State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what could the Prime Minister have done? It

was   within  his  power - I  will  go  further,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, and say that it was his absolute duty

in  those  circumstances to  have  taken  steps  to

dismiss this difficult Minister from his Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked the Minister for National

Development during the debate on the Budget  speech

how  he  was  going to build all  those  houses,  I

suppose  it was Cabinet solidarity which  gave  the

impression  to  the House that the statement  which

the  Minister for National Development had released

to  the  Press was not disagreed to by the Cabinet,

if  I  may say so. At that time, the Prime Minister

and  his colleagues knew that the Minister was  out

of  line to the extent that he was releasing to the

Press  a  statement which, on the face of  it,  was

committing the Government to an expenditure of $400

million  in  five  years,  when  the  Minister  for

Finance himself said that the Government could  not

afford  it.  And  yet the Prime  Minister  took  no

action.  Why did he not take any action? By  virtue

of  the  Constitution,  by  virtue  of  the  powers

entrusted in his hands, he and he alone could  have

done it. All he had to do was to go to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara and say, "I want this Minister  out

of  my  Cabinet," and the Minister would have  been

out  in a jiffy. But he was not. He remained for  a

long  time  like  a  sore on the  Cabinet  and  the

Cabinet  was not able to move this way or that  way

because  it  did  not know what  the  Minister  for

National  Development would do  next.  He  was  the

source  of weakness in the Cabinet that caused  the

P.A.P.  Government not to be able  to  do  anything

over the last 14 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the matter gets even more

difficult  from the point of view of the  State  of

Singapore when one thinks that the Member for  Hong

Lim might still have been addressed as the Minister

for National Development had he not been so unwise,

as  matters turned out, to challenge the leadership

of  the  Prime  Minister at his own Party  meeting.

Reading  the papers, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  got  the

impression  that  if  the  Minister  for   National

Development had not chosen that particular time  to

challenge the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



leadership  of the Prime Minister or the collective

leadership as they prefer to call it - I will call it

the collective leadership of the P.A.P. as embodied

in the leadership of the Prime Minister - I think he

might still have been sitting over there. Would the

country then have had to wait for another 14 months

before  the Minister for National Development  took

it into his head to challenge the leadership of the

P.A.P.? No, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Party  in

power  owes a greater duty to the State  than  this

Party  in  power did, in fact, show to  the  State.

Sir,  the  events of the last 14 months have  shown

that,  if there is a conflict between the interests

of the Party and the interests of the State, unless

the  Party  in  power is prepared to  place  itself

above  its own interests - and in the final analysis,

it  is  the interests of the State that counts - then

it  is the Party which has to be sacrificed and not

the  State. However, Sir, I congratulate  the  Hon.

the  Prime  Minister that action was not taken  too

late. Action was in fact taken. But what I do  hold

against him is this. That tie took it so late.  But

no-t too late perhaps, let us hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, in the

introduction to his opening speech, said, in col. 5

of Hansard as reported:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government does not wish to give the

impression  that there have not been  mistakes  and

shortcomings during the past year. It is aware that

some   of  its  measures  should  have  been   more

carefully  planned and expertly executed,  in  some

instances, it moved too fast and without  preparing

public opinion adequately for the changes. Some  of

the  legislation  resulted  in  inconveniences   or

misunderstandings which could have been avoided  by

a    little   more   foresight,   a   little   more

consultation,   discussion  and   a   little   more

explanation.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  you  will  remember  the  very

arrogant  attitude of the Minister for  Labour  and

Law  when  the  Opposition Members  criticised  his

Bills.  He would tell the Opposition, "You  do  not

know  what you are talking about. You have not even

read the Bill. Even if you have read the Bill,  you

have not understood it." These were invariably  the

replies  one  got  from the Hon, the  Minister  for

Labour and Law. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not deny the

high  intelligence and the high  qualities  of  the

Minister for Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



and  Law.  They are entirely in proportion  to  his

political  attainment. That I will admit.  But  for

the  Minister  for  Labour and Law  to  accuse  the

Opposition, maybe a Member of it, and to  say  that

he  has read the section and has not understood  it

when  he himself could not find the answers to  the

questions put, is a little short of not playing the

game.  It is this attitude over the last year which

has,   to   some  extent,  contributed   to   their

shortcomings and their mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Assembly with you, Mr Speaker, with

the  Government  and us of the  Opposition  is  the

Legislature. We are the three necessary ingredients

of a Legislature and the Legislature, as the Member

for  Hong  Lim has expounded, is one of  the  three

bodies which carry out the democratic processes  of

this  country - the Legislature, the  Executive  and

the   Judicature.  In  the  Legislature,  you,  Mr

Speaker,  see  that we do not go to war  too  much,

they  on  the  opposite side to govern  and  we  to

criticise.  When  listening  to  the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Law,  I found that  he  was  sometimes

impatient  when  criticism  was  levelled  at   his

legislation. However, Sir, I think these  were  all

mistakes of the past and I hope in future  we  will

get  on  quite  nicely  as  a  Legislature  if  the

Minister for Labour and Law does not think that all

of us on this side of the House do not know what we

are  talking  about, particularly when  he  himself

does not have the answers to the questions posed to

him!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government said that they were sorry

they  did all these things without preparing public

opinion  adequately for the changes.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  you  will remember that when the question  of

Political  Secretaries was discussed in this  House

and  the  necessity  for creating  an  extra  civil

service  post  was  discussed, the  Prime  Minister

explained  it away by saying that it was necessary,

in  the political context of the present day,  that

these  particular  people  who  were  appointed  as

Political   Secretaries  should  be  so   appointed

because  they were the persons who would  interpret

the  Government to the masses and, in  turn,  bring

the masses to the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



At that time I asked the Prime Minister  what

necessity there was for such appointments  when  he

himself  had proudly claimed that he and his  Party

were deeply rooted in the masses. However, I had to

be  satisfied  with the explanation  of  the  Prime

Minister   then.   How  now  the   position   where

legislation  has been enacted without  consultation

and  without  putting it across to members  of  the

public?  When  the tobacco duties and petrol  taxes

were  being  raised - this subject, I believe,  comes

under   the   portfolio   of   the   Minister   for

Finance - what was his Political Secretary doing? Was

he  in his small air-conditioned room all the time,

or was he out of it; and if he was out of it, where

was  he?  According  to the Member  for  Cairnhill,

apparently  he was with the Political Secretary  to

the  Minister for Labour and Law. He was apparently

not  doing his job, and he was paid $1,100 of  good

Straits  currency for not doing his  job.  So,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  some of the things  we  have  heard

during  the course of the last year or so  seem  to

take  on  a  different hue when  we  examine  those

statements in the light of what has happened during

the  last  14 months and in the light of,  shall  I

say,  the excuses the Government is now making  for

the year of inaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr Speaker, Sir, in column 5 of Hansard

dated  20th July, 1960, the last paragraph  of  the

Introduction to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But these are errors arising from zeal and

impatience to get things done.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, there is nothing wrong with zeal

and  there  is  nothing wrong with impatience.  The

P.A.P. is  a very young Government judged  by  all

standards.  That  is not a discredit.  In  a  young

country  like Singapore, it is quite right  that  a

young Government should be in power. Probably  they

can  reflect the views and Opinions of  the  people

better  than the old fogeys who are about 60  years

old.  But  young people have zeal and young  people

are  impatient. Those things in themselves are  not

wrong.  They could be channelised into a source  of

power.  But what was really wrong with the  P.A.P.,

Mr Speaker, Sir, was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



not  zeal and impatience, but a lot of zealotry  on

their  part - impatience  profound!  They  could  not

understand  anybody  else's point  of  view.  Their

point  of  view  was the only point  of  view  that

mattered.  Nobody else could be right because  they

thought  A was X and therefore A had to be  X.  The

P.A.P. may  have learned that zeal and  impatience

are  good things because these are the things  that

get things done; but zealotry, Mr Speaker, Sir, is

a  thing  to be condemned in the strongest possible

terms,  and  that is what they were suffering  from

during the last year or so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may come to the section on

"Finance" - I was wondering whether anybody  in  this

House  would  touch  on  that  particular  section.

Everybody  in this House has been saying  that  the

financial condition of Singapore was the most vital

thing  for  its  survival and yet  not  one  single

Member  on the Government side decided to  go  into

the  question  of  the  finances  of  the  country.

Perhaps,  Sir, it is because the Hon. the  Minister

for  Finance  is  not  here tonight  but  elsewhere

looking  for money. Sir, I will read the first  two

paragraphs  under "Finance" in column 5 of  Hansard

dated 20th July, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Members will recall that a year ago the State of

Singapore   faced  many  financial   and   economic

difficulties.  There was a deficit looming  on  the

horizon. There was considerable uncertainty  as  to

the  stability of the political foundation  of  the

State  and  this led to hesitation on the  part  of

potential investors. Our two great neighbours,  the

Federation  of  Malaya and Indonesia,  then  looked

upon the events in Singapore with some reservation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far-sighted policies of the Government

announced last year were firmly carried out and  in

12 short months we have seen a complete reversal of

position.'



<br><br>Might  I read the last sentence again, Mr Speaker,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The far-sighted policies of the Government

announced last year were firmly carried out and  in

12  short  months we have seen a complete  reversal

of, position.'



<br><br>Now, the first statement reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Members will recall that a year ago the State of

Singapore   faced  many  financial   and   economic

difficulties.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



Putting  that into reverse, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

State  of  Singapore  now is an abundantly  wealthy

State.  To  complete the reversal of  position,  we

have no financial and no economic difficulties.  If

English  means  anything at  all,  that  is  how  I

interpret  it.  So  today  the  position   of   the

Government  is that they have no financial  and  no

economic difficulties. There was a deficit  looming

in the horizon. We are now told that the deficit is

now a surplus of $9 million. I quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There was considerable uncertainty as to the

stability  of  the  political  foundation  of  the

State...'.



<br><br>There  is  now a great deal of confidence  in  "the

stability  of  the  political  foundation  of   the

State". And yet the Hon, the Prime Minister said in

his  opening  Address thanking the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara for his speech that there was a lot of  play

underground which is undermining the State. I  read

on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...and this led to hesitation on the part of

potential investors.'



<br><br>The  reverse  position, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is  that

people   are   now  coming  in  to  get  themselves

investments in Singapore. The reverse position then

is  that  the  Federation of Malaya  and  Indonesia

which  "looked  upon the events in  Singapore  with

some   reservation"   are   now   completely    and

wholeheartedly  behind us, particularly  our  great

neighbour, the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second paragraph goes on to

read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The State ended the year's budget with a small

surplus of $9 million.'



<br><br>That  is  the  budgetary  position.  To  state   it

shortly, there was a surplus of $9 million for  the

year  ending  1959. When the Government  came  into

power,  it anticipated a threatened deficit of  $14

million.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  I  have  some  little

experience  of financial matters, how  budgets  are

worked,   how  they  are  drafted,  how  they   are

presented, and how eventually, from a big  deficit,

a   big   surplus  ensues.  Judging  by  what   the

Government  of Singapore has done during  the  last

year, the number of buildings that have not gone up

but could have gone up under the Budget,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



the  number of pay-cuts that have been imposed, and

the  number of posts that have not been  filled,  I

venture to hazard a guess that the surplus  is  not

in  the  region of $9 million, but I  think  it  is

double  that  figure.  However,  this  is  only  an

opinion of mine at the moment. We will soon know it

when  the  accounts  for the year  1959  have  been

published and are made available to the public.  In

saying that, I also appreciate that the accountants

are  very good at figures. There is a phrase  known

as "an adjusting entry". We know how some companies

work  their balance-sheets when they want  to  hide

surpluses.  They  put  it  here  and  they  put  it

there - what  they  call it is "an adjusting  entry".

The  final result is that less profits are made  by

the  companies  and  less  surpluses  made  by  the

Government. [Interruption]. Yes, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

less  profits made by companies so that they  might

evade  taxation,  and less surpluses  made  by  the

Government in order that they might evade criticism

from  their civil servants whose salaries were  cut

because a threatened deficit was in the offing!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next paragraph in column 6

of Hansard dated 20th July, 1960, goes on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Relations with Indonesia entered a stage of

cordiality.  This was principally  due  to  a  more

realistic  appraisal of relations between  the  two

States.  With regard to the Federation  of  Malaya,

the  danger  then  was  that the  Federation  might

pursue policies which did not take into account the

legitimate interests of Singapore. This danger  was

happily averted. On major matters of financial  and

economic  policy,  the two Governments  have  taken

pains...'.



<br><br>Mark  the  phrase,  Mr Speaker, Sir -  "have  taken

pains".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...to carry out mutual consultations.'



<br><br>And  the given examples over which they have  taken

pains are interesting:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Examples of these are the Income Tax (Amendment)

Bill,  the new Currency Agreement, fiscal proposals

over  a  broad field and, last but not  least,  the

current talks on the Common Commodity Market.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, if I may quote the last sentence

first:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...taken pains to carry out mutual consultations

[on the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill].'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, whether they like  it  or  not,

consultations must take place on amendments to  the

Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, because the Income Tax

Ordinances in both territories are on a Pan-Malayan

basis. There is no question of taking pains in that

matter. It is just a question of a "must".  On  the

new  Currency Agreement, of course, there  must  be

consultations,   because  the   currency   question

affects  Malaya, Singapore and other parts in  this

area. The "fiscal proposals over a broad field"  is

a  broad clause put to us. Nobody knows what  those

broad  fiscal  proposals are. Last but  not  least,

"the current talks on the Common Commodity Market".

Well,  those talks are now in progress. We  do  not

know  what the eventual results of those talks will

be,  but I do hope that the Government will be able

to  do  something  in those negotiations  with  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this statement by the

Government  that they have taken pains  to  consult

with   the  Federation  of  Malaya  in  order  that

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya might act in

unison  and go along the same path both politically

and   economically,  so  that  in  the  very   near

future - if   not   today,  then   tomorrow - the   two

territories  might come together in a merger,  when

one  examines the present position with  regard  to

these  consultations  between  the  Federation   of

Malaya  and our Government, one finds that some  of

the  things  that are being done in the  Federation

are  things  which  are not  in  the  interests  of

Singapore. A number of things are being done in the

Federation today, Mr Speaker, Sir, which are going

to bring about a financial loss to the territory of

Singapore.   I   wonder   if   there   have    been

consultations  on  these matters  between  the  two

territories before such action has been taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a stock

exchange  has  been  set up in  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  I also understand that a rubber market  is

being set up in the Federation of Malaya. These are

two  important  things which are going  to  detract

attention from the State of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  as a commercial and financial centre  of

Malaya,  and as a trading centre. We may  not  feel

the  results  today or tomorrow, Mr  Speaker,  but

within  the next year or so the effects  will  most

certainly be felt. Another small instance  where  I

dare  say no consultation has taken place is  this:

formerly  it was possible to get goods through  the

Straits  of  Johore,  over the causeway  on  c.i.f.

Singapore invoice, Mr Speaker, without the Customs

asking that the market price of the goods should be

declared  for  purposes of Customs  duty.  Anything

that  had  previously been set out on  the  invoice

price  was  accepted for purposes of Customs  duty.

But  the  present  position  in  such  matters,   I

understand,  is  that it is not the c.i.f. invoice

price  on which Customs duty is leviable,  but  the

market  price.  In other words, it  is  the  c.i.f.

invoice  price plus something else on which Customs

duty  is leviable. Now, what is the effect  of  the

present  position? The effect of it is  this:  many

traders, instead of using the port of Singapore for

the  landing of such goods, are in future going  to

use  Port Swettenham or some other port in  Malayan

territory. That is a loss to Singapore financially.

Have  there  been consultations on such matters  as

this? The impression one gets, Mr Speaker, is that

the causeway is there but that the entente cordiale

has not gone across the causeway yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Prime Minister, what

efforts  he has made to reach cordial understanding

with  the  Prime  Minister  of  the  Federation  of

Malaya. Occasionally, we hear of the Prime Minister

meeting  the  Federation  Prime  Minister  at   the

Airport.  That,  of course, is an act  of  courtesy

which very properly the Prime Minister of Singapore

accords  to  the Prime Minister of the  Federation.

But  what we want to know, Sir, is whether the  two

Prime  Ministers  of  the two  territories - the  two

territories  should  get together  politically  and

economically - have got down to serious  talks.  Such

talks  could  do  more to bring about  an  eventual

merger of the two territories than anything else at

the moment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we find in the same col. 6:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Applications for exemption under the Pioneer

Industries  Ordinance alone give  a  total  paid-up

capital  of  more than $101 million from  13  major

concerns. These new industries range over fields as

wide  apart  as oil refining, rolling of  aluminium

products, flour milling, sugar refining, production

of  foodstuffs  such as chocolate, condensed  milk,

etc.'



<br><br>We  know,  during  the course of this  debate,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that of these 13 applications, one of

them  is  from  the Shell Company, and  that  alone

accounts for a little more than 50 per cent of  the

$101  million  from  the  13  major  concerns.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we know that Shell has  started  its

work  and  that  in  a year or  so  it  will  start

operating,  and, as a result of that operation,  we

will  benefit  both in the labour  market  and  the

financial market; and, economically, it will  be  a

very  good thing. But what I would like to ask  the

Prime  Minister is this: what of the other 12 major

concerns?  All we know is that their capitals  have

been  paid up; that is all. That, in itself,  means

nothing. Have they started work? Have they got  the

sites?  Has  the Government given them sites?  Have

they  purchased sites? Have they started to  build?

Are  they going to build now or three years  hence?

The  Prime  Minister says, "If we don't build  next

year,    we've    had   it,   boys!" - forgive    the

colloquialism, Sir, but I think it brings  out  the

point very well, and I think the Prime Minister  is

correct, too! Could we then be told whether the  12

pioneer  industries,  over and  above  contributing

monies  by  way  of  paid-up  capital,  have   done

anything  further  to  set up their  industries  in

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr Speaker, Sir, in col. 7:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The most important single objective of the

economic  policy of the Government is  to  increase

the rate of gross capital formation in the State.'



<br><br>And at the end of this column, Sir, it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The greater part of the money for public

investment,  however, must be found  from  our  own

domestic resources.'



<br><br>Now,  "the  greater part of the  money  for  public

investment,  however, must be found  from  our  own

domestic resources." "Domestic resources" could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



mean  a  number  of things, Mr Speaker.  It  could

either  mean  the money from the Central  Provident

Fund or from such other fund. But I will be happier

if  the  Prime Minister could assure us that  these

monies  would  not come - most of it anyway -  from  the

Central  Provident  Fund, but from  the  people  of

Singapore  themselves, which would be an indication

of  the  confidence  they  have  in  the  State  of

Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that

there  is plenty of money in Singapore, but whether

there  is plenty of confidence in Singapore in  the

Government, I am doubtful. And the way  the  P.A.P.

Government  has gone about it during  the  last  14

months,  Mr Speaker, has not induced the  creation

of   confidence  in  the  mercantile  community  in

Singapore.  With  due respect to the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Law, I think he is one  of  the  worst

offenders.  He  really  is. You  will  recall,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the time when there was trouble in  a

pineapple  factory. We will not discuss the  merits

or demerits of that strike. The Minister for Labour

and  Law was so dissatisfied with the behaviour  of

the  employer  that he threatened to  lock  him  up

under  the P.P.S.O. He might not be joking so  much

today,  but was he joking! I can think of no  other

rational  explanation for the Minister  for  Labour

and  Law  talking like that except that it was  one

big joke. Persons in responsible positions cannot -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Joke!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - cannot enjoy the luxury of being able

to  joke, Sir, because somebody else might take  it

seriously; the price he pays for being the Minister

for  Labour  and  Law is that he cannot  joke  any

more!  Not even if he be a joker, Sir. So when  the

Minister  for Labour and Law thundered in front  of

the  Pressmen, "I shall lock that chap up under the

P.P.S.O.".  naturally the mercantile  community - you

know,  Sir, capital is very shy, shyer than  a  16-year  old maiden - would bend its head down, and take

itself  somewhere else - worse than a shy maiden.  If

the Minister for Labour and Law were to create that

impression on shy capital, where then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



is  the Minister for Finance going to get his money

from  "domestic resources"? Except from the Central

Provident  Fund, which is the money from  the  poor

clerk who is being made to save compulsorily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in col. 8, on Industrial

Expansion, a statement is made:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Several factors which have generated confidence

and   stimulated  industrial  expansion  are  worth

noting.  They  must be strengthened to  consolidate

the advances we have made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these must be a firm and stable

Government  whose policy and actions are consistent

and predictable.'



<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  in  other  words,  what  that

paragraph seeks to show is that the Government must

behave  in  such a way that people will know  today

what  it is likely to do tomorrow, or even the  day

after. The basic difficulty in Singapore today, Mr

Speaker, Sir, is this: that the people do not  know

what  is  going to happen tomorrow. That really  is

the  trouble.  If, by some magic, the P.A.P. could

produce a wand and wave it over Singapore and  make

the  people believe that, believe me, Sir, all  our

troubles  are at an end. The monies that are  being

locked up either in banks or in safe deposit  boxes

or  in  some other places where the prying eyes  of

the  Government cannot see them will certainly come

out.  So  let  me  give a word  of  advice  to  the

Government - if  they will accept it - that  the  thing

they  must do is to see that their behaviour should

create  this impression on the people of Singapore;

that  what  the Minister for Labour says today,  he

will  say tomorrow, and he will say it for the next

four years. If the Minister for Labour and Law  can

get  that  across  to them, then our  troubles  are

over. Instead of which, the Minister for Labour and

Law - when  he  says anything, says it  in  the  most

dynamic manner of which he alone is capable - gets up

and  says,  "This is a Government of the  workers."

And when he says that, Sir, the capitalists tremble

in  front  of him. And on top of that, he says,  "I

shall  lock  you  up  under  the  P.P.S.O. if  you

misbehave  yourselves." Do not forget, Sir,  he  is

the  Minister  for Law too! Then,  of  course,  the

position  becomes desperate for the employer.  What

does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



he  do?  He either locks his money up or  he  slips

across the causeway - at least the Government do  not

tell him that over there. If the employer does  not

go  across the causeway, maybe he goes to Hongkong.

And  the net result is a flight of capital. And the

poor Minister for Finance has to fly to America  to

get  money.  If his own ex-colleague, the  Minister

for  Labour and Law, would only behave himself, and

work  together with his ex-colleague, the  Minister

for  Finance, everything would be all right in  the

State  of Singapore. So really, Mr Speaker, it  is

the  Government that brings upon itself all its own

troubles. The State of Singapore is stable, but the

Government is making it most unstable by  its  most

difficult and unpredictable actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is nothing wrong with the statement

that  this  Government  will maintain  the  balance

between employer and employee, with justice to  the

worker.  Who can complain about that? Not even  the

most  reactionary  capitalist  can  complain  about

that.  That  is  a  perfectly just statement  which

should be made by any Minister of any government - be

it  a  capitalist,  ultra-Left wing,  or  socialist

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the statement in the light of what

the  Labour  Ministry does with  regard  to  labour

disputes. A strike takes place. The workers  advice

their union or some other union which rushes to the

scene,  grapples with the problem  as  every  trade

union  should, and after grappling with it,  rushes

off  to  the  Ministry  of  Labour,  which  is  the

Ministry  of Law too, I am told. The Minister,  who

has  been  insistent  on this power  in  his  Trade

Unions  Bill will then send a chit to the  employer

to  come.  And  he must come, which he  accordingly

does.  Or the Minister even telephones him to come,

and he comes pronto. And what happens, Sir, is that

the  employer is "persuaded" - remember, Sir,  he  is

not  allowed  to  take with him an  advocate  or  a

solicitor, because that advocate or solicitor might

tell  him to do things which he might not  want  to

do. Therefore, he goes on his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



own  and the Minister "persuades" him to take  such

and such a step. And if he should be so foolish  as

not  to  be  persuaded  by the  Minister,  terrible

trouble will ensue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me cite to the House some instances of

how  the  Ministry of Labour and Law settled  these

strikes.   Mr,  Speaker,  Sir,  I  know   of   one

particular strike because I was personally involved

in   it   long  before  the  present  Trade  Unions

Ordinance came into force. There was a strike in  a

bakery  in  Sembawang. The workers went  on  strike

and,  in  accordance  with the  usual  trade  union

practice, pickets took up their lawful position and

would  not  allow persons into the bakery.  Now  it

happened that the employer and his wife were living

on  the  premises. Sir, they had to go through  the

pickets to reach the premises, where they lived and

slept  during  the  night. The pickets  refused  to

admit  them.  The woman - she was 45 to 50  years  of

age, and as women do, because they have a touching

faith   in  human  rights - insisted  on  going   in,

whereupon  the biggest of the trade unionists  gave

her  a good wallop. Then, of course, she knew  that

the  trade  unionists meant business. So she  left.

She  was no longer, beguiled by her illusions about

the  rights  of  women. She went to the  police.  I

believe  there  is  a police station  at  the  13th

milestone in Sembawang. She went and made a  report

there that a big brute of a male had walloped her - a

poor, defenceless female. She made the report,  and

what did the policeman tell her? "Oh, saya ta'boleh

champor  dalam ini hal la. If it is a strike,  saya

ta'boleh. The Minister for Labour and Law has  told

me that I cannot interfere." So this poor woman - the

trade  unionist  had walloped her, and  the  police

would  not help her - turned to the last-known remedy

that  a  democratic State provides. She went  to  a

solicitor.  The solicitor took this  woman  to  the

Commissioner  for Labour and put the case  to  him,

not  on  the basis of a trade union matter, but  on

the  basis  of the violation of human rights,  that

is, assault of a defenceless woman by, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



would  not say a brute of a trade unionist, Sir,  a

big  trade  unionist. The Commissioner for  Labour,

who  was  a  human  sort of  chap - he  was  a  civil

servant - was   really  worried   about   the   whole

situation.  He  said that he would  look  into  it.

Knowing  how Government works, Sir, I take it  that

what  he  meant was to tell me, "While  I  entirely

sympathise with you, there is not a thing I can  do

unless  I  consult my Minister."  So  I  left  him,

knowing that the matter was in safe hands. He  must

have  consulted the Minister, but I  did  not  hear

from  the civil servant. I also understood that  to

mean that the Minister had told him to mind his own

business.   Then,  Sir,  we  appeared  before   his

Parliamentary Secretary. The negotiating  team  was

there   and   I   put  this  proposition   to   the

Parliamentary Secretary. I said, "Before we go into

the question of the rights or wrongs of the strike,

I want you to put a question to the trade unionists

on  the  other side. Ask them whether  it  is  good

trade  union practice - P.A.P. or any other political

party - for  a trade unionist to strike a woman  when

that  woman  wants  to enter her  own  house."  The

Parliamentary Secretary is not here. Unfortunately,

he   refused  to  put  the  question.  But  he  had

sufficient  decency, Sir, to  put  his  head  down,

which   meant,   of  course,  that  he   completely

disagreed  with the assault on the woman.  But  the

state  of  affairs in Singapore was such  that  the

question  was  not  put  and  an  answer  was   not

obtained. Sir, this may be a small story. This  may

affect  one  woman. This may affect one  employer - a

poor  baker.  But, Sir, the story gets around.  You

know, Sir, the freedom of the Press. The story gets

around  quicker. The grapevine is faster  than  the

written  word. So it gets round all the  employers,

and  they  know this is how the Ministry settles  a

strike between an employer and an employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give another instance if the Minister for

Labour  and  Law  is interested. This  concerns  an

employee of an ice-cream factory - one of the vendors

of  ice-cream.  On  a number of occasions,  he  was

found  to  pilfer the ice-cream. Whereupon,  in  my

humble view, and I think in the humble view of  the

Minister for Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



and  Law too, the employer, in those circumstances,

is  entitled  to dismiss his employee without  pay,

which he did. He did dismiss him, and this resulted

in a strike. There was a visit to the Ministry. The

net  result of the negotiations was this. "Yes, you

can  dispense with him, but give him three  months'

severance pay." Three months or two months - I forget

now - it  is  immaterial.  The  point  is  that   the

employer  had to pay severance pay. Now  these  are

the  things  which  upset  the  confidence  of  the

employers  in  the Government If an employer  finds

that  he  is unable to dismiss a dishonest employee

and  that  the Ministry of Labour and Law  protects

such   dishonest  employee,  what  confidence   can

capital have in Singapore, I ask you, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give yet another case. There is a restaurant in

Stamford  Road which is doing well. The cook,  like

some  cooks, took a knife and chased the  employer.

One  would  think  that in those circumstances  the

employer  is  entitled to dismiss this chap.  Which

she   did - brave  woman,  but  foolish  woman.  What

happened  was  a  strike.  Result - a  visit  to  the

Ministry  of Labour and Law. The cook  is  back  in

employment,  Sir,  and the strike  is  settled.  He

still cooks, but whether he still wields a knife, I

do  not  know. Perhaps the Minister for Labour  and

Law has persuaded him to discard it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then, Sir, are some of the things that are

happening  in Singapore which tend to detract  from

the  climate  of confidence which the Minister  for

Finance  is so eagerly and so anxiously seeking  to

establish. May I say to the Prime Minister that  it

is  important that all his Ministers work in unison

to  one  end and purpose? It is no use one Minister

saying to the man with capital, "I want you to come

in.  Your  interests  will be protected."  And  the

Minister  for  Labour and Law doing something  else

which  the  employer  knows is  not  good  for  his

interests.  This  then,  Sir,  is  the   state   of

Singapore in the month of August 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in col. 9 of the Hansard, Vol. 13, No. 1,

under  "Communications, Construction and  Housing",

this statement is made:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shipping, civil aviation and telecommunications

play  a  vital  role  in  the  economic  life   of

Singapore.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



Now,   might  I  just  deal  with  civil  aviation?

Singapore has an international airport, and it  has

been  serving as an international airport  for  the

Peninsula of Malaya, and the Peninsula of Malaya is

currently composed of two independent States - one is

the Federation of Malaya and the other is the State

of  Singapore.  The Government make  the  statement

that  they  have been at pains with the  Federation

Government to come to some understanding where both

of  them  will  walk in line and not walk  away  or

against  each other. And yet, Sir, we read  in  the

newspapers that the Federation of Malaya  is  going

to  establish  an  international airport  in  Kuala

Lumpur.   Sir,   if  and  when  that   airport   is

established in the Federation, even if it does  not

entirely   kill   the  international   airport   in

Singapore,  it must detract from the traffic  which

this  airport  would  attract  to  itself.  If  one

airplane  company makes two flights to Malaya,  one

will land in Kuala Lumpur and one in Singapore.  In

simple  arithmetic, it means that we will  lose  at

least  50  per  cent of our air  traffic  to  Kuala

Lumpur.  I  understand from  the  papers  that  the

Federation of Malaya is going to spend $40  million

on  the development of this civil airport. The  net

result  of all that expenditure will be, Sir,  that

Singapore will be the loser. Things are being  done

there which are not to the benefit of Malaya  as  a

whole. I ask the Prime Minister to take such  steps

as  he is able to, to persuade the Federation  that

in  the  matter  of economic survival,  so  far  as

Malaya  is concerned, we are one, and any  economic

disaster  to Singapore must be a political  problem

to  the Federation. I think, Sir, there are factors

on  both sides which must bring us together, and it

is  our  Prime Minister who must put it  across  to

them. Unless we do these things quickly, things are

going  to be done there which will eventually leave

us  with  a lot of population and nothing  to  feed

them on. We will lose our airport, we will lose our

port, and what then is left? We cannot industrially

expand because the Minister for Labour and Law just

takes  the  knife away from the man  and  lets  him

loose,  as in the instance of the cook I have  just

mentioned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the things which I wish to

touch upon in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may come to the Prime Minister's speech when

he  moved  the motion to thank the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.  He  gave  an exposition of  the  political

situation in Singapore as he saw it. And who is  in

a better position to see it than the Prime Minister

himself,  with all the facilities and opportunities

which  the State provides for him? When I read  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech, quite  frankly  I

had  no inkling that these things were going on  in

Singapore. How should I? How should any  Member  of

the  Opposition know that these things  were  going

on?  Perhaps the Member for Cairnhill may be  in  a

better  position to know it, but the  rest  of  the

Members of the Opposition are not in a position  to

know  it.  Therefore, when the Prime Minister  made

his  speech on the motion, we on this side  of  the

House were quite frankly surprised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there can be no doubt that the Government is

wedded  to, and believes in, a democratic  form  of

government.  On  this side of the  House,  we  also

believe  in  a  democratic form of government.  The

P.A.P. say, and keep on saying, that  they  are  a

democratic,  socialistic, non-Communist  Party.  If

the Prime Minister will forgive me, I would like to

analyse those phrases which he must have had a hand

in  inventing  when  the P.A.P.,  was  founded  and

promulgated  its  policies and  its  hopes  to  the

people  of Singapore. "Socialistic and democratic".

Sir,  as  I understand a socialist and a Communist.

The  difference,  Sir, between a  Communist  and  a

socialist  is in the manner in which they  seek  to

attain their objective. The Socialists want  to  do

certain things in the State in a certain way.  They

want  a  certain  state  of  affairs  reached.  The

Communists  also  want the same  state  of  affairs

reached.  But the difference between the Socialists

and  the  Communists, as I understand it,  Sir,  is

that  the Communists want to employ violent methods

to upset the existing system of government in order

that  they might achieve their objective  the  more

quickly; and they also believe that the only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



way  socialism  can be achieved is through  violent

revolution and that the revolution should be at the

beck  and  call of the working classes  namely,  in

political  jargon, the proletariat. Sir,  that  was

the theory propounded by Karl Marx in 1848 when  he

put  out his Communist manifesto. Since then,  Sir,

much time has passed and there has been in Europe a

discarding of the revolutionary method of attaining

socialism  in  favour  of the democratic  form.  So

that, basically then, the only difference between a

Communist  and a Socialist is the manner  in  which

each   of   them  seeks  to  attain  the   ultimate

objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the P.A.P. leadership talk about a

democratic,  socialistic non-Communist  government,

what  exactly do they mean? When they say they  are

social  democrats, it means that they have rejected

the idea of a violent change of society in order to

achieve  their own objectives, and that they  agree

to  adopt  the existing state machinery to  achieve

that  position.  Where then is  the  need  for  the

phrase    "non-Communistic"?   It    is    entirely

unnecessary. I think the Prime Minister  knows  it.

The  Minister for Labour and Law knows it, and  the

Minister for Culture also knows it. The word  "non-Communistic", from the point of view of the English

language,  serves  no useful  purpose.  But  I  can

hardly believe that the Prime Minister who, as  the

Member  for  Joo  Chiat has said, gained  a  triple

first at Cambridge could not have used the word for

no  reason  whatsoever. He and his colleagues  must

have had a specific purpose. Why then must they use

that  phrase? Sir, we have been told in this House,

"You  are  a colonialist; I am an anti-colonialist;

he  is a pro-colonialist," but nobody has said,  "I

am   a   non-colonialist."  Does  the  phrase  mean

anything, Sir? "You are a colonialist; I  am  anti-colonial;  he is pro-colonial" - those three  phrases

have    some   meaning.   But   "I   am   a    non-colonialist" - what  does  that   mean?   "I   am   a

Communist; I am an anti-Communist; I am a pro-Communist:  I  am  a non-Communist." Is the  word  "non-Communistic"  so senseless, so meaningless  in  the

context  which the Prime Minister seeks to  use  it

now?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



What  then is it intended to serve? Is it  intended

to show a group of persons in Singapore that we are

not  against them, so long as they are not  against

us?  Surely  the events of the last 14 months  have

shown the Prime Minister, and he has said so,  that

there  is a grouping of forces at the lower  level.

The  impression I got from his speech was that they

are grouping with evil intent, but not to upset the

Lee  Kuan Yew Government. If it is merely to  upset

the Lee Kuan Yew Government, Sir, it is a matter of

small importance to the State of Singapore. It  is,

of  course, a matter of great importance to the Lee

Kuan  Yew  Government. But that is not  the  point,

Sir,If it is merely the question of upsetting  the

Lee Kuan Yew Government, I would say, good luck  to

them, because I am in the Opposition. But, Sir,  it

means something more than that. Surely that is what

the  Prime  Minister meant. It is not the upsetting

of  the Lee Kuan Yew Government that is going on at

the  base,  but it is the upsetting  of  the  whole

social fabric, the way of living, and the manner of

government that is at stake, not the Lee  Kuan  Yew

Government.  The  Lee Kuan Yew Government  is  just

incidental to the problem. It might have  been  the

Lim Yew Hock Government or any other government,  I

do not know. These are personal factors that do not

enter into the picture, Sir. They just happen to be

in  situ  at that time. But the stakes are greater.

That is the impression I got listening to the Prime

Minister.  Sir,  when you know  that  a  person  is

completely inimical to you and that he is about  to

kill  you,  you do not say, "I am a non-you."  When

the  cobra rears its head up, you do not say to it,

"I  am a non-hater of you", and just stand by.  You

take the nearest stick, if you are fortunate enough

to  get one, and knock it on its head, hoping  that

you will kill it. Sir, if I am convinced that a man

has got a gun in his hand and he is pointing it  at

me,  not merely to frighten me to run away  but  to

kill  me and my family and everything that I  stand

for,  Sir,  would  I be doing the right  thing  for

myself and my family if I merely stood by and said,

"I do not hate you. I do not want to do anything



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



to  you."?  Sir, if the Prime Minister is convinced

that  those  persons at the base are moving  around

with evil intent, not against him merely, Sir - he is

a  passing  figure on the stage of  history - but  if

these people are out not to destroy him only but to

destroy  him  and the way of life and  the  way  of

government that he stands for, then is it not  time

to  drop the phrase "non-Communistic" and just  say

the democratic, socialist Party - the P.A.P.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no use blinking facts. The young

are  anxious.  They  have  plenty  of  zeal.  Their

tendency is to be on the left. It was Bernard  Shaw

who  said that if you are not extreme left in  your

20's,  then you will be an old fossil when you  are

40.  There is plenty of truth in that, Sir. The man

of  progress, the man of ideas at 20, is an extreme

Left.  As the Prime Minister has said, "A tenth  of

an  inch  beyond me, and you are in  the  Communist

camp."  I think he said that in the Assembly,  Sir,

if  you  will remember. Sir, the Prime Minister  in

his  speech has said that there are a lot of people

to  the left of him. If I may therefore use his own

words - they  are not only a tenth of an inch  beyond

his  left,  but  they are a whole  lot  beyond  him

there.  In  which camp then are they, Sir?  On  the

Prime  Minister's own argument,  they  are  in  the

Communist camp. And if the Communist camp is up  to

no good, if it is out to destroy the Prime Minister

because he is the person in power, what will he  do

about  it?  He is the objective, and they  want  to

eliminate him. But it could have been the  Minister

for  Labour  and Law or any other Minister  on  the

Front  bench; that would not matter. The source  of

power  is  the source to be attacked. Because  once

you  kill  the source of power, then you  kill  the

rest. That is the game as I understand it from  the

Prime Minister's speech. And yet, Sir, if the Prime

Minister  does not do anything about it,  will  not

history tell of him, as I have told him today, that

he himself must share a great deal of the blame for

the  inactivity  of the P.A.P. over  the  last  one

year, because the responsibility to eliminate  that

disintegrating  factor was in his hands?  Sir,  the

people of Singapore and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



destiny have placed him where he is today. Let  him

not stand idly by, as he has done over the last  14

months, with regard to a colleague of his.  Sir,  I

could  understand that. It is a human failing which

one  could  admire.  "We were comrades-in-arms;  we

built the Party together; we brought the Party into

power,   and  we  are  in  power."  It  is   always

difficult,  Sir, for one with humanity  in  him  to

discard such an individual even though he may be  a

danger to his Cabinet. But the position here  is  a

whole lot different. It is not the comrade who  has

trodden the road together who is the danger. It  is

not  the comrade who, while treading the road, "has

built a path with me and my friends whereby we have

come  to  power"  who  is the  danger;  but  it  is

someone,  Sir, who is always at the  back  of  your

mind,  who  is  ready to destroy you,  who  is  the

danger.  And if he gives a semblance of wanting  to

help, it is not because he is interested in helping

you,  but  because  he is using  you  for  his  own

ulterior motive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister in his speech has said

that  the  Opposition is not aware of  the  dangers

facing  Singapore.  They are fooling  and  fiddling

when Rome burns. Rome is burning, Sir, because  the

democratic  way  of life is now in peril.  That  is

what  the Prime Minister meant. And he said we were

fiddling with topics such as the restoration of pay

allowances  and kidnapping. Against  that  position

and  that  background, I might even agree with  the

Prime  Minister  that  we were  fiddling,  but  our

excuse  is  that  we  did not know  that  Rome  was

burning.  The  Prime  Minister  knows  that  it  is

burning.  He has got the water-can at his disposal.

I  hope he has plenty of water. If he has, he  must

put  the fire out. If he does not, when he  can  do

so,  then history will judge him as the person  who

failed his destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister, in reply?



<br><br>6.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In reply. Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  have been lectured and heckled in the last  few

days.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



I  think  the  Opposition  mistook  our  calculated

understatement, designed to pitch the tenor of this

debate  on a more serious tone, as one of weakness.

Yesterday the Member for Cairnhill wanted  to  tell

us how we should govern as a Government. Today, the

Member for Farrer Park told us how I should run the

P.A.P. as  a Party. Sir, coming from the  ex-Chief

Minister  who failed dismally in the last  Assembly

to  govern with the consent of the people and  with

the  support of the majority, and from  the  Member

for  Farrer  Park - I am not sure  today  whether  he

belongs to the S.P.A. or whether he has a political

party,  and  I  do  not know  when  he  joined  the

S.P.A. - who told me how to run a political party and

how  to  conduct the Cabinet, I am greatly abashed.

It  is  with  great diffidence,  and  I  hope  with

genuine  humility, that I proffer this as a thought

which  perhaps we should all reflect upon. Sir,  if

they  knew better than we do, and if they  had  the

ability  to do better than we can, then they  would

have  been  here and not we. Some time  before  the

elections  I said that we did not pretend  that  we

could solve all the problems that were facing  us.

It  was quite clear what the state of the game was,

and what any government which assumed power had  to

face. But if it is any consolation to my colleagues

and  me,  I would say that there are very  few  who

could have done better than what my colleagues have

done  in  the  last 14 months. It has  not  been  a

period  of  inactivity. It has  been  an  extremely

intense  period  of change. Lack  of  firmness  and

skill would have meant that the lid would have been

blown  off.  It  was a change of the social  order,

because  once the base upon which power was mounted

altered, then you must expect the reflection of the

basic  power position to find its reactions in  all

echelons  of our society. It was a change in  which

the  English-educated had to  take  a  few  knocks,

according to the scheme of things, and I hope  they

will  continue  to come in and work the  democratic

system.  It  was a change in which the dispossessed

felt  a  lot  of  bitterness and hostility  towards

those who had it good. It was through good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



government   that  the  mutiny  was  contained   in

expectation of a greater change by peaceful and non-violent means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have propounded this theme so often that I

wonder if I could take up the time of the House  in

re-phrasing  the  problem  of  the  revolution   in

Malaya.  Power  was handed over to the  nationalist

groups both here and in the Federation - here,  in  a

contained  and  controlled exercise.  But  all  the

nationalist groups had developed sufficient  sinews

to  grab power from a colonial authority. There  is

nothing  new in this. The problem that we  face  is

the  acceleration  of the catalyst  effect  of  the

Communist  revolt  in 1948. This  brought  a  whole

chain  of  events at a speed which the Indians  and

the Ceylonese did not have to face, and saddled  us

with some real long-term problems, not only of  how

to  take  over the machinery of the State from  the

colonial  authorities,  but  how  to  man  it  with

sufficient effectiveness at all strategic points so

as  to be able to withstand the Communist contender

for ultimate power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a curious way, the Member for Hong Lim and his

two  associates  have  made this  Assembly  a  more

lively  and  interesting place. For the first  time

since  the last elections, the people whom we  have

called  "Left-wing adventurers" -  the definition  of

which  I  gave  when  I moved  the  motion  on  3rd

August - have found a proxy in this Chamber to  shout

their slogans and espouse their cause from time  to

time.  Sir, that is not to say that the Member  for

Hong  Lim  and  his  two associates  are  Left-wing

adventurers. Far from it. For we know that some  of

these    Left-wing   adventurers,   whatever    our

fundamental and abiding differences with them, have

a  depth  of  political beliefs, albeit  misguided.

They  have dedication and are prepared to sacrifice

personal  interest  for their  long-term  political

objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the tragedy of the Malayan Communist

Party  that they made so many fundamental  mistakes

in  Malaya. First, in starting the armed revolution

in  1948. Next, in not gracefully ending it  on  or

before  31st August, 1957, when the Federation  got

their  political independence. And third, in  still

refusing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



recognise   right  now  that  national   solidarity

between  the  various races and their  cultures  in

this  country must come before any socialist  State

can  be  established. All these factors, Sir,  have

driven  them out of the constitutional  arena  into

the   wilderness  where  their  party   and   their

followers - these   Left-wing   adventurers - are    so

completely  cut  off  that  they  can   only   make

themselves heard through the open channels  of  the

Press   and   the  radio  through  proxies.   Their

challenge is the abiding challenge not only to  our

country  but  to the whole uncommitted  regions  of

South-East  Asia, the Middle East and  now  Africa.

Sir,  their challenge is the real challenge to  the

authority of the established State, not the  formal

opposition   in  the  Assembly,  but   the   silent

underground  and  on-the-ground resistance  to  the

policies  of the Government - the vicious  smear  and

distortion - to  turn  the people  sour  against  the

Government. To the extent that they can get some of

their  views heard in this Chamber via proxies  who

are  prepared to lend their services in return  for

expected  support, it is useful to get  the  issues

thoroughly  debated and put into perspective.  What

is  interesting is that the intelligent  Communists

at  the  very  top of the Communist  leadership  in

Malaya know full well the folly and futility of the

orthodox line of class struggle and revolution in a

multi-racial  and  a  multi-cultural  society  like

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Communist point of view, the anti-colonialist line - the united front of all

progressive forces to fight colonialism, feudalism,

imperialism   and   capitalism   in    all    their

manifestations and all their forms - was the best way

to  establish the widest possible support for their

cause;  and  right up till 31st August, 1957,  they

came  near to succeeding. But they recognised  that

the  independence of the Federation on 31st August,

1957,  had radically changed the complexion of  all

anti-colonial  slogans.  Before  that,   to   fight

against   the   State - the  established  constituted

authority   of   the   British   colonialists   and

imperialists - was  to  accord  with  the  slogan  of

uniting  all  classes and social  groups  to  fight

against  the  colonialists. After Merdeka,  he  who

fights the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



established independent nation of the Federation of

Malaya  and its Government becomes a rebel  and  an

enemy of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position in Singapore - as I shall

elaborate  later  on - is not the same.  It  is  this

curious  subtle  distinction between  a  completely

independent   Federation  and  a   semi-independent

Singapore  which, I think, has obscured the  vision

of  many  who,  in their desire to  reduce  complex

truths to simple lies, are egging an1 inciting  the

P.A.P.   Government  to  take   a   plain,   simple

straightforward anti-Communist line. But  there  is

nothing that I said on 3rd August which is a  basic

change  in  the political philosophy or beliefs  of

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am gratified, Sir, that my statements from time

to  time  have stirred and inspired the Member  for

Hong Lim and given him sustenance for his political

slogans.  He  has quoted at great  length  from  my

speeches in the years 1954, 1955 and 1956,  and  in

every one of them there was a fierce consistency in

the  anti-colonialist line. "Unite  and  fight  the

common  enemy. Fight the British." But he  did  not

quote  me  on the meaning and significance  of  the

anti-colonial  struggle after independence  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya. Sir, the Central  Executive

Committee  of  the P.A.P. discussed,  analysed  and

anticipated  the  radical  change  in   the   power

position after independence. For the benefit of the

Member for Hong Lim and the Member for Tanglin, let

me  quote what I have said, not because whatever  I

have said is worthy of being quoted, but because  I

wish  to prove one simple point, that is, that  the

position  has not altered and the P.A.P. line  has

not  changed.  I refer to column 2510  of  Hansard,

Vol.  2  dated  21st  August,  1957.  If  you  will

remember,  Mr Speaker, Sir,, on that  occasion  we

were moving a motion to convey our felicitations to

the  Federation  of Malaya which was  going  to  be

independent ten days from the moment when  we  were

in debate. Let me quote what I said then:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to accede to that request [this was

an  altercation between me and the Chief Secretary]

but  I think we would be deceiving ourselves if  we

do  not realise the deep significance of the change

that will be taking peace after 31st August. At the

moment those of us who read only the English  Press

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



preoccupied with new official dress, palace for the

new  Paramount  Ruler, and embassies  being  opened

abroad.    These    are   the   more    extravagant

manifestations of an independent state.  But  those

who  are preoccupied with what is going on  not  in

these  high places but in the hearts and the  minds

of   the  people,  are  more  concerned  with   the

reactions  of the various groups in Malaya  and  in

Singapore to these changes.'



<br><br>And at column 2512, I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Before 31st August, every policeman, every Home

Guard  officer,  every  member  of  the  Federation

Regiment  who  is shot in the armed  revolution  is

shot  as a running-dog, or it can be said ho was  a

running-dog,  of  the  British.  But   after   31st

August - and  this  I  think  is  in  the   mind   of

everybody - every soldier, every Home Guard shot,  is

a  shot  against  a  guardian  of  the  newly-found

freedom of the people of Malaya, and therefore  the

$64,000  question:  What  is the  Malayan  Communist

Party going to do? If it goes on shooting, then the

consequences will be catastrophic for them and  for

the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new phase and if there are leaders who

have the interests of other than just their parties

at  heart, we should be able to make the democratic

system  work,  for  this simple reason  if  nothing

else, that the people of Malaya have not lost faith

in  the  democratic  system. It is  the  democratic

system - or  the  democratic  constitutional  Parties

taking  advantage  of  the  overall  three-cornered

fight  in  Malaya - that brought freedom  to  Malaya,

That  is  the first fact that must be acknowledged.

Secondly,  the  people of Malaya  are  not  at  the

moment in favour of any armed totalitarian revolt.'



<br><br>The   three-cornered  fight  has,  I  think, been

forgotten in the Federation for good, because there

one  contestant hopped out of the ring, leaving two

contestants. There is a straight battle between  he

who  has  now become independent and he who intends

to usurp the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I was talking to a friend of mine, a colleague of

mine  who  is now enjoying the hospitality  of  the

British  Government in one of the prison  camps  in

Changi.  He  said - and  I  think  he  said  it  with

absolute  sincerity -  "After 31st  August  let  them

pack  up this armed revolution before they do great

damage  to  the country." And we say this:  Whoever

does  not declare where he stands after 31st August

is a fool. Up to 31st August in the Federation, the

question  is:  Do  we  have an independent  Malaya?

After  the  31st  the question  is:  What  kind  of

independent  Malaya do we make of it?  And  we  say

categorically - I  say  it  for  myself  and  for  my

Party - we believe in an independent, democratic, non-Communist [socialist] Malaya.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I pause there and define my term,

because the Member for Farrer Park has alleged that

the purpose of putting the word "non-Communist"  is

to  tell  the Communists, "We are not against  you,

you  are  not against us." Sir, any man who  starts

off  with  a completely passive and inert  attitude

like  that  must  perish. The word  "non-Communist"

means "no Communist", "not Communist". If you  will

slowly  look over the back numbers of magazines - and

I  think  all  Assemblymen get large quantities  of

them - like  the New Leader, British Commonwealth  or

Commonwealth Challenge, you will see, Mr  Speaker,

Sir - and  I  hope from time to time you  will  have

occasion to browse through these ideological tracts

on  anti-Communism - that there is a swing  from  the

use  of  the words "anti-Communist States"  to  the

words  "non-Communist States".  There  is  a  clear

distinction between an anti-Communist State  and  a

non-Communist  State.  Nobody  classifies   Nehru's

India as an anti-Communist State. It may be a  non-Communist  State, but that does not mean that  when

the  Communists twist his left arm, he  will  allow

them  to  twist his right arm also.  From  time  to

time,  I  think  the  Indian  Government  have   to

demonstrate that they are the authority.  And  from

time  to  time, all governments have to demonstrate

the efficiency of the administrative machinery. But

what  is  important  is this: we,  the  uncommitted

nations,  are not prepared willy-nilly to back  one

side, right or wrong. We do not start out with  the

major  hypothesis that whatever the Communists  do,

it  must be bad or it must be downright wrong. Just

as  there  is  the battle of words, the  battle  of

slogans,  and  the  battle of symbols - thousands  of

words  pour  forth  every day over  radio  stations

throughout the world and in newspapers - there is the

battle  for supremacy of ideas. And the word  "non-Communist"  has to be inserted there,  because  the

Communists  keep on saying that they are democratic

socialists.  To ensure that no Communist  supporter

or  sympathiser enters the portals  of  the  P.A.P.

headquarters by an error, because we call ourselves

democratic socialists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



and  other  people also call themselves  democratic

socialists,  we  say  quite  clearly  we  are  non-Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I come back to that at a later stage in

my  reply?  But  what I would like  to  remind  the

Member  for Hong Lim now is that all his quotations

from my speeches, however gratifying they may be to

my  ego,  are completely and utterly irrelevant  in

the  context  of  the political  platform  and  the

political policy upon which we clearly entered  the

elections.  In  order  that  there  shall   be   no

misunderstanding  and in case  anybody  chooses  to

shift  his stand, let me read to him a pledge which

all   P.A.P. candidates  signed  and  which  quite

clearly  and  categorically defines  the  political

basis  of  the P.A.P., the political programme  and

policy  upon which it is to govern for  five  years

if,  as it did, it won the last elections. It  says

here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I, Ong Eng Guan, of No. 3B Fair Drive, off Haig

Road,  Singapore, hereby acknowledge  that  I  have

read and understood the 4th Anniversary Celebration

Souvenir  issue of the "PETIR", the  organ  of  the

People's  Action  Party,  published  on  the   22nd

November, 1958, and the Five-Year Plan of the  P.A.P.

announced   at  the  Special  Party   Congress   of

Saturday, 25th April, 1959, and I declare that I am

in  full  agreement with the People's Action  Party

policy as set out therein.'



<br><br>And  he signed it before the elections on 30th May;

sealed and witnessed. A very curious thing that we,

who   are   alleged  to  have  departed  from   the

principles  of the P.A.P., have to quote  back  the

basic   beliefs,  documented  for  this  particular

purpose long before the elections. Has he forgotten

this  Fourth Anniversary Souvenir, to which he  has

not  referred, or the Party programme, to which  he

has  never referred, or the articles entitled  "The

New  Phase  Since  Merdeka",  and  "Our  Tasks  and

Policy",  which was issued by the Central Executive

Committee  of the Party, of which he was a  member?

It states on page 2:



<div align="center">'Basic Aims of the Party</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was four years ago, on November 21st, 1954,

that  we  published the manifesto setting  out  the

aims  and  objectives of the P.A.P. They have  been

four  eventful  years;  the course  of  history  of

Malaya  changed in this period. Three  years  after

1954,   the   Federation  of   Malaya   became   an

independent nation on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



31st  August,  1957,  and the  artificial  division

between  Singapore  and  the  Federation  has  been

accentuated and has hardened. Singapore is not part

of   the   independent  nation  and  cannot  become

independent  by  itself. Next  year  it  will  only

become internally self-governing. The time has  now

come  to  take stock of our position and to restate

our aims and objectives.'



<br><br>This  is  a testament of faith to which the  Member

for Hong Lim pledged himself. Let me tell the House

and  the country that there is nothing clandestine,

there is no subterfuge about what the P.A.P. stands

for  and intends to do. We take the simple approach

that  the  best thing to do is to tell  the  people

quite  clearly  what your aims and objectives  are,

and what you intend to do, so that they will make a

habit of taking you at face value. Let me read from

the same page 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The creation of an independent, democratic, non-Communist, socialist Malaya (Federation plus

Singapore)  is a task which will occupy  our  whole

life  time. They are enduring objectives for which,

as  socialists seeking a just system of  organising

society,  we must always strive. But our  immediate

tasks have changed, not so much in objectives as in

emphasis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years ago -'



<br><br>that is, 1954, and the revolutionary manifesto  was

in 1955 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`we were preoccupied with fighting for freedom.

Colonialism  in  its crudest and most  direct  form

chafed  and exasperated us. The country was run  by

an   overlordship  of  British  officials,  led  by

Governors, High Commissioners and Generals. A  vast

army of British troops and foreign mercenaries held

the  opposition  down. So our manifesto  emphasised

the need for freedom from foreign domination.'



<br><br>Sub-title "The New Phase Since Merdeka":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now the circumstances are different. The

Federation  has  been politically  independent  for

more  than  a year. True a good number  of  British

officials are still working in the Federation.  But

now  in  the  Federation they  are  no  longer  the

arbiters  of  policy  they  used  to  be.   Elected

ministers have taken over the direction and control

of  our  destinies in the Federation. It is  up  to

them  to complete the independence they won on 31st

August,  1957, to make political independence  more

than just a shouting of "Merdeka", and to translate

the  power  they  have  acquired  on  the  people's

behalf, into homes, schools, hospitals, jobs and  a

decent life.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



Page   3 - "Why  the  Alliance  Government  is  Anti-Merger":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The present Alliance Government is anti-merger

for  different reasons. The Alliance  leaders  have

put  out different reasons at different times,  but

we  can  summarise them into two: first,  Singapore

has about one million Chinese (about 70 per cent of

Singapore's  population  or  18  per  cent  of  the

Federation's population).'



<br><br>Sir, the latest census has put it up to 80 per

cent -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The inclusion of this one million into the

Federation will upset the racial balance  of  power

in  the Federation. Second: Singapore has too  many

"Leftists"  who  are supported by the  one  million

Chinese in Singapore. The Alliance leaders are  not

very  clear in their distinction between Communists

and socialists. They believe all "Leftists" may  be

Communists of varying degrees.'



<br><br>And  here,  we  stated in page  3,  "The  Immediate

Primary Task of a P.A.P. Government":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is therefore our duty to clarify the position

of   the  people  of  Singapore,  principally   the

Chinese.  We must allay these fears and create  the

conditions for merger. This is our immediate  task.

To  achieve freedom, it is no longer Just a  simple

question  of  fighting the British.  We  must  also

resolve the two fears which make the Malay majority

in  the Federation not want the Chinese majority in

Singapore.'



<br><br>And   on   page   5,  Sir,  under  the  sub-heading

"Democratic Socialism and Communism":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is only among the Chinese of recent immigrant

origin that Communism has found its disciples.  But

if  Communism is ever to succeed in Malaya, it must

be  through all races including the Malays and  not

through the Chinese alone. The more Communists  are

Chinese,  the  more  the  Malays  will  be  against

Communism,  fearing  not only  Communism  but  also

Chinese  domination. This is the dilemma which  the

Communists cannot resolve in Malaya. They can  only

win  if  their army can win, but their army  cannot

win   because  of  the  superior  forces   of   the

Federation Government backed by the British army.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Malaya wants to create a socialist society

without inter-racial strife, it can only be through

the  more  tolerant and humane road  of  democratic

socialism, because socialists believe in revolution

by  concept, not revolution by violence.  They  are

provided  in  Malaya with the best  conditions  for

success.   The   less  uncompromising   method   of

persuasion  through the democratic  system  ensures

that   social   changes  are  not  forced   against

emotional and violent resistance of the people. The

Malays  are  not anti-socialists; the  majority  of

them are poor peasants and they desire a more just

society. Islam is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



anti-socialist, because socialism  does  not,  like

Communism, take on the sole of a rival religion.'



<br><br>Sir,  we  did not write, discuss and approve  these

treatises and get our candidates to take  a  pledge

on  them just for fun. We clearly envisaged that so

long  as  that analysis stands, so long  as  it  is

valid, there is going to be a lot of difficulty for

any  Government that has to maintain the  integrity

of the State to keep the people reasonably patient,

to  educate them to correct attitudes, and  correct

values  which are Malayan and not communal. That  a

vigorous  and vibrant Chinese majority in Singapore

would  chafe  at  anything less than  independence.

Therefore, it was clearly explained why it  was  so

and why it must be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I expected a challenge to this at the time

when the ex-Chief Minister said that the forces did

not scatter. But they did. If they did not scatter,

I  do  not  think he would have got off so lightly,

nor  would  the P.A.P. have had such  an  exclusive

sweep  in  the elections. It was because they  were

scattered  that it took them some time to  re-think

and  re-sort their position. And they know that  in

an  atmosphere where reason, argument  and  realism

prevail,  their  recruiting campaign  must  suffer,

because there is no victory round the corner. 1954,

1955 - everybody knew that the British Raj was on its

way  out.  It  is just like the Congo  just  before

independence.  Everybody bought and sold  and  took

chances  on  what would happen after  independence.

Independence  was sure to come. Now  there  is  the

prospect of long years of painful, may be fruitless

and  barren  struggle to upset not  a  colonialist,

imperialistic  regime in the  Federation,  but  one

popularly  elected by the people, the  majority  of

whom  are  Malays who are Muslims and who will  not

take  to  Communism  so lightly.  And  the  curious

position is that the more vital and vibrant city of

Singapore  is in a state of semi-tutelage,  and  we

made  that  semi-tutelage clear as we knew  it  was

bound  to chafe, and a challenge must come,  as  it

has. It is our duty to fight this challenge, and it

may  well be that the next elections, for which the

Member for Cairnhill made a half-hearted call, may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



be  fought on this election issue, and on a broader

division   of  political  forces  than   the   last

election. But until then, this is the programme and

this is the policy, and we govern on this programme

and this policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Member for Hong Lim has

alleged that we have departed from this document or

from  the Party programme. No quotations have  been

made  from  either one of these two documents  upon

which  he  took  a  pledge. What I  would  like  to

suggest  to  him  is that in an  act  of  political

opportunism, he decided to abandon the stand and go

back  to  the pre-historic battle cry,  "Down  with

imperialism! Up with Malayanisation! The P.A.P. has

lost its revolutionary fervour of 1954." It is  all

right  shouting  slogans,  Sir,  like  uniting  all

classes  without barriers of language and race  and

so  on.  It has been done by hundreds and thousands

of  active and sincere, and some insincere, people.

But  when  a  former colleague says, on the  Nantah

question,  that Nanyang University  has  reached  a

deadlock because of the language issue, then I say,

as the Minister for Culture said yesterday, that he

has reached the point of no return. Has he not read

the  statement of policy on education  inside  this

document on which the pledge was taken? There is an

article  there  called  the `National  approach  to

problems  of education policy', and it was written,

to his knowledge, by a founder Member of the P.A.P.

who  was,  at the time of the publication  of  that

article,  in prison for his political beliefs.  Let

me   just  read  the  conclusion  to  settle   this

nonsensical   and  dangerous  talk,  designed   and

calculated  to  stir up unrest and disaffection  on

issues   upon  which  the  greatest  delicacy   and

restraint  have  been  shown,  not  only   by   the

Education Ministry but by associations of teachers,

unions of students and, to a certain extent, by the

whole of the Chinese people in Malaya, not only  in

Singapore but in Malaya. This is from page 23, Sir.

I  hope, for the intellectual delectation of  those

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



rear  chickens and others who have not got time  to

read  this,  they will read a few articles  in  the

reading  room. With your permission,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The people of Singapore strongly desire a

political merger with the Federation of Malaya.  An

important pre-condition for such a merger  is  that

our   own  education  policy  in  Singapore  should

approximate  as closely as possible  in  essentials

with  that  of the Federation of Malaya. We  cannot

expect  the  people of the Federation to  show  any

enthusiasm  for  a  merger with  Singapore  if  our

education  policy is based on principles which  are

opposed  to  those which obtain in the  Federation.

The treatment of the national language in Singapore

is a case in point.'



<br><br>This was in November 1958, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Government's White Paper on

education  (No. Cmd. 15 of 1956) does not  manifest

any aspiration towards a unified national education

system  based  on the acceptance of  Malay  as  the

national  language.  Unlike  the  practice  in  the

Federation, the Malay language is not taught  as  a

compulsory  second language in the Colony  schools.

Malay  is  only treated as an optional  subject  in

schools  in Singapore. Even as an optional  subject

facilities   for   its, teaching   are   woefully

inadequate. These are unpardonable omissions in the

education  policy of a territory  which  claims  to

desire a political merger with the Federation,  and

they  are  omissions  which ought  to  be  urgently

rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further it is of vital importance to the success

of  our  aspiration that the whole education policy

of Singapore be reviewed with a view to bringing it

into  line  on  all matters of principle  with  the

education policy of the Federation of Malaya.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any fool outside this Assembly knows the

attitude  of  the large mass of the Malays  towards

the national language, education, national schools,

Chinese  schools  and Nanyang University.  And  the

fact that we, the Government of Singapore, have  to

carry   and   have  promised  to  carry   a   large

section - for us a large section, 15 per cent - of non-Singapore students to keep the Malayan character of

that  institution alone, I think  would  have  been

sufficient  reminder to anyone in his right  senses

that  there are certain issues where the best thing

to do is never to open Pandora's Box. They tried it

in  Ceylon. I do not think they ever got the  genie

back into the Box when they decided to close it up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I read the conclusion, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have discussed briefly some of the essentials

of a national approach to education policy; what it

means  and the responsibilities and obligations  it

imposes on all those who sincerely desire a  united

Malayan nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Malaya is to survive as a nation, and if our

people  are to achieve social, political,  economic

and  cultural advancement in the modern world,  the

most  essential  prerequisite  is  to  abolish  the

communal  divisions,  antagonisms,  rivalries   and

distrusts which threaten the unity of our  country.

This  can only be done by working devotedly for  a

united  Malayan  nation based on a united  national

consciousness and a common loyalty to  Malaya.  The

instrument to achieve this aim is a truly  national

education policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P's, stand-point is clear and

unequivocal. We have neither time for nor  patience

with  narrow-minded and short-sighted communalistic

approaches  to problems of education  policy.  That

way  lies  national anarchy and ultimately national

suicide. We stand for a united Malayan nation and a

national  education policy. That  way  lies  unity,

peace and progress.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Member for Hong Lim does not

believe in all that now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were treated yesterday by the former

Chief  Minister to a gratuitous lesson  on  how  to

fight  Communism and defend democracy in Singapore.

Sir,  first, I want to congratulate him. I  thought

that,  having  lost  the  services  of  this  ghost

writers  of  the past, he did well in  finding  new

ghost writers, particularly for those parts of  the

speech  relating  to the Internal Security  Council

and how to fight the Communists. Those parts of his

speech, Sir, came from typewritten scripts, and  it

had  a  flow  of language, if I may say,  which  is

somewhat out of harmony with the informal note upon

which the former Chief Minister usually pitches his

own  speeches. It is important, Sir, that we should

answer  the  Member for Cairnhill, and whoever  his

political  mentors  are, who inspired  this  simple

anti-Communist line. We are obliged to him, if  for

nothing  else, for providing us with the background

contrast in attitudes and approach between  what  I

call   our   positive,   socialist,   non-Communist

stand - just  to  distinguish  ourselves   from   the

Communists,  because  they  also  call   themselves

socialists; that is the reason and there is nothing

sinister   about  it - and  their  stand   as   anti-Communists. Caltex made the stand that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



their  brand  "Caltex" had a  red  star  with  five

points  long  before  the Soviet  Union  came  into

being. I think nowadays if you go to a petrol pump,

the    petrol    pump   operator   will    somewhat

apologetically  explain  to  you  that  he  is  not

selling  you  Russian oil. Sir,  he  is  also  non-Communist  to  that  extent,  just  to  distinguish

himself  from  the Communists. It is  a  pity,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that the Member for Cairnhill  should

have  given his game away very early in his speech,

because he said, and he said this with disapproval,

that  it  was  an open secret that the  P.A.P. was

pursuing   a   policy   to   win   over   Communist

sympathisers and activists to the way of democracy.

He  obviously does not believe in this.  He  thinks

all  this  is  dangerous, stupid and  irresponsible

stuff,  because when he was the Chief Minister  and

leader  of the last Government, he did not  believe

in  all  this nonsense about winning over Communist

sympathisers to the way of democracy.  He  believed

in  the  negative approach. Crush  them,  break  up

their  organisations and lock  them  up,  which  is

sometimes  somewhat unfortunate but inevitable  and

necessary. But of all the people who have  had  the

temerity to proffer us advice on how to govern  the

country  and develop the democratic system,  I  can

think  of  no  one  less qualified  and  with  less

reputable   credentials  than  the   former   Chief

Minister. If anybody wanted to know how not  to  do

it, he proved it conclusively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years 1956 to 1959 - true it was a bit

difficult then because at that time it was a  more

tricky position and Singapore was even more  semi-semi-independent - he  had  to   kowtow   to   Chief

Secretaries  and Attorney-Generals  and  Financial

Secretaries. This therefore made him more easily a

victim of a smear. But the point is this. All that

he  has  to  show  for  the  advice  given,  which

obviously  he  must have found out  from  his  own

experience  and  trial, is  a  political  movement

which consists of an address, a publication called

The  People  which  appears  once  in  six  months

whenever  there is trouble somewhere out of  which

they  think  they can get some profit.  Otherwise,

they  go  into a deep coma. Four Assemblymen,  one

having, by his inertia, probably caused by looking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



after  the  fowl world, departed from their  ranks,

This is the result of that policy. The former Chief

Minister said that democracy was the antithesis  of

Communism  and he insinuated that a man  who  calls

himself  a  non-Communist democrat is contradicting

himself. According to his definition a democrat  is

a  person who must first be an anti-Communist. When

we  are  using these terms, I think it is important

to define what we mean. He wound up by recommending

his  line to us with promises of support if we make

common  cause  with  him.  Sir,  I  stated  at  the

beginning that it is the business of each contender

in  this three-cornered fight, which is still on in

Singapore, to pull us to their side. Here  we  have

an  example of discredited reactionaries trying  to

get us to make common cause with them on a sterile,

straightforward, simple, anti-Communist stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me start at the other end of the

definition on how Communists define people. I think

the former Chief Minister would do well if he would

spend   some  time,  besides  reading  the   glossy

magazines,  to read tracts like the forbidden  ones

(they  are  very  useful)  particularly  over   the

monitoring    digests,    like    Mao    Tze-tung's

contradictions  about  the  people.  "Who  are  the

people?",  he begins with. And he says there  is  a

good  Marxist dialectician who said the  definition

of  the  word  "people"  changes  from  country  to

country  and in each country from time to time.  He

said   in  China,  for  instance,  when  they  were

fighting the Japanese invader, all those who fought

the  Japanese  were the people, and all  those  who

aided  the Japanese were the enemies of the people.

Therefore,  by  that definition,  the  K.M.T.,  the

Liberals, the Social Democrats, the Communists, all

were  the  people, and Wang Ching Wei and his  gang

were  enemies of the people, because they  were  on

the  other side. After the liberation of China, who

are the people? First of, all, who are the enemies?

The enemies are those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



resist progress, change, and the establishment of a

socialist  State. And the people are all those  who

want   the  establishment  of  a  socialist  State.

Therefore  the  K.M.T.,  the  American  imperialist

supporters and so on are enemies of the people  and

the   rest  are  the  people.  That  is  basic  and

fundamental. From their point of view, who are  the

Communists?  All those who support  Communism.  Who

are not Communists? All those who either oppose  or

do not support Communism. That is their definition,

but from time to time it varies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been given a great deal of credit,

quite  unjustly,  I think, for the rather  eloquent

phraseologies  which my colleagues in  the  Cabinet

contribute  from  time to time. I would  say,  Sir,

that  it  would be a mistake for people to  believe

that  my  colleagues lack dialectical  stamina  and

skill. In the same way we are also flexible when we

define  "Communists", "non-Communists"  and  "anti-Communists". Who are the people? I say  the  people

are  all those who want to see industrial peace and

expansion,  prosperity, progress and the resolution

of our unemployment problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And support the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. That would be a mistake.

I  think  that is where the Member for Farrer  Park

would be making a cardinal error. The great Chinese

Marxist dialectician never said that all those  who

support the Chinese Communist Party are the people,

because  then  he  would be  left  with  15,000,000

people.  That is all he has right now. At the  time

of  the  liberation of the mainland,  he  had  only

about 5,000,000 cadres. We say "the people" embrace

all  those  who  want to see the  establishment  of

industrial  peace,  industrial expansion,  progress

and  prosperity, and the creation of pre-conditions

for  merger  with  the Federation.  All  those  who

oppose   those  objectives  obviously  want  chaos,

disaster,  confusion, no merger, a prolongation  of

colonial rule, unhappiness and no prosperity.  They

must therefore be classified as enemies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



of the people. I ask each of the individual groups,

whatever     they     call     themselves - Left-wing

adventurers,    pro-Communists,    Marxists,     or

reactionaries (whether or not they fall within  one

or  the  other  side  of that definition) - are  they

enemies  of  the  people or are  they  the  people,

depending  upon  whether they  want  what  we  have

decided - industrial expansion, prosperity, peace and

pre-conditions  for merger - or are  they  those  who

want  strikes,  chaos, unemployment, irreconcilable

struggles that lead to perdition? We do not  punish

for  intent until the intent is made manifest.  But

if  the intent is made manifest, then what shall we

do,  Sir?  Let  me assure the Member for  Cairnhill

that  we will fight for our own cause, a cause more

worthy  and  more likely to succeed  than  his  own

sterile  and negative one. And the Communists  have

not  found  us  negative either, let alone  passive

victims in either the ideological argument  or  the

organisational  battle for power.  We  shall  fight

them ourselves on our own issues of our own making,

and at a time of our own choosing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one thing that we, as a Party and

as  a  movement, have achieved more than any  other

political party since l9 - I wanted to say 1948,  but

to  be  true, I think it is 1945. We have won  over

(and  we are the only Party that has done so) large

groups  of  people, who might otherwise  have  been

sympathisers or supporters of the Communist  cause,

by  our positive approach, a non-Communist ideal to

distinguish   ourselves  from  the  Communists,   a

democratic  socialist approach, because  they  also

call themselves democratic socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as we keep on doing that and succeed

in doing that, then we shall remain a virile and  a

vigorous  force and a movement to be reckoned  with

in the Malayan political situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world ideological battle is a ceaseless

and  unrelenting one and no one political  leader's

pronouncements  on this subject in  Malaya  can  do

more than just to add a little more argument in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



deciding  the thinking of the people of  Malaya  on

this ideological conflict. Let us say quite clearly

that  the oversea Chinese, not just in Malaya,  are

fully  aware  of the tremendous strides  that  have

been  made by the Communist Government in China  in

industrialisation   and  effective   administrative

organisation. As far as the ideological  battle  is

concerned, it is the example of Communist  China - an

example  of  rapid  progress and an  organised  and

efficient  society, and not the dismal failures  of

the  M.C.P. - which has sustained the  Communists  in

getting  recruits into their oft-depleted ranks  in

Malaya.  That  is a problem which we will  have  to

face.  If  you start off by saying, "I am  anti-Com

munist.  I  am in the same category as Chiang  Kai-shek, Ngo Dinh Diem, Dr Syngman Rhee", then I  say

you will convince nobody in Malaya to even look  at

the  alternative which, in our submission,  is  the

only  practical and sane way to peace and a  united

and  prosperous  Malaya. We say  categorically  and

emphatically - and we stand or fall fundamentally  in

the  last analysis on whether we are right or wrong

in  this - that  violent revolution by the  Communist

Party in Malaya, particularly a party which is only

founded   and  mounted  on  one  section   of   the

population, is doomed to failure from the word "go"

and  is  unable to bridge the division between  the

races,  their  languages,  their  cultures,   their

religions  in Malaya. So when those of us  in  this

Chamber  blithely talk about the unity of  economic

forces,    this   P.A.P. lying   about   cultural

consciousness, national consciousness being  a  lot

of  piffle, I say we stand by the test of time.  If

we  are wrong, then verily we shall pay for it. But

if we are right, then we shall be magnanimous about

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the business of any political party that

sincerely believes in the democratic system  is  to

win  over  the  mass of the Chinese and  the  other

peoples  in  Malaya  away  from  Communism  to  the

democratic system. In Malaya we would be stupid  if

we  failed  to recognise that the M.C.P. has  been

working   in   the  schools,  talent-scouting   and

recruiting a whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



host of intelligent, honest and sincere young  men

and  women to their ranks. It is because  of  this

negative approach of the Member for Cairnhill that

he  never  had  a  political party,  let  alone  a

political  movement that ticked. All he  had  were

the  Mak  Pak  Shee's, the Chew  Swee  Kee's,  the

Lazarouses,  the  Member for  Joo  Chiat,  chicken

rearers and others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me pose this problem. Nearly half of

the  population of Malaya are Chinese.  More  than

half  of  these  Chinese are educated  in  Chinese

schools.  For  the  time  being,  the  appeal   to

Communism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



finds its best response amongst the Chinese

section that considers itself politically and

socially ostracized. For the time being, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

Further consideration tomorrow?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.
