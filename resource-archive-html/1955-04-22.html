<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR entered the Chamber,

accompanied by Mr SPEAKER who was preceded by  the

SERJEANT AT ARMS and the CLERK.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the CLERK announcing "His Excellency the

Address.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>GOVERNOR'S ADDRESS</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>His  Excellency the Governor:</b> Honourable Members,

Her  Majesty the Queen has been graciously  pleased

to send the following message:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am glad at the opening of the first session of

the Legislative Assembly under the New Constitution

of  Singapore to express to my people in  Singapore

my great satisfaction at the significant advance in

their  constitutional progress which is  marked  by

this  occasion. The Council of Ministers  will  now

have  to  deal with the many problems of Government

and  upon  them  will  fall  the  chief  burden  of

responsibility  for the continued  advancement  and

prosperity  of  Singapore and for the  welfare  and

safety of its citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward with every confidence to the

faithful discharge of this trust for I am sure that

those  on whom this responsibility falls will carry

it  out  with  foresight, courage  and  honesty  of

purpose. It is my earnest hope that the work of the

Legislative  Assembly  under the  New  Constitution

will be blest with every success."



<br><br>I  have  also  received a message to you  from  the

Secretary of State for the Colonies which reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It gives me great pleasure to send a message of

greetings and goodwill to the Legislative  Assembly

of  Singapore on the historic occasion of its first

meeting under the New Constitution. My only  regret

is  that  neither  I  nor  any  of  my  Ministerial

Colleagues can be present in person to deliver it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must first of all congratulate all those who

have  taken  part in the working out  of  this  New

Constitution, the Committee under the  Chairmanship

of  Sir George Rendel who now see the fulfilment of

their  labours and His Excellency the Governor  and

his  officers who have devoted much time to framing

and   bringing  the  Constitution  into  operation.

Secondly I want to express the satisfaction of Her

Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom  at  the

successful  completion of an important task  which

is  signified  by  the convening of  this  Assembly

today  and  our  most sincere good wishes  for  the

prosperity  and happiness of Singapore in  the  New

Era, which is now opening.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with every confidence that I look to the

Assembly and the Council of Ministers to build and

maintain a tradition of mature deliberation and of

sound and impartial administration. You will I  am

sure  prove  yourselves worthy of the  high  trust

which  has  been reposed in you by the  people  of

Singapore. Good luck to you all."



<br><br>This  first  meeting  of the Legislative  Assembly

inaugurates an epoch in the constitutional history

of Singapore. In the period of 136 years since its

establishment under the British flag as a  trading

centre,  Singapore has been transformed  from  the

small  village, which was located here where  this

House  of  Assembly stands, to a centre  of  world

trade  with its port ranking as the tenth  busiest

in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of this cosmopolitan island has

hitherto   been  in  the  hands  of   professional

administrators. Today Singapore is governed  by  a

Council  of Ministers answerable to a Legislature

which is predominantly popularly elected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men and women of good sense will be confident

that  under  its new form of Government  Singapore

will  not  only  continue  to  flourish  but  will

flourish even more healthily than in the past. And

there  is good reason for this belief for we  have

already had a most striking demonstration  of  the

realisation  by the people of Singapore  of  their

responsibilities  in  this  matter.  The   General

Election  held earlier this month showed that  the

people  of Singapore understand the importance  of

the  vote and the need for casting their votes  in

accordance with their convictions. It is  now  for

the  Council of Ministers and this Assembly  as  a

whole  to  see  to it that the popular  will  thus

democratically expressed is carried  out.  Let  no

man suppose that he knows better than the Election

results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate that I should on this occasion

indicate  the  broad  lines of  policy  which  the

Government  intends  to  pursue  as  well  as  the

programme  for  the next year in  so  far  as  the

Ministers  have been able to plan it in the  short

time since their appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that the welfare of the

people  of  Singapore can best be  served  by  the

early   attainment  of  complete  internal   self-government and union with the Federation of Malaya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



and  will  direct  its efforts to achieving  these

immediate ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuance of these aims, the Government

intends to give its vigorous support to the policy

of   staffing  the  Public  Service  with  locally

domiciled officers. Whilst seeking this objective,

the  Government  recognises  the  just  claims  of

officers  recruited from overseas who  have  taken

part  in  building up the present  administration,

and  undertakes to look after their interests.  If

any of these officers are found to be redundant as

a    result   of   the   implementation   of   the

Malayanisation policy, the Government will  ensure

that  adequate  abolition  terms  will  be  fixed

having  regard to the interruption of  the  career

which  the officer had a right to expect  when  he

accepted  his  appointment. In the  meantime,  no

more expatriate officers will be appointed without

prior  reference to the Council of Ministers.  The

Government   has   implicit  confidence   in   the

continued loyalty of the Civil Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that commerce is the

lifeblood  of the local economy. It  will  be  the

policy  of  the Government to foster the expansion

of  our great entrepot trade which is world-wide,

and at the same time to encourage in all practical

ways  the  development  of local  industries.  The

Government  recognises  the  low  level   of   the

standard of living of the large mass of the people

of the country and the threat of unemployment on a

wide  scale,  and  will seek to encourage  a  more

equitable  distribution  of  the  income  of   the

country  and  the utilisation of its wealth  in  a

wider field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government awaits with interest the report of

the  Mission from the International Bank  for  Re-construction   and  Development  which   recently

visited Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. In

planning  its  economic policy full  consideration

will  be  given  to  the recommendations  of  this

important Mission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to secure in the near

future the services of an Economic Adviser, and to

appoint  an  Economic  Commission  to  advise  the

Government on the most suitable lines of  economic

development   designed  to  improve  the   general

standard of living, and increase opportunities for

useful work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



The   Commission  will  include  in  its  task  the

consideration, in consultation with the  Government

of  the  Federation of Malaya, of the  question  of

establishing a Central Bank for Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a fully representative Trade

Advisory   Council  to  advise  the  Minister   for

Commerce,  which  was  recommended  by  the  Rendel

Commission,  will  be  undertaken  forthwith.   The

Government recognises the great importance of close

consultation  with  all  commercial  interests   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to arrange for early discussions

with  our  important trading partners in  order  to

promote good neighbourly relations and to stimulate

the flow of trade on mutually advantageous terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Government, it is emphasised,

is  to  raise  the standard of living  of  all  the

people  of  Singapore  and  for  this  purpose  the

assistance  of  private capital is  necessary;  the

maximum  encouragement for this will be offered  to

both local and overseas investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the vital role of trade

unionism  in  raising the standard  of  living  and

fostering  the prosperity of the country,  and  all

possible  assistance will be given to strengthening

the  movement. The Government will pursue a  policy

of  the  orderly  adjustment of  relations  between

employers   and  employees  by  agreement   between

themselves. Where the parties are unable  to  reach

agreement by direct negotiation the services of the

Ministry  of  Labour will be freely  available  for

conciliation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the small man in raising his standard

of  living  greater attention will be paid  in  the

future   to  co-operative  development,  and   more

emphasis  will be placed on assisting  our  farmers

and fishermen. To stimulate interest in farming  an

Agricultural Fair will be held this year. It is the

intention  of the Government to develop as  rapidly

as  possible  an adequate and suitable road  system

for the rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperative and pressing need for adequate

housing  for  those  in  the  lower  income  group,

including the solution of the problem of the  attap

dwellers  and  the clearance of  slum  areas  is  a

challenge which the Government appreciates can only

be  met  by  the  most vigorous and in  some  cases

drastic measures. It is the firm intention  of  the

Government to find the solution to this problem and

in  doing  so  it  will in the  future  place  more

emphasis on the provision of public housing at  the

lowest  possible  cost  even  if  this  means  some

lowering of standards. It is also the intention  of

the   Government  to  find  ways   and   means   of

encouraging those in the low-income groups  to  own

their own homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broad field of social services, special

attention   will   be  paid  to  social   security,

including the formulation as soon as practicable of

statutory schemes to assist the aged, the  disabled

and   the  unemployed.  The  needs  of  handicapped

children,  including the mentally  deficient,  will

not be overlooked. The Community Centre scheme will

be  developed and more facilities provided for  the

underprivileged  youths  of  Singapore.   Immediate

arrangements are being made for the introduction of

a  free Legal Aid Service, including representation

in  courts both civil and criminal. The position of

Government pensioners will be examined forthwith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will expand all medical and health

services,   particularly  in   the   rural   areas,

including  the establishment of district  hospitals

and   clinics  and  the  encouragement  of   health

education.  A Medical Advisory Council representing

all  branches of the medical profession will be set

up  immediately to advise the Minister. One of  its

earliest  tasks will be to consider the feasibility

of  introducing  a National Health  Service  scheme

including a service of home visits by doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In education the policy of the Government is to

aim  at  equal  treatment for all schools  and  all

teachers in those schools. The foundation stone  of

the  policy  will  be  a six year  course  of  free

primary education for all children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



Technical  education, which the Government  regards

as   of   paramount  importance  for  the  economic

development  of  Singapore,  will  be  expanded  as

rapidly   as   possible   and   the   question   of

apprenticeship  and training of industrial  workers

and clerks will be studied at an early date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realm of legislation, the Government has

turned its immediate attention to the matter of the

Emergency Regulations, which in accordance with the

law are due now for consideration by this Assembly.

Yesterday, I extended by Proclamation the period of

Emergency for another three months. It remains  for

this Assembly to decide at this meeting whether  or

not  this  extension is to be confirmed by adoption

of   the  Proclamation  by  a  resolution  of  this

Assembly. Meanwhile, I have revoked certain of  the

Emergency Regulations, which the Government after a

preliminary   examination  is  satisfied   can   be

dispensed   with   immediately.  The   Government,

anxious  not to damage the fabric of security,  has

decided  after earnest consideration to  submit  to

you this Proclamation for adoption at this meeting,

and  is  in  process of exhaustively examining  the

Emergency  Regulations and the Banishment Ordinance

with  a  view,  in  so  far as is  practicable,  to

dispensing  with  such  powers  as  are  no  longer

necessary  and to the exercise of powers  essential

for  the  maintenance of law and order  within  the

framework of normal legal procedure. In considering

this  matter, regard will be had to all the factors

involved, including the Emergency situation in  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards general matters of defence, the

Government  proposes  to  examine  immediately  the

organisation  of  the Local Forces with  particular

reference to the operation of the National  Service

Ordinance.  Objections  and criticisms  which  have

been  made  to the requiring of young  citizens  of

Singapore  to  undertake national service  will  be

subjected to the closest consideration, and  it  is

the intention of the Government that, so far



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



as  is practicable, these objections and criticisms

shall  be  met  within the policy  of  building  up

adequate  local  forces,  which  cannot  await  the

attainment of complete self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bill to establish the City and Island Council

will be ready for consideration by the Assembly  in

the   near  future,  and  this  Bill  will  include

provision  for the introduction of multi-lingualism

in  that  Council. It is hoped that the success  of

such  an  arrangement will lead to the granting  of

similar provision to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to introduce a Labour Bill

to  replace  the present outmoded Labour Ordinance.

There   is  every  likelihood  of  agreement  being

reached  with  Her Majesty's Government  that  this

Bill  should  cover the civilian employees  of  the

three Services recruited in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will seek additional powers for the

acquisition of land for public purposes, and powers

for  the  freezing of values of immovable property.

It  is  the  firm  intention of the  Government  to

ensure  that the land is used in the best interests

of  the  people. The Torrens system of Land  Titles

will  be  introduced in the near  future  with  the

object  of  reducing the cost of land  transactions

and  generally  simplifying  the  process  of  land

tenure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further the carrying out of public housing and

slum  clearance, legislation will be introduced  to

set up a Housing Authority to replace the Singapore

Improvement Trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsatisfactory state of public transport calls

for  early  action, and to this end the  Government

contemplates   the  setting  up  of   a   Transport

Authority which will include in its functions  the

allocation of routes and the fixing of fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government contemplates amending the Trade

Union  Ordinance to permit the use of  trade  union

funds  for  political activities and to remove  the

present restrictions on Government trade unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



joining  federations  of  unions  not  confined  to

Government  employees. The Central  Provident  Fund

Ordinance  is  under examination  with  a  view  to

further amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial position of Singapore at the present

time  is  sound.  The public debt  is  very  small.

Favourable trading conditions during the  past  few

years have enabled substantial reserves to be built

up  and  some of these reserves have been  utilised

for  long  term loans to the Singapore  Improvement

Trust  while  a further portion has been  earmarked

for development purposes. A Special Reserve of $100

millions has also been created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, certain points arising out of

the  financial position which give cause  for  some

concern. There are indications that revenue, on the

present  basis of collection, is tending  to  level

off.  It  is  also clear that recurrent expenditure

will  increase  steadily as the  implementation  of

existing development plans gains momentum.  In  the

circumstances, unless steps are taken  to  increase

revenue  on the one hand and to control expenditure

on  the  other, there is considerable  danger  that

expenditure  will  exceed  revenue  by   increasing

amounts  in the future, and that the reserves  will

be exhausted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore the intention of the Government

to  make  an  immediate examination of the  revenue

potential and to introduce as soon as possible such

measures  for increasing revenue as are  considered

practicable, having regard to the intention of  the

Government  to increase the economic prosperity  of

Singapore,  to encourage enterprise and  to  expand

trade  and  industry. An examination will  also  be

made  of  the  existing machinery of Government  to

ensure  that any waste, inefficiency and redundancy

is  eradicated and that the Government  service  is

maintained as an efficient and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



economical machine for the execution of the  policy

of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members, I should like to conclude

this  Address by expressing my own sense of  regret

that  this  is the last occasion on which  I  shall

speak  in  the  Legislature. But to  have  been  in

office  while  the  recent constitutional  advances

were  being planned and executed has given  me  the

greatest  satisfaction, and I shall always  cherish

the  privilege, which I have had of addressing this

Assembly  at  its  inaugural meeting  today.  I  am

confident that it will be a worthy guardian of  the

peace and prosperity of this Island, and will fully

justify the confidence reposed in it by the people.

I  offer you, Honourable Members, and through  you

the  people of Singapore my warmest good wishes for

the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of THE GOVERNOR'S Address, Mr

SPEAKER, preceded by the SERJEANT AT ARMS  and  the

CLERK,  escorted HIS EXCELLENCY out of the Chamber,
