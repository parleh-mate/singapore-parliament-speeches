<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION POLICY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Question - [5th April]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House approves the adoption of the

Education Policy outlined in the White



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>



Paper  on  Education Policy as contained in Sessional

Paper  No.  Cmd.  15  of 1956. - (The  Minister  for Education.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

much to commend in the broad principles laid down  in

the White Paper: for example, that all schools should

receive  equal  treatment and  that  all  regulations

should  apply  equally  to  all  schools  which   are

financed  or aided by Government; that teachers  with

the  same or equivalent qualifications and experience

should be paid the same salary; and that every parent

should  have the right of choice regarding the  first

and second languages which his children should learn.

These  principles will be acceptable to the majority.

But  when we begin to examine the White Paper to  see

how some of these principles are to be carried out in

practice, we find that the Government skates somewhat

uncomfortably over the problem. This White Paper,  in

fact,  is  the  work of politicians  rather  than  of

educationists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem, of course, is that of language.

The  All-Party  Committee plunged into  trouble  when

they recommended in Section I:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That at least two of the following languages,

English,  Malay,  Mandarin and Tamil  should  be  the

media of instruction in their respective schools."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are to take that statement literally, it

would  mean  that students should be taught  all  the

subjects  in the curriculum in one language and  then

all  over  again  in  the second  language.  That,  I

presume, is not what the Committee meant, but that is

what  they  said,  and they then tried  to  extricate

themselves   from  the  difficulty  by   recommending

bilingual  teachers  so that instruction  in  certain

subjects  could  be  switched from  one  language  to

another,  the students having equal facility  in  the

two  languages concerned, presumably,  in  the  main,

English and Mandarin. The White Paper skates over the

impracticability of this politicians' solution to all

our ills, merely stating that there must be a primary

followed  by  a  secondary language of  the  parents'

choice, and that students must be able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>



to   leave   the  primary  school  with  a  competent

knowledge   of  one  language  and  a  fair   working

knowledge in the second language. The implication  is

that  if  you Malayanise the textbooks and prune  the

syllabuses of all non-essentials, whatever  that  may

mean,  this  can  be accomplished. But  what  happens

after  that?  Are two languages to be  taught  almost

side  by  side  in  the secondary schools,  technical

schools  and  so on? The White Paper, for  very  good

reasons, remains silent on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us get down to what can and what cannot be

done  in our schools - educationally, I mean, and  not

politically.  Firstly, it may be possible,  up  to  a

certain  point, to give instruction in two  languages

in  the  primary  stage, but the shortened  hours  of

work,  due  to the doubling of morning and  afternoon

schools,  is a terrible handicap. But when you  reach

the secondary stage, there can only be one medium  of

instruction if the most important part of a student's

life is going to be properly utilised in turning  him

from   a   comparatively  ignorant  lad  of   12   or

thereabouts into a maturing young man of  16  to  17.

There  is so much to be crammed into those four years

that there must already have been planted in him  one

language  in  which he thinks and writes  and  speaks

without hesitation; and this language must be the one

through  which he will imbibe all that he must  learn

in  his  secondary school life. By all means let  him

have  a  second  language, learn  it  properly  as  a

subject and pass examinations in it, but it is out of

the  question  to  allow it to be used  as  a  second

medium of instruction at this stage of his education.

It just will not work and the Government, I feel, has

not adequately faced up to this fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings mc to the question of the Malayanisation

of   textbooks.  The  Government  has  accepted   the

recommendation of the All-Party Committee lock, stock

and  barrel,  but  there  can  be  no  question  that

syllabuses  and  textbooks  must  be  Malayanised  as

quickly   as  possible.  Here  again,  we  get   into

considerable trouble and it is not at all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>



clear  whether  the  All-Party Committee  accepts  or

rejects    the   recommendations   of   the   Chinese

educational  authorities in  paragraph  55  of  their

report,  although these get to the core of the  whole

matter. It reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They (that is, the representatives of Chinese

educational bodies) make one reservation, however, in

that   in  Chinese  Literature  as  a  subject,  they

advocate no serious deletions as the Chinese classics

are   in  most  cases,  if  not  in  fact,  in   all,

crystallisations of Chinese culture, and if these are

banned  Chinese culture will suffer. They claim  that

these  classics  also  offer  the  very  much  needed

balance  in  Malayan  Chinese education,  which  must

retain  in  it anything that encouraged moral  values

and  concepts,  and  strive to produce  an  all-round

citizen. To cut out Confucius or Mencius from Chinese

Literature  is as unthinkable as to omit  Shakespeare

or Milton from a study of English Literature."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is not clear whether the All-Party

Committee, as I say, accepts or rejects this point of

view,  the  Government  seems to  ignore  this  point

altogether.  But let us remember now that,  with  the

possible  exception  of Malay, all  the  other  three

languages  have  been nurtured and developed  in  the

countries of their origin. Consequently, the classics

and  all  other  good  standard  textbooks  in  these

languages  must naturally be imbued with the  history

and  the splendour and the innate qualities of  those

countries. How then can the Committee Malayanise such

textbooks?  No one in his sane moments  will  suggest

that there are persons in Malaya capable of producing

Malayanised   textbooks  in   the   three   languages

comparable  to  the thoughts and the beauty  and  the

grandeur  of  Confucius  or Mencius,  Shakespeare  or

Milton. There have been no great Malayan philosophers

and  no  great  Malayan poets to make this  possible.

Even  my  hon.  Friend, Mr R. C. H. Lim,  would  not

aspire  that high! Now the very fact that  Government

has  as its policy that there should be equal respect

for  the four principal cultures of Singapore  is  an

admission  that  Malayanisation of  textbooks  is  an

impossibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we presume the Government means, and what the

All-Party Committee ought to mean, is that  for  many

years  to come all that we can hope for is to produce

Malayanised textbooks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>



in  three  languages for the lowest classes,  perhaps

for  the  primary schools. The Pan-Malayan  Text-Book

Committee,  to  which  the  White  Paper  refers   in

paragraph  19,  was intended surely only  to  produce

textbooks for the primary classes. I fully agree that

simple  readers  for  young students  should  have  a

Malayan background. I agree that our children  should

learn about tembusus rather than oaks, but I will not

support  the  view that Keats' Ode to  a  Nightingale

should  be  Malayanised just  because  there  are  no

nightingales   in   this  country.  Malayanise   your

teachers by all means, so that they can interpret the

wide  world in a Malayan way, for it is the  teaching

that matters far more than the textbooks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the All-Party Committee stated, language

teaching  should  be of the best possible  standards,

then we must perforce teach through the media of  the

classics  from  the  countries whence  the  languages

originated.  Both  the Government and  the  Committee

have tried to duck this simple fact, and the more one

tries  to ignore it, the more the educational  system

of  this  country will tie itself in knots.  I  admit

freely  that it is a dilemma. I am second to none  in

my  belief that the people of this country  can  only

come  together  as Malayans by sharing  each  other's

languages  and  cultures, but it must  be  recognised

that  equal facility in three languages, or even  two

languages, does not come at the primary or  secondary

stage  of education, with which we are most concerned

in  this debate. We must accept the fact that we must

aim  at  the mastery of one language which the parent

chooses,  and  a sufficient grounding in  the  second

language for it to be easily studied and mastered  at

the   university  or  later  stage,  while  a   third

language - alas, I think - must be left as  an  optional

extra  curricular activity for which facilities  will

have to be made available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave this aspect of the White Paper, may I

have  your permission, Sir, to read a short paragraph

from  a  recent article on the problems of  education

facing the Central Advisory Council for Education  in

Britain, where there is, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>



course,   only   one  language  as  the   medium   of

instruction:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Undoubtedly, however, the real centre of difficulty

and dispute lies in the curriculum of the Sixth Forms

of   Grammar  schools.  The  trouble  is  well-known.

Universities  find many of their scientific  entrants

narrow  in  mind and unable to write  or  even  speak

plain  English. The Arts specialists,  on  the  other

hand,  may  be  able to write a properly  argued  and

punctuated  essay (though this cannot  be  taken  for

granted),  but he is totally ignorant of science  and

of  the  changed  view of the world that  is  brought

about.   They   are,  furthermore,  products   almost

exclusively  limited  to England  and  Wales  in  the

modern  world. No other system of education  anywhere

permits  too  early this sharp and  harmful  division

between  the  Arts and the Sciences. The  dangers  of

over-specialisation might seem so  obvious  that  its

removal would be simple. Unhappily, a radical  attack

on   it   would   shake  higher  education   to   its

foundations. It would certainly mean lower  standards

of  attainment  in  the main subjects  in  university

entrance  and  open scholarships.  It  might  end  by

adding  a  year  to  university courses.  The  tangle

largely defeated a Committee of Vice-Chancellors  and

school heads which reported last summer."



<br><br>If  that,  Sir, is the problem in England where  only

one language is concerned, how much more intricate is

our  problem here. In this country we are crying  out

for  our local sons and daughters with qualifications

for  all kinds of technical and administrative posts.

Are  we  going  to  get them if we  make  them  over-concentrate on languages and limit their  outlook  by

giving  them Malayanised textbooks, and  are  we  not

therefore indulging in contradictions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now turn more briefly to other aspects of the

White Paper. I welcome the introduction of Civics  as

an  essential subject, but I would prefer to call  it

Citizenship which, I think, conveys better the spirit

of  what  is  intended. Civics implies abstract  book

knowledge,  while  Citizenship  suggests  the  living

world  around us, an object of wonder to both teacher

and taught. Because the teacher should teach, not  as

one  conveying truths which are absolute but  as  one

imparting information which may be questioned.  Small

children are by nature inquisitive and sceptical. The

effect of much teaching is too often to overlay these

original  impulses  and  to convert  the  inquisitive

questioning  child  into  the  passive  recipient  of

information.  This  is  particularly  unfortunate  if

citizens are to be educated. After all,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



had  we all been brought up never to believe what the

newspapers  say,  much  less politicians,  the  world

would  be  a  happier place. And so let  us  talk  of

Citizenship, not Civics, and let us make certain that

our teachers are good citizens too, in the sense that

they are still ready to learn as well as to teach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome also paragraph 24 of the White Paper which

refers  to  competition in sports  between  different

schools,  but this should be expanded to include  Art

and Music. In this connection, I think that the House

would be interested to know that, by arrangement with

the   Singapore   Musical  Society,  two   celebrated

international  artists - a violinist and a  pianist - are

giving  a concert tomorrow in the hall of the Chinese

High   School,  thanks  to  the  enthusiasm  of   the

Principal of that school. So far as I know,  this  is

the  first  time that such an event is taking  place,

and  it  is a happy indication that the Chinese  High

School  is  not  exclusively concerned  with  Chinese

culture.  It  is  admittedly  an  experiment,  but  I

believe  it to be an important one, and the Principal

is confident that a large number of his students will

attend  the concert, sandwiched as it is between  the

morning and afternoon classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this subject, I would like the Minister to

know that this interest in Western music - and there is

an  interest - among the Chinese schools is  not  being

sufficiently encouraged by the Ministry of Education.

The  Singapore Musical Society, of which I happen  to

be  Chairman, holds regular concerts for schools when

celebrated musicians visit us. Notices are  sent  out

regularly  by the Ministry to Government schools  and

English   aided  schools,  but  not  always   Chinese

schools. This is one instance of how a great gulf can

be  fixed  between  Chinese  schools  and  Government

schools,  and I would ask the Minister to  make  sure

that there is no discrimination in the field of music

in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two or three other matters on which I must

touch  briefly. Firstly, I deplore the fact that  the

Government  has no adequate plans for those  students

to  remain  in  school  who  failed  to  qualify  for

secondary  education. Are we to push out  on  to  the

streets at least half



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



of our rapidly increasing 14-year olds at an age when

jobs  are  almost impossible to obtain? Of  such  are

Communists  and  gangsters made. That the  Government

does  not  seem to be willing to tackle  this  matter

seriously can be seen from paragraph 40, where it  is

stated of last year's students:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of the 45 per cent who failed to find places in

Government  secondary schools, those under  14«  were

allowed  to  remain  in  their primary  schools,  and

instruction is being provided in evening classes  for

those of the remainder who are interested."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implies that the Government is not sufficiently

interested  in seeing that this class of students  is

properly   catered  for  and  this  is  a  deplorable

confession. Half of the 14 to 15 year olds are to  be

abandoned to their devices unless they happen  to  be

interested in evening classes. This will not do.  The

Minister  must know perfectly well that students  who

have  left  school at the end of the  primary  school

stage are virtually unemployable, and that they  must

be  given  courses of instruction to  equip  them  to

become  junior clerks or apprentices in  industry  or

fit for the national defence forces. If Government is

not  interested in these young people  at  this  very

formative  age, it will be failing in its duty.  This

is  the most lamentable gap in the whole White  Paper

and  we  shall not be satisfied unless a solution  is

found to a very serious problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the next paragraph, No. 41, refers to the

need to retain those teachers, now in the service, to

cope  with the expanding secondary education in 1960,

but  this principle, Sir, should be extended  to all

types of schools. It seems to me pure folly to retire

teachers at the age of 55 when the crying need  is  for

more and more teachers. At a time when the average

age   of   teachers   in  the   school   is   dropping

considerably,  a  levelling of the experience  of  the

older  men  would have a beneficial  and  steadying

influence. At my own school I well remember that

house-masters  had to retire at the  age  of  60  and

teachers  at  the  age of 55, which meant  that  house-masters  at the age  of 60 could revert to  teaching  for

another five years as very valued and experienced men. I

see no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



reason  why  the same sort of thing could not  happen

here - set the age limit of principals at 60, but allow

teachers to go on to the age of 65; principals to  be

re-engaged  on a supernumerary basis as teachers  for

five  years, thus stepping aside for the younger  men

to  do  the more strenuous administrative work.  Many

teachers  retiring at the age of  55  today  turn  to

other  forms  of  employment in order  to  supplement

their  small  pensions. Most of them  would  be  much

happier and much more useful continuing to teach  the

young,  but  in  positions of less responsibility.  I

hope  that the Minister will consider this suggestion

in all seriousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also issue a word of warning regarding

condition (vi) of paragraph 26 which the school  must

fulfil in order to qualify for Government aid:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general education policy of the school must not

in  any  way conflict with the education policy  laid

down by the Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands, this clause means, or I hope it means,

not  that there should be 100 per cent uniformity  in

schools  but  that  there  should  be  uniformity  in

essentials  and  diversity  in  non-essentials.   The

danger  can be that the State-controlled institutions

will  have their own initiative reduced by conforming

to one rigid model which is not in the true interests

of  education.  There cannot be,  particularly  in  a

multi-racial country, one perfect model system or one

perfect model method for all schools. In other words,

while  the idea that all regulations should apply  to

all  schools  is  good in principle,  there  must  be

freedom  for the principal of a school or a committee

of  management to evolve its own methods and  make  its

own  experiment in the educational field. We  do  not

want  the dull dead hand of the State to kill  initiative  and enterprise among teachers, for that is  the

very thing which education must encourage and develop.

To  put  it  another way, we ought  to  create  great

headmasters  and  great  principals  and  not   great

registrars. These are the main points on which I want

to touch regarding the contents of the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now refer to two significant omissions. We read nothing in the White Paper and we have heard nothing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>



in the Minister's speech which would indicate, on the

one  hand,  what the new education plan is  going  to

cost, and, on the other hand, in what stages and over

how  long  a  period  of  years  it  is  proposed  to

implement  it. It is all very well to get the  scheme

on  paper and be as proud of it as my hon. Friend the

Chief  Minister says he is, but he will be the  first

to  acknowledge that the more important thing  is  to

indicate  to  the House when and how  the  Government

proposes  to implement it. It is on this  very  point

that   we   have   our  doubts,  because   Government

performances in the field of education have not  been

on a par with their promises.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> When?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> In the often quoted pamphlet -

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> When?

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> In the often quoted pamphlet of the Labour

Front, it was stated that the policy was "free

compulsory schooling for all children, - "



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> For four years.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> " - in English or vernacular schools, for

the  first  six years as a matter of first priority."

As my hon. Friend interrupts, that was understandably

to  be a policy for four years, and the policy of the

first year, as given in the Governor's speech, was  a

six-year  course  of free primary education  for  all

children.  Now,  not the slightest attempt  has  been

made  to implement this policy. For several months  I

have pressed the Government to disclose its plans  to

build  more  cheaply constructed schools which  alone

could make this policy effective. Only   a  week  ago  I  got  this  answer  from   the

Minister - "All  new plans need time to  work  out" - and

the  statement that sites have been found for  school

buildings - only  sites.  If  this  is  all  that   the

Government  can show for their first year in  office,

is  it  surprising that we have misgivings as to  how

soon  and  how vigorously the implementation  of  the

White  Paper is going to be tackled? I hope  that  we

shall  hear  of a definite time-table of action  from

the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>



when he winds up this debate and a definite statement

of    the   financial   implications.   Despite   our

misgivings,  it  is  not our purpose  to  oppose  the

motion  that  is before us today but to  support  it,

for,  as I have said, the broad principles laid  down

are  generally satisfactory; but we shall have reason

to  oppose  the Education Bill when it is  introduced

later  on  in this House if the points I have  raised

have not been taken into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, therefore, this White Paper is a step

forward  towards an improved educational  system  for

this country. I have indicated some of the weaknesses

which  do  not, however, spoil the broad  pattern  of

what has been conceived. But let me say this. One  of

the  main problems and fears has been how to fit  the

Chinese  schools into this pattern. But I am inclined

to  believe that, whatever objections remain  in  the

minds of Chinese educationists, once they are brought

under   one  system,  these  will  evaporate  in   an

independent  Singapore, because,  in  an  independent

Singapore,  it  stands to reason  that  all  schools - whether  Chinese,  Malay, Tamil or  English - will  and

must  be of equal status and equal importance.  There

will  be  no  longer any room for  the  feeling  that

Chinese  or Malay or Tamil schools are being ignored,

for  how  could  they be ignored  in  an  independent

Singapore and by a freely elected government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching profession is the most hard-working and

self-sacrificing    profession    of    all,    often

misunderstood and almost always under-paid;  but  let

us  not suppose that because so often under-paid, such

teachers  are  necessarily poor in  quality,  as  the

White  Paper rather unfairly seems to suggest.  There

are many teachers - and it applies everywhere, not only

to Singapore - who work for the sheer love of teaching.

All the more power to them! I feel confident that  in

the   Singapore  of  the  future  the  teachers  will

continue  to  be  true to their great traditions  and

that   they   will   rise   to   their   very   noble

responsibilities of producing loyal young citizens in

their  thousands who are able and willing to maintain

and protect their nation's independence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  would have been optimistic for anybody to  expect that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>



there will be no criticism on a vital matter like the

education  policy  of  the Government  of  Singapore.

Indeed, it would have been optimistic for us to  have

expected  that even the All-Party Report  on  Chinese

Education  would  have  met with  approval  from  all

sections  of the community. This is a thorny subject.

I have used the word "primordial" once and it brought

a  rebuke from the hon. Mr Sutherland, but that was,

perhaps, because he does not understand these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk of policy in education and you touch upon the

very  heartstrings of the three main cultural  groups

in   Malaya.   You  bring  forth  all  the   inherent

conflicts,  the urge for supremacy and  dominance  of

each culture and each group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four topics in the All-Party Report on

Chinese  Education  which we knew  would  arouse  the

fiercest   controversy.  They  were:   first,   those

statutes  empowering  the Government  to  cancel  the

registration  of  schools and  to  close  them  down;

second,   grants-in-aid,  with   conditions;   third,

Malayanisation  of textbooks; and, fourth,  languages

to be taught other than the mother tongue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the last 50 years the Chinese schools have

grown progressively more and more suspicious and more

and  more  hostile of the Government. It is important

to  remember that, as far as they are concerned, they

do   not   see  any  difference  between  a  colonial

Government and one under the Rendel Constitution.  It

may be an unfair thing to those legal experts who can

point  out the differences between what the  colonial

Government  was and what it is now. Nevertheless,  as

far  as  Chinese educational authorities, the  school

committees,  the  Chambers  of  Commerce,  the   clan

associations are concerned, there has been no real or

significant change. It is unrealistic on our part  to

hope  that  they  would accept these Ordinances  when

they  are  administered by representatives of  a  new

Rendel  government when they had resisted  them  when

they  were  administered by colonial  officials.  The

only conclusion that the All-Party Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>



came to is that it is impossible to allow a state  of

affairs  where a government, soon to be a  completely

elected  one,  is  not  in complete  control  of  the

educational system. So we recommended that all  those

statutes,  which were at the time they  were  drafted

designed to meet problems in the Chinese schools  and

were  drafted specially to apply to them,  should  be

amended. Sir, we have to accept the fact that for  the

time  being  there  will be resistance  from  certain

communal   quarters   to  Government   control   over

management and registration of schools. At  the  same

time  even they will not ultimately be able to resist

the proposition that there must be one authority in a

country, and that authority is the government of that

country     through     its     popularly     elected

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter which I expected would raise new

controversy was grants-in-aid. Here again I think the

biggest stroke of bad statesmanship, if statesmanship

was  what it was intended to be, was the offer of $12

millions to Chinese schools at the height of the anti-national  service campaign. Sir, I do  not  know  who

advised His Excellency the Governor in those days.  I

understand that there was an Executive Council  which

included elected Members like the then hon. Mr C. C.

Tan and his friends. They did not understand what was

happening in Malaya, and not understanding  it,  they

were  unable to find the right solution. To  offer  a

bribe of $12 millions to school committees and school

teachers  to  place  the whole school  administrative

machinery  under Government control was the stupidest

thing that they could have done. It completely soured

the   whole  outlook  of  the  Chinese  schools,  the

management  committees,  the clan  associations,  the

Parent-Teachers  Association and the  whole  host  of

other interested and active bodies. Here again, it is

unrealistic  of  us to expect that resistance,  which

has  been  built  up over the years  through  genuine

frustrations  and grievances, would  be  washed  away

just  because  there are now nine  popularly  elected

Ministers, I beg your pardon, five popularly  elected

Members,   and   one  nominated  Member   and   three

officials.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Six.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Six? I beg your pardon, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. I cannot catch up with the  number  of

Ministers and Junior Ministers in this House!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You want to wake up!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The only proposition one can

honestly support is that if a government is to expend

public  money on any educational system it must  have

some  say on how that educational system is going  to

be   run.  However,  I  do  see  that  there  may  be

objections to certain conditions in the White  Paper.

I feel that the fourth condition in paragraph 26:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No principal or teacher shall be appointed or

dismissed without the approval of the Registrar;"



<br><br>has  got all the inherent dangers of brainwashing and

thought  control through the teaching staff. Sir,  we

must  understand the attitude with which this problem

will  be approached by the communities which are  not

adequately represented in this House. If  we  do  not

take the trouble to understand it, then we are likely

to  make  as  much  a mess of it as the  former  hon.

Member Mr C. C. Tan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the principle that no government can give

away  $12 millions or $50 millions to private  groups

of  persons to run private institutions.  But  we  do

appreciate  that, in the situation as  it  exists  in

Singapore,   taking  into  account   the   historical

background   of   the  schools,   there   should   be

discussions  and negotiations over these  conditions.

There  should be fair and just conditions  to  ensure

that  the  government  has an effective  say  in  the

education  policy. But they should not be  conditions

which  would make for tyranny in the hands of  either

the  Registrar  or  the Permanent  Secretary  in  the

Education  Ministry. It is only on  account  of  this

that we thought there was some reason for the request

for  a postponement of the debate on this motion. But

the  Chief Minister has stated that he suspects  that

there  are other motives behind the request  for  the

postponement and he has insisted that the debate goes

on today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thorny subject is Malayanisation. Sir, this

has  got nothing to do with expatriates, getting  rid

of  them,  giving them a handsome bonus  and  pushing

them  off  in  the first ship. We do not  propose  to

score out any Nightingales, nor do we wish to cut out

the wise sayings of Confucius and Mencius. When we in

the   All-Party   Committee   on   Chinese   Education

recommended  that  there should be Malayanisation  of

textbooks,  our idea was simple. The whole  political

emphasis - and education is the only means by which you

can  do  it - must  be  on the reorientation  of  one's

heart,  one's  loyalties  to  this  new  Malaya.   We

expected  a great deal of opposition to this  because

it  would  straightaway rouse the  bogey  of  culture

being  endangered. There was a good reason  for  that

bogey in the old days when the Governor thought  that

he knew what was good for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can fairly put it this way. Nothing that

anybody  can do in or outside Malaya will  alter  the

fact  that  there will be two dominant languages  and

cultures  in  Malaya.  These are  the  facts  in  our

population figures. The Malay language and the  Malay

culture  will  irresistibly  become  the  predominant

language  and  the predominant culture.  The  Chinese

language  and  the Chinese culture,  particularly  in

view  of  the  tremendous  renascence  that  it   has

undergone  in  China, will occupy  a  very  important

place in Malaya. Perhaps it is because my hon. Friend

the  Member  for Tanglin (Mr Ede) is not as  acutely

conscious  of these facts, as an Asian is,  that  his

excellent  speech on the technique of  education  was

somewhat lacking in its grasp of the more deep-seated

problems that we face. Sir, the Chinese culture as it

will  be in the Malaya of 200 years from now  is  not

likely  to be what Chinese culture will be 200  years

from  now  in China. That is inevitable. We need  not

score out Confucius and Mencius.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody denies that it was the British who first

colonised  America, and that they speak  the  English

language.  But he would be a bold man indeed  to  say

that in America they have the same identical language

and the same identi-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



cal  culture.  In fact, you cannot think  of  a  more

supreme  insult to an Englishman than to mistake  him

for an American!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland (Nominated):</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed this one culture and one

language  spread  over  five continents - New  Zealand,

Australia,  South Africa - has gone through  mutations.

Basically it is the same language and the same Anglo-Saxon  culture.  But the number of  not  so  pleasant

things that I have heard Englishmen in Singapore say,

after  a  trip to Australia, about things other  than

Australian  beer, gives me some appreciation  of  the

differences which language and culture undergo  after

separation in space and time. I am sure the Frenchmen

in  Canada whose ancestors first travelled from Paris

are  quite different people from their first  cousins

who are still in Paris. That does not mean that their

culture has been destroyed or that they have been de-culturalised.  Culture  is  a  dynamic  and   organic

process. There is a great difference between allowing

a  culture  to  develop on its  own  under  different

geographic  and economic circumstances and  having  a

culture  desiccated and infusing  into  it  something

completely alien.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is where the White Paper fails. In our

Report  we just touched upon the problem, because  we

felt that we should cross our bridges when we came to

them.  But  this  White Paper,  on  the  question  of

languages   other  than  the  mother  tongue,   fails

lamentably. In our All-Party Committee we groped, but

groped consciously, for some solution which would  be

acceptable all-round. There are certain things  which

politicians - indeed, any man who seeks the support  of

all   sections  of  the  community - must  say  without

putting  them  in a form which would be misunderstood

by communities other than his own. If you were to ask

an  outsider, "What would you do with a country  like

Malaya (and I am still talking in terms of Malaya and

not  Singapore)  what are you going to  do  with  the

language, with the culture and with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>



administration  of this country?", the  only  logical

answer he would give, if he were a logical person, is

that  ultimately there will be one dominant  language

and   one   dominant  culture.  Then  you  have   the

Legislature,  the  Administration,  the  Courts,  the

schools all speaking, teaching, writing, and thinking

one  language.  Then you will have a  unifying  force

which binds the people together. Nobody would dispute

that  as  a  broad proposition. But when one  gropes,

however  consciously, for the language, one comes  up

against  all the primordial prejudices of  the  other

groups.  So  we  in  the All-Party Chinese  Education

Committee suggested bilingualism in the primary stage

and trilingualism in the secondary stage, because  it

was  one  way  of  bringing  about  the  pre-eminence

ultimately of one language. There would have  been  a

minority report, Sir, which the Hon. the Minister for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing and myself would

have signed if we did not feel that bilingualism  and

trilingualism  would,  in fact,  produce  one  common

language  in  the process. Whatever your language  in

the  primary  stage,  if you  have  to  opt  for  one

more - and  you have to opt for one more later - you  are

bound  to  include Malay. By the very nature  of  its

construction, it is easy to learn and to speak. It is

widely spoken and used and is the most acceptable  as

the lingua franca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on Education Policy is,

however,   a   completely  different  document.   The

Minister was ill-advised to table this White Paper in

the  form it is. He will remember the meticulous  and

assiduous  care  with which we  struck  out  all  the

English  emphasis in the All-Party Education  Report.

There are certain things which are going on in Malaya

which  those  who  run  Government  departments   and

educated  in English are sometimes aware of.  Instead

of  making  the  emphasis on an Asian  language,  the

White  Paper  has made the emphasis  on  the  English

language.  Sir,  there is a revolution  not  only  in

Malaya. There is a revolution in the whole of Asia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>



In every country that has attained independence after

fighting  a  colonial  power, the  language  of  that

colonial  power has not been acceptable. The  Burmese

pushed  out  the English language from  their  Courts

even  before they got their textbooks translated into

Burmese. The Indians have stipulated that in 20 years

they  will  all  speak  Hindi.  I  think  it  is   in

everybody's  mind  that the Chief Minister's  friend,

Sir   John  Kotelawala,  got  on  to  the  Singhalese

language  band-wagon a little bit too  late.  Certain

things  are  just not acceptable. Sir, every  time  I

speak  the  English language there is a deep  sense - I

would  not  say  of  humiliation - but  definitely   of

inadequacy  that  I  have not the same  facility  and

control  over my own language. That is something  you

must  understand, or you will not understand what  is

happening in Asia. Sir, in the whole of this  Report,

we  get the same silly nonsense - "that parents wish to

have   their   children  educated  in  English;   the

Government  are therefore concentrating  on  building

English   schools  and  on  recruiting  and  training

teachers  for them." Then they go on to say,  now  it

will  not be bilingualism and trilingualism. It says

that  not only can you not choose any language.  They

indicate what language you will have to choose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pupils attending Chinese and Tamil schools will in

general  be  taught English as their second  language

because   it   is  the  most  widely  used   of   all

languages - the language of diplomacy, of world  trade,

of technical and higher education."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Read on, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Then it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There may, however, be some parents who would

prefer  their  children to learn  Malay,  instead  of

English, and the Government will seek to provide  the

necessary facilities."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Exactly!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It shows that the group of people

who  deliberated on this did not understand what  was

happening. Sir, I will not believe that we can  solve

this language problem here in Singapore alone. If  we

had to solve the language problem in Singapore alone.

I think the solution will be somewhat different from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>



that which would be arrived at if you solved it on  a

Pan-Malayan basis. And I still wish to talk on a Pan-Malayan  basis  because  the  other  alternative   is

uncomfortable. We left the question of  national  and

official languages untouched in our All-Party Report,

because  they  were big subjects which could  not  be

solved  by Singapore alone. They can only be resolved

at  a later stage when Singapore has merged with  the

Federation, and no politician, either in Singapore or

in  the  Federation, can make any difference  to  the

geographical,  economic  and  ethnic  factors   which

militate towards a merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Militate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, two significant advances have

been  made  since  the publication of  the  All-Party

Report  on Chinese Education. The first is  the  fact

that  the  Singapore Chinese Middle  School  Students

Union has accepted the principle of Malayanisation of

textbooks.  The  second is the fact  that  that  same

Union   has  also  accepted  Malay  as  the  national

language.  They are deep and significant advances.  I

do  not say, of course, that there will be no trouble

over  Malayanisation. It depends upon who  Malayanise

what  textbooks.  But  with  the  acceptance  of  the

principle that the thought content, the substance  of

instruction should be centred in Malaya, I  say  that

we  have a chance, through the education system  over

the  next  15  or 20 years, to produce  a  generation

which  is  completely Malayan. I do not believe  that

just because the Chinese Middle School Students Union

has  accepted  Malay as the national  language,  that

therefore all the Chinese in Malaya will accept Malay

as  the national language. But it is an indication of

trends.  It  is an indication that groups other  than

Malays  have  recognised the need for one pre-eminent

language,  and  they have indicated  that  that  pre-eminent  language should be Malay. For  a  government

which  looks  forward into the future, to  produce  a

White  Paper with the whole emphasis based on English

is a matter for regret.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>



It  shows a lack of foresight and a lack of grasp  of

the vital issues involved in education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a damning indictment of the old colonial

governments  of  Singapore that, after  more  than  a

hundred  years of colonialism, with special  emphasis

on  the  Malays, the indigenous people,  you  have  a

situation  in  Singapore where  there  are  no  Malay

secondary schools. On this, the White Paper says with

considerable pride, not in an apologetic vein:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As yet all Malay schools are primary schools,

though  secondary classes in Malay, two for boys  and

one  for  girls, were opened for the first time  this

year  with  a  view to the early establishment  of  a

Malay secondary school. Previously there had been  no

direct  access to secondary education for  the  child

from  the Malay primary school; but the bright  child

had been encouraged to transfer after his fourth year

to   an   English  primary  school  where   intensive

instruction in English was provided in Malay 'special

classes'. In this way he could earn promotion  to  an

English secondary school. A change in Malay education

policy in 1952 which replaced Malay by English as the

medium  of instruction from Standard IV upwards  gave

to  every  child  in  the Malay  primary  school  the

opportunity  to qualify for admission to  an  English

secondary   school   through  the  Secondary   School

Entrance Examination."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they go on to say that they intend to provide

facilities for secondary education in Malay with  the

greatest possible speed, but that the obstacle  is  a

shortage of teachers. The Vice-President of the  Pan-Malayan Students Union, who is a Malay, has suggested

that  if  it  is  only  a  question  of  shortage  of

teachers, "Well, let us get them from anywhere in the

world.  There  are  a  lot that  we  could  get  from

Indonesia."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You cannot. They are very short

themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am not an expert on this

matter -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We were there.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I hope that we will get a full and

exhaustive   explanation  of  the  reason   why   the

Government have said that they propose to proceed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>



with  the  English  emphasis in education.  Sir,  the

White Paper is disappointing in this respect, but  in

so   far   as  the  White  Paper  carries   out   the

recommendations of the All-Party Report,  we  support

it.  But  we  oppose - and I think it is fitting  that

someone who is English-educated should oppose  it - the

emphasis on English education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I put it, without apologies, in a very personal

way? Sir, we all like to live our lives again through

our  children. We know we should do what is best  for

them.  But unconsciously we do for them what we  wish

our  parents  had done for us. When I was  born,  the

British Navy ruled the waves. My grandfather, who was

a chin-chew on a steamship line between Indonesia and

Singapore,  had the greatest respect for the  British

Navy. He made a great deal of money because, he said,

there was no piracy in Malayan waters. He lived, Sir,

until  he  saw the Prince of Wales sunk  by  Japanese

aeroplanes. Imagine it, Sir, aeroplanes made in Japan

sank the Prince of Wales! He died shortly afterwards.

I am sure that the sinking of the Prince of Wales had

nothing to do with his death, but I think an age  had

passed  with  him.  I, Sir, was sent  to  an  English

school to equip me to go to an English university  in

order  that I could then be an educated man - the equal

of  any Englishman - the model of perfection! Sir, I do

not  know how far they have succeeded in that. I grew

up,  and  finally  graduated. At the  end  of  it,  I

felt - and  it  was long before I entered politics,  in

fact it is one of the reasons why I am here - that  the

whole  set  of  values was wrong,  fundamentally  and

radically wrong. When I read Nehru - and I read  a  lot

of Nehru - I understood him when he said, "I cry when I

think  that  I cannot speak my own mother  tongue  as

well  as I can speak the English language."  I  am  a

less  emotional  man, Sir, I do not usually  cry,  or

tear  my  hair, or tear paper, or tear my shirt  off,

but  that  does  not mean that I feel  any  the  less

strongly about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son, Sir, is not going to an English school. He

will  not  be a model Englishman. I hope, of  course,

that he will know enough English to converse with his

father on matters other than the weather! I hope also

that in time to come I will know enough Mandarin  and

enough Malay to converse with him on the problems  of

humidity  and  heat  control  in  the  tropics!   But

whatever the difficulties in family relationship,  he

is going to be part of Asia, part of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin talked of the technical

details  of  English  education, of  difficulties  of

multi-languages. Whatever the difficulties, these are

the innate forces that nothing can stop, and it would

be  foolish  to ignore it. The person who wrote  this

Report does not understand those problems. He thought

that  in  five years or in ten years even  if  people

talk  Mandarin,  Tamil and Malay in the  Legislature,

the  world  will go on more or less the  same.  There

will  be  the English schools which will be producing

all  the  civil servants, all the administrators  and

all   the   professional  men - the  accountants,   the

lawyers, and the engineers. That, Sir, is not what is

going to happen, not from the point of vantage that I

look  upon  the problem. If you have these  languages

recognised, if you have an education system producing

men  speaking Mandarin and Malay, can you imagine the

Government  Land  Office writing to  its  tenants  in

English asking them to quit? I will not say that  the

All-Party  Committee on Chinese Education evaded  the

issue, because that would not have been an honourable

thing to do. We faced it, but we felt that first  you

must settle the question of the language. Which is to

be  the  predominant language? Will there be  one  or

more languages? I myself am of the opinion that there

cannot  be only one because you cannot push  out  the

Chinese  language. When you have settled  that,  then

you  shape your whole educational machinery for  that

purpose, to produce that result. There is no escaping

this. An age is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>



passing  in  Malaya, an age in which the English  and

the  English educated ruled the roost. It is  passing

slowly. Probably the rate at which it is passing will

increase   as   time  goes  on.  It  might   suddenly

accelerate   after  April.  I  think  it   would   be

prudent - certainly it would be wise - if  one  were  not

only  to  try and meet these forces but  to  try  and

shape and influence their ultimate direction.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to associate myself wholeheartedly  with

the Hon. the Minister for Education. There is need to

integrate  Malay  education in  a  general  education

system so that not only will the special features  of

Malay  culture and traditions be preserved,  but  the

economic  future of the Malays will be made  brighter

by   giving   equal   or  even  special   educational

opportunities to the Malay pupils to go to  secondary

schools.  At present, very few are enabled to  profit

by  secondary education. Malay parents,  in  general,

find   themselves  unable  to  afford  the  cost   of

education beyond primary standards in a Malay school.

Certain   bright   pupils  are  selected   arid   are

transferred  to an English school there  to  continue

their education in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the system of equal treatment as now

enunciated  in  the White Paper will mean  a  radical

change  in  approach. We should, in our Malay schools,

agree to bilingual education in Malay and English and

continue  these  schools on to the  secondary  stage,

also   in   Malay   and  English,   maintaining   the

educational standards that will give the Malay  child

the same chance of attractive employment and the same

opportunities for admission to institutions of higher

education as the children of other races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the reference in the White Paper to the

need  for  raising the standard of teaching of  Malay

and  Tamil. In a bilingual school, where Malay is one

of the media, there can be no doubt that the standard

in the Malay language reached would be at a very much

higher   level  than  that  of  the  present   School

Certificate paper; and there can be little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>



doubt that arrangements can be made by which both  an

alternative language paper of a higher level as  well

as  a  new paper in Malay Literature can be provided.

The Malay-English media bilingual school will, it  is

believed, enable its pupils to reach an equally  high

standard  in both languages and will not be  the  old

English school likely draped with a little Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far can Malay pupils under these circumstances,

Sir,  accept the further burden of learning  a  third

language - Mandarin or Tamil - is rather problematic. In

principle,  I think it is a goal worth striving  for,

but  I  should hate to commit myself to a  course  of

action  where  the  Malay  intellectuals  will   find

themselves  unable to support just at present.  Hence

my reservations on this point. It will depend largely

on  how far and how expeditiously we can marshall  our

resources of teaching talent; first, to cope with the

accelerated improvement of Malay education up to  the

equivalent of the School Certificate stage, and  then

to  accept the implications of utilising as  much  as

possible  the  bilingual medium - English-Malay - in  all

stages  of  Malay  education. If only  conversational

Mandarin  or Tamil were to be introduced in the  next

few  years and no scripts are taught, it is  possible

that  the  additional load could be  borne  by  Malay

schools. I should not like to commit myself  on  this

point,  but I think I may say, without contradiction,

that  the  Malays wish to play their full and  proper

part  in the noble task of building a nation and will

not lag behind other communities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Malay-English bilingual school is to be

conducted  at  the same level as the present  English

school,   its   teachers  must   have   an   academic

preparation and a professional training as  sound  as

that  of  the  teacher  in the  English  school.  The

academic  and professional training will be  provided

by  the  bilingual school itself once it  has  gained

momentum. The professional training will be given  by

the Teachers' Training College in the same way and at

the  same  level as for the teachers in  the  present

English  schools. I have, however,  an  assurance  to

give to Malay teachers. As the Hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister for Education has stated with reference

to  Chinese schools, the education policy outlined in

the  White  Paper will not result in the retrenchment

of  any  teacher but may well mean enhanced prospects

for many.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious study of Malay in the bilingual school,

other than the Malay-English school - will require  the

services of a number of Malay language teachers. Much

must  depend on the assessment of academic  standards

which will be necessary. Fair treatment, however, has

been  promised,  even  to  those  teachers  who,   in

academic attainments, may not have reached as high  a

standard as we would have liked. As long as they  are

playing adequately their part in educating the youths

of  Singapore, they will certainly not be overlooked.

I  would  like to emphasise that the past and present

economic  plight of many Malays is due  to  the  fact

that  they have been educated only in Malay and  have

acquired  no knowledge or an inadequate knowledge  of

the  world language of commerce. It is this that  has

denied  them both well-paid employment in  commercial

concerns   and  access  to  institutions  of   higher

learning.  It  is this that must be  remedied.  I  am

convinced  that the White Paper opens  the  door  for

opportunities  to the Malays as to all  other  races,

while  the fullest consideration will continue to  be

given to whatever representations the Malay Education

Council may see fit to make from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no hesitation at this stage in endorsing the

principles enumerated in the White Paper in so far as

they affect Malay education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

last  we have a chance to debate the education policy

of  the  Government which is laid down in  the  White

Paper.  Obviously  this White  Paper  has  long  been

awaited  by  the  public, especially by  the  Chinese

community.  Before I get on any further,  I  wish  to

make  my  stand  clear. Although I  was  one  of  the

signatories  to  the  All-Party  Report  on   Chinese

Education - and most of the recommendations  in  this

White Paper are based on the Report -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>



I remember, when I accepted the appointment to sit on

the All-Party Committee, that I reserved the right to

air  freely my views and my Party's views  in  future

regarding  the  education  policy.  It  is  with  the

deepest  regret that I say that I cannot  agree  with

this  White  Paper,  although it includes  many  good

points  from  the Report. The reasons  why  I  cannot

support the White Paper fall into two parts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this White Paper fails to convince us that

it  is a long-term education policy for this country.

It  tries  to  avoid  the most important  problem - the

question of a lingua franca for this country. Many  a

time  during the All-Party sittings we tried our very

best to avoid it because we were limited by the terms

of  reference. We tried very hard to get on with  our

investigations into the problem of Chinese  education

only  without touching on the question  of  a  lingua

franca. We cannot find any mention of a lingua franca

in  this  White Paper. Why? The writer of this  White

Paper seems to have forgotten that not very long  ago

this House passed a motion to have multilingualism in

this Assembly, and now we find the emphasis placed on

English  education.  The writer  cannot  produce  any

solid  assurance regarding, the promotion of a  local

language,  which the Minister for Education  promised

me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at Malay education, which is dealt with

in  this White Paper, we find that the Government has

been trying very hard, ever since it got into office,

to promote secondary education in Malay, but that the

difficulty  has  been  to engage sufficient  teachers

with  a sound academic background. In the White Paper

the  Government  says that it "hopes  to  extend  the

present  Training College to include a Malay  section

to supplement the small quota of teachers who undergo

training  at  the  Sultan Idris Training  College  at

Tanjong   Malim  and  the  Malacca  Women's  Training

Centre."  It tells us very clearly that  we  have  to

depend  on the Government of the Federation of Malaya

to train Malay teachers for us, as we cannot find our

own Government showing determination in this matter,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>



though  they have very good comments to make  on  the

Ten-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the White Paper has been badly

mishandled  by  the writer who, I suppose,  does  not

understand the people's feelings in this country when

he  touches on the historical background of education

in  this White Paper. All I can say is that he  is  a

good  defender  of the old Colonel Blimp's  education

policy.  Look  at what he says: Sir Stamford  Raffles

founded   Raffles   Institution  where   multilingual

education  was introduced, but, "unfortunately,  however, a local inertia led to the early abandonment of

all languages except English...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the present Government has indicated

that  it  will introduce bilingual education for  all

races  and  that their cultures should be  respected,

who  can assure us that 5 years, 10 years or 20 years

hence the same sentence would not reappear in another

White Paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...a local inertia led to the early abandonment of

all languages except English..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer further says that most of the parents

wish  their  children to be sent to English  schools.

About  two or three months ago, Sir, after  the  All-Party   Committee  started  its  investigation   into

Chinese   education,  I  remember  the  Ministry   of

Education  caused a questionnaire to be sent  to  all

parents of children studying in English schools only,

and  the  majority of the returns indicated that  the

parents  wished their children to receive an  English

education.   Do  you  think  the  sending   of   this

questionnaire only to English schools is fair? Do you

think it is democratic? Do you think this survey  was

sincerely  carried out? Why could not the  survey  be

conducted among all schools - English, Malay, Tamil and

Chinese - asking  the parents what  type  of  education

they preferred their children to have? But the survey

was  carried out among the English schools only.  Now

the writer of the White Paper comes and tells us that

many parents in Singapore wish their children to have

an English education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at this. The White Paper says that "their great

virtue (the English



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>



schools)  is that they have brought together children

of  all races and creeds and made them Malayans."  It

is  believed that most of the English school children

have  a true Malayan outlook. I do not know how  they

classify  Malayans. Listen to this: "John, what  make

is your watch?" "Oh, it is made 'at home'." They call

London-made 'home-made'. Then this: "John, where  are

you  going to spend your leave?" John replies, "I  am

going  to spend my leave 'at home'." 'At home'  means

the United Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sure it is.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> And this talk of Malayan

loyalty.  It is only trying to cover the old  Colonel

Blimp  tactics. Now this writer, writing  on  English

education, goes all out to defend it. He has this  to

say of the Chinese school committees:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aid was accepted only when standards of

accommodation and teaching had fallen to a  very  low

level and without any sense of obligation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he is defending the full aid system

which  has  generally  been refused  by  the  Chinese

schools,  though certain schools that  have  received

full aid have come under criticism from him. Take the

Catholic High School. I can challenge anyone who says

that it is not a model school in Singapore, even  the

Minister  for  Education.  Here  is  a  school  which

receives  full aid and yet the writer  of  the  White

Paper criticises it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aid was accepted only when standards of

accommodation and teaching had fallen to a  very  low

level and without any sense of obligation."



<br><br>Is it fair?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you! Now I come to the

criticism of the Chinese school teachers in the White

Paper. There it says that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most of the teachers were recruited in the days

when  salaries were insufficient to attract good men,

or having attracted them, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



earn their wholehearted loyalty. The teacher is still

too  often paid at piece-work rates, so that his duty

to the school begins when he enters the classroom and

ends when he leaves it."



<br><br>The  writer's  intention is to show how irresponsible

and how selfish the Chinese school teachers are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote a practical example now. The Rendel

Constitution   is   said  to  be   undemocratic   and

inadequate to attract good men to stand for election.

If  that is so, are all the hon. Members now in  this

House  good men? Are they "honourable" men? The White

Paper  points  out that the Chinese teachers  receive

poor pay, and yet sees fit to draw attention to their

poor   standard  of  teaching  and  their   lack   of

responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to give hon. Members another practical

example. We know that Bedok Village recently suffered

a  flood.  In this village there lives a man  by  the

name  of Choo Keng Guan who is the Principal  of  Poh

Sin  Hwa School. Mr Choo receives a salary of  about

$290  a  month.  With  the rapid  expansion  of  this

school, it was found that there were not enough desks

for  the  students. Because of the flood, the  school

management  committee had no money to buy  desks  for

the  students. This principal, from his own  savings,

bought them and supplied them to the school - on  loan,

of  course. He is also at present supporting  two  of

his  former students who are furthering their studies

at  a Chinese Middle school in Singapore. Is this the

type  of  teacher  that the writer describes  in  the

White Paper? Do you think that we think this Mr Choo

is  wonderful? That this story is new to us? No,  not

to  the Chinese community! There are hundreds of  Mr

Choo's!   Mr Choo embodies what we Chinese call  the

scholastic  spirit - Tsu chi. It is  this  spirit  that

keeps Chinese culture alive, no matter where it goes.

We  must  realise  the  fact that  Chinese  education

flourishes  today  not  only  because  it  is   fully

supported  by  the  big Chinese merchants,  but  also

because of this type of noble people who possess  the

scholastic spirit. So I think the implication as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



contained  in  the White Paper that we have  no  good

Chinese  teachers  is an insult to  all  the  Chinese

school teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Hon. the Chief Minister was once a lawyer, I

wish him to recall from his memory whether he knew of

any  case  where a Chinese school principal had  ever

appeared  in  Court charged with misappropriation  of

public

funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> The Chief Minister indicated no,

and  yet  we  recently have the case of  one  English

school principal who was charged in a criminal  Court

for  misappropriation of public  funds.  Therefore  I

wish  the  writer  would  understand  the  scholastic

spirit  that  is imbued in the Chinese educationists.

They do not teach for money. The writer tries to give

us  the  so-called historical background  of  Chinese

education and criticises the Chinese school community

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Chinese school students. We know

this  White Paper stems from the All-Party  Committee

Report  which  also  deals with  the  Chinese  school

students - a  problem  with which we  are  all  greatly

concerned.  Yet  we  can find  no  solution  to  this

problem  in the White Paper, only comment. The  White

Paper   just   tells  us  that  the  students   "have

participated in anti-Government activities which have

caused genuine concern not only to Government but  to

all sections of the community."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> It is not wholly true.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Why is not the problem faced

and  a  solution  to it found? Why have  the  Chinese

school  students created trouble? Why cannot we  face

facts?  In every new-born country, especially  as  we

have  not  achieved  our  Merdeka  yet,  a  students'

political movement cannot be avoided. It must  exist,

and  the problem is not peculiar to Singapore  alone.

It  is  not true to say that those students who  take

part in politics are Communists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> It is not stated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> It is not only among the Chinese

school students that there are subversive elements. I

understand that even among the undergraduates of  the

University   of  Malaya  there  are  also  subversive

elements. So it is up to the Government to clean  out

the  'bad  hats'  from among the  student  body.  The

statement  should  not be applied to  Chinese  school

students  only.  If the Minister for Education  would

like  to  consider it, I think the solution  to  this

problem  would be for the Government to change  their

attitude  towards  the students  from  now  on.  They

should  recognise  that the Chinese  school  students

possess  these  valuable attributes  which  are - their

righteousness, their passionate nationalism and their

mutual-assistance spirit which we, on  the  All-Party

Committee,   found  very  much  lacking  in   English

schools. The Government must realise that they cannot

suppress the Chinese school students. They must guide

them into the proper channels. They cannot insist  on

saying,  "Oh, Chinese school students are Communists.

They are dangerous - "



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Who said that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> " - subversive elements."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We did not say that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> The Government should not allow

comments  of  this  nature to  influence  them.  They

cannot  treat the Chinese school students as prodigal

sons.  If they bear this in mind, then they can clear

the  so-called  underground element.  But  they  must

beware  of  one  important thing - the  open  political

manoeuvrers among the Chinese school students.  I  am

sorry the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)

is not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He has made his speech!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> He is the adviser to the Chinese

Middle School Students Union. I now wish to say  that

he has honoured the All-Party Com-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>



mittee  Report on Chinese Education by  affixing  his

signature  to  it. At page 27 of the Report  we  find

this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is recommended that students should not

participate  in  active party  politics  or  actively

participate in trade and industrial disputes."



<br><br>I wish the Member for Tanjong Pagar would go back and

advise  the  Chinese  school students  to  beware  of

political  manoeuvrers. Beware of someone who  always

styles himself as the national champion in the  fight

against colonialism. Colonialism, however, is a  fast

dying  tiger. The students cannot be fooled  by  such

people. There is no need for such propaganda by these

professional politicians. We are well aware that,  to

start  any  political campaigns, certain  politicians

must  make  sure that they have the support  of  many

Chinese  school  students.  I  wish  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar would advise these students when  such

campaigns are sponsored.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> He is not here!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I hope the Minister for

Education  can  see  fit  to  accept  a  few  of   my

suggestions which I make here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To call on all Parties to sign a joint statement

endorsing  all the recommendations I have  just  made

and  also declaring that no students should take part

in active party politics or industrial disputes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That Government should clearly set out a

national  education policy which should also  include

the question of a lingua franca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To set up a uniform examination standard.

This  will ensure that all students in Singapore,  no

matter whether they are in English, Chinese, Malay or

Tamil  schools,  will  have to  pass  an  examination

standard  recognised by Government and  employers.  A

rigid  standard is to be set in respect of  both  the

mother tongue and the compulsory second language. For

instance, in an English school, where a person has to

secure  a Senior Cambridge Certificate which will  be

recognised   by   all   employers,   including    the

Government, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>



must  in  addition  possess  at  least  a  vernacular

education standard equivalent to Std. VII.  And  vice

versa, a Senior Middle School student must possess an

English  education  standard  or  a  Malay  education

standard  equivalent to Std. VII too,  to  make  sure

that  the  bilingual  education policy  is  sincerely

carried out and not made a mockery of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) To establish immediately a training school to

train Malay secondary school teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) To re-engage all retired Malay teachers in order

to  cope with the rapid expansion of Malay education.

In  some cases I have found that Malay teachers  have

retired at the age of only 50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In view of the suspicion that exists among the

Chinese  schools, more especially as the White  Paper

has  been produced in such a way, I am sure we cannot

expect   the  Chinese  schools  to  believe  in   the

sincerity of the Government by accepting full grants-in-aid.  To  allay  such suspicions,  therefore,  the

Government  should show that they are true  to  their

word  by  giving  equal  treatment  to  all  schools.

Partial aid, especially to the Chinese middle schools

where the teachers are so badly paid, should also  be

considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The retirement age for teachers should be raised

from 60 to 65 years. This will help to cope with  the

expansion of the Chinese educational programme. We do

not want to start a new school and then find that  we

have not enough teachers. The position now is that we

let  a lot of teachers still able to teach retire  at

too early an age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) To start immediately a survey of the true wishes

of  the  parents  as  regards the  type  of  language

education they prefer their children to receive. This

survey  must be carried out not among English schools

only, but among all schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) To Malayanise immediately the Ministry of

Education.  I would say that top priority  should  be

given  to  this.  I am not blaming the  Minister  for

Education  for this White Paper. It was not  prepared

by him.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He takes the responsibility for it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> But I can more or less give him

an excuse!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I do not want any!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Then



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) I wish the Government would respect the

importance of the private school system and allow  it

to  remain  in Singapore. The position  is  the  same

everywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) I wish the Government's attitude towards the

Chinese  school students would improve and that  they

would try to understand them more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, although this White

Paper  is  based on the recommendations of  the  All-Party  Report, it is not the work of our local people

and,  consequently,  has been  wrongly  prepared  and

therefore cannot be acceptable to us, especially that

part  which  deals with the historical background  of

Chinese  education.  Therefore, I  suggest  that  the

Minister for Education be kind enough to adjourn  the

debate now so as to redraft especially the historical

background, otherwise the White Paper will be, as the

Chinese  proverb  says, just like "Old  wine  in  new

bottles".



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

nine  men  who  sat on the All-Party  Committee  were

honest,  true  and  sincere  men  discussing  in  all

seriousness  the  problem  of  education  that  faced

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has thought fit to remind the

Member   for   Tanjong  Pagar  that  this   All-Party

Committee  agreed that our students should  not  take

part  in politics or in trade union disputes. Perhaps

he  himself has forgotten that, between pages 42  and

43  of  the Report, there is a chart which this  All-Party Committee recommends to the Government. In this

chart, it is recommended that for the first six years

between  the ages of six to eleven or twelve  in  all

schools,  in  addition  to the  vernacular  language,

English should be taught. We had recommended this  in

all  sincerity because we believed English  would  be

useful to our children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>



But  here  in  this  Assembly, we  find  very  severe

criticism  against  the  Ministry  of  Education  for

giving  certain emphasis on English being  taught  in

schools as a language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar

referred  to the $12 millions offered to the  Chinese

schools  by the colonial Government perhaps  assisted

by  Messrs.  C.  C.  Tan & Co. Ltd.,  which  was  not

accepted by the Chinese schools. The Chinese  schools

had refused to accept because, at that time, prior to

April,  1955, they had every reason to be  suspicious

of  any  such offer from the colonial Government  and

their  suspicions  were not unfounded.  The  colonial

Government  had  for many decades not only  neglected

but  ignored Chinese education to such an extent that

all  the Chinese schools were not able to have enough

money  to  pay adequate salaries to teachers  and  to

have adequately equipped classrooms or buildings, and

some  Chinese schools had even no playgrounds. As  we

know,  youth  has  any  amount  of  energy  and   the

playgrounds  are the places where such  energies  are

let  out.  We have found, at the various sittings  of

the All-Party Committee, that the lack of playgrounds

for  the  Chinese schools has been such a  tremendous

handicap  that  it is now absolutely  necessary  that

Government  should,  wherever  possible,  offer  them

playgrounds  or  the facilities of using  playgrounds

which are at the disposal of other organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the position is different from that prior to

April, 1955. Today, as the Minister for Education has

informed me, he regards himself as the father of  all

students - the  Chinese  school students,  the  English

school  students,  the  Malay and  the  Tamil  school

students - and his duty is to defend them and  not  to

persecute  them.  During  the  colonial  Government's

regime,  I  had  the privilege on many  occasions  to

defend  the  Chinese schools. Every year,  a  certain

number  of  Chinese  schools were  threatened  to  be

closed  down. They were asked to show cause why  they

should  not be closed down because one or two of  the

students  did not behave according to the  liking  of

the colonial Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>



I  am  very glad to be able to say that, on all these

occasions,  we  succeeded in showing  cause  and  the

schools  were  not closed down. But the  attitude  of

persecuting  school children and not  defending  them

when  charges were preferred against them had  caused

deep  suspicion especially amongst the boys and girls

of  the  Chinese  schools. Now, the attitude  of  the

Government  is changed, so we can look to the  future

with confidence and convince the boys and girls,  the

teachers and the management committees of the Chinese

schools of our sincerity in helping them to bring  up

their standard to that of the English schools. On one

occasion,  while aids were offered  to  some  of  the

Chinese schools, they were refused to certain village

schools because the Education Department thought that

they  were not up to standard. Today, I am  sure  the

Minister  for  Education has reversed  the  position.

Those  schools that are not up to a certain  standard

will  be given priority. They will be given more  aid

than  those schools which have reached a certain high

standard.   I  hope  it  will  not  be  long   before

Government  can  also say to the Nanyang  University,

"We  will come and assist you. You and the Government

will  co-operate  so that we can together  provide  a

higher  means of education for the boys and girls  of

the Chinese schools."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in considering

the  postponement  sought by the Opposition,  I  must

confess  to  considerable surprise at the paucity  of

opposition   displayed   today.   There   has been

considerable  verbiage  but  absolute  bankruptcy  of

ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very able Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede), with his

delightful   facility  for  setting  up  bogeys   and

knocking them down, did seem to suggest as though  he

was  getting  somewhere, but it  was  more  like  the

activity  of  a squirrel in a cage. Sir,  he  pleaded

that  we  should recognise the fact that  you  cannot

have  tuition in more than one language.  If  he  had

read  the  Report  adequately,  Sir,  he  would  have

realised  that that is, in fact, what we seek - tuition

in one language and the other languages to be special

subjects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>



So  you will be taught in your mother tongue both  in

the  primary  and  in the secondary school,  and  the

languages  of  choice  in the primary  and  secondary

schools will be taught as separate subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a further complaint from him that we had

not dealt with various minor points of procedure. The

purpose  of  a White Paper, Sir, is to give  a  broad

outline  of  policy  and  not  to  indicate  detailed

procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we had the suggestion that we might find a

little  difficulty in producing a Malayan nightingale

to  satisfy  a  Malayan Keats. Sir,  I  think  it  is

certainly understood by me - I do not quite know  which

paragraph to refer to but it is inherent in  all  the

recommendations  both  of the Report  and  the  White

Paper  policy - that,  though the  whole  structure  is

Malayan, literature is part of the culture associated

with  the language and literature will not and cannot

be  Malayanised and there is no suggestion whatsoever

of   Malayanising  the  literature  aspect   of   the

teachings  in the different languages. So  those  who

study  English will still have their Keats and  those

who  study  Mandarin will still have the analects  of

Confucius.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, in what I may

call, if I am permitted, one of the more constructive

speeches,  to  which I have listened, emanating  from

him  in  this  Assembly, did draw  attention  to  the

suspicion  and  hostility of  the  Chinese  community

towards the Government. That we recognise, Sir.  That

is  the  heritage which we have, but we have been  in

office for more than a year and I think we have given

sufficient evidence of our goodwill and our sincerity

in  seeking to deal justly with all races. This White

Paper,  in fact, is part of our three-pronged  attack

on  this  problem and it seeks to lay the  foundation

for  all  time in Singapore of equal justice for  all

races.  The  hon.  Member went on  to  weep  for  the

misfortune  of  having been educated in  the  English

language, which he handles so well. Sir, one can  but

regret  the unhappy fact that such ability, in  fact,

such  brilliance, should be associated  with  such  a

lack of appreciation and under-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>



standing  of  the basic facts, as indicated  by  that

lament  of  the Member for Tanjong Pagar who,  having

made  his  speech, did not pause to  listen  in  this

House  to any replies. That is the attitude  we  have

always had from him - that he knows everything and  can

be guided in nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the English language is closely

tied  up with the traditional fate of Singapore as  a

market  place of the world. We are a place  of  trade

and  commerce and, to that extent, we must  recognise

that   the  English  language,  as  an  international

language, is of the greatest importance to the people

of  this  country. Sir, it is not only a question  of

folly, but it is falling below the standards of human

dignity  to  permit  one's sense of  inferiority  and

antagonism  towards the dominant race to get  to  the

point of hating them, Sir, to the point of wanting no

part  of their culture and their language which could

be helpful to us in our daily life. There is a saying

that  some people cut off their noses to spite  their

faces and, Sir, when the Member for Tanjong Pagar was

speaking, that is the vision I had. Here is a man who

hates  so  bitterly,  because  of  some  imagined  or

genuine  sense of humiliation as a result of what  he

had  undergone  in the past, that he  wants  none  of

anything associated with any version, even though  it

might be of considerable benefit to the people of the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on the Government side recognise that not only

the Chinese people but the people of Singapore are  a

practical and a reasonable people. The hates  of  the

supersensitive intellectuals, unalloyed by the broad-based  decencies of human commonsense, do not control

the feelings and the actions of the general public of

Singapore. We have given them under paragraph  14  of

the  White  Paper the option of taking  as  a  second

language  either  English or Malay, recognising  that

many of them would seek to have English because, as a

practical  people, conscious of the  difficulties  of

employment that are going to have accumulative effect

in the future, they would wish their children to have

qualifications  which  would give  them  the  maximum

possible   opening  in  commercial  and  professional

fields. But I would like you to recognise,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  that we do not suggest and, in fact, have never

suggested  that  the Malay language  should  take  an

inferior place to the English language, and that, in

fact,  as  soon  as  we  can  we  shall  provide  the

facilities  where  parents may  require  Malay  as  a

second  language, and, in any event,  we  make  it  a

compulsory language in the secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about the White Paper. Let

me  say  in  fairness to our civil servants - that  not

only  do I and my colleagues take full responsibility

for what is in this Paper, but we did, Sir, carefully

go through it and carefully satisfy ourselves that it

was  accurate  in fact and that it did represent  our

policy. This is the first opportunity I have to  seek

to  correct an impression that the Paper was  written

by  some  Machiavellian expatriate officials and  has

been surreptitiously introduced without the knowledge

of  the Government. It is no question of gallantry in

protecting them, Sir, that I say this, but because  I

believe that we should always face the honest  truth,

and  if there is any genuine criticism in respect  of

this Paper, do not blame the expatriate officials. We

are  here  to  face it because we are, in  fact,  the

persons responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the suggestion that we have given undue

prominence  to  the  English language - the  suggestion

which  made  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  weep  and

which he opposed - I would draw attention to the Report

signed  by the Member for Tanjong Pagar in  which  he

recommends  that the English language  shall  be  the

compulsory  language in all primary  schools  as  the

second language. I think my friend and colleague  the

Minister  for  Education will draw attention  to  the

exact paragraphs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come, Sir, to a gentleman I regret to see

absent  whom  I  have  at all times  found  the  most

delightful  of  speakers. I refer to the  Member  for

Changi.  I  must  confess that I enjoy  watching  his

courageous  struggle  with the  English  language  as

though  it were a giant slithery eel but he succeeds,

and  succeeds amazingly well, Sir, in putting  across

not only what he means but his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



own  sincerity, which I believe. To that extent, Sir,

I  listen  with perhaps not only more indulgence  but

with more consideration to what the Member for Changi

says  than - if the others will forgive me - to what many

of   the   others  do  say  who  consider  themselves

professional opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi had some complaints to

make,  the most important of which is that Government

seems to have given no attention to the question of a

lingua franca. Government recognises this, Sir,  that

you cannot impose a culture from on top. It must well

up.  It is dangerous to seek to impose Malay just  as

dangerous as it is to seek to impose English. We  are

not going to make the mistake of forcing the feet  of

our  population into preconceived shoes. Where it  is

not  necessary,  we  will  allow  time  to  evolve  a

solution   and,   in  this  case,   giving   parallel

opportunities and facilities to all four cultures, we

hope - as  was  indeed indicated  by  the  Member  for

Tanjong   Pagar - that,   in  course   of   time,   the

recognition  that one of the languages is,  in  fact,

the  logical lingua franca will be generally accepted

and,  when accepted, will then become law; but  there

is  no  sense  in  making it part of  this  education

policy and seeking to impose it upon a people some of

whom are not yet ready for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Member for Changi complained that we

said    that    Sir   Stamford   Raffles   introduced

multilingualism  but that due to the  apathy  of  the

local people only English was persisted in. Sir,  one

of  the  favourite  features  of  my  reading  is   a

fascinating  feature that you find regularly  in  the

Sunday Times, and it is called "Historical Corner  by

Donald   Davies".  Last  Sunday  it  was  even   more

rewarding  than  usual. I am  referring  here  to  an

account  of  what Abdullah the Malay chronicler  said

about the foundation of Raffles Institution:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first meeting to discuss the foundation of the

college,  according  to  a pamphlet  printed  at  the

Mission Press at Malacca, took place in Raffles'  new

house  on  Fort Canning Hill on April 1,  1823,  when

Raffles himself read a long and eloquent minute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... addressing the Sultan, he said, '0 Sultan,

Temenggong, and all ye gentlemen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



here  gathered  together, I have  a  desire  to  give

effect  to,  to  wit an undertaking of  the  greatest

utility to this and to future generations; for  today

we live that we may die, and then pass away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if we can show good deeds we are named as good

hereafter; and if bad, so accordingly. Now, while  we

have  the  opportunity, let us make a good  name  for

future  generations. Now, what I desire to do  is  to

erect  an  edifice in which all races can be  taught,

each  in  their  own  language,  and  by  their   own

schoolmasters,  in  all knowledge which  pertains  to

true  intelligence, such as may be imparted  to  each

and  every  one. . . But my greatest  anxiety  is  to

advance  the  Malays, by easy degrees, in  their  own

language - otherwise, let each race have  its  assigned

place,  and  all this without expense,  but  let  the

teaching be gratuitous; the country will increase  in

population in time, so if there be such an institute,

its fame will spread to all races."



<br><br>There  was  this great-hearted gentleman anticipating

our  White  Paper by 133 years. There was,  Sir,  the

cornerstone of a Singapore that could have  been  the

lighthouse  of the world if it had been  pursued  in,

for  he asked for multilingualism in schools and  for

equal  respect  for all cultures. Sir,  when  I  read

this,  I was proud to know that I was in such company

and  that  this  Government was,  in  its  way,  when

fumbling towards an honest and just solution  to  our

problems,  achieving a solution that  another  honest

and  just  man  had thought of more  than  a  century

before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do recognise this though, Sir, that there is in

Singapore a small group of people who are aliens  and

who  have  no intention of being anything else.  They

see with alarm the possibility of the integration  of

races  and  communities in Singapore into  a  Malayan

nation  and  it  is their technique  to  confuse  the

people  and give no credit to anything worthwhile  in

the hope that, through confusion, they can create the

chaos  through  which their alien ways  will  achieve

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we on the Government Bench feel like a

craftsman who has fashioned a beautiful jade bracelet

for a member of the family. That jade bracelet is not

intended  for  pigs' trotters. This  White  Paper  is

intended  for Malayans, those who are true  Malayans,

and to those who are aliens and who do not intend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



to  be other than aliens, we say, "You can keep  your

schools, but stop messing our marble floors."  I  say

this today, Sir, more in sorrow than in anger to  see

this  agitation, this smokescreen seeking to  confuse

the  decency  and  the generosity  of  the  education

programme outlined by this Paper; but I say to  these

people  that  the  day may soon come when  Singapore,

knowing her enemies, will show more anger than sorrow

and  when  that day comes, Sir, this Government  will

not be slow to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not going

to  hide  under  the colonial cloak of Colonel  Blimp

when  the  Member  for Changi (Mr  Lim  Cher  Kheng)

levelled  criticism  against me by  saying  that  the

White  Paper on Education Policy was written by  some

expatriate officer and has been presented without the

Government Benches first having had a look at  it.  I

must say that I take full responsibility for it and I

will  not  blame  anyone for the inadequacy  of  this

White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) said that the

Ministry  of  Education had not been co-operative  in

the  field of music. There has been no discrimination

whatsoever. Rather, the underlying suspicion  on  the

part  of  Chinese  educationists in  the  past,  that

Western culture is being forced on them, has deterred

somewhat  the Ministry's desire actively to introduce

Western  culture into the schools; but, of  late,  we

have,  in  fact, promoted extra-curricular activities

and  extra-mural activities, including art and music,

in  all the schools, irrespective of whether they are

English, Chinese or Malay schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then also the White Paper has been attacked for

laying  emphasis on English. I rather think that  the

word "English" should be changed to "reality". It  is

emphasis  on  reality.  Recently,  I  caused  to   be

surveyed  the requirements and needs of the  employer

in employing youths who graduate from our schools.  I

will  read  extracts of letters from the Chambers  of

Commerce, but not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>



European Chamber of Commerce which I will leave out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Malaya, Chinese firms conduct business among

themselves  chiefly  in  Chinese.  In  dealing   with

European,  English and American firms,  both  locally

and  abroad,  English  is  used  as  the  medium   of

communication. In dealing with neighbouring countries

and countries in Asia in general, English is also the

medium  of  communication, but very often Chinese  is

also  used. In view of this, it would appear to  this

Chamber  that only those who know either  Chinese  or

English  or  who are proficient both in  English  and

Chinese would have good prospects in Chinese firms."



<br><br>This  is  an extract of a letter from another Chamber

of Commerce:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As English is the commercial language and as it is

sure  to continue to be the commercial language  even

in the foreseeable future, this Chamber feels that it

would be preferable to have English as the medium  of

education,  with  Malay  as the  secondary  language.

Those who go through a scheme of education with Malay

as  the  medium of education and English  only  as  a

subject  might find it difficult to get  employed  in

the average and high income groups, and also it would

be difficult for them to rise up in position. For the

lower  paid post, it might be all right to have Malay

as a medium of education, but, generally speaking, it

would be worth while to have only English as a medium

of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards those who have their secondary education

through the medium of Chinese with English only as  a

subject,  such  candidates might have good  prospects

only  in Chinese firms, as it will be understood that

English,  for  the  purpose  of  correspondence   and

attention  to daily routine, and knowledge  of  Malay

for  contacting local business interests, will  be  a

sound background to employment in commercial firms."



<br><br>Now,  that is what the employers want. They want  the

Government to educate the youths in such a way as  to

enable  them to seek employment in the firms or  have

an education that the firms would want them to have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has drawn attention to

the  All-Party Committee Report on Chinese Education.

I  wish  to draw hon. Members' attention also to  the

chart  facing page 43 of the Report. This will  allay

any  fear  that the Government wish to do  away  with

vernacular  languages.  In the  first  year, in  the

English  stream,  you  have the  vernacular  language

taught, and from the second year onwards, "Vernacular

and  English",  and then to "English and  the  mother

tongue or second compulsory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



language  chosen by parents". That chart  shows  very

clearly  that we cannot ignore the fact that  English

is  the language of commerce, industry and diplomacy,

and  those  hon. Members who spoke against the  White

Paper, such as the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew)  and the Member for Changi (Mr  Lim  Cher

Kheng), have affixed their signatures to the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the regulations which Government will

want  to  see  complied with, I  wish  to  draw  hon.

Members'  attention to the remark made by the  Member

for Tanjong Pagar as regards paragraph 26 (iv) of the

White Paper where it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No principal or teacher shall be appointed or

dismissed without the approval of the Registrar."



<br><br>The  Registrar's powers are not dictatorial  because,

at the end of this paragraph, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Appeals against decisions of the Registrar may be

made  to  the Director and against decisions  of  the

Director to the Minister . . .".



<br><br>As  I said at a previous sitting, this clause is only

to  safeguard  the  principal and teacher  themselves

against  any  management committees who, for  reasons

only  known to themselves, seek to appoint or dismiss

any  principal or teacher as they like. No government

of  any  country in the world will support  education

and  spend large sums of money on it without  wanting

some measure of control and without regularising  the

standards laid down as the educational policy of  the

government in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi referred to a recent survey

made  by  the  Ministry of Education as  regards  the

choice  of language in schools. It was unfair of  him

to  criticise that that survey was conducted only  in

English  schools. It was also conducted in Malay  and

Tamil   schools  and  the  majority  of  the  returns

indicated  that they wanted English as the medium  of

instruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also mentioned that the criticism of

the   White  Paper  on  the  Chinese  schools  having

accepted  aid because their standards of teaching  or

their  standards  of  accommodation  have  fallen  is

actually   somewhat  academic.  That  criticism   was

levelled   at  the  past  system  which   gives   the

background to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>



Chinese school system, which is, of course, not  true

today and there is no intention whatsoever to include

the Catholic High School in that sphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also said that Government is

criticising  Chinese education and has not  tried  to

evolve   a   method  by  which  to   eradicate   such

inequalities.  I  refer him to the last  sentence  of

paragraph 4 (c) of the White Paper which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A basic condition for improvement in Chinese

education   is  a  re-orientation  of  the  students'

attitude  to  a realisation that the schools  provide

the  means of fulfilling their love of education  and

their loyalty to this country."



<br><br>That is exactly what the present Government is doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been representation that Malay teachers

could  be  obtained from Indonesia. I say this,  with

the  knowledge that I have, that we cannot get  them.

Indonesia herself is running short of teachers. We do

not want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>



Malay teachers for primary schools but teachers for

secondary schools, and Indonesia cannot provide them

even if she wishes to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House approves the adoption of the

Education Policy outlined in the White Paper on

Education Policy as contained in Sessional Paper No.

Cmd. 15 of 1956.
