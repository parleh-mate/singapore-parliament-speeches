"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 2011 to 31st March, 2012." - [Minister for Finance].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question again proposed.<br></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the aims of this Budget is to foster social cohesion and to build an inclusive society.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3211</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term "inclusive society" has different meanings to different people.&nbsp; One important aspect of an inclusive society is that it should be&nbsp;one that integrates people with different physical and mental abilities into the mainstream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this yardstick, our society still has some way to go to qualify as inclusive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget does provide for a continuation of MCYS' programmes for the elderly and disabled and gives some support to special education (SPED) schools and students.&nbsp; I note that the Ministry of Education has also committed some money for the development of three SPED schools.&nbsp; However, to be truly inclusive, Singapore needs to commit rules and resources towards integrating persons with disabilities in a much more holistic way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government recently submitted a report to the United Nations.&nbsp; The UN Human Rights Council has a process called the Universal Periodic Review which examines the human rights record of each UN member.&nbsp; This year is our turn and the Government submitted its National Report as part of that process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the National Report, the Government mentioned that it was considering signing four international human rights treaties, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).&nbsp; It also said that Singapore is "actively studying the provisions of the CRPD".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While some may see this as progress, we are actually laggards.&nbsp; We have not yet signed the Convention when 147 countries have already signed it,&nbsp;including all our ASEAN neighbours except Myanmar.As mentioned in the Budget Statement, social cohesion "cannot simply <p align=left>Column: 3212</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be left to market forces".&nbsp; All the more for persons with disabilities who usually have little bargaining power&nbsp;&ndash; there is a need for special protection to safeguard their rights and quality of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A look at&nbsp;the CRPD will reveal that Singapore falls short in several areas by international benchmarks.&nbsp; I will highlight just a few.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 7 of the Convention requires countries to take all necessary measures to ensure that children with disabilities have full enjoyment of all human rights on fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children.&nbsp; Article 24 recognises the right to education, including lifelong learning, and expressly&nbsp;prohibits&nbsp;excluding children from compulsory education on the basis of disability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, our Compulsory Education Act ensures that every child attends at least six years of primary school.&nbsp; However, the subsidiary legislations specifically exempt children with physical or intellectual disabilities from compulsory education.&nbsp; While this may have been gazetted for practical reasons, seen from the Convention's standpoint, it is a form of discrimination.&nbsp; The current situation is that special needs children in Singapore are not enjoying the same legal rights to education as other children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is largely left to voluntary welfare organisations to educate special needs children.&nbsp; The Government provides some subsidies, but parents of special needs children still bear a much heavier financial burden than other parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the additional expenses parents will spend associated with the child, school fees are means-tested, unlike in the mainstream schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early intervention is critical for special needs children to mitigate the effects of their disabilities but there are waiting lists<p align=left>Column: 3213</p>for schools and therapies, suggesting a resource issue and losing precious time from the child's formative years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Singapore were to sign up to the Convention, investments will be needed to ensure that children with disabilities enjoyed similar educational rights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Article 9 of the Convention provides that States shall take measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the physical environment, to transportation, to communications, electronic services and other facilities on an equal basis with others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made significant progress in implementing barrier-free accessibility.&nbsp; However, this does not apply to older buildings so many remain inaccessible to persons with disabilities.&nbsp; The public transportation system is also not yet completely barrier-free.&nbsp; For example, it is expected that buses will be completely wheelchair-friendly only by 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, disabled persons should have a concessionary travel rate, just like students and seniors.&nbsp; Most importantly, how easily can a person with disabilities access public information?&nbsp;&nbsp;To what extent are e-Government initiatives disabled-friendly?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Institute of International Affairs noted in a recent report that Singapore does not have comprehensive disability legislation aimed at moving away from viewing persons with disabilities as "objects" of charity and towards&nbsp;viewing them as "subjects" with rights and capable of inactive members of society (SIIA UPR submission 2011).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are&nbsp;seriously considering signing to the CRPD, the appropriate investments will need to be made.&nbsp; Recently, I came across cases of disabled adults being left at home due to lack of further education opportunities after&nbsp;they turn 18 years old, <p align=left>Column: 3214</p>or the inability to afford daycare activity services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still&nbsp;much more that can be done by the Government in this area.&nbsp; This aspect must not be forgotten if we are to achieve the vision mentioned in the Budget Statement&nbsp;&ndash; a truly inclusive society "where everyone can contribute and share in a nation's progress".</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Inflation has come to our shores because of world weather conditions and other natural disasters that have affected the world's food supply.&nbsp; The situation that is now playing up in the Middle East has inevitably affected the&nbsp;supply of oil, which in turn has had a knock-on effect, driving oil prices up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importing everything as we do, we are particularly vulnerable and susceptible to fluctuations in prices of food, commodities, fuel and our other necessities.&nbsp; We cannot stop inflation from coming to our shores.&nbsp; But the real issue&nbsp;is what we can do to help Singaporeans cope with it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's strategy for dealing with inflation is to grow real incomes for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; If costs go up but incomes stay the same, then we will be unable to cope.&nbsp; But if costs go up but real incomes also go up, then it is manageable. So, for example, if a household's expenditure goes up by $100, but the monthly salary also goes up by $100, then they will still be alright but not otherwise.&nbsp; Our strategy therefore is to try and ensure that increase in costs is matched by a corresponding increase in <p align=left>Column: 3215</p>real incomes so that the differential between the two is maintained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the strategy.&nbsp; I noted from the Minister's speech that for Singaporean households at the 20th percentile of incomes, real incomes went up by about 8% over the decade, not taking into account transfers from the Government.&nbsp; For median household, real incomes grew by 21% over the last decade.&nbsp; We have now set ourselves a target to raise real incomes by 30% over this coming decade.&nbsp; In order to do that, we have to achieve 3%&nbsp;&ndash; 5% economic growth and improve our productivity by 30% over the next 10 years.&nbsp; Can we do it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that every year, and every decade, we set the bar higher and higher for ourselves.&nbsp; Yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Teo Chee Hean, talked about productivity, in terms of brisk walking, rather than a marathon race. But when we see these targets that we set for ourselves, sometimes, it seems to me that we are doing the high jump but we should be aiming for pole vaulting.&nbsp; Can we pole vault?&nbsp; I think the answer is, "yes".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is instructive if we pause and take stock of what we have achieved over the last decade.&nbsp; I still recall when I first became an MP after the 2001 elections&nbsp;&ndash; some of us may be old enough to remember this. This was just after the September 11 terrorist attack.&nbsp; Overnight, everything changed. The world was then rapidly sliding into a recession in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.&nbsp; The travel industry was severely hit.&nbsp; Unemployment was up.&nbsp; The general feeling at that time in the business circles was that Singapore was not competitive enough&nbsp;&ndash; too much red tape in setting up a&nbsp;business; the financial sector said that we were too heavily regulated. With the <p align=left>Column: 3216</p>spectre of recession at our back, we had to find new ways to grow the economy.&nbsp; Does that sound familiar?&nbsp; It should because it was the same challenge we were facing 10 years ago.&nbsp; The Government sent out a call to Singaporeans to be more entrepreneurial.&nbsp; We were looking for new ways to climb up the value chain because we were losing out to manufacturing in China which could provide labour at a much lower cost than Singapore.&nbsp; India had just become the outsourcing capital of the world and we were grappling with how to deal with the twin challenges posed by India and China. &nbsp;Singapore was not considered to be a "happening" place. The "happening" place at that time was Lan Kwai Fung in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Nightlife in Singapore was boring.&nbsp; Pubs and night spots could not&nbsp;open beyond midnight, or just past midnight.&nbsp; There was no barrier-free access at the MRTs or the HDB heartlands. And the arts was still regarded as a poor cousin to the sciences with people bemoaning the lack of a vibrant arts scene in Singapore.&nbsp; And there was a quota limiting the number of women who could study medicine at NUS.&nbsp; There was no five-day workweek.&nbsp; National Service (NS) was still at two-and-a-half years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years on, where are we?&nbsp; We went through three recessions,&nbsp;starting with 2001 with September 11, followed by the SARS crisis in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2009.&nbsp; We came through each and every one of those with flying colours.&nbsp; We had the Economic Restructuring Committee, the Remaking Singapore Committee and no sacred cows!&nbsp; In that decade, we grew our economy, gave CDCs the task of providing job assistance, reduced red tape in setting up business, found ways to engage China and India through mutual benefit and advantage, got NEWater, found new high value-added services, launched the world's first night-time Formula One race, installed Singapore Flyer, built the IRs, transformed Marina Bay, redeveloped Sentosa.&nbsp; We are now a <p align=left>Column: 3217</p>"happening" night place. People come to Singapore to party here, there is barrier-free access, no more quota on our women medical students, Singapore women had conquered Everest, Orchard Road has been rejuvenated, NS&nbsp;is down&nbsp;to&nbsp;two years and a 3G SAF, introduced ComCare, Workfare&nbsp;&ndash; the list goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 10 years, so much has changed.&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; can we do it in the next 10 years to come?&nbsp; And I think the answer is, "yes".&nbsp; We started the last decade with a whole host of challenges which we surmounted. We surmounted them with the PAP Government at the helm, and we transformed ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now at the brink of another decade, looking at another set of challenges, asking ourselves: can we transform ourselves?&nbsp; And the answer is "yes".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That brings us back to our strategy for dealing with inflation which is to grow real incomes.&nbsp; I think this is the right strategy, and I think we are going in the right direction.&nbsp; What&nbsp;I am concerned about, though, is how we are to help those in the low-skilled, low-income group to achieve this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because whilst we can talk in terms of raising productivity, business restructuring, skills upgrading, for this group, such discussions have little meaning for them.&nbsp; For them, it is a question of how to get enough money to get through each day of the week.&nbsp; As the growth in real income for the bottom 20th percentile was 8% in the last decade, what it means is that they were only able to cope because of Government transfers and financial assistance.&nbsp; And whilst subsidies and financial assistance are good things to help the lower income, that cannot and should not be the long-term solution.&nbsp; The long-term solution for them is to have real income growth, which means that they must be able to work and their work must have a real<p align=left>Column: 3218</p>value so that it can attract a real and substantive salary.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking about the kind of strategy that we have for this group, and I think that we can have a more focused and targeted strategy for them.&nbsp; The typical profile of this group would be a young family, usually two or more children.&nbsp; Often, they are single-parent families, meaning the parent is either unwed or divorced and, often, they are single mothers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of the parents in this group, pursuing further academic studies is not a realistic option.&nbsp; The mother does not go to work as she needs to look after the children.&nbsp; The father may work but getting him to go for skills upgrading is a challenge because he does not want to have the opportunity cost of spending the time to go for skills upgrading and not work and therefore lose out on his salary.&nbsp; He would rather have the short-term gain rather than to put in the long-term investment in skills training for&nbsp;the bigger gain at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when you speak to them, you will find that the concept of having a strategy to grow real incomes is not something on their radar at all.&nbsp; They are more preoccupied&nbsp;with making ends meet day to day and have no long-term view of their future.&nbsp; We need to find a way to make this group part of the solution, and to have them aware of and involved in the strategy to grow real incomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think we need a more targeted, focused approach aimed at the children, the mothers and the fathers.&nbsp; Let us start with the children.&nbsp; A fundamental importance is early childhood education and getting the children into pre-school. But we can have more pre-schools or infant care and student care centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have feedback from my residents that they want to put their children into infant care or student care centres but there are not enough vacancies.&nbsp; The group which<p align=left>Column: 3219</p>needs the most help is the low-income group.&nbsp; This group is most likely to be living in HDB rental flats, and they tend to be the ones having more children. They are also the ones where the mother is not free to work as she has to look after the children.&nbsp; They do not want to spend the money on transport to send the children to pre-school elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want to raise the real incomes of the bottom 20th percentile, then we should invest more in building more infant care and childcare centres near to rental flats because that is the catchment area&nbsp;where the people who are likely to fall into that group live.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also help the children with tuition and other support programmes.&nbsp; I just want to share a little bit of experience of what we have done in my constituency.&nbsp; We have got what is called the WELL Programme &ndash; We Love Learning &ndash; and the whole idea about that programme is that it is supposed to encourage the children and give them a sense of self-confidence.&nbsp; We started as a reading programme.&nbsp; We now have a tuition programme. &nbsp;And I have one simple rule to my grassroots leaders and volunteers who help run this programme, which is that whatever we do for the children, it must be (1) fun; (2) educational, and the children must link the concept of learning with fun in their mind.&nbsp; The amount of effort put in by the grassroots leaders as well as the tutors &ndash; we work with MENDAKI as well as other self-help groups &ndash;&nbsp;has paid off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because last year, out of the eight children in the programme who sat for their PSLE &ndash; these all come from low-income backgrounds &ndash; three of them&nbsp;failed their Mathematics and Science, two of them failed English in Primary 5&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;six got into Express stream.&nbsp; You have to understand how remarkable that is when&nbsp;we consider that three of them failed&nbsp;in Primary 5.&nbsp; They were able <p align=left>Column: 3220</p>to do this because of encouragement, support and, most importantly, because we believed in them and that gave them a sense of belief in themselves.&nbsp; So when Mr Sin Boon Ann talked about students in the better schools doing well and there being a gap, that may be true but it does not mean that the gap cannot be bridged.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be bridged with help,&nbsp;effort,&nbsp;commitment and&nbsp;care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see that this Budget does reflect that because I was very heartened by the introduction of the Child Development Credit Scheme for all Singaporean children aged&nbsp;six and below as well as the enhanced Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) and Centre-based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC) schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I think that we can do a little more to encourage the mothers to go to work.&nbsp; The reason often given by the mothers as to why they cannot work is that they have to look after the young children.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get round this problem and to encourage mothers to go to work and contribute to the family income, I suggest that the Government consider a scheme whereby a mother from a low-income family who goes back to work or who is on Workfare should get priority for her child in infant care or a student care centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we could consider additional subsidies (also contingent upon her working), to help pay for infant care and childcare fees.&nbsp; This would incentivise the mothers to go back to work and, at the same time, relieve them of their main concern which is who would look after the children when they work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the fathers, the problem is slightly different.&nbsp; This is a typical example: a student came to see me.&nbsp; He wanted to go to ITE.&nbsp; I wrote for him, got a place in ITE, that was a year ago. Then at the end of last year, he came back to see me and asked for a place&nbsp;in ITE.&nbsp;&nbsp;I<p align=left>Column: 3221</p>said, "What happened? I thought I had written the appeal for you."&nbsp; And he said&nbsp;that&nbsp;the family did not have enough money to cover the basic necessities, so the parents told him to go out and work and he gave up his place&nbsp;in ITE, which was very short-term thinking.&nbsp; So I made the appeal for him, secured funding for him to go to ITE and told him this time he should not give up that chance.&nbsp; But that kind of thinking is prevalent because of immediate short-term needs.&nbsp; I would suggest, therefore, that we consider a training subsidy or maintenance allowance that would allow the breadwinner to continue to provide for the family's basic needs whilst the breadwinner goes for skills upgrading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the new Child Development Credit, I assume though that that is just for children of parents who are wed.&nbsp; In other words, it would not apply to illegitimate children.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Government to reconsider this.&nbsp; I appreciate and understand the underlying philosophy as to why they are not eligible, which is that the Government does not want to encourage or to be perceived to be encouraging people to have children out of wedlock.&nbsp; Ultimately, not extending this or some other form of help to illegitimate children who come from low-income families is self-defeating because that particular group is also the group that tends to have many children of single unwed parents.&nbsp; In fact, in one of my HDB rental flats, there is a single mother with six children.&nbsp; She is currently expecting&nbsp;her seventh child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is these children who are&nbsp;most likely to grow up with little or no education because the parents just cannot send them to school. And they are the ones likely to remain at the bottom 20th percentile, and they are the ones most likely not to experience real growth in their incomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3222</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just from a purely pragmatic and practical level, if we want to be able to grow incomes across the board at all levels, then we also need to start thinking in terms of what we can do to get children of unwed, single parents properly educated starting right from pre-school.&nbsp; If they do not get a good foundation, then they will be left behind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude by saying that this is a good Budget.&nbsp; It is a strategic and thoughtful Budget, and it is in the best interests of Singapore. I would call it a People's Budget.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this, Sir, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.22 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that many Singaporeans look&nbsp;at the Budget as an <I>angpow</I>.<I>&nbsp;</I> This is understandable as everyone is concerned about the growing cost of living and the growing rate of inflation. But we also have to bear in mind that mere <I>angpows</I> or cash handouts are not a sustainable way to address growing economic pressures.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, we already have in place numerous modes of relief that address both&nbsp;immediate and long-term needs for the low-income people.&nbsp;&nbsp;These include the Workfare Income Supplement, ComCare, and the various CDC-level assistance schemes&nbsp;plus many other forms of help that is in&nbsp;our "Many Helping Hands" approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, the most important and the great and best <I>angpow</I> we can hope for is, in fact, full employment, economic stability and the ability to grow our economic pie so that everyone can have a larger share. This is where the challenge lies &ndash; help Singaporeans from all income levels to improve their income levels through continued effort to increase their&nbsp;skills and productivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3223</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to note that this year's Budget continues to emphasise not mere handouts, but productivity and innovation for long-term sustainable growth and incomes. At the same time, the Budget has also made important outlays in social investments &ndash;&nbsp;catering for the elderly, the ageing population and other crucial social issues.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Budget has done well to share the good things with all Singaporeans, especially the lower-income group. We must not forget the middle class, who continue to feel the pressures of inflation, but do not qualify for financial benefits and schemes that&nbsp;are aimed at the lower-income groups. We must therefore continue to support and reassure our middle-income professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) in the form of job stability, continued upgrading&nbsp;to enhance their employability, job enhancements and the Government's measures to continue to create more good jobs and give them opportunities&nbsp;to improve their livelihood.&nbsp; We must also reassure them that schemes are in place to alleviate some of the economic pressures they face. To this end, we must continue to strive for a "best wage for all". &nbsp;I welcome the enhanced training support for PMETs in the form of more places at Continuing Education and Training Centres as well as better subsidies for this group of people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent report on incomes has revealed that the Gini coefficient &ndash; which measures the income gap &ndash; is increasing. While this may be of concern, we must also dig deeper to understand why this gap persists so that we can see it in perspective. With the Government&rsquo;s transfers and benefits, the Gini coefficient was 0.452 in 2010. This shows that the Government's schemes have been helpful in moderating the income inequality.&nbsp; I hope that the Government will continue to<p align=left>Column: 3224</p>do more in this area.&nbsp; We must also be mindful of what causes the gap to remain large &ndash; perhaps it is because the rate of income growth in the higher percentile outstrips the growth of the lower income group which, in fact, is also&nbsp;continued to grow, but&nbsp;at a smaller pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, as the Chinese saying goes "<I>ti di bu fen ti</I> ",&nbsp;let us look how far the baseline has increased, rather than the gap that remains. Therefore,&nbsp;I welcome the various Budget measures that address the lower income &ndash; especially the enhanced Workfare Income Supplement and the Workfare Development Scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the increase in the cost of living, I would also like to ask the Minister to consider or look into whether it is possible for us to increase&nbsp;the dependant tax relief for spouses and children in view of the rising costs that is "squeezing" the budgets of many Singaporeans. &nbsp;In its latest budget announced, the Hong Kong government has increased the dependant tax relief by 20%. It has also raised its child allowance and the additional one-off child allowance in the year of birth by 20%.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would continue my speech in Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110302/20110302VS_164623.pdf"">Appendix A*</a>.</I>]<I>&nbsp;</I> Employers, as responsible citizens, must continue to also review wage policies and job training&nbsp;&ndash; especially those for our mature and low wage workers. While a large majority of our workforce has diploma-level qualifications and above, we need to ensure that those who do not continue to upgrade so that they do not get left in the cold. We must also emphasise not only "best wages" but fair wages. I am pleased that&nbsp;the NEA and Town Councils have schemes to recognise or elevate the skills of cleaners. Since employee skills training became a requirement in the Town Council cleaning contracts from 2008, a full-time cleaner can earn $1,000<p align=left>Column: 3225</p>monthly,&nbsp;an increase&nbsp;from $650 to $750 previously. Those who are skilled in handling machinery can receive $1,200 to $1,400, compared to the previous average of $750. This is a very good move and I urge other organisations&nbsp;&ndash; particularly schools to do more.&nbsp; During one of my house visits, a school cleaner told me that his monthly income&nbsp;remains very low due to the MOE's outsourcing arrangement. The Government agencies should do more.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3413-3416.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, the coming increase in foreign worker levy has been a matter of debate these few weeks. Some employers are complaining that the increases are coming down "like floodwaters"&nbsp;&ndash; and there&nbsp;are some resentments on the ground.&nbsp; A friend from a SME recently told me that the Heaven must be busy this Chinese New Year. I asked him why he said so. He said, "Because all Singapore bosses are now 'asking the Heaven' every day." I asked him how they do so and he said that they do so by singing, "Ask the Heaven". What are they asking? He told me that this&nbsp;is currently a popular Taiwanese song. It was originally a song about "endless love"; it has now become a song about "endless moans"! I cannot give you the lyrics in <I>Hokkien</I> &nbsp;so I have translated them into Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how it goes:</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wind is really angry, the rain is really angry<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angry because I've no backbone<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foreign labour is disappearing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Levy is here to stay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What, oh what is Productivity?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've asked around but what "cuts" have there been?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My business is tied so tightly by you<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask the Heaven, I ask Earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you not make fun of me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you continue, I will be so tortured<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask Heaven, I ask Earth,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't you not make fun of me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to forget this as quickly as possible<br><p align=left>Column: 3226</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But my dreams are all about the levy increase next year."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said we have 3R &ndash; reuse, reduce, recycle &ndash; in our green efforts; now we have 3R concerning foreign workers &ndash; replace, reduce, return!&nbsp; While I can understand that the levy increases are significant, these must be seen in context. Firstly, the increases are staggered and the first increase this year was announced in 2010. The next increase will only kick-in in 2012 and again in 2013. Employers are being informed well in advance of the levy increase - the coming flood, if you will say. This being the case, employers have plenty of time to escape the flood, step out of the way and build up their "dams".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should adopt a carrot and stick approach. We could look at incentivising companies that upgrade their foreign workers. We can also reward, instead of penalise, companies that obtain good productivity goals. Can we look at developing a productivity scorecard for companies, particularly SMEs? For those that obtain good productivity gains, we could give them levy subsidies or rebates. Currently, the levy hikes affect all companies, whether or not it does well in innovating or raising productivity. This should not be the case. The levy increases should be structured in a way that rewards innovation, skills upgrading and a productivity mindset.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we continue to drive the productivity mindset in the labour market, we must also be conscious to ensure that this expectation of productivity applies to all our workers. Employers need to play their part to ensure that the qualifications, training and skills required of local workers are the same for foreign workers as well. Employment must continue to be skills and not headcount based. We must also continue to foster social integration among our diverse workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3227</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that our current foreign worker reliance is not tenable and can be likened to an addiction.&nbsp; At present, I believe the 1:2 migrant-locals ratio is adequate for not only practical manpower needs, but in terms of perception of neutrality. Let me illustrate with an example that one of my friends raised. If you line up one foreign worker and two Singaporean workers, the Singaporean in the middle, looking to his right and left will see one foreign worker and one Singaporean. The perception therefore is that it is "equal". But raise the quota to 1:1 and the impression when looking beside him will be that there are two foreign workers versus only one other Singaporean. The perception will be that of being "crowded" out of a job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change is&nbsp;constant" and the global competition is real.&nbsp; Companies and employers have to review the way they do things, innovate and keep one step ahead. Recently,&nbsp;my NTUC colleague Ong Ye Kung shared with me that he visited a food manufacturing factory that has automated many of its processes.&nbsp; Through IPG and innovation, the company has reduced its operating costs and reliance on foreign labour. Happily, it has also meant that the company has done better and rewarded its workers&nbsp;&ndash; mostly locals&nbsp;&ndash; with an 8% wage increase. I believe more companies can learn from such an example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I> ):&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;as we continue to grow the economic pie, we must also not forget sustainability of our workforce.&nbsp; We can do more for education, especially in the early years to build a sound foundation, and in the later years to boost skills.&nbsp; Already we have taken steps to prepare our children for life with a broad-based and holistic education.&nbsp; But we should&nbsp;also see where we can support schools further in this regard.&nbsp; Even as we build strong educational foundations in the <p align=left>Column: 3228</p>school-going years, we must also continue the lifelong learning approach.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, we should do more to nurture our young people.&nbsp; More and more Singaporeans want to have a more active part to play in their country and call for alternative views and channels.&nbsp; This is a positive thing but only to some extent.&nbsp; What we need is not just views or alternative views, but understanding&nbsp;the issue and coming up with a practical action.&nbsp; Already the platforms are out there.&nbsp; We have REACH, social media and many other online channels.&nbsp; All Government agencies should do more to further explore how&nbsp;we should respond and work with our young to help them turn alternative views and complaints into practical solutions.&nbsp; More so, we should also help them transform all the ideas that they have into workable actions.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One clear signal from this Budget is that the Government is being responsive to the practical needs of the people.&nbsp; In this Budget, we see fine-tuning of schemes to help businesses, more help for the lower-income and middle-income groups and moves to counter inflation in the long term by growing the economic pie.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the Government can also continue this people-centric approach in other areas of concern.&nbsp; One of these is the worry of many young Singaporeans&nbsp;on&nbsp;the affordability and timing of new flats.&nbsp; The recent revisions to raise the ceiling cap for DBSS and the shortening of the waiting time for BTOs are welcome.&nbsp; But perhaps the Government could also look into opening more options for couples waiting to start a family early.&nbsp; For example, can we revive and bring back the Interim Rental Housing Scheme for couples who have already booked flats under the BTO scheme for which they have to wait for about two to three years?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3229</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area that need the review and response is in the area of industrial plot ratio of 1.4.&nbsp; As a land scarce country, I think we should not continue or confine our institutions that need more land.&nbsp; Flexibility in this area is needed so that we can intensify and maximise our land use.&nbsp; Ultimately, the Government has indicated it is listening to the need of the people and the Grow and Share Budget is one that will address our economic fundamentals while enhancing the social support for a strong and resilient society.&nbsp; It gives a helping hand where it is needed, and opens up opportunities for people to embrace and&nbsp;create&nbsp;a best home for all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.41 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;thank you for this opportunity to speak on Budget 2011.&nbsp; I rise in support of the Budget.&nbsp; Having&nbsp;heard two full days of speeches, one wonders what more&nbsp;I can say.&nbsp; Moreover, I am sure all present here are more keen to hear&nbsp;from Mr Budget than me.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I am sure you will agree that many of the good points are worth re-emphasising and remembering, especially the basics we need for our future.&nbsp; The Budget is not just about goodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, how do we understand what the Budget means?&nbsp; Many of the figures given&nbsp;can be quite mind-boggling, especially for the average Singaporean.&nbsp; Here I would like the Minister&nbsp;for Finance, hon. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, to elucidate as to how&nbsp;we want Singaporeans to understand the Budget, especially in the context of the long-term and short-term messages we want Singaporeans to&nbsp;imbibe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt many, if not most, will see this as a GE Budget.&nbsp; Understandably, this<p align=left>Column: 3230</p>is expected by most to be a GE year, although we can go on up to next year.&nbsp; There are many goodies to be given out.&nbsp; But understandably too, as our economy did very well last year.&nbsp; As Minister Tharman said, this is a growth-sharing Budget.&nbsp; This is after all the thrust of the Budget presented.&nbsp; Grow and Share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I see this Budget as a $10 billion bonus for the people.&nbsp; Four billion dollars back to reserves, $3.2 billion for social investment and $3.4 billion for sharing surpluses.&nbsp; Yes, I even consider the $4 billion being placed back in the reserves as for the people.&nbsp; We have to remember that even in times of surpluses, savings for the rainy day must be part of our philosophy and our approach towards life.&nbsp; As the Malay saying goes, "<I>sediakan payung sebelum hujan</I>".&nbsp;&nbsp;Better to have your umbrella ready before it rains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this also reminds me about the spirit of the now famous <I>Hokkien</I> song which is like a Eunos mantra in&nbsp;my constituency which is <I>&nbsp;ai pia chi ai ya.</I>&nbsp;70% hard work, 30% luck.&nbsp; So, we must not be afraid of sharing when sharing is due, especially when our people deserve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to see the spirit of humility shown by Minister Tharman when he said, "in addition to hard and good work, we also had good fortune".&nbsp; Now, that reminds me of the&nbsp;other song about the heavens, <I>wo men ti,</I> meaning, you can turn to the heavens.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, if I may digress a bit to say that, in Eunos, many people thought that I have been singing this <I>ai pia ai ya</I> (in <I>Hokkien</I> ) song too long so they wanted to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked them to look for another song.&nbsp; But most of the time they come back with love songs.&nbsp; I know I love my residents and I hope they love me too, but I wanted something like the <I>ai pia</I> spirit, which is about strive, about hard work and this is about Singapore.&nbsp; Then <p align=left>Column: 3231</p>they suggested, "what about <I>wo men ti?</I>"&nbsp; So I said, "are you sure that would be appropriate?" Because in an election year, people may think that when they ask for something which the Government cannot deliver, then&nbsp;we say, "just turn to Heaven."&nbsp; So, that song might not be appropriate too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, anyway, I think we know what Singapore represents.&nbsp; In times of hardship, in time of surpluses, we must get our basics right.&nbsp; This approach of Grow and Share is fair and not "under-the-belt"&nbsp;Budget as I overheard&nbsp;one Opposition member said.&nbsp; Neither is it right to say its pork-barrel politics.&nbsp; It is not Singapore style.&nbsp; It is <I>haram.</I>&nbsp; It is not what we believe in.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government&nbsp;believes in fair and equal sharing and when it is due,&nbsp;we will give what is due.&nbsp; Those who claim as such &ndash; the pork-barrel politics &ndash; just reflect that they do not understand the philosophy and principles of Singapore's basics for our future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Mr Speaker, Sir, before we get overwhelmed by the euphoria of the surpluses, allow me to remind ourselves about these basics.&nbsp; Singaporeans should not lose sight of our basics for the sake of future generations.&nbsp; I was glad to hear over radio this morning one listener&nbsp;saying that she was worried that&nbsp;Singaporeans are expecting goodies from&nbsp;every Budget.&nbsp; Let us not develop, she said, a "jelly fish" mentality among Singaporeans, and she said that emphatically.&nbsp; Let us not get soft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is about hard work of our people, good governance, cohesive and harmonious multi-racial, multi-religious Singapore.&nbsp; Allow me, Sir,&nbsp; to share two examples of how I see these basics being translated in real life.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at the seminar on "Wills, Islamic Law of Inheritance and Inheritance Planning" two Sundays ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand people attended, and this was<p align=left>Column: 3232</p>organised by Barakah Capital Planners and supported by MUIS, <I>Warna</I> the Malay radio station, <I>Berita Harian</I> and Hongkong-Shanghai Bank.&nbsp; That says a lot about those who were interested in the subject.&nbsp; That must also say about people who have inheritance and are concerned about distributing it fairly and correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the attendees were Ali Daud and his wife Sharifah Talhah.&nbsp; Both are visually impaired.&nbsp; They have a daughter in Secondary 2.&nbsp; She is not visually impaired and she is doing very well in school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali and Sharifah are two excellent examples of Singaporeans who have their basics in life right.&nbsp; Through their hard work, skills upgrading and a positive outlook to life, they have been given opportunities to excel, in their own ways.&nbsp; British Council, Ali's employer, had bought Ali computer software so that he could do his work in customer services well, despite being visually impaired.&nbsp; In fact, he is now even entrusted with student counselling.&nbsp; Even Sharifah, his wife, has been given special software&nbsp;by her company, Pratt &amp; Whitney, to do well in her receptionist work.&nbsp; But as we all know, it is not just about software or hardware but mindshare.&nbsp; The spirit must be right.&nbsp; I have always been impressed, and indeed, inspired by such Singaporeans.&nbsp; I look forward to more Singaporeans to follow such good examples of the right Singapore spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another anecdote I would like to share, Sir, is Libya.&nbsp; We all follow what is happening now&nbsp;in this North African Arab country.&nbsp; I was there last October, and again two years ago, in Senior Minister Goh's official delegation.&nbsp; And in fact, even much earlier in 1973, attending an international youth conference.&nbsp; In the exuberance and idealism of the post revolution years in the early 1970s, Libya embarked on lots of rhetorics and dogma of exclusivity.&nbsp; The leader, Muhammad&nbsp;Gadaffi, introduced the Green Book and <p align=left>Column: 3233</p>the so-called <I>The</I> <I>Third International Theory</I>.&nbsp; He said capitalism was decadent, communism on the verge of collapse, thus Islam is the only&nbsp;answer to the world's woes.&nbsp; Interestingly, the conference rejected the idea instead, asking for inclusivity rather than exclusivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Mr Speaker, that brings me back to the Budget, where Minister Tharman had emphasised inclusivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we will Grow and Share but let us also remember&nbsp;the spirit of inclusiveness.&nbsp; Allow me also&nbsp;to add that inclusiveness is not just about improving the skills and economic performance of the different income groups but also social programmes to bring about greater and better cohesiveness and harmony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I would like to urge the Government to enhance the good work done by MCYS and the various VWOs and religious organisations.&nbsp; Government should not shy away from doing more and thus increasing the resources available at MCYS and these VWOs and members of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO)&nbsp;to play an effective role.&nbsp; I welcome the extension of the 250% tax reduction for contributions to the Institutions of Public Character (IPC) and hope to see it as a permanent part of our Singapore charitable landscape.&nbsp; Government should continue to be big-hearted to those who are generous&nbsp;towards charity work and programmes that will bring our people as one united Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now&nbsp;to&nbsp;say a few words in Malay.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110302/20110302VS_170346.pdf"">Appendix A*</a>.</I>] &nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Budget is a heartening one.&nbsp; It fulfills the need of Singaporeans from all aspects, whether for the benefit of the people, the private sector's growth, and, more importantly, for the lower-income and middle-income Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3234</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen from the two days of debate in the House that Members of Parliament show concern towards issues that is worrying Singaporeans, be it about the cost of living, the cost of medical bills and inflation. I believe and I hope that the Government will do whatever is necessary to ensure that our people will continue to have the confidence and self-belief to overcome any challenges that they may face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This should convince us that the Government is concerned about the short-term and long-term needs of the people.&nbsp; As we enjoy the goodies and assistance provided, we must not forget the long-term messages that are being conveyed, for instance, the need for skills training and looking at educational and job opportunities that the people can take advantage of.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we accept the Government's "Grow and Share" approach, we must also be thankful that the Government pays a lot of attention towards the issue of inclusive living.&nbsp; No matter how much the economy grows, it will not be perfect without a harmonious and cohesive living environment.&nbsp; This inclusive living environment should not be limited only to the issues of income and skills upgrading, but also to social and community programmes.&nbsp; However, this is our collective responsibility.&nbsp; I hope MCYS can be given more provisions in order to perform its role&nbsp;as best as it can.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>)<I>:</I> &nbsp; In conclusion, let me close by suggesting that we Singaporeans should see this Budget as an opportunity to Grow and Share and strive for an Inclusive Society.&nbsp; In short, let us see ourselves as players and contributors towards this Grow and Share Inclusive Society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Budget.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>12.54 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to&nbsp;catch the tail end of the debate.&nbsp; Looking through the list of the themes of each Budget for the past 10&nbsp;years, in seven of the 10 years, the themes have the words&nbsp;society, home, community and future in them.&nbsp; This is no mere coincidence.&nbsp; Each Budget puts a little something into strengthening our Singapore society, and in bumper years like 2010, the Finance Minister brings forth&nbsp;three large vats of rice&nbsp;to distribute.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what sets Singapore apart from many other countries.&nbsp; We squirrel away our reserves; taking some out on a rainy day and immediately putting them back when it is sunny again.&nbsp; We sow seeds for the future and continuously inject vitality and nourishment into our societal sinews.&nbsp; We know that when we believe in doing something, we persevere year after year, so clearly demonstrated by&nbsp;our Armed Forces which have grown unrecognisably&nbsp;from nearly&nbsp;two boats and a couple of platoons; and&nbsp;our societal networks and infrastructure are built up strength by strength, like a helix, growing more complex and stronger year after year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One piece of our infrastructure, the sinew that binds our people networks that I like to highlight&nbsp;is the People's Association and its group of Grassroots Volunteers.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, People's Association and the CCCs grew out of villages, kampong networks and councils.&nbsp; Progress brought along more modern facilities, and even the methods of outreach evolved to suit the times.&nbsp; But the spirit and the people element will never change.&nbsp; The very success of the People's Association, I dare say, is because of the people &ndash; the PA staff and its volunteers.&nbsp; PA's success came at the expense of the countless hours its staff toil in the thick of the community, smoothening the jarring edges, polishing<p align=left>Column: 3236</p>the melded pieces.&nbsp; It is a job that cannot be done on a&nbsp;8.00 am to 5.00 pm basis, and the best PA staff I have encountered have&nbsp;treated the community that he has been entrusted with almost with the same love and care as his own extended family.&nbsp; Many lived and breathed their work.&nbsp; And the multiplier of their efforts&nbsp;is the grassroots leaders.&nbsp; The very reason why grassroots leaders volunteer, eschewing the comforts of their homes and working voluntarily for the betterment of their fellow community brethren.&nbsp; And many a times, also&nbsp;parting with their own funds&nbsp;because they have seen the importance of PA and grassroots' work.&nbsp;&nbsp;This work is&nbsp;relevant, and in fact a cornerstone to our continued societal strength.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that we continue to see this group as key to our societal firmament and to continue to more than adequately fund it so that we have the right type of people and the right number of people working in our community for our future continued good health.&nbsp; We can be too easily enamoured&nbsp;by KPIs and it is not easy to measure this intangible&nbsp;thing we called social capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I hope we continue to put aside funds to ensure that we continue to fund the build-up of our treasure&nbsp;of social capital.&nbsp; For the very nature of this beast we call social capital is that it has to be continually fed, so that its reach&nbsp;remains extensive, its influence pervasive and its internal constitution intensively cross linked.&nbsp; For this to happen, PA needs funds and people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust and faith in society is assured only if every person in it feels that they have a stake.&nbsp; This is no new revelation.&nbsp; Our mantra of Inclusive Society sums it all up nicely.&nbsp; Here I hope that more can be done for two groups within our midst:&nbsp;dysfunctional families&nbsp;and the mentally ill.&nbsp; In the past 10 years as an MP and advisor, I have seen more and more schemes that came along that address many of these problems.&nbsp; Workfare and ComCare are two key instruments.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3237</p>Through Workfare, a person acquires the monetary resources to live better, cope with rising costs and at the same time have the pride and self esteem that he is able to do his utmost to fend for himself, with society supplementing.&nbsp; ComCare addresses immediate crisis &ndash; it is a band-aid.&nbsp; We have to recognise that we need the resources to customise aid to every case post ComCare.&nbsp; If not, we will not have made a dent at the problem.&nbsp; Here, I am asking for more social workers to be dedicated to each Division on the ground&nbsp;for they are the ones that when appropriately complemented by the community and grassroots, ensure that the Many Helping Hands actually get their hands around the problems and reach out with the appropriate solutions.&nbsp; Where people are involved, broad brush cookie-cutter solutions may not be effective.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to deploy social workers on the ground intimately working the cases.&nbsp; Just as society's continued good health needs PA,&nbsp;its staff and volunteers,&nbsp; social workers are needed for the dysfunctional families, mentally infirmed and bring about some relief to the strains on their families.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sooner we act, the sooner we deploy more resources to the ground, more Singaporeans will be helped.&nbsp; Let me just illustrate with one case in my ward.&nbsp;&nbsp; A young woman, aged 17 is a resident in Block 541, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10.&nbsp; She is a single mother at 17 years and also the eldest of three in the family. &nbsp;She has a younger brother aged five years old and sister aged two years old who are taken care of by her grandmother aged&nbsp;65 years old.&nbsp; She&nbsp;has a son aged&nbsp;two years old born out of a wedlock.&nbsp; She is unemployed.&nbsp; Both her parents are now in Changi Prison for drug related offences.&nbsp; But she is determined to support her child and siblings while her parents are in jail, and she wants to work.&nbsp; In the meantime, the flat arrears are building up and the day of reckoning is approaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;Five lives,&nbsp;four of them&nbsp;young ones with the future<p align=left>Column: 3238</p>ahead of them.&nbsp; They&nbsp;require very special assistance so that the young have a decent start in life.&nbsp; We wish that we&nbsp;could have worked with the parents before they turned to drugs and jail.&nbsp; Now, we must pay close attention to the kids that they left at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the strains of coping with such dysfunctionality in families and also with the mentally infirmed tear at the seams of both families and the immediate community.&nbsp; Solutions to such problems, I argue, will further fortify our inclusive society and build the resilience that will prepare us for storms and challenges that we cannot yet foresee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can only achieve if we have a good Government,&nbsp; good leaders who continue to grow the economic pie so that we can have the resources to blossom as a society.&nbsp; Execution is through an efficient and service oriented civil service.&nbsp; Here, I just want to make a small suggestion.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the "no wrong door" policy.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is already a great step forward.&nbsp; It reflects the awareness that&nbsp; it could be frustrating navigating the milieu of administration.&nbsp; Still, more could be done.&nbsp; Why not take&nbsp;the "no wrong door" policy a step further&nbsp;to a "no wrong lap" policy?&nbsp; If it lands on your lap, you go and solve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take ownership and make it your business to get the matter resolved.&nbsp; Why do I say that?&nbsp; Let me illustrate with a recent&nbsp; example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two weeks ago, we launched a 3G centre for the residents of Ang Mo Kio.&nbsp; Just days before the official opening ceremony, the short strip of road in front of the centre needed to be paved.&nbsp; It cuts across the jurisdiction of three agencies.&nbsp; Eventually, three agencies came and got&nbsp;the job&nbsp;done, but one&nbsp;after the other.&nbsp; The good thing is that, of course, the job got done, but it could well have been more efficient, and probably a lot cheaper if one party did it all at once, instead of&nbsp;three<p align=left>Column: 3239</p>groups mobilised one after the other,&nbsp;all doing roughly the same work on three adjacent strips of pavement.&nbsp; I can well understand why it happened.&nbsp; Different agencies, each protecting its own budget and inevitably creating artificial boundaries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empowerment&nbsp; and ownership are needed in order that the "no wrong lap" policy could work.&nbsp; Someone has to take the lead.&nbsp; And somebody has to&nbsp;take on the role of&nbsp;the honest broker so that no one agency eventually feels short changed.&nbsp; But I believe, eventually, it will be more efficient and costs will be reduced.&nbsp; Public appreciation of our civil service will be infinitely&nbsp;enhanced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all Members for their views and suggestions. I have listened closely to all of them, on a few occasions when I have had to take a biological break, I have made sure I read all the transcripts. I will address in my round up all the key issues that pertain to the Budget.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are many other issues that the Members have raised which should be taken up by the respective Ministers in their COS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues concerning marriage and parenthood, specific policies concerning the environment, the elderly, the disabled, policies concerning the arts and sports, measures to help youth and families at-risk.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been a rich debate and I am sure my colleagues will take into account not just what will be said during the COS cuts but also what has been said during the Budget Debate itself.<br></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key issues that I want to address during my round up are basically four:&nbsp; first, whether we have adopted the right strategies to boost productivity;&nbsp;&nbsp;second,  <p align=left>Column: 3240</p> how we can keep social mobility going and uplift&nbsp; lower-income Singaporeans;&nbsp; third, how we are addressing the issue of rising cost of living and in particular whether we should we cut the GST;&nbsp; and finally, how do we sustain a progressive fiscal system whilst meeting future expenditure needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Raising productivity</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me address each of the four issues in turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Teo has provided an overview of our strategies to boost productivity, including what's already been rolled out, including many examples of how businesses are in fact taking advantage of our schemes. They are upgrading, taking advantage of the various new grants under the National Productivity Fund as well as existing grant schemes that SPRING and other agencies have.&nbsp; And as Deputy Prime Minister Teo and several other MPs have emphasised, MP Denise Phua, NMPs Paulin Straughan, Mildred Tan and many others, tripartite collaboration is important in all of these. And our Labour MPs, in particular, spoke in some detail about what they are doing, what the unions are doing to work with specific industries and companies to redesign jobs, raise skills, raise productivity and thereby raise wages.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) was introduced last year and enhanced this year. I think everyone, including our businesses, recognises that it is a generous scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;It effectively amounts to a significant cut in corporate taxes for companies that are investing in productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have received feedback since the Budget. In fact since a week and a half ago, we have received further feedback from our chambers, associations and several individual businesses.&nbsp; Our SMEs do face an impediment in taking full advantage of the scheme. They want to invest now. They want to take advantage of the scheme but they have cash flow problems. The<p align=left>Column: 3241</p>scheme provides them significant rewards later. So we studied various options how we can help these businesses because I agree this is a valid concern.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have therefore decided to allow tax deferral under the PIC scheme. Tax deferrals that will allow businesses to obtain cash in the same year as their investments&nbsp;&ndash; by deferring the taxes that they need to pay in the current year to the following year.&nbsp;&nbsp;For up to $100,000 of qualifying PIC expenditures in the current year, businesses may defer the same quantum of tax to the next year.&nbsp;One hundred thousand dollars&nbsp;cater to a very broad base of SMEs, when you talk about the types of investments or the types of training expenditures they intend to incur.&nbsp;&nbsp;This tax deferral allows businesses to effectively enjoy their tax savings under the PIC scheme one year in advance, if they so wish. It will apply to expenditures incurred for the year of assessment 2012 to the year of assessment 2015.</p><p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members have mentioned that businesses are under the impression that the PIC claim process will be complex.&nbsp; This is in fact not the case.&nbsp; PIC benefits can be claimed as part of routine tax filing.&nbsp; In fact, for companies, no additional supporting documents are required specifically for the PIC claims.&nbsp; And for smaller outfits like sole-proprietorships and partnerships, for whom it is not a requirement to submit audited accounts together with the tax returns, they will only need to furnish in a simple form the details of their expenses for PIC. So we will keep this very simple, easy to understand, easy to make your claims.&nbsp; Businesses that wish to opt for the cash grant option under the PIC can do so anytime after their financial year has ended, although I would say that with the new enhancement that I have just announced&nbsp;&ndash; the tax deferral scheme, many businesses will choose to take advantage of that and not wait until the cash grant becomes available in the<p align=left>Column: 3242</p>following year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will provide support through our Enterprise Development Centres at key business chambers and associations to advise businesses not only on how they can improve their productivity; but also on how they can tap on the whole range of government schemes available including our grants as well as our PIC scheme.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRAS has in fact been very active in publicising the PIC.&nbsp;&nbsp;It sent out brochures to 225,000 businesses late last year, conducted 50 PIC seminars for 7,600 participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is going to do more.&nbsp; I urge industry associations and chambers to continue to work actively with IRAS to increase awareness and help get maximum take-up rate of the PIC scheme. We will work with them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key driver for productivity&nbsp;&ndash; the tight domestic labour market.&nbsp; To complement business restructuring and productivity investments, we also need to manage the supply of foreign workers (FWs) &ndash; as many MPs, including MPs Arthur Fong and Yeo Guat Kwang just this afternoon, have mentioned.&nbsp; We want to make a quantum leap in productivity. Ten years from now, we want to be in a very different place from where we are now.&nbsp; We know we will not get there if we continue to rely extensively on low-skilled foreign labour.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We introduced one round of foreign worker levy increases last year, and we extended and accentuated the increases this year. But the foreign worker levy increases are not the fundamental driver for the business upgrading that has to take place.&nbsp; The key driver is a tight labour market. We have virtually full employment. The growth of our labour force going forward is also going to be extremely low. Wage costs will go up. &nbsp;In a full employment economy, it is not just wage costs, but rental costs and many other costs that will go up.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, businesses will have to restructure and<p align=left>Column: 3243</p>make adjustments because we have succeeded and we have a full employment economy.&nbsp; Going forward, the flow of additional local workers entering the workforce is going to be limited.&nbsp; We have to restructure in order to adapt to a high cost environment and to be able to grow without ever increasing labour inputs. That was the context in which we decided to extend and accentuate the FWL increases we announced a year ago.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the increase that we announced a year ago was measured. We were just coming out of a crisis. No one knew for sure how strong the growth would be. It was a series of measured steps over a period of two years. The growth turned out to be much stronger than expected and now local wages are going up. In fact, if we do not raise foreign worker levy further now, there is&nbsp;a real likelihood that the cost of foreign workers will go up less than the cost of local workers.&nbsp; Everyone knows that means an increasing demand for foreign workers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have to extend the FWL increases beyond what we introduced last year. And it is better to do it now while the economy is still doing well and maintain that gradual schedule of increases rather than wait till later and introduce steeper increases in one go.&nbsp; The increases starting from where we were last year up till 2013, which is where the schedule of new increases ends, will impact business costs. But it is a measured impact. The total increase in labour costs for the business sector will be less than 2% when the changes are fully phased in.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sectors will be affected more &ndash; the more labour-intensive ones or, as many MPs have mentioned, sectors that depend on the human touch such as hotels, restaurants and the retail sector.<p align=left>Column: 3244</p>They depend on people.&nbsp; But these are the same sectors &ndash; construction, hospitality at large &ndash; the same sectors where productivity is relatively low compared to the industry leaders globally. There is significant headroom for us to reach productivity levels of the cities that are in the lead in these sectors.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>1.15 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members of Parliament have also questioned the effectiveness of FWL as a mechanism to achieve what we want&nbsp;&ndash; to reduce the demand for foreign labour and encourage firms to upgrade. There is no perfect way of doing this. But there is no workable alternative to the FWL increases as a means of controlling the demand for foreign labour&nbsp;&ndash; for deciding on which firm or which industry should receive more or less labour at each stage of the economic cycle. There is no workable alternative besides using a clean, straightforward price signal.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang also questioned the effectiveness of the foreign worker levy.&nbsp; But he offered no alternative in his speech this year.&nbsp; Earlier, I think it was last year, he had suggested an alternative which essentially meant that bureaucrats set quotas for different sectors and company sizes, and gradually reduce the dependency ratio to encourage productivity growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not workable. It would only mean constraining businesses' flexibility to get the necessary manpower to expand when they got opportunities. And no group of bureaucrats will be able to decide on which company or which industry is more deserving and what are the peculiarities of the circumstances they face.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is far better for us to use the price mechanism to provide clean incentives for employers to reduce dependence on low-skilled foreign manpower, while giving them the flexibility to manage cyclical changes in manpower needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3245</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we cannot increase the number of foreign workers indefinitely &ndash; and we certainly do not want it to exceed, on any sustained basis, the&nbsp;one-third of the total workforce target that we have set &ndash; we will still require a significant foreign workforce to keep our economy diversified and competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a critical mass of workers, talent and expertise, to ensure we have viable economic clusters in Singapore, and a diversified range of economic clusters. Not just one or two clusters but several.&nbsp; We need this diversification. First because it provides some resilience &ndash; some industries go down while others are going up, it provides some resilience across the economic cycle. But importantly, it also provides a variety of good jobs for Singaporeans. Not all Singaporeans are best suited to working in the frontline of a hotel or in a restaurant.&nbsp; Some are very good with their hands, very inventive with their hands, some are good in logistics. So we really need a wide range of sectors&nbsp;&ndash; manufacturing, including traditional and high-tech manufacturing, logistics, a range of service industries to provide good jobs for Singaporeans. And to provide good careers so that all Singaporeans can realise their aspirations in a thriving economy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a zero-sum game.&nbsp; Speak to any business that hires foreign workers and they will tell you it is&nbsp;not a zero-sum game. They will tell you that they are able to create good jobs for Singaporeans up and down the ladder because they have access to a certain number of foreigners. The foreigners complement the locals and make possible the story that we had in recent years. Increased demand for local workers that has pushed up their wages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many examples. And I am just going to cite one, the only one in my speech. Small company, SME&nbsp;&ndash; Chun Cheng Fishery &ndash; it is a company that processes and exports frozen tuna.&nbsp;&nbsp;They<p align=left>Column: 3246</p>are a company of about 60 to 70 people, about half are locals. They employ foreign workers &ndash; first, to fill positions in its freezing facilities, as local workers are not accustomed to working in a cold environment.&nbsp; Freezing conditions.&nbsp; Tuna comes in, they are slicing. Local workers &ndash; hard to get them for this particular task because they are not so accustomed to working in such a cold environment.&nbsp; They also brought in two experts last year from Japan to teach them how to identify the different grades of tuna and use automated cutting technology from Japan to maximise the efficiency and quality of their cuts. I will not&nbsp;go into the details but real productivity improvement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not have the knowledge locally to be able to do this, so they got in some foreign experts, very helpful.&nbsp; Now they are expanding, so more demand for workers.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;opening up a new facility to increase their processing capabilities and diversifying as well into tuna sashimi processing&nbsp;&ndash; higher-value product.&nbsp; In fact, they are now planning to quadruple their output and this means more job opportunities for locals. Small firm. We are not talking about a huge number of job opportunities but multiply that example across the economy.&nbsp; No zero-sum game. Provide them the workers they need. Give them continuous incentive to upgrade and reduce the need for low-skilled workers but try not to squeeze them out of business.</p><p><br><I>Social mobility<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many MPs have spoken about social mobility, including Mr Sin Boon Ann, Dr Lily Neo, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and, just a short while ago, Ms Irene Ng.&nbsp; Actually I can mention many names.&nbsp; We are all concerned about the widening income gap, and it is&nbsp;a concern for all of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, why is our income inequality high? It is because we are a global city. They are like that. If you look around the world, the global cities that compete with us, <p align=left>Column: 3247</p>especially Hong Kong, New York, they all have high Gini ratios. In fact our Gini ratio is a little lower than most other global cities&nbsp;&ndash; Hong Kong, New York and in fact&nbsp;seven or&nbsp;eight American cities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason lies in the nature of the economy of a global city. They require a significant pool of highly skilled people who are also on the upper end of the income ladder &ndash; a significant pool of highly skilled professionals, executives and entrepreneurs.&nbsp; That is what makes the cities tick, and they compete with each other on that basis.&nbsp; Second, their entire economy, up and down the ladder as well as across the sectors are highly exposed to global competition, so wages are influenced by what competitors are offering. Each company you talk to, multinational or local, that is involved in the international market will tell you that they have got to track what the competitors are paying and what is being offered for the same type of talent or skill, so wages are significantly influenced by what is happening in the international markets and cities show this up in an accentuated way, which is why the Gini is high.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Income inequality is not irrelevant. It is something we should be concerned with.&nbsp; What matters most is not income inequality itself, but&nbsp;whether we succeed in raising incomes and living standards for all Singaporeans, including and especially the lower income groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as Mr Sin Boon Ann and several other MPs said, whether we can keep providing opportunities&nbsp;&ndash; so that all Singaporeans regardless of their family background or starting points, have the chance to fulfil their potential and aspire to a better future.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are the key issues.&nbsp; Can we keep raising incomes, and related to that, can we keep providing opportunities for  <p align=left>Column: 3248</p> everyone to realise their potential and their aspirations?&nbsp; If we want to achieve this, we need a&nbsp;dynamic economy and society; opportunities for all;&nbsp;we need to generate sufficient resources so that we can make the required transfers to help the lower income to uplift themselves; we must maintain a sense of community where everyone participates, and those who have got more, give back to the community and try to help the others.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has done well in growing incomes for our people; in fact we have done better than most countries with a much lower degree of income inequality, as measured by the Gini index. If we look at the median household across countries and growth of real median household incomes,&nbsp;real median household incomes in Singapore grew by 1.7% per year from 2000 to 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done better than the other advanced Asian economies [<I>Chart 1*</I> ].&nbsp; Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have seen declines in median incomes over the decade.&nbsp; Median incomes in South Korea have risen, but by less: 1.1% per year.&nbsp; We did better than economies that have a lower degree of income inequality.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, as a result of having grown our incomes, if we look at income levels, we are not doing badly either. When we compare median income levels in Singapore to other countries&nbsp;&ndash; and I compare here again to the more advanced Asian economies and a set of the most advanced nations &ndash;&nbsp;Switzerland, UK and US &ndash; median wages in Singapore are higher than in Hong Kong, Korea and Japan, when adjusted for purchasing power parity. There is no perfect method for comparisons across countries, but exchange rates based on purchasing power parity are what the IMF and World Bank use [<I>Chart 2*</I> ].&nbsp; I will also include as an Annex* a comparison of median incomes using market exchange rate, which will show an essentially similar story.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our median wages have <p align=left>Column: 3249</p>not reached the levels of developed economies such as Switzerland and the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we grow incomes by 30% in the next decade, we will catch up with the developed countries' standards of living.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growth in incomes has been accompanied by growth in employment. Singaporeans have benefited from the growth in employment. From 2006 to 2010, 228,000 new jobs went to Singaporeans. In fact in 2010 alone, 44,700 new jobs went to Singaporeans.&nbsp; This has led to a higher employment rate among our citizens. If you look at the working age population and see what proportion of them are employed, we used to have a significantly lower rate than the developed countries, but we have now caught up. Our employment rate has caught up with most of the developed countries. The big difference, however, is that our high employment rate is a result of a very low unemployment rate among those in the labour force. Whereas the same employment rate in the developed countries is a reflection of higher labour force participation rates, particularly among women, but offset by a very high unemployment rate. So we are in the right place, high employment rate because we have got very low unemployment&nbsp;&ndash; and that is&nbsp;because we have a dynamic economy. One aspect of maintaining a dynamic economy is ensuring we have rational policies, and this includes our policies on foreign labour. Have a price mechanism to encourage upgrading, but recognise that foreign labour is part and parcel of the growth that can help Singaporeans raise incomes.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3397-3398; 3399-3400.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, that is what we have seen. I have got another chart which I am going to show.&nbsp; I will focus now&nbsp;on the lower end, the 20th percentile household. Mr Low Thia Khiang and some others have felt that the infusion of foreign workers has been to the disadvantage of <p align=left>Column: 3250</p>Singaporeans. I did, in fact, address this last year and I am&nbsp;going to do it again now, updated to 2010.&nbsp; As I mentioned in the Budget speech, if Members would look at the blue bars first [<I>Chart 3*</I> ], we have had significant growth in incomes at the lower end of workforce in the second half of the decade. This fortunately helped offset the rough period they went through in the first half of the decade.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of the decade was, in fact, the same period where there was a significant growth in the foreign workforce. The share of foreigners in the work force saw a significant increase,&nbsp;by about&nbsp;eight percentage points in the second half of the decade. But it was not inconsistent with growing local incomes. Why? Because local incomes and, in fact, wages generally, are not just dependent on the supply of labour but also dependent on the demand for labour.&nbsp; Yes, there was an increase in supply of foreign labour, but it went hand-in-hand with increased demand for labour across the economy. As every firm that employs both foreign and local workers will tell you, if they did not&nbsp;have the foreign workers, they could not&nbsp;have more local workers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So demand for labour picked up, unemployment went down, wages went up. That is the basic story.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we know that we need to change the way we grow going forward because our local labour force is now going to grow much more slowly. And we want to avoid an ever increasing proportion of foreigners in our workforce. That is why we have shift to productivity-driven growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social mobility is a crucial aspect of our inclusive growth model as MPs Mr Baey Yam Keng, Mr Zainudin Nordin, Dr Lily Neo, Dr Amy Khor, Ms Irene Ng and Mr Sin Boon Ann have argued.&nbsp; We maximise opportunities for everyone to do well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our meritocratic system allows any Singaporean with drive and perseverance, <p align=left>Column: 3251</p>and talent of different types to succeed. But we have to do more. In particular, we have to do more to prevent a permanent underclass from forming&nbsp;&ndash; an underclass that replicates its condition across generations.&nbsp; Let us put it in perspective. We have achieved phenomenal mobility in the last few decades. Very clearly since the 1960s but even since the 1980s. If we look at the generation that is now in their late 40s and 50s. Their parents started off with little. But many of the children have done well through a meritocratic system and moved up. Shift forward one generation, look at the present generation of young adults. They, too, have done far better than their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, less than 10% of those aged 25 to 39 young adults had diplomas or degrees.&nbsp; The proportion of 25- to39-year-olds with Polytechnic or higher qualifications has increased to 64% in 2010 [<I>Chart 4*</I> ]. So a significant shift even for that generation&nbsp;&ndash; not the first wave of mobility that happened in the 1960s and 1970s but what happened after.&nbsp; A very significant shift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then move forward to today's generation of school kids. It is&nbsp;still happening. Not as fast as before, but still happening.&nbsp; The Minister for Education&nbsp;will be talking more about this in the COS and Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, will be talking about it too&nbsp;&ndash; what we are doing to keep mobility going.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Members would&nbsp;look at today's PSLE students, today's generation of young kids, amongst those who are in the bottom&nbsp;one-third&nbsp;of socio-economic backgrounds &ndash; defined by parents' education and type of flat they are living in &ndash;&nbsp;half of them end up in the top&nbsp;two-thirds of PSLE scores. There is still significant mobility working through the system. But it will get more difficult in each successive cohort. As Mr Sin Boon Ann rightly pointed out, it is precisely because of the success of past <p align=left>Column: 3252</p>generations, precisely because we achieved a very high degree of mobility in the past.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that we have to put much more effort into our mobility efforts as we go forward, to prevent a cycle of disadvantage for those from lower-income backgrounds.&nbsp; This has been and remains our approach to helping the lower-income group. Ms Indranee Rajah gave an interesting example of the type of work required.&nbsp; Intensive scheme involving&nbsp;eight children, all had failed Primary 5.&nbsp; A lot of effort went into mentoring them and providing additional support. Of the&nbsp;eight children,&nbsp;six managed to get into the Express stream.&nbsp; That is the type of work that is required, but it is also the type of results we can still get out of our system.&nbsp;&nbsp;How we go about this is somewhat different from many other countries.&nbsp; How we go about ensuring that we keep up to this degree of social mobility, and try to alleviate the consequences of income inequality and reduce it whenever possible.</p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, education is fundamental.&nbsp;&nbsp;We invest heavily in education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly at the early stages to reduce the disadvantages faced by students from low-income backgrounds.&nbsp; The more we do early on to help children discover their strengths, the more likely they will be able to move up and do better than their parents.&nbsp; Since 2006, our expenditure on childcare and primary school education has grown much faster than for secondary and tertiary education.&nbsp; Childcare&nbsp;&ndash; 150% increase per child.&nbsp; Primary school&nbsp;&ndash; 60% increase per student.&nbsp; Pre-school fees are extremely low for lower-income groups so that no family need worry: $6 per month for childcare."&nbsp; Even less for kindergarten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improve teaching quality.&nbsp;Since 2006, primary schools have seen a 15% improvement in the number of teachers per students, and a 60% increase in Allied <p align=left>Column: 3253</p>Educators and executive and administrative staff complement teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What <I>New York Times</I> columnist, Thomas Friedman, observed&nbsp;one month ago about Gan Eng Seng Primary School, is true of our neighbourhood schools generally.&nbsp; We have principals and teachers who are passionate about what they do, and try to make learning interesting for each student.&nbsp; This is unlike many other countries with huge disparities in facilities and teaching standards, between schools in poor and wealthy neighbourhoods.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that is education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to briefly address what NCMP Ms Sylvia Lim had mentioned about the disabled. The disabled are indeed a part of our vision of an inclusive society.&nbsp; In fact, we are doing, frankly speaking, far more than many other countries that have signed on to the CRPD that she spoke about.&nbsp; But we want to do more. MCYS will be elaborating on this in the COS. It has the Enabling Masterplan that addresses the needs of the disabled comprehensively, not just the hardware aspects, barrier-free accessibility, but also the software&nbsp;&ndash; education, employment opportunities, the whole spectrum of issues that we want to address satisfactorily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are doing more in early intervention, we are doing more for our SPED schools, we are doing more to achieve barrier-free access.&nbsp; By the&nbsp;end of this year, 70% of our MRT stations will have at least two barrier-free access routes. We are spending a lot of money on this, $116 million. By 2020, all our public buses will be wheelchair-accessible. It takes some time but, in fact, by end of last year, 40% of our public bus fleet already comprised wheelchair-accessible buses.&nbsp; In this budget alone, we have done more for the disabled. We have extended the financial assistance scheme that MOE has to help needy children to our SPED schools; provided additional funding to the schools directly for them to <p align=left>Column: 3254</p>decide on how best they can help needy pupils. And importantly, the Community Silver Trust will include the disabled adults. I quite agree with Ms Sylvia Lim that we have to do more for our disabled adults. The Community Silver Trust will enable us to do that by bringing in donors, bringing in charitable organisations, bringing in passionate volunteers. With the Government putting in significant resources to help match every contribution that is made.&nbsp; We need to do more, and we intend to do more.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is&nbsp;the first plank &ndash; education. Next &ndash; housing, which I am not going into detail on, Minister Mah Bow Tan will be talking about this in the COS. We are helping the lower-income group own their houses so they can have an asset that appreciates over time. It goes beyond that. It is also about what MP Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim mentioned, which is about providing a sense of stability and a sense of belonging to the community amongst everyone. Because owning their flats gives them that addition sense of belonging and makes them feel that they too benefit from Singapore's success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are&nbsp;also constantly improving and rejuvenating the estates in which they live. That also keeps up the value of the flat. It keeps a unique feature of Singapore, which is common space of a very high quality&nbsp;&ndash; where the broad spectrum of Singaporeans, low-income group, all the way to at least upper middle-income group, live in the same estates, enjoy the same facilities, the same parks, the same playgrounds, the same new sports complexes that are coming up under our Remaking Our Heartland programme. High quality common spaces: that, too, is part of an inclusive society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan and&nbsp;Er&nbsp;Lee Bee Wah have also asked about the private housing estates. We are not neglecting them. In fact, MND has set aside $46 million over the next&nbsp;three years to upgrade our private estates&nbsp;&ndash; improving the parks, the <p align=left>Column: 3255</p>playgrounds, footpaths, drains, rain shelters and so on.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third plank is what we do to reward work. Workfare and everything we are doing to help workers keep training and keep upgrading while they are in the workforce.&nbsp; We are putting a lot of resources into it.&nbsp; Many Members of Parliament had suggestions on how we should refine our schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob, Ms Irene Ng, and Mr Lim Biow Chuan suggested various refinements to Workfare &ndash; raising the income ceiling, making permanent some of the changes we introduced in this year's budget, such as some aspects of the Workfare Special Bonus and the Special Employment Credit&nbsp;&ndash; whether we should not make it permanent.&nbsp; We will consider these holistically when we next review Workfare in two years time. But I think we have to bear in mind what Mr Hri Kumar mentioned yesterday, which is that there are real trade-offs involved in all our assistance schemes, including Workfare.&nbsp; We want to provide assistance to the low-income group; and in Workfare, we are topping up their wages. We want to prevent income inequality from widening. But we also want to make sure that we retain a strong incentive and reward for people who upgrade their skills and raise their income so they move out of the Workfare net. And that is&nbsp;a real trade-off that any Government has to face, regardless of how you intervene, whether it is regulated minimum wages or topping up wages through Workfare as we do.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3401-3402.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is a real trade-off between helping people more and, at the same time, making sure that we retain the drive to upgrade, which is the basis of dynamism in our society.&nbsp; When we review Workfare holistically in&nbsp;two years' time, we will have to look at this very carefully &ndash; what is the right balance?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3256</p><p>1.45 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we add up all the planks &ndash; education, Workfare training, housing and assets &ndash; how do they add up?&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bottom 20% of household incomes, we choose a young family because I wanted to trace how much they will be getting over a lifetime.&nbsp; Husband and wife still young, in their late 20s or so. One of them earning $1,000, another one working part time, say, $500, very low income family.&nbsp; They purchase a 3-room HDB flat near their parents.&nbsp; Let us say they have two children, one makes it to polytechnic, one makes it to ITE&nbsp;&ndash; I am not saying that is all they will achieve, but I am using it as an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add up all the benefits that we are providing, including what we have introduced in this year's Budget.&nbsp; Our schemes will enable this family to receive about $490,000 over their lifetime&nbsp;&ndash; or about 60% of their lifetime income.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a small-minded Government when it comes to intervening to help the lower income group. Not small-minded at all.&nbsp; Sixty percent&nbsp;of lifetime income coming from the Government. The difference is how we do it, not how much we do. We are doing a lot but we are doing it a way which ensures that we retain the drive to upgrade, keep improving.&nbsp; The majority of the benefits &ndash; about 60% &ndash; will come in the form of investments to their children's education, their continuous education and training, and in their assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty percent&nbsp;comes in the form of cash and other subsidies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention that the $490,000 figure that I gave excludes discretionary transfers&nbsp;&ndash; the special transfers that&nbsp;we give from time to time which are, in fact, a further part of our subsidy framework. They are quite significant&nbsp;&ndash; if we look at the last 10 years alone, for this type of families, although they are young, they would have received more than $10,000 in the last&nbsp;10 years in discretionary transfers.</p><p align=left>Column: 3257</p><p><br><I>Cost of living and GST</I><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of living issues and, in particular, whether we should reduce the GST. We are all concerned with the rising cost of living, and know that it affects particularly our retirees and those with lower income.<br>Overall, we expect inflation to be 3% to 4% in 2011, although higher in the first half of the year. Sometimes, in public perception, we think that it is much higher than that because we are looking at the items that have gone up faster, for example, coffee, sugar, garlic, and cabbage.&nbsp; However, other items in the food basket have not gone up much or have declined, such as bread and tomatoes. So if you look at the overall food basket for the average household, it costs 2.8% more in January compared to a year ago.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise in health,&nbsp;Members can identify some costs such as certain in-patient bills which have gone up significantly, depending on the type of illness and treatment. But overall healthcare costs have gone up by just 3% in January. Still unsettling, but the increase is not as much as often perceived. We have to look at the entire basket of expenditures of the average household, which is what the CPI is about.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Grow and Share" Package in this year's Budget provides more than what is required for lower- and middle-income households to tide over this temporary period of high inflation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are providing more than required to offset the increases in cost of living for lower- and middle-income households this year.&nbsp; Take for example a retiree household living in a 3-room flat, because that is&nbsp;the type of household that would be most hurt by the rising cost of living. Not working anymore, so they have to rely on their savings and some other forms of support from their children. Their expenses are expected to increase by about $400 for the entire year. They will <p align=left>Column: 3258</p>receive more than six times this amount in transfers in 2011 from the "Grow and Share" package&nbsp;&ndash; $2,750 [<I>Chart 5*</I> ].&nbsp;&nbsp;This holds true for most other types of households, for example, if you look at a larger, lower-income household with two children, they will receive about five times the increase in cost of living this year.&nbsp; Their costs go up by about $650, but they will receive more than $3,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you look at a middle-income household, with three generations, they will receive about 1.8 times more than their cost of living increase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures I have given are excluding the permanent changes that we implemented this year, such as the removal of Radio and TV licence fees, the revision of Public Assistance (PA) rates, enhanced bursaries and so on.&nbsp; I should mention that contrary to Mr Low Thia Khiang's observation that our PA rates have lagged inflation, we have increased Public Assistance (PA) rates by 21% since 2009.&nbsp; For a single-person household, the rate increased from $330 per month to $360 per month in 2009, and again this year from $360 per month to $400 per month.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will invariably be some needy families with unique circumstances for whom the package does not fully cover the increase in cost. Not large in number but there will invariably be some such families. For those who need extra help, we have other schemes to help them.&nbsp; We all know about these schemes, such as ComCare and other local as well as national schemes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as Mdm Halimah Yacob has emphasised, the lasting solution is not these transfers that we are able to provide because we have a good budget this year.&nbsp; The lasting solution is the most important part of Budget 2011, which is to raise incomes and productivity &ndash; in other words grow incomes on a real basis so that <p align=left>Column: 3259</p>purchasing power goes up over the next&nbsp;10 years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang dismissed all that we are doing to help families fully offset the cost of living increases this year. And I have shown&nbsp;Members the chart, it is&nbsp;more than a full offset.&nbsp; More importantly, he had nothing to add on to the longer-term strategies that we had introduced and reinforced through the Budget, strategies to strengthen our economy, raise productivity and incomes; to strengthen our society for the future;&nbsp; develop long-term care for the elderly; substantially enhance bursaries for lower- and middle-income students; and lower income taxes for the middle income.&nbsp;&nbsp;His solution to the rising cost of living was instead to control prices. He did not specify what mechanism would be used to prevent prices of items like food from rising. But he proposed reducing GST by two percentage points from 7% back to 5%, and waiving GST for basic necessities. That is his solution.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain why this is the wrong solution, and would only involve giving more money back to wealthier groups, while taking something away from the poor.&nbsp; First, the bulk of the GST we collect, in fact, comes from higher-income groups and foreigners. It does not come from the lower- and middle-income groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based in fact on our 2010 collections, the bottom 20% of Singaporean households contributes only about 4% of all GST paid. The first 60%, in other words, from the lowest end to the 60th percentile of households, pays about 16% of all GST [<I>Chart 6*</I> ].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the GST is a core part of a fiscal system that provides substantial transfers to our lower-income group, including Workfare, which we introduced together with the GST; including bursaries, healthcare subsidies, housing <p align=left>Column: 3260</p>grants for low-income families; and also including special transfers which we do from time to time to help the lower- and middle-income groups, as we have&nbsp;done this year.&nbsp; So when we add it all up and see what happened with the introduction of the GST&nbsp;&ndash; how much more they have to pay, and what additional benefits they are&nbsp;getting, let us have a look.&nbsp; When we raised the GST from 5% to 7% in July 2007, first, we provided a substantial package of GST offsets to help take care of the higher costs for the low-income group as well as the middle-income group.&nbsp; So for a household in the bottom 20%, the annual increase in GST paid was itself fully made up for by the GST Offset Package. The annual increase in GST paid, $370 per year, but the GST package per year was $910.&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, we introduced permanent programmes to help the lower income group, including Workfare [<I>Chart 7*</I> ].</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you add it all up, this bottom 20% household, if you include both the GST Offset Package and the permanent programmes, would have received five times their increase in GST costs. The GST Offset Package by itself was adequate to offset the increase in GST.&nbsp; But of course, the GST Offset Package is not forever, hence, we have permanent programmes which are far larger than the increase in GST costs for the household.&nbsp; For middle-income households, similar picture, they received roughly five years of full offsets for higher GST costs. Less permanent benefits, but full offset for five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;And for all Singaporeans, the GST was part of the fiscal changes we made to enhance growth &ndash; to invest in capabilities, reduce corporate taxes and encourage investments so that incomes could rise over time. And that is exactly what we have succeeded in doing.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will also be the wrong solution to have different GST rates for different items, such as to have a zero percent rate for basic necessities. I had addressed this <p align=left>Column: 3261</p>fully in 2007.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang had raised it again in 2008 and I had addressed it then too. Let me go over it again. Exempting basic necessities from GST is an extremely inefficient way to help the poor.&nbsp; It sounds good, but it would be counterproductive.&nbsp; Firstly, even for bottom 20% of Singaporean households, the commonly cited eight essential food items&nbsp;&ndash; rice, salt, sugar, edible oil, soya sauce, vegetables, flour and fish, comprise only 6% of their total household expenditures. Including all other uncooked food items, the total is still only about 15% of their total expenditures.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, even when we look at basic necessities, the bulk of the GST comes from the better-off groups. They consume more of everything, not just luxury items, but basic necessities as well. It is therefore much better to collect the GST on essential goods from everyone, and use the resources to support the poor directly.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is much evidence, too, from other countries that a multi-rate GST&nbsp; ends up raising business costs significantly, and we know that this means that the costs are passed on to consumers.&nbsp; In fact, the OECD did a recent comprehensive study including countries with a broad-based and flat-rate GST system and concluded that a broad-based and flat-rate GST system is the best policy choice.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3403-3404; 3405-3406.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Its reasons were exactly the same as ours when we decided to go for a flat rate system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experience of many countries showed that a multi-rate GST system subsidises the consumption of the higher-income groups more, distorts consumption and production, and&nbsp;raises administration and compliance costs for businesses.</p><p align=left>Column: 3262</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exempting or reducing GST on certain goods and services also does not mean that these tax savings will be passed to the consumer. When France reduced the VAT rate on restaurants by 14 percentage points &ndash; a very significant reduction from 19.6% to 5.5% &ndash;&nbsp;in 2009, suppliers absorbed most of the savings and prices hardly fell. And that is a typical story.&nbsp; There is also the legal uncertainty created by multi-rate GST systems. In the United Kingdom, there are endless disputes on the classification of food products. Recently, the Courts had to decide on whether smoothies were beverages or liquid food in order to determine its VAT rate. There are many other examples, by the way.&nbsp; The Courts in Belgium had to decide on whether shops that show pornographic films could be classified as cinemas or cultural venues and, hence, have a lower GST rate. It went all the way to the European Court of Justice before it was, fortunately, settled not in favour of the pornographic shops.&nbsp; That may sound funny but there is&nbsp;a whole set of similar examples that have arisen. There is great legal uncertainty as to what to classify as essential, and what is not.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Switzerland recently had a public consultation, and the result was that most people preferred moving from their multi-rate GST system to a single-rate GST.&nbsp;&nbsp;A major study in November last year in the UK, led by a Nobel Laureate Sir James Mirrlees. The study concluded which that the poor would be much better supported if the government were to remove the lower tiers of VAT on various items that the poor consumed, and instead help the poor more directly instead. Ending these reduced rates would mean more government revenues, which could be completely returned to the bottom 30% via means-tested benefits, with another &#65505;11 billion&nbsp;to spare.&nbsp; So they could completely offset the increased VAT to be paid by the poor by raising means-tested benefits, plus have an extra &#65505;11 billion pounds to spare, which could also be<p align=left>Column: 3263</p>used to help the poor. The Mirrlees study concluded that the UK tax system was "costly and inequitable."<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang's proposals have precisely this drawback&nbsp;&ndash; they would be costly and inequitable. They would mean that the better-off in society pay less taxes, leaving us with less resources to help the lower-income groups.&nbsp; As Mr Christopher de Souza and&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Koo Tsai Kee have also asked, who exactly is Mr Low trying to help when he proposes to cut the GST or exempt some items from GST?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same point applies to the foreign domestic worker levies, which a few Members of Parliament have raised. The bulk of the levies are borne by higher-income households.&nbsp; Removing or lowering it will benefit them more than anyone else. It is not that they are the only ones hiring maids, but the bulk of the levies are borne by the higher-income households. The levy helps to control the growth of the foreign domestic worker population, which is a large population even compared to Hong Kong on a per capita basis.&nbsp; But we provide targeted help where it is needed, particularly for those who care for elderly or young children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Progressive fiscal system that can meet future needs</I><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GST is part and parcel of an overall system of taxes and transfers that is efficient and equitable. The system has three major features.&nbsp; First, the overall tax burden is one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total taxes paid by a Singaporean are on average about two-thirds that paid in the United States. You have to bear in mind that the US has somewhat lower taxes than most European countries. So taxes in Singapore are in fact significantly lower than that paid in most developed countries.&nbsp; Second, the system is pro-  <p align=left>Column: 3264</p> growth. Income taxes are low and the majority of the workforce does not&nbsp;pay income taxes, so that they reward effort, enterprise and the constant urge to move up.&nbsp; Third, the system is fair. Taking all our taxes together with the transfers that we make to the population, the overall system is highly progressive.&nbsp; That means that those who are well-off pay the bulk of the taxes, and the low- and middle-income groups receive the bulk of the benefits.&nbsp; For the lower-income groups, the permanent transfers they receive &ndash; leaving aside special transfers &ndash; significantly exceed the total taxes they pay.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;will take&nbsp;Members through Chart 8*.&nbsp; If we just look at the second decile first.&nbsp; Those between the 10th to 20th percentile of incomes pay GST&nbsp;&ndash; that is a significant component of the total taxes they pay.&nbsp; But the permanent transfers that they receive through Workfare and other schemes are far in excess of the GST they pay.&nbsp; If we add up all the taxes they pay, that is also significantly lower than all the transfers they receive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have shown earlier what happened after we introduced the GST but my earlier chart had to do with the increases after we increased GST in 2007. It shows that the increased GST paid was more than offset by increased benefits. Chart 8, however, looks at the total picture, not just the increases in recent years but what the total picture is if&nbsp;we took a snapshot now.&nbsp; Total benefits received are far in excess of total taxes paid including GST for the lower-income group.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the upper-income group, we choose the eighth decile as an example &ndash; the picture will be even stronger if I choose the topmost decile.&nbsp; They pay much higher taxes than the benefits they receive.&nbsp; They pay more GST than everyone else, they also pay more income taxes, property taxes and other indirect taxes than everyone else. And they receive less benefits.</p><p align=left>Column: 3265</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is a highly progressive system.&nbsp; A fair and efficient fiscal system does not and should not mean that every tax is progressive.&nbsp; It means that taken together, our system of taxes and transfers should provide significantly more benefits for the lower- and middle-income groups. It should do so whilst rewarding work and ensuring income growth across the board remains healthy, in other words, ensuring that we retain a dynamic economy and society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GST on its own is a flat tax, not a progressive tax, but what we have introduced is not just the GST but the "GST plus". In other words, the GST plus Workfare and other schemes to benefit the lower-income groups. Taken together, they make up a highly progressive system.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were able to arrive at this fair and efficient system because of two important changes that we have made in recent years.&nbsp; First as I have mentioned, we increased the GST, from 5% to 7% in 2007.&nbsp;Second, we implemented the new Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework in 2009.&nbsp; We made the constitutional changes in 2008, implemented in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were fortunate that we did this in time, ahead of the financial and economic crisis in 2008 and 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many Members including MP Josephine Teo and others have contrasted our situation now, through the crisis and now, with what has&nbsp;happened with most developed countries. Their public finances are under severe strain.&nbsp; Their people will have to go through wrenching adjustments in the coming decade.&nbsp; Many countries had to borrow and spend heavily just to try and stay afloat during the crisis, and had to cut back on important programmes for their long-term future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We raised the GST when we were not under strain.&nbsp; We did not wait till we were under strain to raise the GST. That <p align=left>Column: 3266</p>allowed us, first, to provide a strong package of offsets to help the lower- and middle-income groups, full offsets, for several years.&nbsp; Second, by doing it in time &ndash; not that we had perfect foresight and knew the crisis was coming &ndash; we were able to intervene forcefully during the crisis to help our businesses and workers and avoided an even larger draw on past reserves. In particular, we did it in time, we were able to address needs during the crisis whilst retaining our focus on the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were unique in being able to cut corporate income tax rate during the crisis to enhance our competitiveness, and&nbsp; make substantial investments for the future, building public infrastructure, rejuvenating our neighbourhoods, implementing sustainable development initiatives, ramping up the quality and capacity of our educational institutions, boosting healthcare provisions.&nbsp; Kept our focus on the long term whilst addressing short-term crisis needs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our second major move was to revise our NIR framework. It is an important part of our revenues, the NIR.&nbsp; Our Net Investment Returns now provide us an income stream of our budget of around 2% of GDP per year&nbsp;&ndash; significant part of our total revenues.&nbsp; Significant contrasts with the developed countries which each now have to spend a growing part of their annual budget just to service their debts. In other words, they have to take away from what they get in tax monies, a growing amount just to service their debts.&nbsp; The UK is spending already 3% of GDP to service their government debts;&nbsp; Japan is spending more than 4% of GDP; and&nbsp;the United States, by the end of this decade, is projected to spend more than 3% of GDP taken out of tax dollars to service their debts.&nbsp; So we are in a very different situation.&nbsp; How do we sustain this revenue stream of about 2% of GDP?&nbsp; To do it, we have to preserve our reserves and ensure that they grow in line with our economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why when we amended the Constitution in 2008, we limited the <p align=left>Column: 3267</p>Government to spending no more than 50% of the long-term expected real returns on the reserves.&nbsp; The remaining returns accrue to the reserves, and we can keep growing our reserves.<br> &nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also why the GIC and Temasek have to keep their focus on the long term. Their objective is to achieve good long-term investment returns, across economic cycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Seh Hong and Mr Liang Eng Hwa have asked how our reserves have performed, having gone through this crisis.&nbsp; Both GIC and Temasek saw significant drops in their portfolio values during the crisis in line with the decline in the markets, and similar to other large funds.&nbsp; They have both recovered their pre-crisis values and have done creditably relative to comparable market indices.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan has asked a very fundamental question which is whether our revenues will be sufficient to meet our increasing expenditure needs in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two major changes that we made to our revenue structure in recent years, raising the GST to 7% and implementing the NIR framework were, in fact, aimed at meeting our growing expenditure needs in the future.&nbsp; They were not to plug a short-term gap in revenues.&nbsp; They were aimed at allowing us to build new capabilities and infrastructure for Singapore's future in education and training, health and long-term care, transport, housing and neighbourhood rejuvenation; and&nbsp;allowing us to intervene decisively to help the lower-income groups through Workfare and other means.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3405-3406.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our expenditures are increasing.&nbsp;Expenditures were around 14.5% of GDP in the last five years from 2006 to 2011 &ndash; that excludes special transfers.&nbsp; In fact, by the last two years, expenditures had <p align=left>Column: 3268</p>increased to about 16% of GDP.&nbsp;&nbsp;And is expected to go up further to about 16.5% of GDP over the next five years, reflecting the major investments that we are making for our future. So from 14.5% over the last&nbsp;five years to 16.5% over the next five years, a significant 2% of GDP increase.&nbsp;As a result of the changes we have already made in our revenue structure, we will be able to fund these projected expenditures over the next five years.&nbsp; Our overall revenues have increased from around 15% of GDP before we made the changes to around 17% of GDP currently. We expect to sustain our revenue at this level over the medium term.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor has asked if we should be spending more on healthcare.&nbsp; Indeed, we expect to invest considerably more in healthcare in the next few years.&nbsp; We are expanding both the acute and step-down care sectors, which Minister Khaw Boon Wan will elaborate on at the COS.&nbsp; We have also provided in this budget a significant top-up to Medifund to ensure that the needy are well taken care of.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor has compared us with some other countries, and at face value, it appears that we are spending significantly less. But the Singapore system is one that is well-recognised, is one that delivers superior healthcare outcomes per dollar spent by tax payers and by patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our national expenditure on healthcare &ndash;&nbsp;that is both Government spending and patients' own spending &ndash; is about 4% of GDP, less than the OECD countries' average of 9%, but we achieve better outcomes than most.&nbsp;&nbsp;On a whole range of indicators&nbsp;&ndash; infant mortality, life expectancy, cancer deaths and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, two-thirds of surgeries in our hospitals are day surgeries, which cut down significantly on expensive hospital stays.&nbsp; And most fundamentally, our 3M framework encourages Singaporeans to take personal responsibility for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; So when you <p align=left>Column: 3269</p>look at it all together, it allows us to limit the use of tax dollars as well as patients' dollars, while achieving superior outcomes. Minister Khaw Boon Wan will be elaborating on this at the COS.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Ah Heng had asked if we should spend more on MHA's budget, and highlighted the need for adequate counter-terrorism resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure Mr Ong that we are providing adequate funding for counter-terrorism efforts. However, MHA's budget is not the only one involved, as MINDEF, Ministry of Transport and MTI, too, have set aside significant resources annually for our counter- terrorism initiatives.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef and Er Lee Bee Wah and&nbsp;Ms Joscelin Yeo have likewise asked about sports and MCYS will be addressing this during the Committee Of Supply (COS).&nbsp; But I just want to add that expenditure on sports &ndash; both from the Government budget and Tote Board &ndash; has in fact increased significantly in recent years, and this is without taking into account the YOG. Beyond our expenditure in sports, the overall MCYS's budget, too, has increased significantly, and I am mentioning this because there is some misperception coming out of one or two charts that were produced in the media, which showed a drop in MCYS's budget this year compared to last year.&nbsp; Our overall MCYS budget has increased significantly over the years. Over the last five years, the budget has increased on average by 13% per year. So the reduction in the budget in Fiscal Year 2011 compared to last year is simply because we are not holding another YOG this year, at least Minister Vivian Balakrishnan has not&nbsp;told us we are.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, GST and income taxes. Mr Low Thia Khiang had asked a question on this.&nbsp; He had noted that GST as a percentage of total tax revenue had increased from Fiscal Year 2005 to Fiscal <p align=left>Column: 3270</p>Year 2011. However, direct taxes, specifically personal income taxes, had not gone down as a share of personal tax revenue.&nbsp; This is no surprise because we have not&nbsp;cut&nbsp;Personal Income Tax&nbsp;rates.&nbsp; We only cut Personal Income Tax rates this year and, in the meantime, income growth has been rapid, so Personal Income Tax collections have naturally increased. No cuts in tax rates but high income growth, so Personal Income Tax collections have increased.&nbsp;&nbsp;What we did cut was Corporate Income Tax rates effective from Year of Assessment 2010 and, indeed, Corporate Income Tax has gone down as a percentage of total tax revenue. So if you add together our direct taxes, our Income Taxes; Corporate and Personal Income Taxes; their share of tax revenues has gone down, from 41.9% in 2005 to 41.5% now [<I>Table 1*</I> ].&nbsp; Strong income growth has helped to bolster them as well.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, if I can now conclude with&nbsp;a&nbsp;point&nbsp;which several Members have emphasised: that the Government cannot build an inclusive society on its own.&nbsp; An inclusive society is about keeping our community spirit alive and about all Singaporeans participating actively in their communities and taking responsibility for each other. That is indeed why a key part of the Government's effort is to put aside resources to support the voluntary sector, our School Advisory Committees, our SPED schools and to foster a culture of philanthropy.&nbsp; An inclusive society is about everyone taking responsibility. It is&nbsp;about the Government partnering with many good people and groups to make this a truly caring society.&nbsp; It is about each of us as individuals taking responsibility to keep improving our own skills and to look after our families as best as we can.&nbsp; Like the resident that Miss Penny Low had cited&nbsp;&ndash; a lady&nbsp;who refused all financial help from her and only wanted help to obtain a licence to sell ice cream so that she could remain independent and look after her family. Or the young man whom Mr Sam <p align=left>Column: 3271</p>Tan got to know, whose mother gave him the courage to live out his dreams. As&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed put it a short while ago, &#19977;&#20998;&#22825;&#27880;&#23450;&#65292;&#19971;&#20998;&#38752;&#25171;&#25340; (in <I>Hokkien</I>)&nbsp;&ndash; translated directly in English: 30% is decided by the heavens, 70% depends on hard work.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this spirit of personal and collective responsibility that will enable us, with our hands, our wits and our hearts, to make this a first-rate developed country.

He said that whilst the total tax package is progressive,&nbsp;not all&nbsp;taxes are progressive.&nbsp; Yes, I think he knows very well that the GST&nbsp;is regressive, that is why we needed the&nbsp;Offset Package.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question is&nbsp;&ndash; and perhaps I would like the Minsiter to clarify&nbsp;&ndash; why did he, first of all, tax a low-income family and then give&nbsp;them the Offset Package?&nbsp; I will not tax them and also give them some help.&nbsp; Does he not agree that the fundamental of tax principles must be whether you really need to tax?&nbsp; Do you really need the revenue from a GST that is&nbsp;2% higher than I proposed?&nbsp; We now have two Integrated Resorts, new streams of income coming in &ndash; betting tax and probably from&nbsp;the increase in tourism visits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like Minister to clarify why is it that the chart shows that the lower income pays about 16% of the total GST tax?&nbsp; But if you look at&nbsp;the different percentiles of people who pay the GST, will it be &ndash;&nbsp;because the tax is wide-based &ndash;&nbsp;that the middle-class, middle- and upper-middle groups are actually paying much more in totality?&nbsp; In view of the higher inflation that we are expecting in <p align=left>Column: 3272</p>the coming year, will it be a serious middle-income squeeze?&nbsp; And they will be adversely affected.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I think some Members want to know who&nbsp;we wish to help.&nbsp; The Workers' Party helps and aims to help &ndash;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Chairman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

[<I>Laughter</I>.]&nbsp; I am not making a speech.&nbsp; Sir, we are a nation-based party, we help the whole spectrum of society and with the focus on workers.&nbsp; Workers, of course,&nbsp;refer to people who are employees.&nbsp; So, whilst we are focused on looking at the lower-income family, we are also looking at the middle-income family as well.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next issue which the Minister for Finance has mentioned &ndash; and to which I agree with him&nbsp;&ndash; is that what is important is whether we can keep raising income for Singaporeans.&nbsp; That is what he said.&nbsp; I wish to clarify with him.&nbsp; He put up a chart to show that from 2000 to 2009, there was a 1.7% increase per year.&nbsp; And the target is to raise income by 30% over the coming decade.&nbsp; I would like to ask him how confident is the Government to raise incomes by 30% over the next decade given&nbsp;the situation&nbsp;in the last decade where&nbsp;we only managed half of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the whole picture change if, let us&nbsp;say, in the charts that were shown to us, we removed 2010's incomes?&nbsp; Would it show a different picture in terms of&nbsp;income growth of Singaporeans in the past 10 years?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Chairman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I am not introducing new questions or new points for debate.&nbsp; In his speech, the Minister also showed that the incomes have grown significantly and especially in 2010.&nbsp; But the Minister for Finance also said that 2010 was an exceptional year.&nbsp; So, my question is whether or not we are going to have more exceptional years to grow the same level of income for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Or would we be derailed, somehow, depending on the global situation, as the Minister also mentioned that we are a global city affected&nbsp;very much by changes in global circumstances?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Sir, I would like to thank Mr Low for his questions, which I will take in turn.&nbsp; First, I think I will have to go over very briefly what I have just explained about how the GST together with GST plus&nbsp;&ndash; Workfare and the other transfers we provide&nbsp;&ndash; amounts to a highly progressive tax system.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low may not have followed everything that was on the chart I showed.&nbsp; Essentially, what I had shown is that first, the GST being a flat tax impacts all in society.&nbsp; Secondly, the wealthier groups pay more of the GST.&nbsp; Third, we use the revenue thereby collected to provide more benefits to the low-income group.&nbsp; This is not limited to the GST Offset Package.&nbsp; The Offset Package is not permanent although it lasts for several years for the lower-income group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real part of GST plus that I am emphasising is not the Offset Package.&nbsp; It is Workfare and the other enhanced permanent schemes to benefit the lower-income group.&nbsp; Sir, I have displayed a chart which showed that the permanent benefits,&nbsp;introduced together with the GST after 2007, themselves&nbsp;exceed the increased GST costs that the low-income group has to pay.&nbsp; And when we add that <p align=left>Column: 3274</p>to the Offset Package, we have a very substantially larger number.&nbsp; As Members can see, the bar comprising the green and the yellow components which consist both permanent and one-off transfers significantly exceed not just the GST but all taxes they pay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the GST plus system.&nbsp; GST alone is a flat tax; it is not a progressive tax.&nbsp; But the GST plus which came with it and motivated it, is a highly progressive system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I really have to emphasise that the more fundamental issue that concerns&nbsp;us in Government when we think through these&nbsp;schemes &ndash; and it&nbsp;has to concern any government &ndash;&nbsp; is that there are trade-offs in everything we want to do.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally, we should be able to reduce taxes on the lower-income group, if possible, also the middle-income group, and perhaps even some of the higher-income group.&nbsp; Foreign domestic maid levies, why not?&nbsp; And still do everything that we are doing&nbsp;&ndash; Workfare, enhance the support for the poor, plus investing in the future.&nbsp; It does not work out that way.&nbsp; The arithmetic is simple.&nbsp; You have to balance your budget.&nbsp; If you are taking out these revenues, you also have to put back less expenditure, and you have to decide what to cut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are doing is having a broad-base type tax system in the GST that thereby allows us to have much lower GST rates than most developed countries.&nbsp; In fact, the US is the only developed country without a consumption tax and most reasonable observers will tell you that it is a matter of a few years, not even a decade by which they are going to have to introduce one.&nbsp; But our GST rate is far lower than the VAT rates that apply across the developed world.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3275</p>Because we kept it simple,&nbsp;flat across the board, collect as much as possible from the upper-income group through the GST and use that revenue to subsidise and help uplift the lower-income group.&nbsp; That is the basic trade-off we have to address, and I would say it is a trade-off not just for the Government to address but for any responsible Opposition to address.&nbsp; That is what First World government and First World opposition has to be&nbsp;about, addressing the real trade-offs in every public policy, including what I was talking about earlier, which Mr Hri Kumar has spoken about yesterday.&nbsp; The real trade-offs that we always face between doing something to reduce inequality and doing something to keep up the drive to upgrade and improve, and raise incomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casino taxes:&nbsp; that has been&nbsp;built into my projections already, that is,&nbsp;built into the 17% of GDP revenue that we feel will comfortably assure us of being able to pursue all the important programmes&nbsp;we want to do over the next five years.&nbsp; It is not as large as some people imagine, and I think Ms Denise Phua's point is a very important one.&nbsp; Besides our core taxes, let us not assume too much for taxes that we get from specific business activities, nothing is secure.&nbsp; Competition, growths and shifts, do not bank on large casino revenues forever and base your fiscal policies on that by making permanent changes that assume the casino revenue will continue to grow rapidly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member asked about the middle-income group.&nbsp; First, I think he has misunderstood the chart I showed.&nbsp; The 16% of GST that is being paid is not from the low-income group.&nbsp; It is from the lower end middle-income group.&nbsp; Sixty percent of our population, the bottom 60% pays 16% of GST.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the chart [<I>indicating</I> ] &ndash;&nbsp;16% is paid by 60%, and the remaining 84% is<p align=left>Column: 3276</p>paid from upper-income groups and foreigners.&nbsp; A remarkably efficient system and a fair one.&nbsp; I recognise Mr Low's desire, particularly at this point in time, to emphasise that he serves a wide spectrum of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I recognise too that the wide spectrum includes, in particular, the wealthy which his proposals would serve even better, as I have explained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not think that was intended.&nbsp; I do not think it was his intention to deliberately favour the wealthy.&nbsp; But this illustrates the forming of policies that do not address trade-offs, that do not address how we have to fund expenditures and that concentrate only on trying to give and give away.&nbsp; I do not think he intended to do this but it illustrates the&nbsp;danger of ignoring trade-offs and ignoring the fact that if you want to do something good, you need some revenue and you have to decide on the most efficient way of raising the revenue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member also asked the question about raising incomes of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I am glad that I get the chance to clarify.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;shown a chart to compare with other countries for 2000 to 2009, what was happening to median households.&nbsp; I must first explain two things.&nbsp; This chart is for the purpose of comparing with other&nbsp;countries.&nbsp; It is looking at all resident households, not just employed households.&nbsp; Therefore, the growth rate of incomes that Members see here, 1.7% per year, is a little lower than what we get for employed households because the chart&nbsp;includes retirees, it&nbsp;includes people who are temporarily not working, so on and so forth.&nbsp; For all countries, Members&nbsp;will find that is the case that when we include all households, the income growth rate is a bit lower because there are many people who are not actually in the income-earning group.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is 1.7%, better than other countries.&nbsp; Secondly, this is only up to 2009.&nbsp; I did not include 2010 because there is no comparable <p align=left>Column: 3277</p>data for the other countries.&nbsp; If you want the 2010 data, look at the Budget speech.&nbsp; It showed a 20% increase in median incomes over that decade from 2000 to 2010, and it will be a challenge to raise our incomes by 30% in the next decade.&nbsp; It is a real challenge.&nbsp; That is why everything&nbsp;that Deputy Prime Minister Teo was talking about yesterday, everything that the MPs were talking about,&nbsp;will&nbsp;not be&nbsp;easy work.&nbsp; It is not going to come easily, whether it is the Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) scheme, or all the other schemes we are doing, starting from young and helping kids discover their strengths.&nbsp; This is going to be hard work and we may not succeed, but we want to give it our best shot and we are putting significant Government resources to support our businesses and our workers to try and achieve this.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, I thank the Minister for Finance for a comprehensive reply.&nbsp; On the issue of GST, he says revenue collected from GST will provide the necessary&nbsp;resources to help the lower-income families, and this is a trade-off.&nbsp; It seems to me that this Government looks at GST as a panacea to everything, as&nbsp;income to help the lower income.&nbsp; Sir, my concern is whether this mindset is a risk,&nbsp;that is,&nbsp;using GST as a way of being able to get the resources to help the lower income, to fund many other projects, even social projects.&nbsp; Will Singapore&nbsp;one day end up to be&nbsp;like Japan&nbsp;&ndash; high costs, high tax, very expensive and then low-income growth?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> I think Mr Low has repeated his question in a slightly different way, not that very differently but slightly different.&nbsp; So, I will try and give the Member an answer in a slightly different way.&nbsp; First of all, the trade-off I was talking about by the way is not a trade-off between taking something from you and giving something back to&nbsp;you.&nbsp; It is a trade-off between taking out a source of revenue that comes <p align=left>Column: 3278</p>from a broad base of people and being able to provide benefits to where you feel it is most important for the low income, for the&nbsp;elderly, for the disabled and for all those whom we feel we have to do more for.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also a trade-off between providing benefits and retaining the urge to improve and succeed, which is at the core of Singapore success.&nbsp; All countries, including those in Europe which are best known for having built up a system of welfarism are now having to address this because of the persistence decline in the work ethic that came about because they gave more and more benefits on an entitlement basis.&nbsp; It is a real trade-off that all governments have to assess.&nbsp; As I mentioned, it is a trade-off which any Opposition has to address.&nbsp; The alternative policy cannot be about giving more and more.&nbsp; It is also has to see where you can to get the money from, and in the Member's case, if he is going to take less money from the rich, he has to explain how he is going to&nbsp;give more to the poor.&nbsp; So, we do not see the GST is a panacea.&nbsp; We see it as part of an efficient and equitable system because it is part of GST plus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, Mr Low did see reducing the GST as a panacea because, as I mentioned, he commented on nothing else in our Budget.&nbsp; All our long-term programmes, the most important ones, like Ms Jessica Tan, Mdm Halimah Yacob, and everyone were talking and making suggestions on &ndash;&nbsp;how we can improve them.&nbsp; Those were not his concerns.&nbsp; His panacea was 7% down to 5%, food bring it down to zero.&nbsp; <I>Voila</I>! [<I>Interruptions</I>].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Japanese, in fact, are now in the middle of a debate.&nbsp; They have 5% GST, but because they have extremely high income taxes and there are many other inefficiencies in their fiscal system, they are now in a fiscal bind.&nbsp; They anticipate having to raise their GST to 15%, some people say even more.&nbsp; Even those who <p align=left>Column: 3279</p>are not fiscal conservatives in Japan are now increasingly recognising this.&nbsp; That is what happens when you do not keep the system as a whole in balance where you retain the drive to excel and to grow incomes and, in the meantime, fund your expenditures by borrowing on future generation's accounts.&nbsp; That is what happens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us not pursue easy giveaways without a means to finance them.&nbsp; First, it is not fiscally possible or sustainable; secondly, more fundamentally, it is the way we decalcify our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 2011 to 31st March, 2012.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> I propose to take the break now.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 3.00 pm.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><I>Sitting accordingly suspended</I></p><p align="right"><I>at 2.41 pm until 3.00 pm</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		<P><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><em>Sitting resumed at 3.00 pm</em><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3279<p><p align="center"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></span></div></P>      					<!--TITLE_NAME:ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 2011 TO 31ST MARCH, 2012--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 2011 TO 31ST MARCH, 2012<BR></B></span><div><BR>								<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Paper Cmd. 1 of 2011--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Paper Cmd. 1 of 2011)<BR></B></span><div><BR>			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [1st Allotted Day].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3279<p><p align="center"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Main and Development Estimates of Expenditure of Singapore for the financial year 1st April 2011 to 31st <p align=left>Column: 3280</p>March 2012, contained in Paper Cmd. 1 of 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For convenience, I shall take the totals for each Head of Expenditure in the Main and Development Estimates as they appear in the last columns of the schedules of estimated expenditure under the Main and Development Estimates Outlays for FY 2011 on pages 6 and 7 respectively of the Command Paper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A total of 411 amendments to the Estimates of Expenditure have been submitted this year.

Many parents are thankful for the Child Development Credit Scheme and the improved funding support for CFAC and KiFAS schemes given in this Budget. The schemes are generous and go a long way to bring down the costs of raising children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But benefits such as these and the Procreation Package given in the previous Budget may not be enough to stop the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) slide. These benefits are helpful to the "converted"&nbsp;&ndash; parents with children or those planning to have children. But we are still a long way from convincing&nbsp;the "unconverted"&nbsp;&ndash; the singles and the married couples without children&nbsp;&ndash; whose numbers are increasing and contributing to the TFR decline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I initially planned to give a speech on creating a more conducive environment until I did&nbsp;an informal straw poll.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;I realised that I would just throw that cut away, and decided&nbsp;to share my findings. I spoke to single women&nbsp;and those married without children in their 20s and early 30s. Most will only&nbsp;think of&nbsp;marriage nearer their 30s or early 30s, and if they decide to bear children, it would be closer to 35&nbsp;&ndash; very similar findings to a survey by an advocacy group, "I Love Children".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I&nbsp;went&nbsp;further and asked, "If I dangled&nbsp;a baby bonus, paid&nbsp;in cash, no strings attached&nbsp;of, say, $50,000 per child, would this change your mind?" Most said "yes" some said "no". Then I realised that the answer depended on their current income. Those who said yes were usually in the lower- and middle-income. Those in the&nbsp;upper-middle income put the tag closer to $100,000 per child.&nbsp; For the "unconverted", most also indicated&nbsp;that more&nbsp;parental leave will not change their minds. This is not scientific, but if&nbsp;we do it methodically, there is <p align=left>Column: 3282</p>something here&nbsp;&ndash; a Singaporean psyche that needs to be understood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had two take-aways from this: first, what the Government needs is a package that is in-your-face, upfront and simple that&nbsp;people can understand and appreciate. Singaporeans value the upfront benefit they can see and feel, before they are convinced to change their position.&nbsp;Second, there is a tipping point&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a price.&nbsp; It is just that the Government has not found it, or is finding the price tough to swallow. Then, we need to ask ourselves, what is a Singaporean baby worth to the nation that depends on people? If we put what we are also spending&nbsp;to attract, manage and integrate foreign immigrants, we may well be able to balance the opportunity cost to the Government on a per head basis.&nbsp; We may&nbsp;well be spending a lot but&nbsp;our schemes are disparate, confusing and have conditions attached. So, people cannot appreciate the amount of Government support for child-raising to weigh against the opportunity cost. For example, it is hard for a working mother to appreciate the&nbsp;tax relief on foreign domestic worker&nbsp;levies for working mothers. But if&nbsp;we give an immediate rebate or a discount on the levy charge, the perception of household cost changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I do recognise that putting too much emphasis on material benefits may well be&nbsp;a hazard.&nbsp;Thus, it is just as important to balance the approach more holistically and perhaps on a steady stream basis. So, we also need a whole-of-Government approach to make Singapore more conducive and affordable to raise children.&nbsp; I think there are&nbsp;probably&nbsp;other issues to address, apart from the material ones.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we have to&nbsp;address the psychological barrier that child-raising is a burden, and anything more than&nbsp;two children is a prison sentence. The tuition arms race and peer pressure also sends the perception that it is expensive and   <p align=left>Column: 3283</p> time-consuming to raise a child.&nbsp; For many young couples, this commitment is a barrier&nbsp;to pursuing their ambition and enjoying their freedom.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, lower the barriers for young couples to home ownership. Keep prices of new flats low, have minimal upfront downpayment and provide sufficient supply so that couples can establish their families earlier.&nbsp; If possible, bring parents into the picture.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly,&nbsp;incentivise employers to create more parent-friendly work environments. Do more for the "unconverted" who need the benefit of time to find the right partner or time to build their family&nbsp;&ndash; credit to Member Paulin Tay Straughan's recommendations. We can still get it right with the next generation.&nbsp; Create a culture of balance amongst our students. Success is not complete&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;going for just grades and a good career. Life is more complete when you&nbsp; have a family to share with&nbsp;&ndash; spouse, children, parents. We have done well with sending the message and buy in for environmentalism on our young.&nbsp; Let us see if we can make procreation sexy, not sex,&nbsp;pardon the pun.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Organisations such as AWARE and "I Love Children" have also put forth recommendations. We should consider their findings, but we should also look&nbsp;at the context of our social norms. Perhaps the Minister can also share with us some&nbsp;factors he thinks that can turn the tide around, and which of our current schemes have shown promise and early success.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Encouraging procreation</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Viswa Sadasivan (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, procreation, or the lack of it, must remain one of the most pressing challenges faced by our country as Singaporeans become more educated and affluent.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3284</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Government has given the matter due attention over the decades, by coming up with a slew of measures, ranging from the creation of the Social Development Unit (SDU) in 1984, to measures to create a "pro-family environment", to even a campaign called "Romancing Singapore".&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, despite these efforts, the Total Fertility Rate&nbsp;(TFR) did not seem to have moved up the scale.&nbsp; In fact, the TFR for 2010 hit an all time low of 1.16, compared to the replacement rate of 2.1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to have hit a stone wall.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;certainly not for want of trying.&nbsp; Yet, the problem is important enough for us to keep trying&nbsp;&ndash; tweaking the measures and introducing new ones until the penny drops.&nbsp; What we do every year counts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Findings from studies, surveys as well as anecdotal evidence seem to point to a lack of time, money and energy and what is seen as an environment that is not supportive enough for the mothers, in particular, as the key inhibiting factors.&nbsp; This is consistent with the findings of an extensive study conducting by MCDS in 2004, where 10,000 persons were polled.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The correlation between early marriage and procreation has been established by several studies.&nbsp; I am happy to note that MCYS is continuing to encourage Singaporeans to marry, and marry early.&nbsp; However, I suspect that these measures may be hindered by what appears to be a larger consideration for young couples contemplating marriage&nbsp;&ndash; the price of HDB flats.&nbsp; As long as these couples perceive the cost of purchasing an HDB flat as being prohibitive, there is a high chance that marriage will be put on hold.&nbsp; Therefore, any serious effort to encourage young couples to tie the knot needs to factor in&nbsp;concerns that the HDB flat, which sadly appears to be a pre-requisite to marriage, is not perceived as beyond their reach.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3285</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Tripartite Committee on Work-Life Strategy should come up with more concrete measures that provide sufficient assurance to young couples contemplating having a child.&nbsp; We have been promoting the concept of working from home for a decade now&nbsp;&ndash; yet this does not seem to have caught on with most Singapore companies, including Government offices.&nbsp; It has to be a mindset issue because, with the sophistication of technology today, there is little reason for employers not to allow young parents who need to work from home to look after their children to do so.&nbsp; After all, for many western MNCs based here, for them, this is an established practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government could consider providing some form of cash incentive for technology investment, to nudge companies towards this end.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third suggestion pertains to giving couples greater leeway in deciding on how they utilise the 16 weeks of paid maternity leave.&nbsp; As an increasing number of women today are holding key appointments in the workplace, couples may want the option of the mother taking the first part of the leave, while the father takes the remaining part to look after the newborn.&nbsp; This will not only give couples the flexibility they increasingly need but also send an important signal to the young working mothers or mothers-to-be which they desire to hear&nbsp;&ndash; that they are not going to have to carry the load all by themselves, and end up losing out in career.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This appears to be borne out by a recent survey conducted by AWARE that involved 1,001 working parents&nbsp;&ndash; where 57% of the respondents said they welcome the option of transferring parenting leave from mother to father.&nbsp; Ninety-one per cent supported the idea of making paternity leave compulsory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3286</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AWARE report also stated that "studies have shown a direct correlation in developed nations between the level of gender equality in a society and its TFR.&nbsp; When women have to bear the bulk of childcare responsibilities, they are less inclined to have children...".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, I urge the Government to give due consideration to AWARE's recommendations: two, in&nbsp;particular &ndash;&nbsp;to&nbsp;make paid paternity leave of&nbsp;two weeks mandatory, with the cost shared between the employer and the state; and, more importantly, to&nbsp;allow one month in the&nbsp;four months of paid maternity leave to be used as "parenting leave" to be taken by either parent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that we are dealing with a very difficult challenge, essentially because it is a very private matter which has to be tackled at a national level.&nbsp; We need to keep trying and tweaking the good measures already in place to ensure we create a "family-friendly environment", provide concrete relief for parents and would-be parents, especially in terms of childcare assistance and financial support.&nbsp; Just as important is to send the right signals to working mothers and married women, in particular, that society appreciates and supports their concern that they should not be carrying the load of having and raising children on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a silver bullet solution to the problem, but I am confident it will make a difference.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Mildred Tan (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Of course, I know the difficulty this poses.&nbsp; How do you test for willingness to integrate?&nbsp; How can we expect anyone new to subscribe to Singapore's values and ideology?&nbsp; How do we know whether a person fits in or sticks out?&nbsp; How do we know when a foreigner becomes a Singaporean?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know that each new citizen has to say the Pledge and that it must mean something to each one of them.&nbsp; But I wonder if there is some way that we can make the willingness to integrate a criteria for selection.&nbsp; Is there a way to ask questions that ought to tell us how this person is likely to fare in Singapore? Has there been any study undertaken to understand the impact of new citizens?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this end, can I ask the Deputy Prime Minister if we could conduct a large-scale longitudinal study on the impact of new citizens in Singapore?&nbsp; Among other things, it would measure effectiveness of our selection criteria for new citizens.&nbsp; What measures have we used to measure the suitability of these new citizens and in what ways have they met our expectations, fallen below or exceeded them and&nbsp;vice versa?&nbsp; Which among our tests were the most suitable in testing for social integration?&nbsp; Three,&nbsp;five or 10 years after they have become Singaporeans, how many do well economically?&nbsp; How many have joined volunteer associations and contributed to our society?&nbsp; How many have had children <p align=left>Column: 3289</p>in Singapore?&nbsp; What difference, in short, have they made to Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know we have used proxies to show the amount that new citizens and foreign talents have added to our GDP.&nbsp; No doubt, they have contributed successfully to our economic growth&nbsp;but the answers that the study that I am proposing can provide are far more detailed and nuanced results.&nbsp; The results of such a study would be&nbsp;far-reaching, it would not only tell us about talent recruitment, but also many things and draw insights into&nbsp;our society as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I end with a small point about making the best use of what we have. &nbsp;The reason we are keen to have more people here is to grow a vibrant economy and to ensure that we have the right capital.&nbsp; The other way to do this is to make better use of the people we already have.&nbsp; We need to make sure that women who have to stay home to look after their children or elderly, retirees and people with disabilities who cannot move about easily can still be economically active.&nbsp; This means ensuring the right institutional arrangements and incentives are in place for these different groups, and it is a matter for the Government, businesses and the unions&nbsp;consider all these.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Wong Kan Seng)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> Mr Chairman,&nbsp;Sir, I thank the hon.

[<I>Copies of handouts* distributed to hon. Members</I>.]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2010, 62% of females aged between 25 and 29 were single, up from 45.5% in year 2000.&nbsp; For&nbsp;males of the same age group, 78.5% were single in 2010, up from 66.4% in 2000.&nbsp; Singlehood rates for those aged 30&nbsp;to 34 have also&nbsp;increased significantly.&nbsp; Some Members suggested&nbsp;that the key to raising our fertility rates lies in reducing our singlehood rates.&nbsp; I totally&nbsp;agree.&nbsp; But getting married is a very personal decision.&nbsp; I know from perception surveys that Singaporean&nbsp;women&nbsp;do want to get married, and they are just waiting to find the right partner, and so&nbsp;are the men.&nbsp; Getting married is a very personal decision.&nbsp; What the Government can do is to facilitate the process by providing opportunities for singles to socialise.&nbsp; This is done&nbsp;through the Social Development Network (SDN) and accredited private dating agencies.&nbsp; Minister Vivian Balakrishnan will elaborate on&nbsp;SDN's programmes when he speaks at the COS&nbsp;debate on his Ministry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy&nbsp;Mohamad and&nbsp;Mr Ong&nbsp;Ah&nbsp;Heng &ndash; in their Budget speeches &ndash; also&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;providing&nbsp;more financial assistance for couples to have children.&nbsp; The Government has&nbsp;indeed invested sizeable resources to support Singaporeans in having children.&nbsp; Since the Marriage and Parenthood (M&amp;P) package <p align=left>Column: 3291</p>was introduced&nbsp;in 2001, the Government has enhanced the&nbsp;package twice &ndash; once in 2004 and again&nbsp;in&nbsp;2008.&nbsp; Members can refer to the handouts I have given regarding&nbsp;the individual support measures that were introduced in 2001, 2004 and 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members can&nbsp;see that with&nbsp;the 2008 enhancements,&nbsp;we now&nbsp;have a broad-based package of support measures, including increased maternity&nbsp;and childcare&nbsp;leave, increased baby bonus cash gift and co-savings, and increased childcare subsidies.&nbsp; We should allow more time to assess the&nbsp;impact of these measures, before considering&nbsp;further adjustments.&nbsp; The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) will consider Mr Zaqy's suggestion&nbsp;on how to present the package more intuitively, so that Singaporeans can&nbsp;understand&nbsp;and appreciate&nbsp;how the various measures&nbsp;apply to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Mr Viswa Sadasivan&nbsp;said that the&nbsp;cost of&nbsp;HDB flats could have deterred couples from getting married.&nbsp; While&nbsp;that may be&nbsp;the reason some give for not getting&nbsp;married, let me assure the&nbsp;House that the Government is committed&nbsp;to keeping&nbsp;new flats affordable through generous subsidies.&nbsp; Minister Mah&nbsp;Bow Tan will&nbsp;say&nbsp;more about this when he speaks at Ministry of National Development's Committee of Supply (COS).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of facilitating&nbsp;work-life practices&nbsp;and work-life balance, Mr Viswa Sadasivan is well aware that there is the&nbsp;Tripartite Committee on&nbsp;Work-Life Strategy which drives the&nbsp;implementation&nbsp;of work-life strategies across industries.&nbsp; Companies can tap&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Work-Life Works!&nbsp;(WoW!) Fund to defray the costs of introducing work-life measures, for example, for purchasing laptops and implementing infrastructure to support <p align=left>Column: 3292</p>telecommuting.&nbsp; Companies are best placed to determine how best to address employees' needs, to attract and retain their talent.&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong will say more about work-life&nbsp;balance during his COS debate on MOM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard&nbsp;to parental leave, the Government introduced paid childcare leave in 2004 to support both fathers and mothers in their parenting duties.&nbsp; In 2008, we extended paid&nbsp;childcare leave to six days for each parent&nbsp;until the child turns&nbsp;seven.&nbsp; We have also introduced six days of unpaid infant-care leave a year until the child turns two.&nbsp; That is a total of 42 days paid leave and 12 days of unpaid leave per parent.&nbsp; In 2009,&nbsp;a year after the introduction of&nbsp; the&nbsp;2008&nbsp;M&amp;P package, 30% of fathers took more than three days of paid childcare leave, as compared to 46%&nbsp;of mothers.&nbsp; The Ministry of Manpower&rsquo;s survey also shows that 48% of companies voluntarily provide paternity leave in 2010 on top of the legislated childcare leave.&nbsp; For&nbsp; now, I think we have done enough to&nbsp;encourage shared parental responsibility&nbsp;through childcare&nbsp;leave.&nbsp; Married couples should decide between themselves how to share their parenting responsibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy&nbsp;Mohamad suggested that there could be&nbsp;a tipping point in subsidies beyond which Singaporeans will change their minds about having&nbsp; babies.&nbsp; But marriage and&nbsp;parenthood cannot just be&nbsp;about tangible costs and benefits.&nbsp; I hope married couples would&nbsp; not just take&nbsp;a transactional&nbsp;approach in deciding&nbsp;whether to have&nbsp;children.&nbsp; While having children means having to make&nbsp;sacrifices&nbsp;in&nbsp;the short term, there&nbsp;is immeasurable joy to see them grow up and be good citizens.&nbsp; There needs to be a mindset change&nbsp;among&nbsp; our population if we were to tackle the issue of low TFR.&nbsp; Or, as Mr Zaqy Mohamad said, Singaporeans need to overcome these psychological barriers to get&nbsp;married&nbsp;and have children. What the Government can and will do is to <p align=left>Column: 3293</p>ensure&nbsp;that Singapore is a good place&nbsp;to raise children.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Government will also&nbsp;provide&nbsp;some funding&nbsp; support to help them&nbsp;do this, as we have done.&nbsp; But couples must bear some responsibilities for being parents too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Mildred Tan asked whether we could&nbsp;make "willingness to integrate" part of our selection criteria for new immigrants, and whether we would consider implementing a citizenship test.&nbsp; We need foreign&nbsp;manpower to augment our local workforce so&nbsp;that we can&nbsp;remain globally&nbsp;competitive.&nbsp; But&nbsp;not all foreigners who come here to work are&nbsp;allowed to sink roots.&nbsp; We allow only those of good&nbsp;quality&nbsp;and&nbsp;who share&nbsp;our core values to become&nbsp;PRs or&nbsp;citizens.&nbsp; We take into account not just factors, such as the applicant's economic contributions, qualifications and age, but also whether he can integrate well into our society, and his commitment to sinking&nbsp;roots.&nbsp; In general, Permanent Residents and Singapore Citizens&nbsp;applicants would also&nbsp;have to be&nbsp;in Singapore for some&nbsp;time before&nbsp;their applications&nbsp;may&nbsp;be approved, and this allows us to further assess their level of integration.&nbsp; We also consider the profile&nbsp;of the family if they are included in the application.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another group of foreigners that we allow to settle in&nbsp;Singapore as PRs and citizens are&nbsp;those with family&nbsp;ties to&nbsp;Singaporeans.&nbsp; These are mostly foreign spouses.&nbsp; A key consideration is whether the local&nbsp;sponsor has&nbsp;the ability to look after the family, so that allowing the foreign family members to reside in Singapore does not result in increased burden to society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is&nbsp;difficult to assess&nbsp;an immigrant's&nbsp;willingness to integrate as this goes into his state of mind.&nbsp; Instead, we should make a holistic assessment of the immigrant's&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to integrate through objective factors such&nbsp;as the<p align=left>Column: 3294</p>applicant's age, length&nbsp;of stay, family ties, and whether he has studied in Singapore, and so on and so forth.&nbsp; Integration takes time and cannot be rushed. We must take&nbsp;a pragmatic and realistic approach.&nbsp; If&nbsp; there are practicable suggestions that can help us to achieve the&nbsp;objective of integrating new immigrants with locals, please let me know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of citizenship test, this has been considered by the National&nbsp; Integration Council (NIC).&nbsp; Members felt that&nbsp;a test may not accurately assess or ensure the long-term commitment of new citizens.&nbsp; Instead, members felt that a more structured naturalisation process would be more effective&nbsp;in ensuring that all new&nbsp;citizens understand the fundamentals of Singapore society and our values.&nbsp; Hence, to enhance the integration of new citizens into our community, we have begun&nbsp;putting them through the Singapore Citizenship Journey.&nbsp; New citizens are required to complete the journey before they&nbsp;can complete&nbsp;the citizenship formalities.&nbsp; This programme&nbsp;seeks to enrich new&nbsp;citizens&rsquo; understanding&nbsp;of Singapore's&nbsp; history, nationhood, norms and values.&nbsp; It&nbsp;also provides platforms&nbsp;for new citizens to be involved in our local community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Mildred Tan also suggested doing a longitudinal study on&nbsp;the impact of new&nbsp;citizens on Singapore.&nbsp; I am told that there is a periodic study on the perception of integration and rootedness of Singaporeans and PRs.&nbsp; A study is now ongoing too.&nbsp; But we must be careful not to create too&nbsp;much&nbsp;of a distinction between new citizens and old citizens, lest we get into a debate on who is more Singaporean.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3409-3412.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The French had such a debate almost two years ago, and I&nbsp;do not think they ended up feeling better or happier.&nbsp; It created divisions within the society as a result of that debate.&nbsp; Under our laws, whether a person is a new citizen or old citizen, he receives equal treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3295</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, NPTD takes a Whole-of-Government approach&nbsp;and&nbsp;we assure Mr Zaqy Mohamad that in tackling the population issues,&nbsp;it&nbsp;will continually refine its policies and strategies to ensure a sustainable population&nbsp;&ndash; one that supports our economic aspirations and underpins a cohesive Singapore.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chairman:</B> Mdm Halimah.

Otherwise, we will lose capable officers and suffer an overall decline in the quality of the Civil Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June last year, the Civil Service raised starting salaries for the Management Executive and professional schemes. We also made significant revisions to Legal Service salaries, especially for the younger officers, to ensure that we retain good officers despite a hot market for lawyers.&nbsp; We are also restoring the cuts to annual increments made during the downturn.&nbsp; Overall, the annual salaries of civil servants this year, ie, in 2011, will return to the pre-downturn level in 2008.&nbsp; Variable salary components which fell during the recession have increased in tandem with the strong economic recovery.&nbsp; An Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 1.5 months (plus a $300 one-off payment) was paid to all civil servants.&nbsp; As announced last year, a Special Variable Payment (SVP) of 1 to 1.6 months will also be paid in March 2011, to those with good performance.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By design, the annual remuneration of senior officers contains a significant <p align=left>Column: 3300</p>variable portion dependent on the officer&rsquo;s performance and that of the economy.&nbsp; The more senior officers, including Ministers, have more variable annual salary packages.&nbsp; The main salary component for senior officers that varies with economic growth is the GDP Bonus. GDP Bonus is zero if GDP growth is 2% or below, but accounts for a maximum of one-quarter of the annual salary of senior officers, or eight months, when the GDP growth exceeds 10%.&nbsp; This links the annual salary automatically to GDP growth which makes it more responsive to actual market rises and falls than having the salary relatively fixed.&nbsp; Hence, during the downturn in 2009 and 2010, no GDP Bonus was paid.&nbsp; This contributed to a 18% to 22.5% reduction in annual salaries of senior officers for the two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, in 2011, based on the exceptionally high 2010 GDP growth, officers will get the maximum rate of GDP Bonus. Nevertheless, I should emphasise that their total annual salaries,<br>including all the variable components, remain within the market benchmarks, and that was the way the salary structure was designed.&nbsp; Annual salaries of senior officers have therefore moved down for two years and up again, in line with our policy of keeping pace with, but not leading the market.&nbsp; For 2011, we expect GDP growth to be lower than 2010, hence, in all likelihood, GDP Bonus paid next year will be lower, too.&nbsp; These are year-to-year fluctuations, and not permanent pay increases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supplementary Estimates that Mr Low Thia Khiang referred to on Monday are, therefore, a reflection of the way that our variable salary system is designed to function, falling and rising in line with the GDP.&nbsp; All this was fully explained and debated in this House when the Government last made major salary revisions in 2007, and there has been no change to the system since then.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 3301</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, Mr Low Thia Khiang took part in the debate and he said:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;While we accept that basic salary may be benchmarked broadly with the private sector in line with international best practice, we believe that performance pay should also be introduced to establish a visible correlation between performance and pay.&nbsp; Currently, the Civil Service has no financial bottom line in ensuring good outcomes, although part of the senior officers&rsquo; salary is linked to GDP growth. "&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Mr Low Thia Khiang said:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"... while it is necessary to link a percentage of salary to performance, it is also imperative to provide a performance regime whereby it is possible to discriminate performance for non- performers or under-performers, and to reward them accordingly".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And, Sir, in this respect,&nbsp;Mr Low added, "I welcome the adjustments in Ci vil Service pay structure just announced by the Minister.&rdquo;&nbsp; That means, by me.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Sir, we can see that Mr Low accepted two key principles&nbsp;&ndash; benchmarking to the private sector and&nbsp;variable performance-linked pay.&nbsp; These are two key important principles and although we had discussions of which models to follow and what KPIs to follow, I think that we appreciate Mr Low&rsquo;s acceptance that benchmarking to the market and variable pay is, in fact, the way to go.&nbsp; So Mr Low should not be surprised that the Civil Service pay, with significant variable components, has moved up this year in line with the economy, as we moved down in the last two years in line with the economy significantly.&nbsp; In fact, Mr Low welcomed such a variable pay structure for the Civil Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to other aspects of the Civil Service that the Members have brought up.&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan asked<p align=left>Column: 3302</p>about diversity in the Public Service. &nbsp;We value diversity in views and experience, and welcome mid-career officers who have worked in the private or people sectors.&nbsp; This group has grown from 49% of newly-appointed officers in 2008 to 54% in 2010.&nbsp; These were the new officers coming in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also introduced internship programmes for junior college (JC), polytechnic and undergraduate students. We would, of course, be delighted if they eventually join the Service, but if not, at least they have gotten a first-hand experience of public sector work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked about public sector productivity. Our public sector has been consistently well rated internationally. But notwithstanding this, the Public Service is making a concerted effort to improve productivity by enhancing organisational efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strategy is summarised as 3Cs: Customer-centric, Connected and Creative government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customer-centric government is about understanding our customers better and taking their perspectives into account in designing policies, regulations and services.&nbsp; Our agencies should also operate in a more connected manner, so that our customers can benefit from an integrated approach to policies and services.Our agencies also need to be more creative, by allowing new ideas to surface and experimenting with them quickly.&nbsp; These 3Cs are underpinned by a culture that embraces change and continuous improvement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All our public agencies have come on board the 3Cs strategy last year.&nbsp; The Permanent Secretaries and Heads of Agencies will be personally responsible for driving the 3Cs in their respective organisations.&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance and <p align=left>Column: 3303</p>the Public Service Division will also coordinate central efforts to drive inter-agency collaboration for our productivity push.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also asked about re-employment of older workers.&nbsp; The Public Service recognises that older workers form an important part of its workforce.&nbsp; Over the last&nbsp;two years, 2009 to 2010, 1,400 officers or&nbsp;eight in 10 retiring officers have been offered re-employment and 83% accepted.&nbsp; Of those who accepted,&nbsp;four in 10 were re-employed at last drawn pay while the remaining had their wage adjusted to reflect the value of the jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Employment Assistance Payment (EAP) was paid as these guidelines were only finalised early this year.&nbsp; Our approach is to focus on getting officers re-employed so that the payment of EAP would be minimised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One important emphasis is to engage officers at least six months before their retirement so that they have ample time to make their decisions.&nbsp; We have various ways of helping&nbsp;retiring officers. One is that&nbsp;the Public Service Division (PSD) launched a special module in the careers portal, Careers@Gov, for officers to deposit their resumes, search for job opportunities and apply for Public Service jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the small number of officers who cannot find a suitable public sector job, the Public Service will help them with job search skills, training and networking opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Straughan had various suggestions, very interesting ones, on work-life balance.&nbsp; I would be very happy to take up her suggestion and get PSD to get in touch with her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3304</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Public Service officers work very hard, and often long hours so that Singaporeans&nbsp;can enjoy good service and Singapore&nbsp;can grow and progress.&nbsp; We do try to take care of their well-being.&nbsp; We have implemented work-life and family-friendly measures for many years&nbsp;such as childcare leave and staggered working hours.&nbsp; Other work-life measures include flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, no-pay leave and part-time work.&nbsp; We also offer marriage, maternity, paternity and childcare leave to enable officers to spend time with their family.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we cannot be rigid in applying these measures.&nbsp; Each agency has its own needs and requires flexibility in implementing measures that best suit them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Public Service Division has adopted a Blue Sky policy for PSD itself, where on Fridays, officers are encouraged to leave the office by 6.00 pm&nbsp;while the sky is still blue,&nbsp;while&nbsp;there is still sunlight.&nbsp; But we are careful not to make such a scheme mandatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some officers may prefer to finish their work so they have less to worry about before heading out for a big weekend, starting late on Friday night.&nbsp; But for those who prefer to leave by 6.00 pm, they can do so without guilt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, I do share Assoc. Prof. Straughan's point that we can do more to create a more work-life friendly culture in the Service and we will do more to do so.&nbsp; PSD will help agencies better implement the measures that we have&nbsp;and educate supervisors and officers on the range of flexible work arrangements that we have available.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> Sir, ably led by Minister Lim Boon Heng,&nbsp;the national Wellness Programme aims&nbsp;to promote active ageing.&nbsp; Excellent toolkits such as this [<I>indicating</I>] were developed to encourage seniors take part in health screenings and physical exercises such as<p align=left>Column: 3305</p><I>tai-chi,</I> line dancing and even belly-dancing.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to add more meaning to ageing, I propose that the Active Ageing Framework formally includes the components of work and contribution into the current physical, mental and social dimensions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are seniors who wish to and can afford to work less, at their own pace and their own time.&nbsp; I ask for a Jobs-for-Seniors Clearing House&nbsp;to be&nbsp;set up to help identify, assess and place seniors in part-time work suitable for elderly beyond the usual blanket-sewing, handicraft type of work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on ageing more meaningfully, Sir, more popular programmes such as Youths for Causes and Young Change-Makers support young people to contribute to people or causes beyond themselves.&nbsp; Similar programmes such as a Seniors for Causes or Senior Change-Makers should also be funded throughout Singapore so that ageing Singaporeans can make&nbsp;greater impact&nbsp;on other people, beyond themselves and their families.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us fund People's Association more&nbsp;to help all our senior Singaporeans to finish well in life.&nbsp; Do not let them&nbsp;just count their days.&nbsp; Let us help to make their days count.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Supporting seniors</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Minister has certainly put in much thought and funds for the care of senior citizens in this year's Budget.&nbsp; Many senior citizens are already living longer lives with advancement in healthcare.&nbsp; But as they live longer, it is important that they must also enjoy some quality in their lifestyle and&nbsp;enjoy mobility.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would approach the cut with the elderly and residents' perspective and wishes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3306</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Medical.&nbsp; Although, I would not have enough savings in my Medisave but I have MediShield&nbsp;&ndash; money no worry, if I am hospitalised.&nbsp; But outpatient medicine is taken everyday.&nbsp; Lucky, children are good and I have got some savings&nbsp;&ndash; can still pay.&nbsp; But high inflation, medicine must be kept low.&nbsp; If not, got to ask for more money from children and take from savings.&nbsp; Hope Government could look into the cost of medicine for chronic diseases for the elderly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessibility to medical care.&nbsp; I have high blood pressure, diabetic and my eye is not good.&nbsp; I need to go to the polyclinic and also to the National Eye Centre for check-up regularly.&nbsp; Hope the Government provide more comprehensive and integrated medical care at the polyclinic for the elderly.&nbsp; Go to doctor.&nbsp; Children busy &ndash; say must take leave&nbsp;&ndash; limited leave days only.&nbsp; How about Government granting leave to take care of an&nbsp;old lady?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social.

We need to improve the affordability of eldercare centres to the elderly.&nbsp; I urge the Government to review and simplify the means-test system which presently is based on the gross income of all the children of the elderly. The use of monthly per capita family income does not reflect the amount of money available to meet the needs of the elderly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This issue is compounded by the unwillingness of family members to disclose their incomes, especially in estranged families.&nbsp; In such instances, the elderly usually suffer as they would rather withdraw from eldercare than be the cause of family discord.&nbsp; The limit of means test subsidies&nbsp;is also currently unrealistically low with the eligibility set at $360 per capita family income for the 75% subsidy. &nbsp;This should be increased.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I would urge the Government to increase subsidies and rebates for<p align=left>Column: 3308</p>caregivers of the elderly tied to the median income.&nbsp; They need the support, particularly the singles.

In the past, with more children in the family, they can share the responsibility among siblings.&nbsp; With one or&nbsp;more children in a typical family today, and a substantial number of our women in the workforce, each child bears a much heavier responsibility.&nbsp; It is even more difficult for working adults with young children to care for elderly or sickly parents at the same time.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, the Government committed to set up 200 more childcare centres by 2015.&nbsp; The Budget this year has also provided enhanced subsidies to help parents with their childcare fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, I hope that with these provisions, there will be more babies in Singapore, and the falling fertility rate would reverse.&nbsp; We should be optimistic.&nbsp; On the other hand, what we know for certain is that the number and proportion of senior citizens in Singapore will increase steadily in the coming years.&nbsp; While we are placing significant resources in caring for the young ones, and the Finance Minister just mentioned a 150% increase in spending for childcare, can we also allocate more resources to help with elderly care?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bringing up a child, while it can be stressful, is very rewarding when we see our child growing up and becoming more independent.&nbsp; However, caring for the elderly is the reverse, when we see our loved ones becoming weaker and more dependent over the years.&nbsp; It is physically, emotionally and financially draining.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, there is a pressing need for us to speed up the set up of more step-down medical facilities, short-term care, day-care and hourly-care centres, especially in<p align=left>Column: 3310</p>all our housing estates.&nbsp; Such facilities and services will allow Singaporeans in their productive years to focus on their work as they can leave their parents in good hands.&nbsp; Not only will the elderly have people to look after them, they will also be in a familiar environment.&nbsp; I think it is also very important that we make a bigger effort to reduce our reliance on&nbsp;foreign domestic workers to take care of our elderly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to propose subsidies for the use of such services and facilities, just like for childcare.&nbsp; There should be a basic subsidy for all parents, and tiered additional help, similar to the system we have for childcare subsidies.&nbsp; Households with lower incomes or working adults should benefit from higher subsidies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to share with the House some information about the Queenstown Multi-Service Centre in my constituency which has a substantial elderly population.&nbsp; Set up in 1998, it is currently supported by Queenstown CCC and Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society.&nbsp; The centre offers both rehabilitative and day-care services.&nbsp;&nbsp;A two-way transport service is provided daily for the elderly to and from the Centre.&nbsp; Rehabilitative treatments are performed for the elderly with acute health problems, such as stroke, paralysis, fracture and neurological defects.&nbsp; Without these treatments, their problems may become chronic, and the elderly might become weaker and eventually bed-ridden and would require institutional care.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day-care services are provided for the frail elderly whose family members are out for work during the day.&nbsp; The elderly enjoy the social interactions and recreational activities which meet their psychological needs.&nbsp; Sing-alongs, individual or group exercises and games, calligraphy, gardening, tea appreciation and, yes, even <I>mahjong</I>, keep the elderly active and mentally alert.&nbsp; Every month, there are birthday parties and one or two outings. Both ambulant <p align=left>Column: 3311</p>and wheelchair-bound elderly get a chance to enjoy themselves during these outings.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 40% of the elderly at this Centre can only afford subsidised fees.&nbsp; The community groups will continue to raise funds to charge affordable fees and also offer more subsidies.&nbsp; But there is so much more we can do.&nbsp; Based on means testing, some do not qualify for subsidy as these families are not exactly low-income.&nbsp; But some of the elderly and their children do not want to commit to a monthly expenditure of a few hundred dollars and, hence, the elderly end up staying at home.&nbsp; We need more centres and the Government can do more to&nbsp;make them more affordable and offer more subsidies to cater to the changing needs of our population, and&nbsp;prevent longer-term consequences and challenges of&nbsp;an ageing population.&nbsp; I look forward to the Minister's update on the progress we have made in this area and new plans for the&nbsp;future.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Family caregivers</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, as a country faced with an ageing population and rising rate of chronic illness, our healthcare delivery mode focuses on patients to give them holistic care and help the sick enjoy a high-quality of life and rightly so.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must also not forget the caregivers.&nbsp; Very often, a family caregiver's welfare is neglected, not just by the society but the caregiver as well.&nbsp; In our Asian society, family members, particularly the women, are expected to assume a caregiving role when a family member becomes ill.&nbsp; The role is often thrusted upon an individual without little prior warning and not much is done to equip them with the know-how or lifeskill to become an effective caregiver.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left>Column: 3312</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, caregivers undertake not only financial sacrifice by giving up their jobs but personal psychological sacrifice as well. Caregiving encompasses a wide range of responsibilities including providing physical care, financial support to social, emotional and spiritual support.&nbsp; The stress of caregiving can also take a personal toll on the caregiver, and caregivers have been known to suffer depression or worse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the support the VWOs, like the Asian Women Welfare Association Centre for Caregivers, provided for caregivers.&nbsp; I believe if the caregivers are well supported, care recipients will receive the best care and attention as well.&nbsp; So, more should be done by the Government to support family caregivers and address their needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be more funding to roll out caregiver-focused psychosocial programmes for the family caregivers.&nbsp; Caregivers also need more assistance from agencies, especially in the area of their other family needs.&nbsp; The Government, at the same time, together with the other employers, can also play an important role by being more understanding and giving caregiver's leave to support the caregivers.&nbsp; The Government should set an example with&nbsp;caregiver-friendly HR policies so that the private sector will be compelled to follow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we must look at how we can integrate the Government agencies' support together with that provided by the private sector companies, non-profit organisations and all the&nbsp;VWOs to address the increasing pressing needs of the family caregiver in our society.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen (Joo Chiat)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Twenty years down the road, the number will be much higher.&nbsp; It is really a big time bomb waiting to explode, and I want to say my heart especially goes out to those caregivers who care for patients who have got mental problems.&nbsp; If&nbsp;a patient is sick, you nurse&nbsp;the person and he is able to appreciate your efforts.&nbsp; But if there is something wrong with the mind, let us say that the person is suffering from dementia or&nbsp;in a coma,&nbsp;this situation can last a very long time.&nbsp; Over time, the poor fellow does not even recognise the caregiver.&nbsp; The caregiver is a loved one,&nbsp;who loves&nbsp;the person but is not loved by the person and not even recognised by the person.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we&nbsp;add up all these things, it is really an impossible problem to cope with on the part of the caregiver.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, the emphasis is on caregiver training.&nbsp; We have been focusing on training them to be caregivers.&nbsp; I hope that in the next few years, more emphasis will be given to the care and support for the caregivers&nbsp;&ndash; how to offer them emotional support, how to give them counselling support, how to organise programmes to give them some relief from the daily chore of giving care so that at least they may have, say, two or&nbsp;three hours a day to go and do their own things.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to say that this problem of the caregivers, unfortunately, falls in the<p align=left>Column: 3314</p>crack between&nbsp;two Ministries.&nbsp; It starts because somebody gets sick.&nbsp; In that sense, it is initiated from the&nbsp;Ministry of Health's portfolio.&nbsp; Then, as the pressures mount, it becomes an MCYS problem with regard to the caregivers.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;it falls within the crack between&nbsp;two big Ministries, my concern always is that the two Ministries are exercising courtesy&nbsp;and&nbsp;think that the other Ministry may solve the problem.&nbsp; Therefore, I want to propose that the Prime Minister's Office organise a taskforce comprising these two&nbsp;Ministries and other bodies&nbsp;to see how we can have a long-term plan to support our caregivers, 20 to 30 years down the road.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Indeed, it is already bleak, so to speak.&nbsp; This problem will also be compounded by younger family members leaving our shores for employment opportunities or to settle down elsewhere.&nbsp; To address this concern while there is still time or a window of opportunity, may I ask the Government to come up with a financial scheme to provide incentives for informal caregivers, especially from the community, to care for the elderly in the neighbourhood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I acknowledge that the incentives can be in kind as&nbsp;a form of recognition or appreciation, however, monetary incentive is very much preferred.&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme, together with a comprehensive caregiving training, can be packaged so that it can attract and sustain the informal caregivers on&nbsp;a long-term basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I further suggest, as I had done in my speech on the Budget&nbsp;yesterday, that this allowance be credited into their respective CPF accounts?&nbsp; This will benefit them in their old age and supplement their own precious CPF savings.&nbsp;

According to MOM's Employment Report 2010, many companies allow other leaves such as compassionate, marriage and paternity leave. However, only 11% of companies allow their employees to take leave to look after their sick parents. Fortunately, this percentage is doubled that of 2008,&nbsp;and this is a rising trend. Most employees have to use their annual leave to take their parents to see the doctor. If their parents are sickly and have to go to hospital often, their annual leave may not be enough.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our population is ageing and the proportion of elderly people is increasing fast. The family structure in Singapore has also undergone major changes. Families used to have&nbsp;three to&nbsp;four children so the children can take turns to look after the parents and share the responsibilities. Now the&nbsp;family size is smaller, with one or two children, and so, fewer siblings can share the duty of caring for the parents.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I suggest the Government consider changing the current six-day childcare leave to family leave, so that employees can use it flexibly. Besides caring for children under seven, he can also use it to look after elderly parents, grandparents and parents-in-law above 70 years old. This will help the employee to achieve work-life balance. To prevent employees from abusing this benefit, the employer can ask the employee to show proof, such as receipts from clinics or hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employers may be concerned with the rising labour cost because of this flexible leave arrangement. However, I believe the benefits outweigh the cost increase. If he <p align=left>Column: 3318</p>achieves work-life balance, he will be happier at work. Thus, his work efficiency will increase. Attrition rate will also drop.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3419-3420.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

So, who will take care of the aged parents with limited mobility?&nbsp; Currently, for those who can afford it, they purchase help through the form of&nbsp;a foreign domestic worker.&nbsp;But for those who cannot, they have to rely on personal leave when they are needed to assist aged parents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, it is the low-income worker who suffers more as they are in jobs with less benefits and more rigid reporting schedules. &nbsp;I appeal to the Government to legislate the provision of parental care leave to facilitate responsible caregiving and empower Singaporeans to embrace filial piety. &nbsp;To minimise cost to the State, I suggest that this leave can form part of the existing six days of unrecorded leave for childcare.&nbsp;

That is, to bring down the cost of current services so as to render them more affordable to users, especially in the light of a growing elderly population.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree that it is very important to develop a system of elderly infrastructure, services and products that is affordable to the average household and to the broad middle.&nbsp; But for this to happen, I think it is equally important to invest in capability and capacity; otherwise, we will be using today's capacity, today's infrastructure, today's strengths and weaknesses in our services and products to address tomorrow's growing needs, and that would be unwise and unsustainable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I am of the view that the use of the $1 billion fund should be judiciously apportioned&nbsp;between grants and subsidies on the one hand and capacity and capability investments on the other to cater to our growing elderly population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to ask, besides innovating assistive technologies, which was the example mentioned by the Finance Minister in his Budget Statement, whether the Silver Trust fund would also be used to develop manpower &ndash; how to better&nbsp;attract, develop and retain good people to serve in this sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help the elderly age-in-place, home care services demand would also grow.&nbsp;

It is timely to check how we are preparing for this situation. Are we on track to achieving successful ageing?&nbsp; Ageing is wide ranging.&nbsp; It is and must be the responsibility of every Ministry to consider how it will handle aspects of ageing in its respective portfolio, regardless of whether its purview is in the social, economic or security arena.&nbsp; Some of the questions that have been raised by Members will not be answered by me but by respective Ministries in the Ministries' Committee of Supply (COS).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, because it is wide-ranging, ageing has to be coordinated across Government.&nbsp; I have chaired the Ministerial Committee on Ageing since 2007.&nbsp; We have pursued four strategic thrusts to achieve successful ageing for Singapore and for Singaporeans &ndash; financial security, active ageing, holistic and affordable healthcare and eldercare, and ageing-in-place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spectre of an ageing population looms for many developed countries, characterised by fiscally unsustainable welfare systems and runaway healthcare costs.&nbsp; A <I>Bloomberg</I> article in January this year warns of potential inter-generational conflict in Western Europe, fuelled by perceptions that today&rsquo;s older generation is impoverishing the next.&nbsp; In the article entitled "Baby Boomers Must Pay for Own<p align=left>Column: 3321</p>Elderly Care" published on 17th February in <I>TODAY</I>, Mr Norman Warner, a former UK Health Minister, argues that it is unfair to expect the working population to foot the bill for looking after their parents' generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will we be different?&nbsp; We must be.&nbsp; For if not, then our young may also rebel, one generation after the European youth.&nbsp; Hence, learning what not to do, we must ensure fiscal sustainability in all we do.&nbsp; Each generation must earn and save with the entire life cycle in mind.&nbsp; While children should support their aged parents, we should take care not to impose too heavy a burden on them.&nbsp; Several Members have alluded to the demographic shifts, like Mr Baey Yam Keng.&nbsp; Indeed, our Singaporean way, which reflects our Asian values, goes further.&nbsp; If a generation is fortunate enough to enjoy prosperity as has been the case with the current old and baby boomers, we set aside reserves for the next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I have laid down our fundamental fiscal principle in ageing, let me outline the progress we have made in each strategic thrust.&nbsp; We have enhanced financial adequacy in old age through CPF LIFE and the HDB Lease Buy-Back scheme.&nbsp; But, for most of us, financial adequacy must depend on us continuing to work.&nbsp; Mr Carlos Slim, a leading Mexican businessman, pointed out in an interview with the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> that today&rsquo;s retirement age is still based on life expectancy 50 years ago!&nbsp; In the 1960s, our life expectancy was only 65 years old.&nbsp; Today, it is 82 years old, one of the highest in the world.&nbsp; Our life expectancy is similar to Japan but already ahead of many developed countries like United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.&nbsp; We may also have more centenarians as has happened in Japan.&nbsp; How can we expect to retire and fund another 20 to 30 years solely based on past savings?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3322</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Slim goes on to highlight that "in a society based on physical work, you had to retire young. Today, we are a knowledge-based society, and people are retiring when they are in their best mental state&nbsp;&ndash; most experienced, most trained." Singapore has transformed itself to become a knowledge and service economy.&nbsp; Mr Slim's observations apply to us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.27 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I share Ms Denise Phua's views that we need to help our seniors work longer for as long as they can, and at the pace they want.&nbsp; Re-employment will take effect from 2012.&nbsp; Older people need not necessarily be re-employed in the same job, on the same pay or at the same pace.&nbsp; For older people who need jobs, the CDCs provide employment services for job seekers and seniors could use these services as a job clearing house, including looking for part-time jobs.&nbsp; I think it is not necessary to incur more administrative costs by setting up a separate&nbsp;infrastructure for this purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Ministry of Manpower's survey showed that 92% of employees reaching 62 in June 2009 were allowed to continue to work.&nbsp; The 2010 Labour Force Survey found that the employment rate for those aged 55 to 64 had risen to 59% in 2010, up significantly from 54% in 2006, notwithstanding the recent downturn.&nbsp; We must strive to achieve our target of 65%.&nbsp; More will be said on this in the COS debate on the Ministry of Manpower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua and Mdm Cynthia Phua have commented on our second strategic thrust, which is Active Ageing. Since its inception in 2007, the Council<p align=left>Column: 3323</p>for Third Age (C3A) has promoted active ageing with an emphasis on lifelong learning and an inter-generational approach.&nbsp; C3A has disbursed more than $9 million of the GO! Fund to over 90 community projects, benefitting some 400,000 seniors. &nbsp;Indeed, in response to Ms Denise Phua, volunteerism and nurturing programmes for seniors to be able to contribute back to society is one of the areas of focus of the GO! Fund.&nbsp; This year, C3A will implement the $20 million Active Ageing Capability Fund to further develop sector capability in active ageing.&nbsp; The people that the Member knows, can apply for this fund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complementing C3A is the Wellness Programme.&nbsp; In 2008, we asked People&rsquo;s Association (PA) to pilot the Wellness Programme in 12 constituencies.&nbsp; In 2010, we rolled it out to 42 constituencies which covers half of Singapore. I am heartened at how far the Wellness Programme has enhanced neighbourliness among seniors.&nbsp; In a pre- and post-test study done over a 12-month period, over 40% of seniors made more than 10 new friends in the community while 36% got to know more than 10 neighbours.&nbsp;&nbsp;An ageing society needs such social capital.&nbsp; Neighbours can mutually support one another and be of great help in an emergency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me share the story of 59-year-old Mdm Chew Kwi Yang from Radin Mas.&nbsp; She used to keep largely to herself.&nbsp; After joining the Wellness Programme, she started a herb garden and formed an interest group.&nbsp; In late 2009, Mdm Chew checked herself into the hospital as she was not feeling well.&nbsp; She did not inform anybody, including her family.&nbsp; When the other seniors did not see her at her usual activities, they got worried and contacted her family.&nbsp; It was only then that Mdm Chew&rsquo;s family discovered that she was in<p align=left>Column: 3324</p>hospital.&nbsp; This is why the Wellness Programme is important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wellness Programme also encourages seniors to be responsible for their own health.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nineteen thousand&nbsp;seniors have gone for health screening.&nbsp; Many are starting to exercise more regularly, which is necessary for maintaining good health, and keeping socially active.&nbsp; Mr Heng Chee How will update us on the achievements of the Seniors for Physical Activity Committee later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Mdm Cynthia Phua &ndash; she has&nbsp;a&nbsp;list of what seniors want &ndash;&nbsp;I agree that the Wellness Programme should be in the residents' neighbourhood and not in a centre&nbsp;far away.&nbsp; The Wellness Programme, in case there is some misunderstanding,&nbsp;should be implemented at the Residents' Committee (RC) level.&nbsp; Every RC should have a Wellness Programme.&nbsp; This will make it convenient for seniors to participate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me turn to the third strategic thrust on holistic and affordable healthcare and eldercare.&nbsp; At least&nbsp;eight MPs, including NMPs&nbsp;&ndash; Mr Baey Yam Keng, Mr Chan Soo Sen, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Ms Irene Ng, Miss Penny Low, Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan, Mr Laurence Wee and Ms Audrey Wong &ndash; have expressed their views.&nbsp; Let me explain what we have done by covering four key aspects: information, referral and case management, care services, caregiver support; and funding of long-term care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have made some improvements in the information and referral service for seniors and families.&nbsp; The Centre for Enabled Living (CEL) and the Agency for Integrated Care&nbsp;(AIC) were set up in 2008 under MCYS and MOH respectively to fulfil these roles.&nbsp; CEL is a first-stop information and referral centre for persons needing care.&nbsp; AIC helps patients prepare for discharge from acute<p align=left>Column: 3325</p>care and will refer them to stepdown or home-care services, where necessary.&nbsp; The two agencies work closely together and they are located side-by-side.&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Chan Soo Sen&rsquo;s worry of something going awry &ndash;&nbsp;that problem&nbsp;is recognised and is being addressed.&nbsp; There is cross-representation of board members&nbsp;of the two agencies.&nbsp; Last year, CEL implemented a case management service for seniors known as the Assessment and Coordination for Enabling (ACE).&nbsp; More than 200 seniors have benefited.&nbsp; One example is Mr Quek Poey Khiang and his wife, Mdm Goh, both in their 70s.&nbsp; Mdm Goh has epilepsy, dementia, hypertension and osteoarthritis of her knees.&nbsp; Following her hospitalisation in 2010, the ACE manager referred home-help services to Mdm Goh while encouraging Mr Quek in his caregiver role.&nbsp; After&nbsp;six months, Mr Quek and Mdm Goh were discharged from ACE successfully.&nbsp; They can now cope with their daily routine.&nbsp; They have been introduced to a Seniors Activity Centre (SAC) and visit it every week to enjoy the activities there.&nbsp; If Members know of cases where&nbsp;they do not know where to turn to, refer them to CEL who will then&nbsp;do the necessary and get&nbsp;them on the right path.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me discuss the progress we are making in home and community eldercare.&nbsp; In 2009, I announced that MCYS will build&nbsp;six new day care centres over&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; I am happy to say that two new centres have been completed.&nbsp; MCYS and MOH have also worked jointly on a pilot with three day care centres to make them dementia-friendly.&nbsp; In addition, AIC has piloted day centres for seniors who are nursing-home eligible.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS and MOH are also enhancing at-home support through Home Help, Home Medical and Home Nursing services.&nbsp; CEL has worked with Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society on a Rent-a-Care Helper pilot.&nbsp; The VWO hires care workers <p align=left>Column: 3326</p>and&nbsp;deploys them to low-income seniors who cannot afford to have foreign domestic workers but need regular home help support.&nbsp; The pilot started in October 2010.&nbsp; As of 31st December 2010, there are seven care workers serving some 50 clients.&nbsp; So, it is a development that we are watching to see whether it can be scaled up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me turn to caregiver support on which several Members have spoken on, including Mr Baey Yam Keng and Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan.&nbsp; Almost all have asked for leave for eldercare.&nbsp; While the concept is popular, it is a complex issue.&nbsp; Employers will have concerns about costs.&nbsp; I asked one employer, "If&nbsp;you can grant childcare leave, why don't you agree to grant eldercare leave?"&nbsp; The response was, "A child grows up after so many years.&nbsp; We don't know how long the elderly person will continue to live."&nbsp; So, it reflects the calculations in the minds of employers which we should not take lightly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should take the same approach as we have done with the retirement age.&nbsp; We&nbsp; need to engage in dialogue and consultation, and not rush matters.&nbsp; At the same time, employees and their unions can negotiate with employers for such leave.&nbsp; Some employers already do so.&nbsp; When more employers grant such leave, then reaching a national consensus will be easier because, by then, the worries of employers about the costs would ease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Families today can enjoy tax relief of up $11,000 as well as a foreign domestic worker levy concession if they look after their elderly parents.&nbsp; Mr Laurence Wee and Miss Penny Low have asked for more financial support, in particular, caregiver allowances to acknowledge the stress and sacrifices made by family caregivers.&nbsp; While this is tempting, we must ask ourselves if we will unwittingly monetise family obligations and love if we give caregiver allowances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3327</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of caregiver allowances, we have focused on caregiver training and support programmes.&nbsp; CEL has given seed funding to NTUC Eldercare and Touch Community Services to pilot the training of family caregivers and foreign domestic workers.&nbsp; Families and maids who go for such training can qualify for the Caregiver Training Grant.&nbsp; More than 1,600 caregivers for seniors have benefited from this grant.&nbsp; About half of them were family caregivers, and the remainder were maids.&nbsp; CEL is also raising awareness that day care centres do offer respite care, and there is also growing availability of home-help services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should uphold the virtue of filial piety.&nbsp; Our current older generation has sacrificed and worked hard to provide the younger generation with better education and skills.&nbsp; We must look after our parents, emotionally and financially.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why we must preserve the principle of means-testing, which is based on family income.&nbsp; I agree with Ms Irene Ng that affordability of care services is important. We have adopted the approach of means-testing to ensure that the lower income and less fortunate will receive help.&nbsp; This will help low-income seniors to access&nbsp;help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, a small minority shirk their responsibilities to support their parents.&nbsp; We have amended the Maintenance of Parents Act last year to enable the Tribunal and Commissioner for Maintenance of Parents&nbsp;to better help such parents obtain support from their children.&nbsp; With respect to the case cited by Ms Irene Ng, I would suggest that this be referred to the relevant CDC for holistic case management because listening to her, there are some help programmes which may or may not have been accessed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3328</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made good progress in piloting eldercare services and caregiver support services with VWOs.&nbsp; So, the $1 billion Community Silver Trust is a very timely and opportune initiative. The Trust underscores Government's commitment to build capability in the intermediate and long-term care sector.&nbsp; It also signals the vital role that the community can play.&nbsp; We hope the community will respond generously to the dollar-for-dollar matching.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully share Mr Heng Chee How's apprehension that some think that the $1 billion should be used to subsidise long-term care, in the mistaken belief that this will make for cheaper care.&nbsp; I must caution we will use up the $1 billion Trust very quickly if we use it for broad-based non-means-tested subsidies.&nbsp; This is not sustainable.&nbsp; Such subsidies also reduce the financial discipline of the service providers.&nbsp; They can become less, and not more, cost-conscious.&nbsp; Costs therefore could go up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the Community Silver Trust is put to good use to deliver long-term care services, it should focus on the following key areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, it should enable VWOs to widen the range, scale and quality of intermediate and long-term care services across the socio-healthcare continuum.&nbsp; If VWOs can expand to reach a critical mass, we can improve quality while containing costs, and here in the light of the productivity drive that we are trying to make, it applies also to this sector.&nbsp; I think today the costs are high because we are not efficient.&nbsp; If VWOs can also innovate, use technology and re-engineer processes to increase productivity, they can further contain costs.&nbsp; These are sustainable ways to make long-term care cost affordable, as opposed to asking for more subsidies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3329</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, as Mr Heng has rightly pointed out, manpower development is another key area as, ultimately, the quality of any care service depends on the calibre of the staff.&nbsp; VWOs need to invest in their staff.&nbsp; Unless they are adequately remunerated, we are not going to get the quality of staff needed for this sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, it is important for VWOs to build up organisational capability to attract quality management that can develop and implement viable service models that make VWOs mission-effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take this approach, I am confident that we will make good use of the $1 billion under the Community Silver Trust, and MCYS and MOH are working out the details. I expect the Trust to be implemented later this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, MOF has announced that the Government will allocate $10 million a year for low-income seniors to obtain mobility aids such as wheelchairs and the like, something that Miss Penny Low was asking for. &nbsp;I will leave MOH to share the details of this grant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to our final thrust to enable ageing-in-place. We are on track on the hardware side in terms of barrier-free accessibility and&nbsp;the lift upgrading programme.&nbsp; As important is the software.&nbsp; What we are doing to expand at-home and community care will help seniors age-in-place successfully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a vulnerable group of poor seniors with weak family support who face the risk of social isolation.&nbsp; Senior Activity Centres (SACs) serve as a first-touch point where these seniors can receive social support, participate in activities and meet other seniors. &nbsp;MCYS is developing SACs into community&nbsp;nodes that support vulnerable seniors and will expand SACs from the 28 today to 55 in five years.&nbsp; Nine were built in the past two years. We are also taking steps to support seniors within the community&nbsp;&ndash; seniors<p align=left>Column: 3330</p>who might otherwise be institutionalised.&nbsp; MCYS, CEL and NTUC Eldercare will embark on a communal housing pilot for poor single and frail seniors.&nbsp; The seniors provide mutual support and help one another.&nbsp; NTUC Eldercare will hire a caretaker on their behalf to keep a lookout for them.&nbsp; The caretaker will work with the nearby SAC to coordinate services the seniors might require.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the poor and the vulnerable, MCYS is piloting integrated services for seniors in studio apartments.&nbsp; A seniors service centre at the Golden Jasmine Studio Apartments in Bishan has been successfully tendered out to China Healthcare.&nbsp; The centre provides health talks, games, physiotherapy and houses a Traditional Chinese Medicine clinic.&nbsp; Residents are also supported by staff who will respond to emergency calls made by residents.&nbsp; MCYS has called for similar tenders at three studio apartment sites.&nbsp; The response from the commercial sector has been positive.&nbsp; We anticipate that the look, feel and shape of these centres will end up being slightly different.&nbsp; But certain features&nbsp;&ndash; a space to mix, mingle and make friends, plus free referral and information services&nbsp;&ndash; will be common.&nbsp; This will help to strengthen the community of neighbours in the block even as they age within the wider precinct.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now speak on two major new initiatives under the Ministerial Committee for Ageing.&nbsp; They are the City for All Ages Project and the Marine Parade Pilot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is the City for All Ages Project.&nbsp; It marks the next major milestone in preparing our society for ageing.&nbsp; It builds upon and pulls together our efforts and achievements over the last few years, especially with regard to ageing in place.&nbsp; It also takes cognisance of the World Health Organization's statement that population ageing and urbanisation are the two global trends that will shape the 21st <p align=left>Column: 3331</p>century.&nbsp; Major cities of the developed world already have more seniors while, in Asia, the elderly comprise some 10% to 15% of the population in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong.&nbsp; It is over 20% in Tokyo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The City for All Ages Project aims for sustainable and affordable urban solutions for ageing.&nbsp; It will address three challenges&nbsp;&ndash; the first of which is a "liveable" built environment for seniors.&nbsp; Let me explain what we mean by "liveability".&nbsp; It goes beyond being barrier-free.&nbsp; It goes beyond universal design.&nbsp; "Liveability" takes into account the socio-psychological needs of older people, including the need for familiarity, sense of place, sense of safety and convenience.&nbsp; Let me illustrate one aspect of "liveability" which is to be pedestrian-friendly.&nbsp; In Copenhagen, architects and urban planners have progressively pedestrianised the city centre since 1962.&nbsp; Since the introduction of these measures, public life in the city centre has increased by four times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second challenge that the City for All Ages will address is how to help seniors age actively and age in place.&nbsp; We will pay special attention to the spaces for social interaction as well as community-based eldercare services and facilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third challenge that the City for All Ages will address is the integration of the hardware and the software, especially with regard to eldercare services. This includes the business models needed to support ageing-in-place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have four key limbs to the City for All Ages Project.&nbsp; The first is to promote Policy-Practitioner Academic research and collaboration.&nbsp; The second is to plan for social spaces that older people need so that they can thrive in a "liveable" environment. We will also enhance the planning and design of community-based<p align=left>Column: 3332</p>care services to better integrate with the built environment.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we will encourage the commercialisation and adoption of age-friendly products and solutions. Together with EDB, HDB and MOH, we will develop a Silver Community Test Bed Programme&nbsp;to test solutions.&nbsp;Let me cite the case of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's Able Studio to illustrate why commercialisation works.&nbsp; Able Studio is a one-stop solutions store for people who need assistance in activities of daily living.&nbsp; Able Studio had two earlier predecessors.&nbsp; The first at Alexandra Hospital was largely a showroom with no commercial element. Even though it showcased good ideas, not many people visited it. The second at Jurong Medical Centre was still largely a showroom but with a small retail component. It fared better.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Able Studio at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital is largely a retail space with a small showroom.&nbsp; It has a lot more visitors.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because Singaporeans are a pragmatic lot&nbsp;&ndash; we want solutions we can buy and use immediately.&nbsp; Building&nbsp;on what we have learnt from Able Studio, MCYS, C3A and the relevant agencies are working on a "functional home" idea&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;one that looks at how to bring commercial elder-friendly home retrofitting solutions to seniors and their families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth limb of this project is to promote Singapore as a global centre of excellence on ageing. This serves to build up human capital in Singapore and place us&nbsp;thought leaders on urban solutions for ageing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The City for All Ages project will be a multi-agency effort undertaken by MCYS, MND, HDB, URA, Centre for Liveable Cities, EDB and SPRING.&nbsp;&nbsp;A project office for this purpose will&nbsp; be created.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn to the&nbsp;next one, which is the Marine Parade Pilot. Senior Minister Goh<p align=left>Column: 3333</p>Chok Tong announced the multi-agency pilot at Marine Parade last December.&nbsp; The Marine Parade Pilot is a project for ageing-in-place at the town level under the City for All Ages Project.&nbsp; It will study the hardware, software and planning strategies needed to better serve the needs of an ageing community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marine Parade estate was chosen as the pilot site because more than 20% of its total population are already 65 and above today.&nbsp; This Pilot is important because it will help all&nbsp;policy makers design cost-effective measures to improve the quality of life and well-being of seniors, and to extend such measures, if successful, to other towns in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilot will be conducted in phases.&nbsp; Phase&nbsp;One consists of a bottom-up evaluation of the needs and interaction between older residents, their caregivers and service providers in the estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation will be conducted through a Needs Assessment Survey, Ground Audits and Focus Group Discussions. The Pilot is currently in its first phase.&nbsp;While the pilot is primarily targeted at seniors and their families, residents will also benefit from a more vibrant, active and inclusive community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are making good progress to meet the needs of our ageing population. If we succeed with the City for All Ages Project and learn from the Marine Parade Pilot, Singapore will be a home that all of us want to grow old in. We can look forward to a happy, healthy and active ageing.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Heng Chee How:</B> Sir, the Minister had earlier given an update on the Wellness Programme and Ms Denise Phua had also spoken about the Wellness Programme.&nbsp; I would like to give the House an update on the work of the&nbsp;Committee for Seniors for Physical Activity&nbsp;(SPA) to encourage&nbsp;physical activity which I chair.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3334</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Committee has thus&nbsp;far launched three mass&nbsp;platforms to encourage active participation in exercise amongst the seniors, and these are&nbsp;briskwalking, <I>taichi</I> and <I>qigong</I>.&nbsp;We&nbsp;chose these&nbsp;exercises for three main reasons.&nbsp; Firstly, because of their&nbsp;mass local appeal, many people are already doing so and, therefore,&nbsp;we know that there is a local interest in it, and it is easier to promote.&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;there is good scientific basis for choosing them.&nbsp; They have merits in terms of promoting strength or flexibility, cardiovascular, fitness as well as balance. And, thirdly, because they offer low&nbsp;barriers to entry. Briskwalking, for example, does not need expensive equipment.&nbsp; Similarly, learning <I>taichi</I> and <I>qigong</I> is not expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For <I>qigong</I> and <I>taichi</I>, professional trainers have broken down the complex exercise routines into more easily understandable and&nbsp;digestible doses. For example, the Singapore Wushu Federation, which is a partner on this Committee, developed a set of <I>taichi</I> called "Tai Chi for All" which is a simplified 13-step sequence as opposed to the typical 100-odd step <I>taichi</I> sequence.&nbsp; So it makes it a lot more accessible.&nbsp; These exercises are also&nbsp;"social" in nature because if neighbours and friends come together to do it, it is more fun and you can keep it up longer.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;peer support is being tapped upon as a critical impetus to bring seniors together to&nbsp;exercise regularly and to sustain that exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also used&nbsp;high point events in the People's Association (PA), for example, the&nbsp;One Community Walk, to encourage participation. Over 85,000 participants took part in briskwalking at 75 locations island-wide in 2010.&nbsp; We increased outreach capability by leveraging on the PA's grassroots network. PA is also catalysing the formation of interest groups at the RC level.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially with respect to <I>taichi</I> and <I>qigong.&nbsp;</I> Because for briskwalking, when groups are formed,<p align=left>Column: 3335</p>they can do other social activities together.&nbsp; Whereas for <I>taichi</I> and <I>qigong</I>, having learnt&nbsp;your steps, you do need to go the extra mile of having groups formed, otherwise it may just fizzle out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also focused on capability building. We built up a pool of trainers. For example, the Qigong Shi Ba Shi Association trained 170 instructors so that they, in turn, may train other leaders in the community. And the Health Promotion Board&nbsp;(HPB) trained 851 lay leaders to instruct in proper&nbsp;briskwalking for maximum fitness. We equipped&nbsp;green spaces with additional supporting amenities.&nbsp; For example, HPB and NParks have worked together and introduced&nbsp;10 briskwalking trails across&nbsp;the CDCs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to take this opportunity therefore to acknowledge the hard work put in by all our partner agencies and also the grassroots organisations. To date,&nbsp;some 500 briskwalking clubs have been formed, and together they have about&nbsp;90,000 briskwalkers.&nbsp; Close to 2,000 participants, for example,&nbsp;joined in a mass display during the <I>taichi</I> launch. For <I>qigong</I>, as of January this year,&nbsp;there&nbsp;is a total of 86 <I>qigong</I> clubs with 7,000 members. So&nbsp;we can see that the platforms are indeed able to reach out to the broad base of our population and are growing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventy-four-year-old Mr Goh Chin Yong exemplifies what our Committee&nbsp;sets out to achieve. At every check-up, the doctor would praise him for being in excellent health. He has been participating in the North West Health <I>Qigong</I> Clubs at Sembawang Zone "E" Residents' Committee for the past five years. Mr Goh reveals that he has made many friends and introduced many other friends through this regular exercise of <I>qigong</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the next phase, we are going to move beyond community platforms and <p align=left>Column: 3336</p>also work on workplace platforms.&nbsp;The reason for that is because more and more of us are going to work for a longer span of time, and we are spending a significant amount of our waking hours at work as well. Therefore, if we can complement the efforts in the community with efforts at the workplace, then we could achieve even more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The second National Tripartite Committee on Workplace Health has published their recommendations in November 2010.&nbsp; These are&nbsp;therefore being implemented by the respective agencies.

So we have not gone through the rest of&nbsp; Singapore but only to half of the constituencies because of the resources that are&nbsp;needed and to make sure that the people who are employed to run these Wellness Programmes can do it well, rather than have a mass recruitment with improperly trained people and then do a job that is not so satisfactory.&nbsp; But we will try to&nbsp;do it as fast as we can.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> I would like to ask the Minister three questions if I may.&nbsp; First, is on eldercare leave and parental care leave.&nbsp; Sir, I understand the concerns of employers about the business costs, but there is also a social cost to be paid in not providing for this eldercare leave or family-care leave.&nbsp; Given our ageing population and the increasing demands at work, can I ask the Minister whether the Government is itself convinced of the need to provide for such leave given the changing demographics?&nbsp; And if it is, then should the Government not&nbsp;take the lead in providing it rather than wait for the private sector employers to have negotiations with the unions on this matter?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is on the means-test.&nbsp; Is the Minister aware that MOH's restructured hospitals have&nbsp;quite a simplified criteria for means-testing and it does not include the gross income of all family members of the elderly?&nbsp; So&nbsp;we have an anomaly where if I am an elderly and I go to an acute and restructured hospital for care, and then when&nbsp;I am transferred for&nbsp;long-term care to an eldercare centre, I have to do means-testing twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would qualify for the one in&nbsp;hospital but I may not qualify for the one in&nbsp;day-care.

That is the point of my speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my suggestion is we should allow&nbsp;employees and unions to negotiate with their employers for such leave. &nbsp;I am aware that some employers already grant such leave.&nbsp; It is a process of forging a national consensus. In the case of the retirement age, the Government did not simply legislate because it is desirable. If you recall, in the past, we actually went through a long period of time before legislation on the retirement age was enacted and this was after some work on the ground before it was finally done.&nbsp;Now, I think&nbsp;people recognise the need to raise the retirement age but, even so, to raise it every year&nbsp;is a process that requires concensus-building.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, I think that for elder care leave, it is an item that falls into the same category.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the means test and the different criteria adopted by MOH and MCYS, it is a goal we are working towards.&nbsp; In fact, this is something which is occupying the minds of the staff at the present moment &ndash; how to reconcile the two different systems.

So, if we make better use of the existing facilities, a lot more things can be done.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;would like to relate that I visited Helsinki last October.&nbsp; I went to one community that&nbsp;is in part of Helsinki where&nbsp;there is an active ageing association.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;six apartment blocks and a number of seniors living there. This is not a retirement village; it was built in the 1960s and people grew old together and so you have a significant number of seniors. They do not have a RC centre, they do not have any financing from the government, but they organise themselves into an association and they use their own living rooms for the different activities which they carry out. <p align=left>Column: 3341</p>So, let us think out of the box.&nbsp; We do not always need&nbsp;to use the RC centres.

That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year saw a distinct change in the world economy.&nbsp; Certainly, at home, Singapore has excelled with a 14.5% growth and generally across the region, economies have recovered from the financial crisis of 2008.&nbsp; Unfortunately, tensions and fighting in parts of Asia have caused serious concern.&nbsp; Most recently, the fighting that erupted between Thailand and Cambodia over the disputed Preah Vihear temple.&nbsp; The ceasefire that was negotiated and agreed on by the two countries with help from ASEAN neighbours was a cause for celebration.&nbsp; But this incident demonstrates that even two countries that are partners in the ASEAN community can take up arms against each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to that, there was severe armed conflict between North and South Korea that began with the sinking of a South Korean vessel, the Cheonan, killing some 46 sailors.&nbsp; This was followed by the artillery barrage on the South Korean Yeonpyeong Island which killed&nbsp;two South Korean soldiers and wounded various others. &nbsp;The North Koreans are unrelenting and continue to pursue their nuclear weapons programme.&nbsp; The conflict was so severe that some speculated that this could result in a second war between the north and south.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This increase in armed conflict in the region has put the spotlight on Asia and, in particular, the tension between the United States and China.&nbsp;&nbsp; In January this year, President Hu Jintao made an official visit to the United States and was received by President Obama.&nbsp; The visit appeared to be positive, with signals from both sides showing that there could be a fresh start to Sino-US relations.&nbsp; It was also the first time that China had expressed concern over North Korea's continued pursuit of its nuclear weapons <p align=left>Column: 3347</p>programme.&nbsp; What is clearly lacking, however, is the discourse between the militaries of the two countries.&nbsp; This shows that while the political leadership seems to have some intention of refreshing relations, the wills and intentions of both militaries&nbsp;are quite different.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relations between the United States and Japan have also experienced some bumps in recent times.&nbsp; Tensions reached a high over the call for a relocation of the United States' military base in Okinawa.&nbsp; In January this year, the United States' Defense Secretary, Mr Robert Gates, spoke to students of Keio University during his visit to Japan.&nbsp; Secretary Gates said that a strong military alliance between the United States and Japan was important to deter North Korea and prevent China from behaving "more assertively" toward its neighbours.&nbsp; In answer to a question from a student about the possible weakening of China's civilian control over its military, Mr Gates said that over the past several years, there have been some signs of "disconnect" between the military and civilian leadership in China.&nbsp; He cited examples of military incidents that apparently took place without the knowledge of&nbsp;Chinese civilian leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional security architecture is growing more complex. &nbsp;The recent and rapid rise of China as a military power has made the presence of the United States even more pressing.&nbsp;

The aim was to become a leaner and more potent fighting force that would use technology as leverage to deal with threats.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our 3rd Generation SAF, the power of technology is not only that we have it; the power lies in the networked capabilities of its machines, thereby giving the SAF more speed, precision and mobility. To this end, there was a concerted effort to network and connect each different component part so as to enable all parts to work as a whole. This would include making use of electronic and computer technology and the requisite training to achieve an Integrated Knowledge-Based Command and Control System.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the transformation to a 3rd Generation SAF, we invested in a range of advanced hardware and technology. Notwithstanding the increase in the hardware and technology, however, the backbone of the SAF must continue to be its people. Singapore faces a declining birth rate. The measures that have thus far been employed to raise our Total Fertility Rate do not appear to have had a significant effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have one of the lowest birth rates in the world and, as a result, an ageing population. This must necessarily have an effect on every sector of our workforce. Manpower will become more scarce. The average age of the worker will rise. We have already raised our retirement age to cater for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF will not be immune to the effects of a low birth rate and the ageing workforce. It has, and will continue to <p align=left>Column: 3357</p>have, to take steps to cater for this phenomenon. In the last two years, retirement ages have been increased in the SAF and a new scheme known as the Military Domain Experts Scheme&nbsp;(MDES) allows officers with special skills such as Engineers to convert to MDES officers and retire much later. Our ageing population will become a serious challenge to maintaining a proficient fighting force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of this, may I ask the Minister the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Could the Minister please provide an update on the SAF's transformation to a 3rd Generation fighting force?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) What steps is the SAF taking to guard against the low birth rate and ageing population in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Will an ageing population result in a compromise to the SAF's operational readiness?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) How can we continue to attract, develop and retain the right people for the 3rd Generation SAF?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v) Will the SAF look to keeping its top talent and capable soldiers on for longer before retiring them?<br></p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee:</B> Sir, on the question of a 3rd Generation SAF, I would like to ask the Minister how&nbsp;have the SAF's new acquisitions been integrated with its current capabilities.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past few years, whether on land,&nbsp;on the sea or in the air, the SAF has made numerous acquisitions towards its arsenal of weapons and capabilities from additional submarines, new fleet of fighter jets to new armour acquisitions such as the Panther tanks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also initiated many enhancements to drive our SAF towards a 3rd Generation SAF.&nbsp; In the same vein, I <p align=left>Column: 3358</p>believe we have also acquired other new and state-of-the-art hardware to stay ahead and to ensure that we have a world-class SAF and viable defence capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the numerous acquisitions by the tri-service, I wish to ask the Minister how these newly procured equipment, weaponry and systems are being integrated with the SAF&rsquo;s existing capabilities and how far have we assimilated our soldiers and formations with these new acquisitions.<br></p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min, please take your two cuts together.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>New and enhanced career schemes</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Chairman, MINDEF introduced the new Military Domain Experts Scheme (MDES) in 2009 which has taken effect since 1st April 2010.&nbsp; For a start, the scheme for officers and warrant officers is tailored for engineers and specialists in military intelligence.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister for an update on the new and enhanced career schemes and whether it has achieved its desired objectives?&nbsp; I would also like to ask if the scheme will be extended to other non-combat vocations in the Singapore Armed Forces.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>People development</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The human resource is a single most important element in any given organisation.

It was physically demanding even for the fittest of soldiers, with sweltering heat and humidity.&nbsp; I remember how parched my Muslim soldiers were as it was <I>Ramadan</I> and they were not able to consume water.&nbsp; Looking at their condition, I gave them the option of not continuing with the exercise.&nbsp; They insisted on continuing because, otherwise, they said&nbsp;their "buddies" would have to bear their load.&nbsp; In response, many of the&nbsp;other soldiers decided&nbsp;to go without water to keep their Muslim "buddies" company.&nbsp; We proceeded this way, with my officers and I keeping a lookout for heat exhaustion.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, these were not specially picked soldiers.&nbsp; They are ordinary Singaporeans you find in our heartlands, displaying extraordinary strength of character as NSmen.&nbsp; The motivation was commitment to each other as comrades.&nbsp; This basic human instinct translates naturally to professionalism and a commitment to serve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is&nbsp;experiences such as these that instilled in many NSmen, especially key <p align=left>Column: 3360</p>appointment holders, an enduring sense of commitment to the nation.&nbsp; Many of these NSmen have ceased to see National Service in terms of a "legal liability" they are required to fulfil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why it irks me when I come across young Singaporeans or their parents who seek&nbsp;ways to evade National Service (NS), or worse, when highly qualified people mock those who show a measure of commitment to NS.&nbsp; More than anything else, it is a grave insult to the thousands of NSmen who gave their best, and many who continue to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty-four&nbsp;years have passed since the first batch of National Servicemen was enlisted.&nbsp; And after all these years, National Service is seen by many, even today, as just a fulfilment of one's "legal liability".&nbsp; This is unfortunate.&nbsp; At a factual level this may be true but, at an emotional and fundamental level, NS has to be more than just a "legal liability".&nbsp; And I do believe that there is a significant number of Singaporeans for whom NS has come to mean more than just a legal liability&nbsp;&ndash; just that their voices are often drowned in the din of cynicism.&nbsp; I meet committed NSmen regularly&nbsp;&ndash; they are from all walks of life, holding a range of NS appointments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have given the matter much thought, and am convinced that one reason why many male Singaporeans and their parents still view NS as something to grit your teeth and bear with is that it is overwhelmingly positioned as a "legal liability".&nbsp; If this is what you hear most of the time when referring to NS, the image of "liability" would naturally override other perspectives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to give greater voice to the emotive aspect of National Service which, in my view, provides a more authentic perspective.&nbsp; To facilitate this, I have three suggestions which I hope MINDEF would consider:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3361</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, to consciously reduce the usage of the administrative term "legal liability" which encourages a focus on the start and end date, which is not what NS is, in essence.&nbsp; The term "NS commitment" should be used more often, instead of "NS liability".&nbsp; What I am suggesting is not just a play on words.&nbsp; It goes beyond that, as the term "NS commitment" more accurately captures what NS&nbsp;is about&nbsp;&ndash; an emotional commitment which does not have a run-out date</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to balance the notion of NS as an act of "conscription" with the idea of Singaporeans stepping forward to serve willingly.&nbsp; I know there are male Singaporeans who were not called up for NS but are willing to serve and, similarly, females who are prepared to do NS.&nbsp; It would be a meaningful gesture if MINDEF could provide the opportunity for such Singaporeans, in a formal manner, to volunteer to do NS.&nbsp; The numbers may not be large, but I am confident we have a critical mass of Singaporeans who will step forward.&nbsp; It would send a potent signal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there should be a greater sharing of powerful NS stories that epitomise the human spirit.&nbsp; Within the SAF, there should be more opportunities for sharing of experiences&nbsp;&ndash; formally and informally.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Many also do not know what to do for Total Defence.&nbsp; This situation is indeed worrying and calls for a re-look into our Total Defence outreach and education efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the concept of Total Defence was introduced in 1984 and comprises five key components, namely psychological, social, economic,&nbsp;civil and military defence.&nbsp; Despite years of campaign and outreach by MINDEF, the level of awareness, readiness and fighting spirit amongst Singaporeans to defend our country is still very lacking.&nbsp; Sir, while I appreciate the outreach efforts of MINDEF using different&nbsp;activities&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;campaigns, songs, competitions, movies, exhibitions and animation contests&nbsp;&ndash; to engage Singaporeans, Total Defence is not about song and dance. Total Defence is about defending our country against aggressive forces or crises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990 provides a grim reminder of a small country's vulnerability.&nbsp; Therefore, we need to take total defence seriously and adopt a more consistent approach to instil a sense of pride and loyalty among Singaporeans.&nbsp; We must provide the same message to all Singaporeans to protect our land and be prepared to die for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to suggest the following for the&nbsp;Minister to consider.&nbsp; First, set up a Total Defence Council comprising all stakeholders of our country, the 3P (Public-Private-People) sectors to spearhead the defence efforts.&nbsp; Two, design a Total Defence curriculum to educate young and old Singaporeans about Total Defence.&nbsp; Three, develop a Total Defence system and conduct regular exercises to increase readiness of our people.&nbsp; Four, sound the Total Defence sirens on February 15th every year and observe five minutes of<p align=left>Column: 3365</p>silence to commemorate the deaths of those who lost their lives during the Japanese occupation in 1942.&nbsp; This will constantly remind Singaporeans of the significance of Total Defence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions: First, what is the Total Defence operational readiness among Singaporeans?&nbsp; Two, what programmes are in place to instil a strong sense of Total Defence among Singaporeans?&nbsp; And three, how does MINDEF monitor and measure the effectiveness of its Total Defence outreach efforts?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>National education campaign</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> Sir, due to our social stability and safe environment,&nbsp;most Singaporeans tend to take our <I>status quo</I> for granted.&nbsp; This is particularly so for many youths who have not experienced anything other than peace and harmony.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although National Service (NS)&nbsp;has been introduced for more than 30 years, many Singaporeans still do not take that and&nbsp;the Total Defence&nbsp;as seriously as they should.&nbsp; Some even ask for the duration of NS to be reduced further or even scrapped altogether.&nbsp; As we have seen in recent news reports about other countries, a country's peace and stability is a very fragile thing.&nbsp; Total Defence is absolutely critical to the very survival of Singapore.&nbsp; Total Defence is about involving every Singaporean in defending Singapore.&nbsp; There is room for everyone in military defence, civil defence, economic defence, social defence and psychological defence.&nbsp; How have we&nbsp;measured up so far?&nbsp; Are our people operationally ready?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I like to ask the Minister for Defence on his assessment of the effectiveness of our National Education campaign in helping Singapore to build up a strong Total Defence capability so far and an update on new campaigns if necessary.</p></P></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 3366</p>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Members for their comments and questions, and for their commitment to Singapore&rsquo;s defence and security.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer and Ms&nbsp;Indranee Rajah enumerated the various challenges on the regional security environment and asked for an update as well as the role played by the US, China and other regional countries.&nbsp; Sir, in the Asia-Pacific, China and India continue to grow at a fast pace.&nbsp; This contrasts with the picture elsewhere.&nbsp; Europe continues to be gripped by the woes of a number of euro-zone countries.&nbsp; The United States is grappling with a large budget deficit.&nbsp; This has meant that economic dynamism and weight has been shifting eastwards.&nbsp; Defence expenditures reflect this shift.&nbsp; They are falling in the West while rising in <p align=left>Column: 3367</p>Asia.&nbsp; The recent unrest in several Middle Eastern countries has also led to some concern with the stability of global energy supply and prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The growing economic weight of China and India has given them more confidence, and a greater desire to play a larger role in regional and global affairs.&nbsp; They have new and expanded interests, such as access to trade routes and resources, and will seek to&nbsp;safeguard them. &nbsp;They are expanding their naval and air forces to extend their reach and influence.&nbsp; This is resulting in a shift in the relationship between the major powers in our region.&nbsp; Traditional flashpoints such as the Korean Peninsula also remain.&nbsp; On this issue, which Mr Palmer asked about, we hope that all parties will exercise restraint and reduce tensions through dialogue as a stable and nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is crucial for regional stability.&nbsp; We do not want to see nuclear proliferation in our region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key question on everyone&rsquo;s minds is how dynamics between the US and China affect our region. Given the high degree of inter-dependence in the relationship, both sides recognise that having friendly relations is in their best interests.&nbsp; However, there is also potential for competition and friction. Domestic pressures in both countries, too,&nbsp;will continue to complicate the relationship.&nbsp; As China undergoes a leadership transition and the US a presidential election in 2012, both sides cannot afford to appear weak, especially on matters that affect domestic support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Southeast Asia, rich in natural resources and where critical sea lanes converge, is a region where the key interests of the US and China intersect and often played out. China is working hard to build up its relationship with <p align=left>Column: 3368</p>Southeast Asian countries and to manage areas where there are differences. In parallel, the Obama Administration has resolved to remain a "resident power" in Asia and has stepped up its engagements with Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp; Both sides seek to deepen their trade relationships with the region.&nbsp; These are positive developments for Southeast Asia, which can then play a role in fostering good relations between the US and China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer, Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Lily Neo and Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef&nbsp;&nbsp;asked about the regional security architecture and the role played by MINDEF as well as other countries in shaping it.&nbsp; In today&rsquo;s evolving strategic environment, countries need to come together to build trust and confidence, and to cooperate in tackling complex security challenges that affect everyone. &nbsp;An open, inclusive and flexible regional security architecture can therefore facilitate this process, by bringing together the key stakeholders to address issues of concern, promote mutual understanding, build confidence, and provide a construct through which countries can cooperate in areas of shared interests, in spite of differences in other areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On our part, MINDEF seeks to contribute ideas and concepts to crystallise and strengthen the security architecture as well as useful capabilities towards regional cooperative activities.&nbsp; We play an active role in institutions such as the ASEAN Defence Ministers&rsquo; Meeting (ADMM), and the ADMM-Plus, the newest component of the architecture, which Dr&nbsp;Neo asked about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, only four and the half years after the first ADMM meeting in 2006, the ADMM-Plus was inaugurated with an ADMM+8 format, comprising the&nbsp;10 ASEAN countries and eight "Plus" countries &ndash; Australia, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Russia<p align=left>Column: 3369</p>and the US.&nbsp; These are key extra-regional countries that have a stake in the region and can contribute expertise, perspectives, and resources to help deal with regional challenges.&nbsp; The establishment of the ADMM-Plus is a significant milestone in the history of ASEAN, strengthening ASEAN&rsquo;s ability to set the regional agenda and its position as a driving force for regional defence cooperation.&nbsp; The inaugural ADMM-Plus agreed to advance practical cooperation among the 18 militaries, particularly through the establishment of Experts&rsquo; Working Groups (EWGs) in five areas &ndash; humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime security, peacekeeping, counter-terrorism and military medicine.&nbsp; The ADMM+8 provides a forum&nbsp;where people can air their views, say how they feel, what their concerns are,&nbsp;so others can understand them.&nbsp; At the same time, after the discussions, it provides avenues and channels where they can work together in these five areas and develop in a concrete way their desire for cooperation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF is also actively involved in the Shangri-La Dialogue, held annually in Singapore. The Shangri-La Dialogue plays a unique role in the regional architecture by bringing together defence ministers, senior officials and academics from the region and beyond for a frank exchange of views. This key event will celebrate its 10th anniversary this year.&nbsp; 2011 also marks the 40th Anniversary of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), a grouping that has become an integral part of the regional architecture.&nbsp; The 8th FPDA Defence Ministers' Meeting will be held in Singapore on 1st November 2011 &ndash;&nbsp;"1-11-11".&nbsp; It marks the day that the FPDA was founded 40 years ago.&nbsp; Over the years, the FPDA has proven to be an adaptive institution, relevant to the changing strategic environment and the needs of its members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee&nbsp;asked about bilateral defence relations with our neighbours and<p align=left>Column: 3370</p>key partners.&nbsp; Our defence ties with Malaysia are deep and broad-based. They encompass a wide range of interactions between the defence leadership as well as among the rank and file through regular bilateral exercises and exchange visits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All these interactions have enhanced the friendly ties between both sides.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our defence relationship with Indonesia remains strong with regular and wide-ranging interactions between the SAF and the Indonesian National Defence Forces.&nbsp; I recently visited&nbsp;Indonesia last December and attended the 30th anniversary&nbsp;celebrations of Elang Indopura, a bilateral exercise between both Air Forces.&nbsp; It was a wonderful occasion because they brought back the officers who had taken part in the early&nbsp;Elang&nbsp;Indopura exercises&nbsp;from the very beginning and they were able to interact with each other.&nbsp; I also met with&nbsp;President Yudhoyono, Vice President Boediono, and Defence Minister Purnomo.&nbsp; In my interactions with these&nbsp;Indonesian leaders, I was heartened to hear their strong affirmation&nbsp;of our warm and friendly bilateral relationship, and their agreement that both sides should further explore opportunities to expand cooperation for mutual benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US remains one of our strongest and closest defence partners and a country with whom we share fundamental interests and strategic perspectives.&nbsp; Our relationship with the US affords us technology access and training opportunities to build our operational <p align=left>Column: 3371</p>capabilities and readiness.&nbsp; Last November, the SAF conducted in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, the first battery live-firing exercise involving our new&nbsp;High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).&nbsp; Our new Sikorsky S-70B navel helicopters were also based in the US from November 2009 to September last year for integration training with our frigates.&nbsp; We continue to maintain F-16, F-15SG, Chinook and Apache training detachments in the US.&nbsp; On our part, we also welcome visits by US ships and aircraft to Singapore.&nbsp; We believe that the&nbsp;continued presence in our part of the world by the US is important for regional peace&nbsp;and security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With China, we have progressed our defence relationship.&nbsp; A second joint counter-terrorism exercise between the SAF and PLA, which focused on counter-terrorism security operations for major international events, was held in Singapore last November.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continue to enjoy close defence ties with Thailand and Brunei, and increasingly with Vietnam, with whom we conducted mutual naval ship visits and our third Defence Policy Dialogue last December.&nbsp;Our relations with other regional partners like Australia and New Zealand also remain warm and strong.&nbsp; We share a history of operational cooperation with both countries, such as in the multi-national stabilisation and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.&nbsp;Last year marked the 20th year that the SAF has been exercising in the Shoalwater Bay training area in Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that some of the Members of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) were able to come along with me to see that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the earthquake in Christchurch last week, more than 100 SAF personnel, who had been on exercise in New Zealand at that time, together<p align=left>Column: 3372</p>with an SCDF team, have been assisting the New Zealand Defence Force and local authorities in their rescue and relief operations.&nbsp; We have also deployed two C-130s to airlift humanitarian aid and supplies to victims of the earthquake and evacuate civilians from Christchurch to Wellington and Auckland.&nbsp; A team of forensic experts from the SAF, Health Sciences Authority and the Singapore Police Force has also just arrived in Christchurch to help with the identification of earthquake victims.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef, Dr Lam Pin Min, Dr Maliki Osman and Dr Lily Neo asked about the evolving threats to Singapore's security, whether the SAF's mission has changed, its role in homeland security and its contributions to international security operations.&nbsp; In today's interconnected world, states face an array of complex transnational threats such as terrorism and maritime security.&nbsp; In such an environment, the spectrum of operations that the SAF has to undertake has expanded, although the SAF's basic mission has not changed.&nbsp; The SAF's mission remains to deter threats to Singapore's security, territorial integrity and sovereignty, and should deterrence fail, to secure a swift and decisive victory over the aggressor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of the wider spectrum of operations the SAF undertakes today is in homeland security.&nbsp; Singapore continues to be a target of terrorists and we must remain on our guard.&nbsp; A seamless inter-agency effort to counter this threat is essential.&nbsp; The SAF, therefore, works closely with other Ministries and Homefront agencies to do so.&nbsp; One example is the Maritime Security Task Force which works closely with other maritime agencies, like the Police Coast Guard,&nbsp;to enhance Singapore's maritime security.&nbsp; Another example is the Island Defence Task Force which conducts peacetime security operations, such as the protection of key installations together <p align=left>Column: 3373</p>with Homefront agencies.&nbsp;The SAF's Special Operations Force remains the intervention force for terrorist hostage incidents, and the SAF's units that deal with chemical, biological, radiological&nbsp;and explosive threats support the Home Team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given its transnational nature, the terror threat cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone.&nbsp; A multinational effort is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah asked about Afghanistan.&nbsp; Afghanistan remains a key element in this global fight against terrorism and Singapore is committed to doing its part, within our means and in useful ways, for the multinational stabilisation and reconstruction efforts there.&nbsp; Our deployments support the larger international efforts to prevent extremists from using Afghanistan as a base to export terrorism.&nbsp; We have been contributing to the multinational efforts in Afghanistan since 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the SAF deployed medical and surgical teams, a weapon locating radar detachment and an unmanned aerial vehicle Task Group to Oruzgan province.&nbsp; We currently have in Oruzgan a six-man Imagery Analysis Team to provide imagery interpretations and intelligence support.&nbsp; We will also deploy another 13-strong medical team to the US-led field hospital there this May.&nbsp; We concluded our four years of contributions in Bamiyan province in October last year with the completion of the Foladi Comprehensive Health Clinic.&nbsp; Afghan, civilian and NGO groups are now providing many of the services needed in Bamiyan.&nbsp; We have, therefore, concluded the SAF's operations there in Bamiyan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also responded to the call for more military institutional trainers to build up the Afghan National Security Forces to prepare them to assume responsibility for security by 2014.&nbsp; A team of 10 SAF institutional trainers is now working in partnership with the Australians at the Australian Defence Force-sponsored Artillery School at the&nbsp;Kabul Military Training Centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3374</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our servicemen operate in tough conditions in Afghanistan, where the work and terrain&nbsp;are challenging.&nbsp; Our people are well trained and we augment their training and equipment appropriately for the specific requirements of their mission.&nbsp; Our men have proven themselves to be adaptable and resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has allowed the SAF to effectively&nbsp;carry out its mission in Afghanistan and glean valuable operational lessons which are then shared with the rest of the SAF.&nbsp;Through the course of their deployments, our servicemen have done Singapore and the SAF proud and are highly regarded by our international partners.&nbsp; Our medical teams have helped to heal soldiers and&nbsp;civilians,&nbsp;our UAVs have successfully supported key operations and our weapon locating radar has provided warnings of incoming rocket attacks that have saved lives and avoided casualties.&nbsp;We have left with Members a&nbsp;DVD [<I>indicating</I>] which they can have a look at to get a flavour of the sort of operations that our men and women&nbsp;are conducting in Afghanistan and the kind of operational challenges they face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Neo and Ms Lee also asked about our maritime security efforts&nbsp;and our counter-piracy contributions in the Gulf of Aden.&nbsp; As a maritime nation, Singapore has an interest in preserving the freedom of navigation, the safety of international shipping and in combating threats at sea, such as piracy and maritime terrorism.&nbsp; Led by our Maritime Security Task Force, we are establishing a new National Maritime Security System to promote even stronger information sharing, situation awareness, decision making and operational coordination among our maritime security agencies.&nbsp; This will enable us to respond more effectively to a wider spectrum of maritime threats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continue to extend information sharing beyond Singapore's borders by building up the Navy's Information Fusion<p align=left>Column: 3375</p>Centre (IFC)&nbsp;as a key regional maritime information sharing hub.&nbsp; Last year, I spoke about the IFC and how it enables an international network of partners to share information to facilitate timely and effective responses to maritime threats.&nbsp; This network of partners continues to grow.&nbsp; Ten countries deploy liaison officers to the IFC and the IFC has linkages with 38 agencies in 25 countries, enabling it to tap on information&nbsp;from a wide range of sources.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia continue to conduct coordinated maritime and combined air patrols under the ambit of the Malacca Strait Patrols.&nbsp; While ensuring the security on the Strait of Malacca and Singapore remains our priority, we continue to play our part in the international efforts to combat privacy in the Gulf of Aden. As it is not possible for a country to protect its own shipping in all key sea lanes around the world, we will have to depend on international cooperation to secure these sea lanes for everyone's use.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we commanded the Combined Task Force (CTF) 151 from January to April and deployed an SAF Task Group comprising a landing ship tank with two helicopters from June to October.&nbsp; During our command of CTF 151, the SAF led more than 2,500 personnel from nine navies. At the invitation of the Combined Maritime Forces, a senior Singaporean naval officer - supported by an SAF command team&nbsp;&ndash; will, once again, command CTF 151 from March to June this year.&nbsp;In the second half of 2011, we have plans to deploy a third SAF landing ship tank and helicopter Task Group to the Gulf of Aden.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer and Ms Lee asked for an update of the SAF's transformation to a 3rd Generation armed forces.&nbsp; Last year, I reported to this House that the key building blocks of the 3rd Generation SAF are in place.&nbsp; Through our steady and<p align=left>Column: 3376</p>prudent investment in defence, we continue to strengthen these building blocks&nbsp;&ndash; transforming the SAF into an advanced networked force, making the SAF more flexible and responsive, and placing emphasis on developing our people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most visible prong of the SAF's transformation journey is the progressive introduction of more capable platforms, which adds important new capabilities to the SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the return of our Sikorsky naval helicopters to Singapore, the Air Force inaugurated its first local F-15SG squadron in April last year, while the Army took delivery of its first HIMARS artillery rocket platform last July. These new capabilities ensure that the SAF is ready to meet the challenges of the future across the air, land and maritime domains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our acquisitions replace ageing 2nd Generation SAF systems that have served us well over the last 20 to 30 years.&nbsp;The Air Force will take delivery of the Heron 1 UAV in 2011 to replace the Searcher-class UAV that has been in service since the 1990s.&nbsp; The Heron 1's longer flight endurance and better surveillance capabilities will provide the SAF with superior battlefield situational awareness.&nbsp; The Air Force will also replace our 30-year old RAPIER air defence system with a new SPYDER-SR ground-based air defence system which can more effectively deal with the wider spectrum of current and future aerial threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Navy will begin designing a new class of vessels to replace our 2nd Generation Fearless-class patrol vessels.&nbsp; These patrol vessels have been in service since the&nbsp;1990s &ndash; the first were in service since the&nbsp;1960s, I served on those &ndash; and will be more than 20 years old by the time we replace them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee asked how the SAF integrates new acquisitions with current capabilities.&nbsp; The strength of the 3rd Generation SAF is not just drawn from having more <p align=left>Column: 3377</p>platforms or having better hardware.&nbsp; Less visible but just as important is the multiplier effect from the SAF's ability to network its array of systems and capabilities.&nbsp; When we first embarked on this networked SAF six or seven years ago, it was quite difficult to explain to people what it&nbsp;was that we&nbsp;were trying to do.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;think now most people understand this because they can see the power of the networks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrated Knowledge Based Command and Control allows the SAF to create an overall fighting system more effective than the sum&nbsp;of its individual parts.&nbsp; For example, the&nbsp;Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicle is not just an Armoured&nbsp; Personnel Carrier (APC).&nbsp; It has an on-board Battle Field Management System and connectivity with the soldiers who deploy from it.&nbsp; So it acts as a node for our soldiers to network with land and air platforms, such as the Leopard Main Battle Tanks and Apache helicopters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for simple things like enabling the soldiers to recharge their batteries, it helps to maintain that network force and for them to be able to remain present on the battlefield.&nbsp; This allows them to operate as an integrated, networked and more capable war-fighting system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer asked about the impact of Singapore's demographic trends on the SAF.&nbsp; The birth rate has fallen since 1997.&nbsp; At the same time, our enlistees are better educated.&nbsp; These resource trends were indeed among the reasons for embarking on the&nbsp;3rd Generation SAF.&nbsp; By anticipating these trends and capitalising on them, MINDEF has made the necessary adaptations without compromising operational readiness by exploiting technology, using fewer people, and commercialising our logistics and support functions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The improving educational profile of our population has proven to be an<p align=left>Column: 3378</p>important advantage.&nbsp; Today's servicemen are better educated and adaptable and, hence, better able to master new skills and operate more technologically complex systems.&nbsp; This has allowed us to proliferate systems such as light-weight UAVs and the Advanced Combat Man System down to our soldiers.&nbsp; This also allows the SAF to field more capable&nbsp;3rd Generation platforms that require less manpower to operate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to visit some new designs&nbsp;for battlefield management systems for our armoured vehicles.&nbsp; What they have done is that they have got polytechnic students to come in and play with the models that they have set up for the man-machine interface for the display and control systems in the fighting vehicle.&nbsp; This helps our engineers in&nbsp;the industry to design the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, these polytechnic soldiers, when they join the SAF, will be operating these systems which they helped to design at the prototype stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Formidable-class frigates are&nbsp;good examples of how we have been able to have the capability but with fewer people.&nbsp; It has a crew half of what many other navies need to operate a similar class of ship.&nbsp; And now other navies, including the US Navy, are just beginning to operate ships of this size and class with similar sizes of crew that we are operating.&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF will continue to take stock of the challenges we face and build on our strengths to find effective solutions to new challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the heart of our transformation efforts is our people&nbsp;&ndash; the key resource enabling us to realise our&nbsp;3rd Generation transformation.&nbsp; We need to therefore attract, develop and retain people with the right set of values and abilities.&nbsp; This is an issue which Mr Palmer asked about.&nbsp; This House will be aware that MINDEF has put in place new and enhanced career schemes to enable us to do so.&nbsp; At the <p align=left>Column: 3379</p>same time, to increase the professional depth of our servicemen and to facilitate life-long learning, we have strengthened our professional development and continuing education programmes.&nbsp; These efforts have been well received.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ng Eng Hen will now elaborate on these initiatives and also speak on the subjects of National Service and training safety which several Members have asked about.&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee&nbsp;will later speak on implementation of the RECORD V initiatives and MINDEF's efforts to reach out to and engage various segments of Singaporeans on defence issues, including Total Defence.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> Sir, if I may elaborate on some issues raised by Members.&nbsp; MINDEF agrees with Mr Michael Palmer and Dr Lam Pin Min that attracting and retaining the right people for the SAF is critical to keeping its edge.&nbsp; Dr Lam said that it was the single most important resource, and we agree.&nbsp; And this indeed was the reason why we introduced new career schemes last year, so that we could better match the aspirations of people seeking a career within the SAF.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Deputy Prime Minister has just mentioned, the&nbsp;3rd Generation SAF also requires deep professional competence in many vocations.&nbsp; We have therefore also rolled out numerous professional development programmes to equip our servicemen with the competencies required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new scheme of service was created&nbsp;&ndash; called the Military Domain Experts Scheme (MDES)&nbsp;&ndash; to build and retain deep professional expertise in critical military domain areas, such as engineering and intelligence.&nbsp; This new career pathway has been well received.&nbsp; There was a 95% take-up rate among the personnel eligible&nbsp;for conversion to MDES.&nbsp; Servicemen who <p align=left>Column: 3380</p>have converted to MDES are enthusiastic about the greater opportunities for professional development and career progression.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give just one example to illustrate&nbsp;&ndash; Air Force technician&nbsp;Military Expert 2 (ME2) Ang Boon Siong, who attained his Bachelor of Engineering in 2009 from UniSIM through part-time studies.&nbsp; He is being recognised for his outstanding performance and strong potential.&nbsp; At age 28, he will be the youngest amongst his peers to be emplaced in the rank of ME4 upon completing his Military Domain Expert Course.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tandem with the introduction of MDES, we have enhanced the schemes for Warrant Officers and Officers.&nbsp; Under the enhanced schemes, our Officers can stay with the SAF till age 50, instead of retiring in their mid-40s.&nbsp; Warrant Officers retire at age 55.&nbsp; Servicemen under the MDES scheme retire at 60.&nbsp; This was a point raised by Mr Michael Palmer about extending the career lengths.&nbsp; The career lengths of our enhanced schemes balance the needs to allow more time for professional development without losing the dynamism that is critical to an effective and potent SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where there is a critical organisational need, the SAF does selectively retain our servicemen beyond their stipulated retirement age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Enhanced Warrant Officers Scheme has been well-received.&nbsp; Under this scheme, those with potential to reach Warrant Officer rank can do so earlier. &nbsp;Their jobs have also been re-designed and restructured to focus on combat leadership roles, and to anchor key SAF competencies in leadership, tactical war-fighting expertise and training supervision. &nbsp;Many Warrant Officers and Specialists look forward to the greater responsibilities and new pinnacle appointments that they can now undertake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3381</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give one example. &nbsp;Army Senior Warrant Officer Lee Sung Cheng has the honour of being the first SAF Warrant Officer to be appointed as Commanding Officer of a Training School.&nbsp; He assumed command of the Specialist and Warrant Officer Advanced School on 31st January this year.&nbsp; This was&nbsp;a post previously held by a Lieutenant-Colonel.&nbsp; In Senior Warrant Officer Lee&rsquo;s words, he said that such appointments "speak volumes of the faith and trust that the organisation has placed upon our Warrant Officers".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SAF Officers have also welcomed the wider range of continuing education, professional military education and training, and leadership development opportunities presented by the Enhanced Officers Scheme.&nbsp; The public response to these schemes in terms of recruitment has been encouraging.&nbsp; Against the backdrop of strong economic conditions and a tight labour market, more have chosen to embark on an SAF career in 2010 as compared to 2009.&nbsp; This is a positive sign as we need to continue to attract able and committed people to the 3rd Generation SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF will step up professional development and continuing education programmes to equip our servicemen at different points of their career.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min asked about our professional development programmes.&nbsp; Let me give some details.&nbsp; For example, the Centre for Army Lessons Learnt, which was created in October 2010, aims to enhance the Army&rsquo;s learning from military operations and training exercises. &nbsp;This year, the SAF will establish the SAF Centre for Operational Learning, which will spearhead efforts to draw operational lessons learned that are applicable across the three Services and, where necessary, institutionalise them into doctrines and processes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3382</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF will continue to work with appropriate professional partners to ensure high standards of its programmes.&nbsp; For example, the SAF established partnerships with the Justice Institute of British Columbia and Nanyang Polytechnic in April&nbsp;last year&nbsp;to enhance paramedic training for its combat medics. These partnerships allow the SAF to strengthen the basic medical knowledge of its medics, give them the skills to treat more complex medical conditions as well as attend to casualties in an operating theatre or an intensive care unit.&nbsp; Our medics can also choose to pursue Diploma and Advanced Diploma courses in paramedic care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past year, the SAF has also collaborated with various Institutes of Higher Learning to further strengthen the SAF&rsquo;s continuing education system.&nbsp; Through the SAF-NTU Academy that was established last year, NTU co-conducts modules at the Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College, which are accredited towards NTU Masters programmes.&nbsp; The SAF has also worked with NTU to launch a 12-week Undergraduate Professional Military Education and Training Programme&nbsp;that provides SAF personnel with foundation courses in military knowledge.&nbsp; Completion of this programme earns the officers credit towards Degree requirements at the four public universities in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF has also established tie-ups with universities to accredit the professional training that our personnel receive in the SAF.&nbsp; For example, UniSIM, in collaboration with the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida in the US, will accredit up to 20 credit units to graduates of selected Air Force Training Command courses towards relevant Bachelor Degrees from both universities. &nbsp;Such accreditation&nbsp;is a strong testament to the rigour and quality of our training and development programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3383</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also leveraging on technology to facilitate the professional development of our servicemen.&nbsp; For example, LEARNet, which is currently available at the Basic Military Training Centre, the Specialist Cadet School and the Officer Cadet School, allows our soldiers to access online training content to carry out self-directed learning.&nbsp; The SAF has also put in place an SAF-wide knowledge repository system for official documents and information, and this has contributed to the SAF&rsquo;s productivity&nbsp;because it enables our personnel to store, search and access information rapidly and securely.&nbsp; More importantly, it accelerates the propagation of knowledge and information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to inform Members of this House that the SAF was conferred the Asian Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise 2010 Award for the progress that we have made in this area.&nbsp; The winners of this award were selected by a panel of Asian <I>Fortune</I> Global 500 senior executives and leading knowledge management experts, and the other winners last year included Infosys Technologies, LG Electronics, and Toyota.&nbsp; So we are in great company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these initiatives illustrate the SAF&rsquo;s commitment to training and developing our people.&nbsp; We believe that as&nbsp;a small armed forces, the SAF must maximise the potential of each serviceman, and develop them well to be better prepared for future challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree with Mr Viswa Sadasivan that it is every Singaporean&rsquo;s duty to defend the country.&nbsp; In fact, I was greatly cheered by his views and his own perception of what National Service means.&nbsp; I also agree that after&nbsp;44 years, we have had strong support for NS from Singaporeans.&nbsp; During passing out parades, you see generations of fathers and sons.&nbsp; Many of you who have sons<p align=left>Column: 3384</p>would&nbsp;have&nbsp;experienced it and it is a very special moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a unique place in the hearts of many Singaporeans.&nbsp; We will continue to engage the hearts and minds of Singaporeans so that all of them will believe that this is a commitment more than a liability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must bear three fundamental principles in mind when considering full-time NS.&nbsp; First, it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;only for&nbsp;critical national need because it imposes considerable cost both to the individual and to the nation.&nbsp; That critical need is national security and our survival.&nbsp; Second, it must be universal.&nbsp; All young Singaporean males who are fit&nbsp;are conscripted.&nbsp; Because if&nbsp;some males are conscripted but others are not, there will be strong feelings of unfairness.&nbsp;The third&nbsp;principle&nbsp;is equity, which means that our NS policies are applied equitably to everyone regardless of background or status.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, there have been calls to extend NS beyond this remit to fulfil social objectives or otherwise.&nbsp; While these objectives are laudable, we must not dilute the restriction of NS only to critical needs of national security and survival and base it on the three fundamental principles I have just articulated.&nbsp; At&nbsp;present, there are no operational needs that justify imposing upon women to serve NS.&nbsp; But we agree with Mr Viswa that, indeed, MINDEF welcomes women and others not called up for NS to volunteer their services in the SAF as well as in the support of Total Defence.&nbsp; For example, there are women volunteers serving as nurses in the SAF's Combat Support Hospitals and as Community Emergency Response Team members&nbsp;in various constituencies.&nbsp; We can consider other areas, as he has suggested, where women volunteers and others can make a meaningful contribution in the defence of our nation.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3385</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef asked how the SAF ensures the psychological well-being of our National Servicemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to enlistment, all pre-enlistees are provided with a comprehensive guide to mentally prepare them for NS.&nbsp; The numerous videos on cyberpioneerTV on YouTube on Basic Military Training (BMT) are also part of our efforts to help pre-enlistees and their families prepare themselves for NS.&nbsp; In addition, they undergo medical and psychological tests to ascertain whether they are&nbsp;suitable for enlistment and deployment.&nbsp; Those who are&nbsp;identified with possible psychological problems are given the appropriate counselling or psychiatric assistance upon enlistment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon enlistment into BMT, commanders pay attention to the common problems faced by their recruits in adjusting to various aspects of NS life, such as&nbsp;regimentation, physical demands and communal living.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;taught stress management skills and are assigned to a buddy&nbsp; that can look out for them&nbsp;during training.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of his NS, every National Serviceman is interviewed regularly by his commanders, which allows him to bring up problems that he may encounter.&nbsp; Our commanders undergo basic counselling training and mental health awareness programmes and are equipped to identify and address the issues raised by their soldiers.&nbsp; If they require&nbsp;more specialised assistance, soldiers can be referred to medical officers, para- or professional counsellors, or SAF psychiatrists.&nbsp; In addition, we have a 24-hour SAF Counselling Hotline, which soldiers can call if they need help.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann asked for an update on training safety. I would like to assure the House that the safety of our people is of paramount importance.&nbsp; I agree with him that we must uphold the<p align=left>Column: 3386</p>trust that the community and families placed on SAF and MINDEF when they send&nbsp;their sons for NS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the organisational level, the SAF has established a rigorous set of Training Safety Regulations and procedures to ensure that safety measures are systematically incorporated into all our training activities.&nbsp; There is also a robust risk assessment process in place, to ensure that our personnel identify risks before every significant activity, and that these risks are mitigated.&nbsp; The SAF also seeks to instil a strong culture of safety in our soldiers through leadership emphasis, and by enabling open reporting systems and practices in our units.&nbsp; At the individual level, our servicemen are drilled on how&nbsp;to conduct their activities safely and trained to be safety conscious. &nbsp;For example, new entrants to the SAF must undergo safety induction training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we&nbsp;do our best to reduce incidents to a minimum, all of us recognise that they cannot be totally eliminated.&nbsp; The SAF will continue to maintain high safety standards and take active steps to ensure the continued safety and well-being of our servicemen.&nbsp; We strive to keep this as low as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann asked for some figures.&nbsp; Let me provide the figures that I have.&nbsp; Overall, the number of training incidents has been on a decline.&nbsp; For example, if we compare 2008-2009 versus 2010-2011,&nbsp;the training incidents reduced from 97 to about 36, which is about a third.&nbsp; If I can give another example, the number of heat injury cases&nbsp;&ndash; something that we are all quite familiar with &ndash; has decreased from quite a high from many years ago, in fact, close to 100, to now about 14 cases.&nbsp; This has been the result of the safety system that was rechecked.&nbsp; They looked at what were the factors and the various measures in place.&nbsp; These positive trends encourage us<p align=left>Column: 3387</p>to continue to try hard and make sure to reduce the number of incidents to the lowest possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now hand over to Assoc.&nbsp;Prof. Koo Tsai Kee who will speak on the RECORD V initiatives, and MINDEF's efforts to engage Singaporeans on defence issues.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah asked about the implementation of the RECORD V recommendations and how our National Servicemen have benefited. I am pleased to report that we have fully implemented 14 out of the 18 recommendations accepted by the Government.&nbsp; Another three are in the process of implementation.&nbsp; As for the remaining recommendation, we have started planning for its implementation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One proposal that we have fully implemented in the past year is the National Service Full-time (NSF) of the Year award, which aims to recognise NSFs who have made significant contributions during their National Service.&nbsp; A total of 70 NSF of the Year awards were given out. One of the award recipients, Third Sergeant Muhammad Khairul Rusydi Bin Mohamad, said the award served as an affirmation of the strong support he received from his commanders and peers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RECORD V had also recommended that the Government give National Servicemen additional allotments in Growth Dividends schemes.&nbsp; Members of this House will be aware that the Minister for Finance announced in his recent Budget Statement that all NSFs, NSmen and ex-NSmen will receive extra Growth Dividends of $100 to recognise their contributions to Total Defence.&nbsp; This is on top of their Growth Dividends entitlement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3388</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three RECORD V recommendations that are still in the process of being fully implemented are the enhancement of fitness corners around Singapore and business centres within our military camps as well as the building of the fourth Fitness Conditioning Centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty fitness corners have been enhanced so far.&nbsp; NSmen who live near fitness corners in areas like Bishan-Toa Payoh, Sembawang, Tampines, Tanjong Pagar and West Coast can now train for their IPPT literally at their doorsteps.&nbsp; For the coming year, another 30 fitness corners will be enhanced by SAFRA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of our camps have also been equipped with enhanced business centres, where NSmen can now use their laptops and PDAs during non-training hours to do their business or to connect with their families or officers.&nbsp; Feedback from our NSmen indicates that nine in 10 believe that this initiative had helped them to better balance their National Service and work commitments.&nbsp; In view of the positive response, we are expanding this initiative to another 20 camps from next month onwards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of the fourth Fitness Conditioning Centre in Kranji is also ongoing and will be completed by the end of this year to facilitate the conduct of IPPT.&nbsp; The remaining RECORD V recommendation that is yet to be implemented is the building of new SAFRA and HomeTeam NS clubhouses in the north-eastern and eastern parts of Singapore, and we have started planning for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah also asked about the implementation of the National Service Recognition Award (NSRA). The purpose of NSRA is to provide sustained recognition for Singapore citizens who serve National Service.&nbsp; By the time he completes his ORNS training cycle, each<p align=left>Column: 3389</p>NSman can expect to receive $9,000, as rightly pointed out by Ms Indranee Rajah, or $10,500 if he is a commander.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform this House that the first disbursement of the award was paid just a few days ago on 28th February.&nbsp; This gesture of recognition has been well received by NSmen.&nbsp; For example, Lieutenant Louis Chia, who recently completed his full-time NS as a commander, received $3,500 in his Post-Secondary Education Account for the first milestone of the award.&nbsp;&nbsp;That means that he finished his full-time National Service. &nbsp;He told us that this is a useful way to recognise servicemen like himself and the award would go towards paying for his NUS tuition fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Total Defence&nbsp;&ndash; this is a topic which is at the heart of some Members like Dr Teo Ho Pin.&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about the operational readiness of Singaporeans for Total Defence and the effectiveness of our National Education (NE) efforts.&nbsp; Dr Teo also asked whether a Total Defence Council for stakeholders to play a role can be set up.&nbsp; Sir, allow me to take these questions together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Defence has worked well for us.&nbsp; It has been effective in bringing Government agencies, private sector organisations and individual Singaporeans together to effectively deal with national crises such as the fallout from the September 11th attacks in 2001 and the outbreak of SARS in 2003.&nbsp; More recently, Total Defence saw us through the worst economic crisis since&nbsp;independence. We were able to bounce back quickly because we had put in place sound economic fundamentals and built up trust between Government, employers and workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF reaches out to Singaporeans through the annual Total Defence campaign to encourage everyone to <p align=left>Column: 3390</p>contribute and play a personal part in building a strong nation together.&nbsp; This, as Dr Teo points out, is the key mission of Total Defence.&nbsp; It is presented in five components to help Singaporeans understand the different roles they can play in the different sectors of society.&nbsp; For example, as Dr Teo himself would be aware, the SCDF conducts the Emergency Preparedness Day at various grassroots events as well as CPR and firefighting drills for the public and schools.&nbsp; He has also helped us to conduct some of these exercises.&nbsp; Just recently, the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC/Bukit Panjang SMC held an Emergency Preparedness Community Day on 20th February 2011.&nbsp; All this adds up to Total Defence with each constituency doing its part with support from various agencies.&nbsp; The public would also know that the SCDF sounds the Public Warning System sirens at 12.05 pm every Total Defence Day to remind Singaporeans of the significance of Total Defence. So, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, Dr Teo.&nbsp; This is accompanied by radio broadcasts to explain the different types of siren sounds.&nbsp; There is also the counter-terrorism exercise, Exercise Northstar, which the SAF participates in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also involves various Government agencies in a Total Defence effort to fight terrorism.&nbsp; Two thousand personnel from 15 Government agencies took part in Northstar VII in 2009.&nbsp; As part of social defence to build national resilience, MHA, with support from MCYS, MOE, MICA, MOM and PA, coordinates the Community Engagement Programme, which drives efforts to promote racial and religious harmony within the local community as well as encourages Singaporeans to be trained to cope with crises and emergencies.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While each component of Total Defence is driven by a separate Ministry, MINDEF also organises the annual Total Defence campaign.&nbsp; Over the past few years, our Total Defence campaigns have   <p align=left>Column: 3391</p> involved our partner agencies like MOE, MCYS, PA, NHB and MHA, and focused increasingly on the "Heart" and "Hands" of Singaporeans to engage them at a more affective and experiential level.&nbsp; For this year&rsquo;s campaign, "Home &ndash; Keeping It Together", we have also involved the People and Private Sectors, as part of the 3P partnership that Dr Teo mentioned, in a joint effort to encourage Singaporeans to help raise funds for needy families and the elderly.&nbsp; This is part of social defence.&nbsp; Through the "click for charity" tie-up with ComChest, more than 130,000 Singaporeans have done their part for Total Defence by downloading the music video "Home".&nbsp; Each download will be matched by a $1 donation from the following organisations: Aurigin Technology, the Lee Foundation, NTUC Fairprice Foundation, SembCorp, Singapore Pools, Singapore Turf Club and the Tote Board.&nbsp; Let us&nbsp;do our part&nbsp;for Total Defence&nbsp;&ndash; please click.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Total Defence campaign completes the trilogy of themes that encourage Singaporeans to take ownership of our nation&rsquo;s defence, and is a fitting sequel to the theme of "What Will You Defend?" in 2009 and "I Will" in 2010, where the natural flow is for Singaporeans to respond by saying "I will defend our home".&nbsp; The remake of the song "Home" aims to instil a sense of pride and loyalty among Singaporeans, and serves to remind us that underlying the concept of Total Defence is the fundamental conviction that Singapore is worth defending simply because it is our Home.&nbsp; The participatory and interactive nature of the Total Defence campaigns in recent years demonstrate the shift from a messaging paradigm to one of dialogue, sense-making and self-discovery, one which encourages more voices, more stakeholders or champions for Total Defence, particularly from outside Government.&nbsp; This year, 39 Singaporean<p align=left>Column: 3392</p>artistes with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra have come together to express their own feelings about Total Defence through the song "Home".&nbsp; The singers are a microcosm of Singapore &ndash; from various backgrounds and age groups &ndash; and they have successfully reached out to all Singaporeans, young and old alike, about the importance of Total Defence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF&rsquo;s open, inclusive and bottom-up approach of involving various stakeholders in the public, private and people sectors, as seen in the Total Defence campaigns in recent years, is working well.&nbsp; The aim is to get Singaporeans to express themselves, as the best messages are bottom-up, coming from Singaporeans to their fellow Singaporeans, as well as take action that contributes and strengthens Total Defence.&nbsp; Post-campaign surveys in the last three years have shown that the level of awareness and support for Total Defence remains high, with an average of 91% of respondents saying that they have heard of Total Defence and will commit themselves to Total Defence.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

MINDEF will study the idea of&nbsp;a Total Defence Council, proposed by Dr Teo Ho Pin, to see whether it fits into our ongoing Total Defence efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitment to defence.&nbsp; Sir, Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef asked how MINDEF engages Singaporeans on the importance of the SAF and National Service to strengthen their commitment to defence.&nbsp; MINDEF actively engages different segments of Singapore society on defence issues through various ways.&nbsp; Besides bringing students to SAF camps and holding Open Houses where all Singaporeans can experience the SAF first<p align=left>Column: 3393</p>hand, SAF units have been co-organising activities&nbsp;with schools to enrich the students' national education experience.&nbsp; For example, as part of the SAF's Total Defence Day engagement efforts this year, soldiers&nbsp;from 41st Battalion, Singapore Armoured Regiment&nbsp;set up&nbsp;a display by armoured vehicles, weapons and combat&nbsp;rations at National Junior College.&nbsp; The students got a close-up and hands-on feel of the SAF's equipment, and were joined by 41 SAR soldiers in full battle gear&nbsp;in&nbsp;a road run, which the school organised as part of its Total Defence Day programme.&nbsp; This was well received by the school and the community around it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we engage the public through new media channels like YouTube,&nbsp;Flickr and Twitter.&nbsp; <I>PIONEER</I>, MINDEF's monthly magazine, which Members have in their&nbsp;bags or&nbsp;chairs, has also gone on iPad.&nbsp; Last year,&nbsp;I spoke about how viewers can learn more about SAF by watching short cyberpioneerTV YouTube clips on life in the SAF.&nbsp; We continue to see a positive viewership momentum, with more than 230 cyberpioneerTV clips garnering more than 2.9 million views &ndash; a six-fold increase&nbsp;a year on.&nbsp; The cyberpioneer Facebook page has also attracted close to 10,000 fans since it was set up in March.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure most, if not all of&nbsp;the Members&nbsp;here, have heard&nbsp;of the "Every Singaporean&nbsp;Son" series that aired on cyberpioneerTV on YouTube last year.&nbsp; Patterned after reality-TV shows, the series followed a group of 15 recruits as they went through BMT, and attracted over one million cumulative views over 18 episodes.&nbsp; The series, which was produced by MINDEF to allow pre-enlistees and their parents to have a better understanding of what goes on in BMT, has even been picked up by the National Geographic Channel and will premiere on the channel on&nbsp;8th March.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3394</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This May, MINDEF will be putting&nbsp;out a new series, "I am a Soldier, Sailor, Airman" which shows the wide spectrum of vocations in the SAF.&nbsp; I hope the public will find this series equally interesting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are&nbsp;heartened to note that there is a strong public commitment to defence and support for National Service.&nbsp; On our part, MINDEF will continue to ensure that our National Servicemen are recognised for their efforts.&nbsp; We will also continue to reach out to all segments of Singapore society, including the public, private and people sectors, through a multi-channel and multi-platform approach to further strengthen their commitment to defence as well as Total Defence.&nbsp; Together, we can work towards making Singapore a stronger and more resilient Home for all of us.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
