<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>LONG QUEUES AT SPECIALIST OUTPATIENT CLINICS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) what

are  the reasons for the long queues at specialist outpatient

clinics of restructured hospitals; and (b) whether any  steps

are  being taken by his Ministry to improve the situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   our  Specialist  Outpatient  Clinics  (SOCs)   see   a

disproportionately  large number of patients,  some  of  whom

could  have  been  treated by their family physicians.   This

situation arises because patients, by and large, prefer to be

seen  by the specialists and the charges at the SOCs are  not

significantly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>

higher than those charged by the family physicians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients therefore may experience long queues and

waiting times at the SOCs from time to time for the following

reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Patients' preference to be seen by certain

specialists  who have a long waiting list.   To  shorten  the

appointment  waiting time for patients, the  clinic  sessions

for  these specialists are therefore overbooked, which  would

invariably contribute to a longer queue and waiting time;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Appointments made at the SOCs are scheduled

assuming that they are "normal" cases with average length  of

consultation  time.  However, in the clinic  situation,  some

consultations  turn out to be more complex and  require  more

time.   This leads to a cascading effect whereby the  waiting

time  for  consultation  for  subsequent  patients  would  be

affected;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) From time to time, a patient's medical condition

changes  or  deteriorates such that he requires  to  see  the

specialist earlier than the given appointment date.  In  such

instances, based on medical need, the SOC may have to arrange

an  urgent  appointment  for  the  patient  even  though  the

specialist is already fully booked for the day; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Occasionally, the specialists are called away to

attend to emergencies in the ward or operating theatres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry and the public hospitals have instituted

the  following specific measures to improve the waiting times

at the SOCs:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To increase the number of clinic sessions for

specialists with long waiting lists;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To extend clinic operating hours for specialists

with very high patient-load; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To initiate an active discharge plan for patients

no  longer requiring specialist care for follow up  by  their

family physicians.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are, however, short-term palliative measures to

deal with the high patient load at our SOCs.  We need to do a

more fundamental review of outpatient care by specialists and

family  physicians to achieve our objective of ensuring  that

patients  receive care appropriate to their needs.   Ideally,

patients  should turn to their family physicians  first  when

they  are  ill.   The  family physicians  will  manage  their

medical    condition   with   appropriate    referrals    and

collaboration  with  the specialists.   However,  this  is  a

complex issue which would involve patient education, ensuring

high  quality  of  family  physicians,  and  review  of   the

specialist  referral  system  and  fees  charged.   With  the

formation  of  the  two networks, we will  make  a  start  by

interfacing the polyclinics with the SOCs.  Where the patient

is  adequately looked after by the polyclinics,  it  will  be

done  there,  and not at the SOCs.  The networks will  extend

this   collaboration   to  the  private   family   physicians

subsequently.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to declare that I am a doctor in private practice.

May I ask the Minister why specialist outpatient clinics take

appointments from any patient who so wishes through the phone

and  without  any  referral?  Would  not  such  practice  run

counter  to  the basic tenet of cost efficient and  effective

medicine?   Surely  not  every sickness  needs  the  care  of

specialists?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree entirely with

the  Member.  Ideally, every patient should be managed by his

family  physician, and see the family physician first and  if

the  condition  requires the care of a  specialist,  then  he

should be referred to the specialist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not enforce a compulsory referral

system.  We encourage referrals by the polyclinics and family

GPs.   We do not make it compulsory that if a patient is  not

referred by a private sector GP, he is not allowed to see the

specialist.  This is the situation today.  I think we have to

work on the education

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>

of  the  general  public that they should  see  their  family

physicians first.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Would the Minister condone such referrals?

Would  not  such  referrals to specialist outpatient  clinics

cause an inappropriate use of medical facilities, and tax our

public hospitals unnecessarily and frivolously?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, compulsory referral is the ideal

situation, but I think we want to be more flexible.  In  some

cases,  patients  make appointment with the  SOCs.   In  some

cases,  they are discharged from the hospitals and they  have

recovered.   But if they think that something  has  recurred,

they may want to make an appointment with the SOCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have adopted a more flexible approach. Unlike

some  countries, for example, they may insist on a compulsory

referral.   We have not reached the stage where  we  feel  we

need to insist on a compulsory referral situation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister did

not  get  me correctly.  I did not mean subsequent  check-ups

with  the specialist where they can go back any time.   I  am

talking  about  first-timers who just call up the  outpatient

clinics  for an appointment and they just walk in to see  the

specialist.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I think the Member also did not get my

answer.   We  do  not enforce a compulsory  referral  system.

Today,  we  are a bit more relaxed and we allow  patients  to

refer  themselves to the SOCs.  Of course,  we  can  adopt  a

compulsory referral system, meaning that if a patient is  not

referred by a private sector or a polyclinic GP, then  he  is

not  allowed to see the specialist.  We can discuss  and  see

whether  that  is  indeed a better system.   But  today,  the

practice is that we allow Singaporeans the flexibility to  go

to  the  SOCs.   In  a way, I think it serves  us  well.   Of

course,  it leads to a longer queue in the SOCs, but this  is

the trade-off.  And Singaporeans seem prepared to accept this

trade-off.   If  the feedback from all the  Members  is  that

Singaporeans  want  to have a compulsory referral  system  so

that the queues in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>

SOCs will be shortened, I am prepared to consider that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Can the Minister be more explicit in his

reply,  Sir?  How do we expect patients to know the  severity

of their illnesses to warrant specialist care all the time if

we just allow them self-referrals?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I think we have to be quite

pragmatic  about the situation.  Singaporeans now  serve  the

Net.   They  read all kinds of things on the  Net.   They  do

quite a bit of self-diagnosis.  It is not the ideal thing  to

do.   But  when Singaporeans think that they have  a  problem

with,  say, incontinence, they would want to see a specialist

first.  They do not want to see their GP.  Unless we say  no,

that  is not allowed, and we change to a completely different

regime,  but  today  the  rules  allow  them  to  go  to  the

specialist and we accept that practice.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as  I understand the Minister,  he  seems  to

attribute  the long queues partly and for a greater  part  to

the  reluctance  of  people to go and see  their  own  family

physicians.  Does he think that perhaps cost may be a  factor

in  this?   Has his Ministry ever considered getting  private

doctors  into a scheme of voluntary service?  The specialists

outside  could help and the Government could subsidise  their

fees,  if  they would only collect a certain amount from  the

patients.  Has the Minister thought about this at all?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my answer, I

attributed  to  two main reasons for the long queues  in  the

SOCs.   One,  is the tendency for people to want to  see  the

specialists rather than their family physicians.  And I agree

with Dr Lily Neo that it is not the ideal practice.  In fact,

my  Ministry  encourages and is putting in place measures  to

encourage  Singaporeans to see their family physicians  first

before  seeing  the specialist.  The share  of  the  workload

between  the family physicians and the specialists  today  is

weighted  to the specialist, because Singaporeans operate  on

the  understanding that if they have a specific problem, they

want to see a specialist before seeing the family physician.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which I put in my answer is cost. Not

that  it is more expensive to see a specialist, but that  the

cost  of seeing a specialist in our SOCs is not significantly

higher  than  seeing  a  private sector  GP.   So  the  price

differential between a private sector GP and SOC  is  not  so

big  that  Singaporeans will be encouraged to  see  a  family

physician first before seeing SOCs.  Singaporeans can  afford

to  see  a specialist.  The differential is not so high.   So

they go straight to the specialist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member suggested getting doctors to provide

voluntary services.  I am sure if doctors are prepared to  do

so, we will work with them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have you suggested a plan?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have to be quite realistic. The

specialists  in the private sector run their  clinics.   They

charge  private  sector fees.  Many of these specialists  are

involved  in community work and we encourage them to  do  so.

But  to  expect  private sector specialists to run  voluntary

clinics on a fee or subsidised basis is something that is not

so pragmatic.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  may not be aware that the practice of  referral  to

see  a  specialist  in  the past was actually  by  way  of  a

referral   system  through  the  general  practitioner.    My

question  is:  is  this  change from  the  previous  type  of

practice, where referral is through a general practitioner, a

way for the restructured hospital doctors to get more income?

That is one thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is this. Is the Minister aware that it

is not affordability that should allow people to go and see a

specialist  on their own?  I think it is the proper  approach

to  the whole healthcare delivery system that the Ministry of

Health is trying to put out.  This means that patients should

actually  get the correct information, the correct  direction

from  his  general practitioner before seeing the appropriate

specialist.  They might see the wrong specialist.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I agree entirely with Dr Tan Cheng

Bock.    That  is  the  ideal  practice.   We  are   actively

encouraging it.  But we have not made it compulsory that if a

patient   does  not come with a referral, we  will  turn  him

away.  So we are still flexible.  If people do not come  with

a  referral, we will, of course, counsel them and say,  "Next

time, please see your family physician."  But we do not  turn

them away if they do not come with a referral.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is a multi-faceted problem. At the same

time,  we  must  get  our GPs and our  family  physicians  to

upgrade  themselves, so that they offer such a good level  of

service   that  Singaporeans  have  a  very  high  level   of

confidence  that their overall medical needs  can  be  looked

after  effectively by their family physicians.  So it is  not

just  making it compulsory for the patient to see the  family

physician.   I  think the family physicians  themselves  must

also  upgrade and do continuing medicare education,  so  that

the   level  of  expertise,  the  level  of  skills  and  the

confidence can also be raised.  Then I think we will reach  a

situation  where  people want to see their family  physicians

and not be forced to see their family physicians.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister said earlier that he

agreed  with me.  Does it mean that he is going to stop  this

type of referrals to the specialist outpatient clinic now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member that it

is  an ideal case, but I am keeping to the present system  of

having the flexibility.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, could the Minister assure this House

that  he  will  ascertain  that there  are  no  inappropriate

practices existing in the hospital now, and whether he  could

avert  other unhealthy policies in the future, basing  it  on

the fact of cost efficient and effective medicine?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have got no idea

what is the Member talking about.  Could she clarify?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I will clarify. Certain practices surely

must be based on criteria that are sound.  Therefore, all the

policies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>

that  are  being adopted by the Ministry of Health should  be

based  on  certain  basic principles and  one  of  which,  of

course, is cost efficient and effective medicine.  Are we not

using our national funds and public funds unnecessarily?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I agree entirely with Dr Neo that we

want  to have a cost effective health care system.  But as  I

said,  the  fee  structure  of  our  SOCs  today  is  not  so

significantly   higher   than  the  private   sector   family

physician. Singaporeans now are better educated.   They  want

choice  and,  therefore, we have not moved  to  a  compulsory

system.  Today, they have a choice.  We discourage them.   We

try  to  educate  them.  We try to work with the  College  of

Family  Physicians to upgrade themselves so that  the  public

can  have  more  confidence in the ability  of  their  family

physicians.   It is not just one side of the coin.   I  think

the  family physicians must also show to the public that they

can handle a wide range of problems when a patient sees them,

if   not,   the  patient  would  want  to  see  a  specialist

straightaway.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that

referral to a specialist is different from what he is  trying

to  tell  us  that  if a general practitioner  is  very  well

equipped, then there is less chance of him referring patients

to  the  specialist?  Yes, I agree with that.  But there  are

certain situations ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Dr Tan, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> The Minister's argument is that if

the general practitioners are very well trained, there is  no

need  for us to refer patients to specialists.  That  is  the

impression I get.  Is that correct?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that.

I  said  that the family physician should upgrade himself  so

that  he  understands  the full range of  problems  that  the

patient  is likely to raise with him and be in a position  to

provide the confidence to the patient that he will refer  him

to the correct specialist.  It must be cost effective for the

patient to do so.  If the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>

patient thinks he has got a specific problem and the cost  is

not so significant in going straight to see a specialist,  he

will want to do so.  We could make it a compulsory system  to

say  that  you  are  not allowed to see  a  specialist  until

referred  to by a GP. We can do that.  But today we  are  not

doing  that.  We encourage everybody to do that, but  we  are

not  making  it  a compulsory system.  So I  am  keeping  the

system as it is without making it compulsory.  If all the MPs

feel that this is crucial and that it will reduce health care

cost  by  forcing  everybody to the  GPs  first,  I  must  be

satisfied that the GPs can undertake their role.   I  do  not

want to force patients to the GPs if they are not equipped to

handle their requirements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> I agree with the Minister

on  the need to retain flexibility.  I think we should  leave

it  to  the patient.  But can the Minister confirm  that  the

rates that the patients are paying to the specialists are, in

fact,  market  rates  so that there  is  no  subsidy  by  the

Government on all these consultations and there is no  impact

on the cost efficiency?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for trying to

help  me  out.   There is a tremendous subsidy in  our  SOCs.

More  than  half of the patients going to our  SOCs  enjoy  a

subsidy  of  65% and all the rents and GST of  our  SOCs  are

fully subvented by the Government.  Even for those who do not

enjoy  the  subsidy, the so-called private  patients  in  our

SOCs,  the fees which they are charged in the SOCs  are  much

lower  than  the  private  sector.   Therefore,  as  I   have

explained  in  my  answer,  one  can  understand   why   many

Singaporeans  troop to the SOCs straightaway  without  seeing

the  family  physician.   I am not  saying  this  is  a  good

practice.   I  am saying we are trying to change  it  through

better   patient   education,  through   upgrading   of   the

physicians.   But  to  have an edict to say  that,  tomorrow,

nobody  is  allowed to go and see the SOCs  unless  they  are

referred  to by a family physician is a step which I  am  not

prepared to take for the time being.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained in my answer, it

is a multi-faceted problem and we have to look at all avenues

to solve the problem.  One of the avenues we have to consider

is  adjusting the fees so that it reflects the value  of  the

<div align="center"><b>EXTERNAL DEGREES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Education,

since  there  are  many mature individuals pursuing  external

degrees,  whether statistics have been compiled to show  that

these  individuals are able to derive any increase  in  their

compensation package or improve their economic wellbeing.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the answer is no.  The Ministry  of  Education

does   not   have  data  on  the  compensation  packages   of

individuals pursuing external degrees.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> In the papers today,

we  find  many advertisements on external degrees  which  are

offered by the various institutions of learning. The costs of

pursuing  these  degrees are very high.  Very often  students

who ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can you move straight to your

question, Mr Ong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> Could the Ministry of Education come out

with  a  list  of  recognised long-distance  institutions  of

learning so that our people will have some guide?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I have explained this before

and  I  will do so again.  There are many institutions  which

offer  qualifications  of various kinds,  including  degrees.

They can be offered by long distance, as the Member has said,

they can be by twinning programmes.  They can be offered over

the  Internet.   They can be offered by correspondence.   The

Ministry of Education is not in a position to accredit or  to

make a judgment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>

on  the  quality of any of these qualifications because  they

can be offered by institutions in a number of countries.   So

it  will  have  to  be  left  to individuals  to  decide  for

themselves, when they take up a particular programme, on  the

quality of the offerings of that particular institution,  and

it will have to be left to the employers to decide, when they

are   employing   particular  individuals,   what   are   the

qualifications of the persons who are applying for  the  job.

That  is the only practical way of dealing with the situation

when  there are large numbers and varieties of qualifications

that are on offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Bernard Chen]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the last one

to  two  years, I have frequently heard complaints about  the

services  at  the  restructured  hospitals.   Basically,  the

complaints could be in two categories.  The waiting  time  is

too  long and services rendered by the medical staff are  not

satisfactory.   Patients have to wait too  long  to  see  the

doctors at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs),  and  at

the  A&E unit, patients inadvertently have to wait for a long

time before being admitted to the wards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey published recently in the Straits Times

confirmed that the waiting time at the 18 specialist  clinics

at the Singapore General Hospital and at the NUH is about two

hours.  With regard to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>

the service level, the people are not happy with the services

of  the medical staff.  Secondly, they are worried about  the

nurse-to-patient ratio.  For instance, patients complain that

the hospital staff lack the necessary skills in administering

intravenous  drips  or inserting gastric tubes  to  suck  out

fluids  from  the patient's stomach.  When they  ring  for  a

nurse to come and assist them to go to the toilets, the nurse

does  not  turn up even after a long wait.  Some cannot  help

but urinate on the bed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients who went back to the specialist clinics at the

hospital told me that after waiting for 1 1/2 hours they were

merely  given a five-minute examination.  They wonder if  the

doctors  really understood their problems. Some patients  who

complained  about their pains were told that there  were  too

many  problems and that these could not be diagnosed  at  one

examination and were told to come again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course these were isolated cases. I could not

say  for  sure  what the overall service performance  of  the

whole  staff was.  I was worried after reading the  newspaper

report  of 7th February in the Straits Times that the  number

of  patients had increased by 20% whereas the number of staff

had  increased by only 11%.  Some doctors said that they were

too tired to maintain the requisite level of service. I quote

from  the Straits Times: A cardiologist said, "I spend  about

five minutes or less on a patient.  It is not enough.  I want

to spend more time, but there are so many patients to see and

so  much  to  do."    Is  it true that as  a  result  of  the

Government's plan to restructure, the hospitals have to  look

at  the  bottom line and thus have to cut cost, resulting  in

not  enough  doctors and nurses being recruited?  Hence,  the

quality of service is affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister for Health to give us an audit

on  the quality of service in the hospitals.  How frequent is

the  audit conducted?   Could the Minister tell us what  kind

of  benchmark the Ministry of Health has with regard  to  the

various  types of services in the hospitals and the level  of

service Singaporeans can expect in the healthcare.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerald Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerald Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like the

Minister  to  consider setting up a hospital to  specifically

treat   patients  who  are  not  responding  to   established

treatments and medicines.  Such a hospital will be a place of

last resort and could be known as the Hospital of Hope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be stringent entry requirements. A person

wishing  to  be admitted to the Hospital of Hope must  obtain

the certification of at least two specialists to confirm that

he is not responding to established treatments and medicines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital will be a place where new but untried, and

experimental  treatments and medicines are applied  with  the

patient's consent. There is no guarantee of a cure, only  the

hope for one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a negative perspective, the patient is a test

subject.  His condition may worsen.  However, on the positive

side,  the patient is participating in the search for a  cure

of  his  condition.  If a cure is found, the benefit  is  not

just  for one person but it will be for everyone else in  the

world  that  suffers from this illness.  Its  existence  will

provide  hope to a person who would otherwise have  only  one

option, to await certain death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost for the patient must be minimal, perhaps even

free.  Such a hospital could attract some of the world's best

researchers.   The Hospital of Hope would be  a  congregating

place   for  researchers.   Knowledge  will  be  shared   and

accumulated for the good of all.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, more national health programmes must

be   introduced  to  highlight  the  prevalent  illnesses  in

Singapore,  especially those that will benefit large  numbers

of  sufferers.  One good example that has been  neglected  in

this respect is the very common condition of asthma.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, asthma is a highly prevalent problem, seen

in 5% of the adult population.   In a study that examined the

healthcare,  utilisation  patterns for  asthma  in  Singapore

between 1986 and 1993, asthma was ranked 5th among principal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>

conditions with the highest number of discharges.  Among 0-14

year olds, asthma was ranked second, only after accidents and

injuries,  as  the  condition  with  the  highest  number  of

discharges.   It was estimated that there were  approximately

20,000  accident and emergency (A&E) room visits  for  asthma

per  annum.  In the primary healthcare setting, asthma ranked

6th   among   leading   conditions  seen   by   the   general

practitioners  and  Government polyclinics.   Among  under-15

year  olds,  asthma  ranked as the second leading  condition,

behind  upper respiratory tract infections.  Sir, this  study

showed  that  asthma is a significant cause of  morbidity  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in many countries, there has been a marked increase

in the prevalence of childhood asthma over the past 20 years.

It  is estimated that 140,000 individuals have current asthma

and more than 100 individuals die of this disease annually in

Singapore.   There  is also a substantial  degree  of  under-recognition of asthma among school children in Singapore.   A

recent  local  study estimated the economic cost  of  asthma,

both direct and indirect, to the patient and community.   The

total  cost of asthma in Singapore was estimated to  be  more

than  US$30 million per annum.  Sir, the study concluded that

the economic cost of asthma is considerable and justifies the

need for a concerted effort to reduce asthma morbidity.  This

is especially so with such prevalence in children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asthma is an eminently treatable condition with good

evidence  that newer interventions and adherence to treatment

can  be cost-effective in the long run.  Studies in Singapore

have  reflected  sub-optimal  management  of  asthma  in  the

community;  this  area will benefit from  a  national  health

programme.   What  is  required  is  a  Comprehensive  Asthma

Programme,  aimed at reducing asthma mortality and  morbidity

at  all  levels of the healthcare system, with the  long-term

goal  of improving the care of asthma cost-effectively.  Sir,

there is a need to make asthma a healthcare priority, in  the

same  league  as other common diseases such as cardiovascular

disease, cancer, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, etc.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school environment is particularly important to

children with asthma because acute exacerbations can lead  to

decreased ability to concentrate, decreased participation  in

activities,   and   high   rates   of   absenteeism.     Sir,

identification  of  children with the disease,  communication

with  parents and health-care providers, removal of  triggers

in  the  immediate  school environment, and  maximisation  of

access  to  medication when needed are  all  key  factors  in

managing  the  disease.   We can tap  the  expertise  of  the

doctors  from  the  Singapore  Asthma  Association  to  train

teachers to handle asthma in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to significantly reduce asthma morbidity, an

integrated approach is required, involving individuals from a

broad  range of backgrounds and interests.  There is  also  a

need  to  coordinate  the  efforts of  such  individuals  and

institutions involved in asthma care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Health could consider my

proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now go on to my next amendment on medical

establishments?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you. Sir, I would like to urge the

Minister for Health to look into greater integration  of  the

public   and  private  medical  sectors  concerning   medical

establishments.  I would like to declare that I am a  general

practitioner in private practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Ministry of Health is able and willing to treat

the  private  hospitals like "private wings" of  restructured

hospitals, and use the multitude of general practice  clinics

as extensions of polyclinics, integration in a lateral manner

can  become  a  reality.  This would involve a  fairly  major

mindset  change by all the relevant people in our  healthcare

institutions.   Sir, lateral integration of all  the  medical

establishments in Singapore will be a good thing and I  would

like to point out some of the advantages that we may reap.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An area of benefit from integration between public and

private  hospitals  and clinics is in the  "shared  use"  and

"free flow" of available personnel, especially in those areas

where  there  is  a  shortage.  This will save  cost  as  the

integration  and cooperation minimises expensive training  of

more and more people.  This will maximise our efficiency  and

enable optimum use of our resources.  The savings can then be

passed on to the patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another advantage of integration is in the shared

use  of  expensive equipment in both the private  and  public

sectors.    There   is  a  need  for  better   planning   and

collaboration in this area between these two sectors.   There

are  many  instances  where it makes  no  economic  sense  to

support  two  expensive machines, such as 4 million-dollar  a

piece  PAT-Scan or Positron Axial Tomogram Scan in  both  the

private  and public sectors.  We do not have enough users  to

justify the availability of more than one scanner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalising on existing equipment that is available and

much  too under-utilised in the private sector should be made

available to the public sector and vice-versa.  Patients from

the  public hospitals may not be able to afford the cost  for

using  such equipment in a private set-up.  Sir, this can  be

overcome if the private set-up weighs its options of  leaving

the  equipment to stand idle or of letting the  equipment  be

used by the public hospitals at special (out-sourced) rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulk order of standard requirements of hospitals and

clinics, like catheters, needles, sutures, medicines, and  so

on, jointly by all medical estalishments, makes good economic

sense.   When  the  lowered costs are made available  to  all

medical   establishments,  including  private  clinics,   all

patients  will  benefit.  They get  to  pay  less  for  their

treatment  and  general expenses.  The savings  in  cost  can

amount  to  a few hundred dollars, a 50% reduction at  times,

for some patients each month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of useful area of cooperation through

integration is a centralised sterilisation for all medical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>

establishments.  This is one area worth considering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Health would consider my

aforesaid suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, the White Paper on

healthcare  has  spelt out the requirements for  doctors  and

nurses  for  both the public and private sectors.   Over  the

years,  there have been so many changes in Singapore  and  in

the  region  which  have  also impacted  on  projections  for

medical personnel required to sustain and improve the quality

of  medical care.  For example, we thought that the  regional

crisis  will  lead to a decline of patients from  the  region

which, in fact, it did for a while.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid recovery of Singapore's economy and to a

certain  extent, those in the region, has renewed the  demand

for more medical services, leading to more doctors and nurses

needed  to service them.  The problem, of course, is that  we

cannot  simply  turn the tap on and expect more  doctors  and

nurses  to  come  out.  Training of doctors and  nurses  take

time,  in particular when it comes to specialists.  There  is

also a close nexus between the public and private sectors  in

both  good  and  bad times.  The national centres  that  were

established  would  also  tend  to  take  the  bulk  of   the

specialists, leaving the private sector with less.  How do we

strike  a  proper  balance  between  the  two,  as  each  can

contribute its part to make Singapore an eminent medical hub?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister elaborate on what are the steps being

taken to adapt to these changes?

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I

share  the  views  of  my  GPC  Chairman,  Mr  Bernard  Chen.

However, I wish to focus on our nurses in the health service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses play a very important role in the care of

patients  in  our hospitals.  They are constantly  in  direct

contact  with patients.  If we visit our hospitals  nowadays,

we  find  that  there is a big percentage of nurses  who  are

foreigners, especially from the Philippines, China  and  even

some from the advanced countries.  I believe these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>

foreign nurses are taken into our service due to the shortage

of our locals wanting to become nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can enlighten us on the reasons for

the  lack  of  Singaporeans who are keen to be nurses.   What

steps   is   the  Ministry  taking  to  attract  more   young

Singaporeans to take up nursing as a career?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1998, there were a total of 15,568 nurses and

midwives   registered  with  the  Singapore  Nursing   Board.

However,  almost  20%  or 3,060 of them  are  not  in  active

practice.   I  think it is such a waste because  almost  one-fifth of them are not practising their skills that they  have

learned  during their training to be nurses and midwives.   I

hope  the  Ministry can do something to attract these  nurses

not  in  active  practice to come back and serve  our  health

service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, according to the national health manpower

to  population, the ratio for nurses is about one to 250.   I

wish  to  ask the Minister whether there are plans to improve

this ratio, bearing in the mind the higher standard of living

in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to urge the Minister for

Health  to look towards the greater integration of our public

and private medical sectors concerning doctors.  I would like

to  declare  that  I  am a doctor in private  practice.   The

doctors  in the private sector are not tapped to the  fullest

potential.  The doctors in the public sector are not  exactly

content  with their lot.  Sir, we need to soften  the  divide

between the two sectors for the better of all concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first consider the case for doctors in private

practice.   It  will  be advantageous if  we  can  have  them

contribute  to the public sector.  The most overt effects  of

such a situation would be:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The reduction of the very heavy workload of doctors

in  the  public sector.  We can revamp the present  "visiting

consultants"  scheme  and implement  a  structured  permanent

scheme  for  private  doctors to contribute  to  patients  in

public sector positively.  At the moment, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>

existing  consultant scheme is only a token.  A comprehensive

type  of  contribution is not possible  perhaps  because  the

agenda   does  not  call  for  it.   It  is  not  implemented

wholeheartedly and this scheme is not very successful because

there  may  be  distrust and fear amongst  doctors  regarding

motives and vested interests.  Private doctors have to depend

on  the friendship and courtesy of their colleagues in public

hospitals to be offered "visiting consultant" posts and, even

then,  some may still feel redundant and unwelcome.   Sir,  a

new scheme should be in place to allow private clinicians  to

come  back  either  part-time  or  full-time  in  the  public

hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Many private doctors are more than willing to serve

subsidised  patients  and to teach in  the  public  hospitals

given  the  opportunity.  There are private doctors  who  are

willing to come to the public sector on the same remuneration

as the public doctors, if given the chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to doctors in public hospitals, integration

would  mean the chance to practise in the private  sector  in

whatever  form  that  is evolved in  time.   Of  course,  the

Ministry can always specify that only those who have attained

a  certain degree of seniority and expertise are eligible for

such options.  The effect of this would be:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The eventual establishment of a pool of doctors

that  is  in  a continuum of movement in and out of  the  two

sectors.   In  fact it would be all the better  if  there  is

mandatory  movement of senior doctors to the private  sector.

This  would  make the prospects of promotion and progress  of

junior doctors more attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Now, the integrated system would have the doctors

eventually coming back into the public sector.  The  constant

hassle  of  the  exodus of doctors from  the  public  to  the

private sectors would be curtailed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the details for a fully workable model for all this

to  work  can  be  worked  out and  in  due  course  a  truly

integrated  system of healthcare can be evolved.   It  is  my

hope that the Ministry of Health will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>

look  into  this issue on doctors and implement the necessary

steps.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, from

young,  I have always respected two types of people.   First,

the  teachers and, secondly, the doctors.  At that time,  the

SGH and TTSH might not be as good as what they are today, but

the  doctors have left a very unforgettable impression on me.

When  I  was  in Primary Five I went to the hospital  for  an

operation to remove my appendix, and I stayed there for three

days.   In Secondary Two, I had high fever and was warded  in

TTSH for five days.  The doctors there were very professional

and   very caring to  the patients.  They always tried  their

best  to alleviate the fears and suffering of their patients.

These  are  things that we do not see commonly  in  Singapore

nowadays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young doctors in the outpatient department care only

for high efficiency.  They only think about how many patients

they  can  see every day, but  do not care about the feelings

of   the   patients  and  their  family  members.   Generally

speaking, the doctors have blank faces.  They do not  have  a

caring  heart.   They  do not want to  communicate  with  the

patients.  And some friends have told me that doctors in  the

hospitals  say  only two words, "How" and  "Next".  They  are

mechanical.   They are all the same.  Let me  illustrate  the

"how" and the "next" in this short episode:

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother took leave to take her sick child to see the

doctor  in  the  hospital.  They waited for a few  hours  and

finally, their turn came  to see the doctor.  The doctor took

a  look  at  the worrying mother and the sleepy  child,   and

asked   expressionlessly,   "How?".    The   mother   replied

nervously,  "My  son has a high fever and is coughing."   The

doctor took the temperature, checked the throat of the  child

and  wrote  the  prescription in quick succession.   He  then

looked up and said to the nurse, "Next!"  Everything was done

very mechanically and without showing any feeling or emotion.

This  description  may  be  somewhat  exaggerated,  but  many

patients and myself have the same feeling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>

that our doctors have been more mechanical than caring.  They

are  too  focused  on efficiency.  This is like  operating  a

production  line  in the factory. I do not think  this  is  a

good thing for doctors to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have also told me that there seems to be a

lack  of  urgency in the A&E Department in the  hospital.   I

feel  we  should  review the mode of  operation  at  the  A&E

Department.   We  must understand that  to  the  patients  an

illness is an illness. To them, if they do not feel well, the

matter  is  serious and it requires immediate attention.  The

patients and their family members are naturally very  anxious

and  they regard their cases to be the most serious among all

the patients, especially when the patients are young children

or old people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is best to have a screening system at the A&E

Department  whereby  the  nurses will  examine  the  patients

immediately   upon  their  arrival,  and  make   professional

judgement to decide on how the case should be classified  and

dealt with accordingly.  The cases could be classified as  A:

critically ill, and B: emergency.   The A&E Department should

have  two  clinics: Clinic A to deal with the  critically  or

life-threatening cases, while Clinic B will deal  with  other

not  life-threatening but emergency  cases.    As  for  other

ailments,  such  as  cough and cold, flu,  fever,  etc,  they

should be streamed to the non-emergency departments.  In this

way,  you  can  lighten the workload of doctors  at  the  A&E

Department. At the same time, there should be more doctors on

duty  at the A&E department. Otherwise, doctors on duty  will

be  over-stressed and will lose their zeal to attend  to  the

patients.   Sooner  or later, they will  become  doctors  who

could  say  only two words - "How" and "Next".   I  hope  the

Ministry of Health can look into this matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the 1998 National

Health  Survey found that Singaporeans above the age  of  50,

particularly  those above 60 years old have the  most  health

risks.   Many in this age group suffer from high cholesterol,

high blood pressure and high blood sugar

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>

content.  This means that there are more than 655,000  stroke

candidates here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1999, 10,000 Singaporeans suffered a stroke.

Perhaps,  it  must  be  pointed out that  high  incidence  of

illness among Singaporeans, particularly the elderly, is  due

to lifestyle much more than age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a firm believer of prevention is better than

cure.   Whilst we invest millions of dollars towards  medical

treatment,  I  hope the Ministry of Health could  also  spend

much thought and more budget on preventive measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge the Ministry of Health to

consider tax incentives for employers who invest in workplace

health programmes to help their employees stay healthy,  like

those   schemes  we  have  in  place  to  provide  for  those

industries who promote industrial safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a Government who cares and recognises that

healthcare  must  be  of high quality  and  affordable.   The

Government has instituted many schemes and programmes towards

this end.  The 3Ms - Medisave, MediShield and Medifund -  are

prime  examples.  However, our challenge remains.  How do  we

ensure  that  the  premium and co-payment for  Medisave  will

remain  affordable?  There are literatures issued by  private

insurance   companies  which  pointed  to   the   fact   that

hospitalisation bills will increase.  Hence, will the 3Ms  be

sufficient?    Can  the  MediShield  remain  affordable   and

effective,  such  that the premium, the  co-payment  and  the

number  of  illnesses excluded from prior coverage  will  not

rise?   And  moreover,  how do we assure  Singaporeans  that,

despite  the  escalating  hospitalisation  bills,  they  will

continue  to  have  sufficient savings  or  monies  in  their

Medisave accounts?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, my concern is something which I

have  constantly raised and that is the cost  of  healthcare,

and I say this, particularly, for our people who are not well

off.   I  am  concentrating on those whose  income  is  below

$2,000 a month.  I once previously asked for a breakdown

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>

of  the cost to the Government of maintaining a patient in  a

Class C ward.  I got a general answer, there was no breakdown

given,  but  a general answer about the land cost  that  goes

into  the  cost and what else goes into it.  Can we not  have

something  which  the  ordinary man can understand,  a  White

Paper  on how much it costs the Government to keep a  patient

in a Class C ward for a day, saying exactly what the cost is,

and  how  it  is provided for so that the citizens  may  then

understand  the  problems of the Government and  be  able  to

appreciate what the Government is trying to do?  So  will  it

be  possible  now  for  the Minister  to  seriously  consider

putting  out  a White Paper on the cost to the Government  of

providing  healthcare in Class C and Class B2  wards  because

that is where they say the subsidy is the greatest?  Then  we

will understand what the subsidy is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I sit down, may I again renew my plea to

this  Government?  Will it consider seriously  setting  up  a

committee  to study the implementation of a health  insurance

for  the  whole of Singapore?  Why can we not even  study  it

instead of dismissing it?  The object must be to provide,  as

has been stressed this morning, healthcare at effective cost.

Is it not possible that a national healthcare insurance might

provide  healthcare at effective cost?  Will  the  Government

please  consider  setting up a committee?  It  would  appear,

from  what I heard this morning, that the Government  attacks

every   problem  as  it  arises.   Why  do  we  not  have   a

comprehensive study on what the problems are and how much  it

will  cost  the  Government to provide the answers  to  these

problems?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I move this amendment not to

highlight  the  problem of casemix implementation  which  the

Ministry  of Health must surely know, but to share with  you,

Sir,  and  Members  of  this House the  implications  on  the

community when hospitals are funded using the casemix model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has announced that, by the year

2000, that is this year, all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>

public sector hospitals will be funded by case mix for  acute

inpatient and day surgery.  Casemix funding is supposed to -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) control increase in healthcare costs; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) ensure healthcare is of a high quality and remains

affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learn that the Ministry of Health had started two

pilot  projects at the National Heart Centre and  the  Changi

General Hospital in May 1998.  The Minister may like to share

these  two centres' experiences as to how casemix information

has  promoted better management of health services.   Has  it

improved   health  care?   That  is  an  important  question.

Perhaps,  the  Minister  would  like  to  respond  to   these

questions later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me draw this House's attention to a US report on

casemix.   It was titled "Casemix information in  the  United

States:   15 years of management and clinical experience"  by

Rosanna  M.  Coffey.  This article is dated 31st March  1999.

It  is from a magazine called Quarterly Casemix, a US medical

publication.  This report made certain pertinent observations

after  15 years of casemix experience.  I would like to quote

from the report:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hospitals are treating only the most seriously ill

patients.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple surgeries are performed outside the hospital.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nursing care has been moved to intermediate-care

facilities or is given during home visits.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recuperation is occurring outside the hospital, where

patients  and  families  have  more  responsibility  in   the

recovery process."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the above observations are significant. Not only

has hospital care changed, but outside hospital care has also

changed.   There  is  need to upgrade and  improve  community

healthcare institutions to meet the new hospital development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these have political implications as the community

is thrust upon to play a greater role of care giving.  Why is

this so?  I think this is because the clinical management  of

patients has changed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>

dramatically.   Even  for the elderly in the  United  States,

conditions  that had been diagnosed and treated in  hospitals

are  now  being handled outside hospitalisation, and patients

treated in hospital leave sooner.  Thus, patients admitted to

the  hospital today in the US are more severely ill and  more

complicated to treat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, one of the startling results of casemix based

funding  of  hospital payment was the expansion of post-acute

long-term  care and home care business.  Are we prepared  for

this development?  If the Ministry of Health wants all public

sector  hospitals to be funded through casemix  by  the  year

2000,   then  the  numbers  of  post  acute  long-term   care

institutions must also expand.  And I do not see the Ministry

emphasising on this aspect, except a $37.2 million subvention

grant to voluntary welfare organisations.  This is out  of  a

total  of  $629.38 million subvention grants to  restructured

hospitals.  Invariably, the voluntary  welfare  organisations

and  community hospitals are going to bear the brunt  of  all

those  post-acute  long-term care.   My  point  is,  we  must

quickly learn from the experiences of the other countries who

have used casemix findings and not reinvent the wheel.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health must move in this area fast.

Thus,  the Ministry must, in the next Budget, make provisions

for  the  establishment of these institutions  and  encourage

more  voluntary welfare organisations to come along by giving

better  subvention grants to them. We will need  to  move  to

high-end   nursing   care  institutions  and   rehabilitation

centres,  apart from the community hospitals, as  the  United

States' finding is quite clear that recuperation is occurring

outside the hospital setting, and patients and families  have

more  responsibility in the recovery process. There must  not

only  be an increase in the number of such institutions,  but

also in the quality of such institutions.  Let me explain why

quality and special care will be expected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the downsides of casemix funding is the hospital

may discharge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>

patients  earlier than needed.  This is what we call "quicker

and sicker", that is, patients are not too well, but they are

discharged because of the funding method.  Let me explain  in

very  simple  terms.   You see, Sir, if a  case  of  appendix

requires  a  four-day hospital stay, you get full funding  if

you  discharge the patient in four days.  If you  exceed  the

four  days, you will become what the system calls an outlier,

and  an  outlier is not funded fully.  Therefore, it  is  the

duty  of  the  hospital unit to discharge the patient  within

four  days.   Thus, when patients are discharged quicker  and

sicker, the need for post-acute institutions to manage  these

community  hospitals and special nursing  and  rehabilitation

institutions  must surely be the order of the  day.   Let  me

give  you some statistics from the United States to prove  my

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1990 and 1997, the number of Medicare (this is

the  United  States  Government  funded  health  institution)

beneficiaries  using  home  care  services  jumped  from  1.9

million  to  3.4  million. You can see this  sudden  jump  of

almost two times.  Home care visits per home care patient per

year grew from 34 to 69, again, almost double.  The number of

home  healthcare businesses grew 5,718 to 9,147  and,  again,

almost double.  Nursing home and home care expenditures under

Medicare  have  been expanding more rapidly  than  any  other

category  of personal health expenditure, including  hospital

and  physician services.  Home healthcare, in particular, has

been growing at incredible rates of 20% to 25% per year.  You

will observe that there is emphasis on home care services. We

do  not have such services but this should be looked into  in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, looking at the present position of our

community  care institutions, I wonder if we  can  manage  if

most  of our acute hospitals go casemix. Bearing in mind that

our  nursing homes are always at full capacity, and there  is

usually  a  long  waiting  list in  the  Government-supported

institutions and VWO homes  ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Tan, you have exceeded the

time allowed.  Dr Jennifer Lee.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like

to  pick  up  a point or two relating also to home healthcare

services and on where Dr Tan has left off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has spoken on various occasions in recent

months,  regarding  putting  in  place  measures  that   will

facilitate the provision of nursing home care for the elderly

by the private sector to supplement the services in this area

being  rendered by the VWOs.  I would like to propose to  the

Minister that the private sector should also be encouraged to

participate  in  the  provision of home healthcare  services.

Although  the  provision  of this  care  is  not  so  capital

intensive  as the establishment of nursing homes, there  will

be  a  growing  need  and an even larger clientele  for  home

healthcare than for institutional care for the elderly.  I do

not think that in the longer term, we can expect the VWOs  to

be  able  to  meet the home healthcare needs of  our  growing

population. And enabling and supporting families to care  for

the ill and frail elderly members at home as far as possible,

is  very much in line with the philosophy and the approach we

wish to take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this to happen, it has to be of interest to the

private  sector  to develop home healthcare services.   There

needs  to  be  some  change in the funding  principles  which

currently  exist in the subsidy for institutional  care,  but

not  for  ambulatory or home healthcare for VWOs, in allowing

the use of Medisave mainly for institutional care, and in the

limited role of insurance to help the defraying of healthcare

expenses for the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that in the report of the Inter-Ministerial

Committee  for  Healthcare for the  Elderly,  long-term  care

insurance was proposed as a component of financing healthcare

for   the   elderly.   In  the  subsequent  Inter-Ministerial

Committee on the Ageing Population, this proposal underwent a

modification  to a proposal for severe disability  insurance.

If I read this nuance correctly, the implication is a drawing

back  from  the  first willingness to consider  supplementing

family financing of an ambulatory healthcare service for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>

chronic  but not necessarily disabling illness, back  to  our

current  position  that  supplements  direct  out  of  pocket

payment only largely for institutional care.  I think this is

counter to our efforts, both to promote preventive healthcare

to  the population, as well as to keep our senior citizens at

home  with  their  families and in the community  as  far  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give these points consideration

and  that  he  will  also  look at the  development  of  both

institutional  and home healthcare services for  the  elderly

concurrently  and not defer attention for  the  latter  as  I

believe both sectors are equally important.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Singapore has a quality primary

healthcare  system that is also very affordable.  However,  I

feel  that  we  can still tap our resources  and  better  the

potential  of  our existing system for the  benefit  of  this

nation  in the future.  I would like to suggest that we  look

at  the  following areas to bring our primary  healthcare  to

even greater heights. Sir, at this juncture, I would like  to

declare that I am a general practitioner in private practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private medical practitioners should remain the main

providers  for  primary care.  At the  moment,  they  provide

primary  healthcare to about 80% of the patients.   But  they

should  be more involved in step-down care from the  tertiary

and  secondary institutions.  Sir, we need to look  for  more

practical  and prudent ways to integrate and tap all  sectors

of  our  available  healthcare facilities.  The  Ministry  of

Health  should devise a scheme to encourage this,  especially

in terms of shared care and step-down care.  This will save a

lot  of  wastage on the more expensive facilities and medical

personnel  in  our  public hospitals.  Moreover,  when  these

patients  are transferred to primary care, they also  benefit

from  the lower costs, the convenience of seeing doctors near

their  homes  and the luxury of staying in their  homes  with

their loved ones. This will spell efficiency at its best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should induce the primary level care providers to

cater  for  the  increasing numbers of the  elderly  and  the

chronic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>

sick.  Perhaps, they can work more closely with the hospitals

in  shared care schemes.  The Government can remunerate  them

in  a  reasonable  and  controlled manner  so  as  to  ensure

affordability.  The advantages of such schemes would  be  the

significant  savings on cost, the decreased  demands  on  the

hospitals  in  terms  of  beds and medical  staff,  and  more

importantly,   the  positive  effects  of   having   patients

continuing to stay in their own homes with their loved ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive medicine, as the key towards maintaining good

health  in  any  population, cannot be over-emphasised.  This

therefore  is  one area we can ill-afford  to  cut  back  on.

Instead,  we  must seek out all avenues to help  the  healthy

maintain  their well-being for as long as possible.   In  the

long run, it will be the ministry of continuous and concerted

efforts  in promoting preventive medicine that would  contain

the  escalating costs of healthcare.  The involvement of  the

primary care doctors in this, with the encouragement from the

Ministry  of Health, will be the way to go in promoting  this

important  area of healthcare. The Ministry should  devise  a

plan to maximise the relationship of doctors and patients  in

this  aspect.   The  availability or the convenience  of  the

geographically placed private clinics will be an advantageous

asset for success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the primary healthcare doctors usually have better

rapport  and more time with the patients. They are  therefore

ideal for promoting preventive healthcare, especially so when

patients  give scant thought for preventive care  or  routine

medical check-ups when they are not sick.  We have to  change

the  mindset of people and reaffirm the idea that  prevention

is  better than care.  The Ministry of Health would be  doing

well  if  it  could  get  one and all to  go  for  preventive

healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister for Health can enlighten

us on my proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, I would like to address this

preventive healthcare issue more at the elderly or  those  of

us  who are going to be getting old ourselves.  I once  asked

my old friend, who was in his 60s,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>

how  he was doing. He said, "Every part of my body is falling

apart."  As we get older, this will happen to us too  and  we

will  get  sick  more often.  One way to  prevent  this  from

happening  is  to keep monitoring ourselves to enable  us  to

take  preventive measures in good time.  If we find  that  we

have  high  blood pressure, we should start taking medication

before we get strokes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health screening, although not 100% effective, at least

helps  us  to  spot these symptoms early.  Most  of  us  are,

however,  reluctant to go for health screening.  Some  of  us

are  dead scared about it because every time we go,  we  find

something wrong.  And the older we get, the more wrong things

we  get.  So, it may be better not to go at all.  This  is  a

wrong approach, especially for the elderly.  It is vital that

we  should detect the signs earlier for us to take  steps  to

reduce  the  risk of serious illnesses and costly  treatment.

We  need  to convince them that health screening is not  only

good  for  them,  but also necessary. We  know  that  we  are

providing,  at  the  moment, some  health  screening  at  the

community  centres and other institutions.  We  should  widen

the net and catch as many of them as possible. Above all,  we

need  to provide this screening at reasonable cost that  they

can  afford.  It is not necessary to test everything, but the

basic  fundamental tests must be carried out and  if  we  can

confine these tests to the essential ones, we will be able to

keep  cost  to a minimum. I do not know whether the  Ministry

has a programme in this respect.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, "prevention is better than cure" is a

fact  that  each  one of us here would accept wholeheartedly.

In  fact, my parliamentary colleague, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang,  had

just reaffirmed this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beseech the Ministry of Health to establish firm

directives on promoting preventive healthcare. The successful

implementation  of preventive healthcare will translate  into

quality life for our people and the enormous savings for  the

people  and the nation on healthcare cost. Sir, I have spoken

on  this important issue several times in this House and also

have moved an adjournment motion on it not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>

too  long  ago.  I would like to re-emphasise that  the  core

directives to ensure success of preventive healthcare are  as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Ministry of Health must campaign for a mindset

of  acceptance in the age-old dictum - "prevention is  better

than  cure".  Many Singaporeans still believe in seeking  for

remedy  only  when  they are sick, and  in  many  unfortunate

conditions, it is too late. An example of this is  when  they

are  seeking  the remedy for renal failure due  to  the  end-disease  of untreated diabetes or hypertension.   If  we  can

succeed in persuading people to look after themselves better,

half  of  our  battle is won.  The Ministry of Health  should

therefore  step up health education about healthy living  and

on responsible awareness and care for one's health. Excessive

campaigns, with effective use of television media,  may  make

the people more responsive, especially when they realise what

the  end-results  of many uncontrolled common  diseases  are.

Sir,  do not let the lack of information to the people  cause

efforts on preventive healthcare to fail.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The other important tool to ensure the success of

preventive care is to get all doctors throughout the  island,

not  just those in public institutions but also all those  in

private  practice,  involved  in  the  whole  concept.    The

Ministry must, therefore, find ways to engage all our doctors

in  all  the  different  aspects  of  preventive  healthcare.

Furthermore,  we  should encourage  all  our  doctors  to  be

mindful of the need to promote preventive healthcare  and  to

be  committed enough to consistently influence their patients

on the value of preventive healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sir, a more integrated approach, with the

involvement  of  the community, grassroots organisations  and

voluntary  organisations, will help in the implementation  of

preventive  healthcare.  The involvement of immediate  family

members with regard to preventive healthcare for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2162</b></font><br><br>

their  aged parents is another important area that should  be

pursued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A "Department of Preventive Healthcare" of its own

should  be  set  up  in  the Ministry  of  Health  to  ensure

continuity  and  lasting follow-through  of  all  efforts  on

preventive  healthcare.  It will be the department's  job  to

continuously  identify prevalent diseases that can  be  given

greater attention, and to continuously monitor and study  the

trends for prevention of common diseases as well as the  many

different  aspects  of  preventive  healthcare.   Some  basic

tenets  of preventive healthcare make it necessary  to  adapt

constantly.   For instance, whilst it would be impossible  to

try  and prevent all cancers on an equal basis, we should pay

more  attention to the more prevalent and devastating cancers

in Singapore.  We need to make sure that essential preventive

healthcare  programmes are geared to reach the at-risk  folks

at  the local community level.  We must always remember  that

the   morbidity  and  mortality  from  any  disease  can   be

dramatically reduced when the diseases are treated  in  their

early stages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The most important item to success is the

allocation of adequate funds for preventive healthcare.   The

dollars allocated for preventive healthcare programmes  today

will  enable our people to lead healthier and happier  lives,

and  also save us the heavy expense in building more and more

nursing homes and hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the Minister for Health will have the

rightful  considerations for this concept and  apportion  due

importance for it, so that we can have a lasting legacy for a

better life in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Chiang is not here. Dr Neo, would you

like to continue with your next cut?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Singaporeans are living longer now

with  an  average  life  span of about  78  years.   This  is

expected to improve further with newer medical advances.   As

our  population will age at an exponential rate, there is  an

urgent  need for the Government to cater for the requirements

of long-term healthcare of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>

many  more  people who have chronic diseases due  to  chronic

illnesses  such  as  diabetes,  hypertension,  cardiovascular

diseases  and so on.  It is of paramount importance  that  we

address  these issues quickly so that we have a  well-planned

medical  system in place to cushion the burdens of  long-term

healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are three areas that we need to consider

here:  first,  is  the  financing  of  long-term  healthcare;

second,  is  the  medical care to best  cater  for  long-term

healthcare; and, third, is the provision of tertiary care  of

long-term healthcare in hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the financing of long-term healthcare, I have raised

in  this  House  more  than  once the  issue  concerning  the

inadequacy   of   the   present  "medi-plans"   for   elderly

Singaporeans for this purpose.  I have suggested that perhaps

another  insurance  scheme, say, "Medicare"   -   a  patient-Government co-payment scheme  -  may fill this inadequacy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am delighted, therefore, that the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly has

recommended  an insurance scheme to solve this problem.   The

success  of long-term healthcare will be based on  the  basic

tenet  of  promoting preventive care to prevent complications

of  chronic diseases.  In other words, help patients to  care

for  their  chronic diseases as best as can be, so that  with

lesser  complications, they can lead a better life with  less

pain to bear physically and financially.  Long-term financing

must  be  made  available  to  address  this  area,  and   to

facilitate  care of patients outside the hospital setting  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must seriously consider implementing one of the most

effective  ways to cater for the chronic sick in the  future.

This is to get the primary healthcare doctors to care for the

chronic  sick,  as much as possible, without hospitalisation.

There    must  be  greater  integration  between  the  public

hospitals  and  primary  healthcare doctors  in  the  private

sector.   Sir,  I would like to declare that I am  a  private

general  practitioner.  Encourage shared care  and  step-down

care  to  the  primary  medical practitioners,  and  we  will

certainly reduce

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>

the  use  of  acute hospitals and community hospitals.   Most

patients  will also benefit when they can stay  at  home  and

close to their own families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that chronic healthcare

requires that a standard protocol be put in place for chronic

illnesses  in terms of long-term healthcare financing.   This

will ensure better treatment for all the chronic cases.  This

will  also  ensure  conformity, in  terms  of  care,  to  all

conditions.  Patients can also have the assurance  that  they

are  given the best care as recommended by this protocol  and

follow-up wherever they seek treatment.  For example, in  the

care  of  diabetes,  the protocol on the frequency  of  blood

check-ups,  eye  testing,  ECG testing  and  so  on  must  be

determined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that the Ministry of Health

make  it  easier for face-to-face discussion of patient  care

between doctors in the public and private sectors.  This will

be especially useful in the shared care and step-down care of

chronic cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Health could enlighten me

in the issues that I have raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with the aging of

our  population,  a  lot of resources utilised  for  creating

wealth  may have to be used to nurse the aged sick.  So  more

Government  policies will have to be formulated  towards  the

elderly  and  health  sector.  There will  also  be  enormous

burden   and  responsibility  placed  on  the  fewer  younger

Singaporeans in looking after their aged sick, and the  price

that  they pay will be greater day by day.  Therefore, whilst

we should continue to review our health programmes to provide

a  high  standard of healthcare, we must also  intensify  and

strengthen  the  cooperation between the  various  healthcare

sectors  to ensure that cost of healthcare services  for  our

older people remain affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health recently announced that it plans

to  increase the private sector's share for nursing homes  to

40%.  Is 40% the right balance?  How could we ensure that  we

will have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>

adequate nursing care for the aged be provided by the private

sector,  because  the  commercial  nursing  homes  are   more

concerned about business bottom line?  Therefore, under  such

circumstances,  is  it proper to ask the  private  sector  to

shoulder this responsibility of looking after our aged  sick,

and to provide them with a high quality of service?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, because of the

higher  educational level and the rapid economic development,

Singaporeans are spending significantly more time in  reading

and  working.  There are more and more people suffering  from

myopia,   glaucoma,   diabetic  retinopathy   and   cataract.

Particularly,  in  recent years, with the  emergence  of  the

computer  and  Internet  and the ever  increasing  number  of

international TV channels, international news and interesting

events  can  be easily accessed from PCs and television.   In

other words, Singaporeans are spending more time on computers

and  on  watching  television.  As  a  result,  many  of  our

citizens  and  our  working class people are  suffering  from

various types of eye diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a local opthamologist, many primary and

secondary  students are suffering from myopia,  and  some  of

them are as young as six years old.  When they grow up to  12

years  old,  their shortsightedness can be as high  as  1,000

degrees.   About 12% of our primary students are shortsighted

and  up  to  secondary school, about 56% are  suffering  from

myopia.  In the  SAF, about 48.5% of the Chinese NS boys  are

having  myopia and among the Malays, 24% of them are  myopic.

If  we  do  not  look into this problem seriously,  then  our

primary  and  secondary  students will  have  more  and  more

complicated  eye diseases when they grow up.  The  specialist

told  me that this is not just simple myopia.  There are also

many complicated eye diseases.  This is certainly a cause for

concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of the IOL implantation technique,

many developing countries are introducing advanced techniques

of  phacoemulcification to train

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>

their  own  eye  doctors to treat their  eye  patients.   Our

National  Eye Centre, established by the Ministry of  Health,

has also played a very important role in this aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore moving very rapidly into a modern IT

society,  there is bound to be an increase in the  number  of

patients with various eye diseases.  This is a matter not  to

be  overlooked.  I do not wish to see that in the not too far

distant  future, Singapore leads the world in IT development,

and  the  proportion of people in our country suffering  from

myopia and other eye diseases also tops the world.  This will

be a pity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's budget, I see that only $6 million is

allocated to the National Eye Centre.  If we want to step  up

our  R&D,  I  think  this is not enough.   I  hope  that  the

Ministry  of Health would grant more money for the  study  of

eye diseases to improve the eyesight of our people.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, you have not heard

from me for some time.  Thank you for allowing me to join  in

the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Keep it short!

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, the judgment of good hospitals is by how

they treat their customers, particularly the patients.  It is

no   point   having  good  hardware,  good  buildings,   good

facilities, but the people who manage them are not responsive

in  dealing  with the needs of the patients.  So it  is  very

important for hospitals to be proactive and to see  how  they

can  provide  the best for the patients, and I  am  sure  you

would agree with that, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we have patients who do not have

sufficient  money or identification when they appear  at  the

Accident  & Emergency Department for treatment.   I  know  of

cases,  from time to time, who faced difficulties in  seeking

treatment.   Some of them will have to go back to  get  their

ICs before they are seen.  Others may have insufficient money

and they are probably asked to raise money for treatment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the recent case in point at Mount Elizabeth

Hospital would suggest that there are some lapses in the  way

that  patients are being treated.  It is a community  concern

about how we handle and manage emergency cases.  It would  be

very tragic if patients who really need treatment and who  do

not  have identification and who do not have enough money  in

their  pocket  do  not get treatment in  time.   And  we  can

understand the gravity of the problem.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this case, I want to find out from the Ministry

whether  there are any standard operating procedures to  deal

with  emergency  cases.     How do  they  deal  with  private

hospitals?   Do  they  come under  a  purview  of  audit  and

supervision in relation to dealing with emergency cases?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Claire Chiang is not here. Mr Goh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, there are

currently  about  2,100  kidney  patients  on  dialysis.    I

understand  that the number of kidney patients  increased  by

about 500 each year.  The problem will be compounded with  an

ageing  population.  It might not be a shortage of facilities

for this group of patients at the moment, but are there plans

to  cope with the increase?  How many dialysis centres do  we

need  in  the  next five years?  With more  and  more  kidney

failure patients, the queue for kidney transplants would  get

longer  if  supply of kidneys remains static.   More  kidneys

need to be harvested for transplant purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Organs Transplant Act may have to be amended

as  currently only accident victims' kidneys can be harvested

for  a  transplant.   Public education in  preventing  kidney

failure needs to be stepped up.  I have seen people suffering

from  diabetes and on medication still  merrily drinking away

coca cola every day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, dialysis is costly. Inevitably, there will be some

patients  who  are  too poor to bear the cost  of  undergoing

dialysis treatment.  But they are not able to get

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>

Medifund   assistance.    Can  the  Minister   consider   the

possibility  of  extending such assistance  to  needy  kidney

failure patients?

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerald Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerald Ee:</b> Sir, Singapore's only natural asset is its

people.   The main way we enhance the value of this asset  is

to focus on education and training.  Even during the economic

downturn, we continued to invest materially in education  and

training  to ensure that our human resource is well  equipped

with knowledge and skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One additional way in which the nation can enhance the

value  of its human resource is to ensure that it has  access

to  various  knowledge bases.  Today, I am  focusing  on  the

knowledge base of medicines and medical treatments.   Such  a

knowledge base will be a depository of knowledge on medicines

and medical treatment, established and experimental, and case

studies.  There should also be chat channels so that a doctor

treating a disease could share the experience with others and

also  benefit from the experience of others.  I believe  that

setting up such a knowledge base can establish Singapore as a

Centre for Medical Knowledge.  It is not a novel idea but  it

certainly requires the commitment of a large organisation  to

achieve  a  meaningful and workable model.  It  is  for  this

reason  that  I  am  requesting the  Ministry  of  Health  to

consider this proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am urging the Ministry of Health to take the

initiative  of  setting  up such a knowledge  base  that  all

medical   practitioners  and  researchers  can   access   and

contribute to.  It should not be restricted to just access in

Singapore, but it should be opened to global access.  In  the

same way, I hope that there will be global participation  and

therefore knowledge being deposited from all over the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the knowledge base is designed to provide active

exchange of ideas, I foresee that there will come a day  when

no  one needs to  miss out on a treatment that is known to be

effective  somewhat  in  the  world.   Such  a  database  can

usefully collate data and establish patterns to provide early

warning alerts of potential

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>

epidemics and perhaps the necessary course of action can then

be taken to prevent it from happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is something that the World Health

Organisation could participate in and the Singapore  database

could be its central source of knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spin-offs are many. It will certainly help to

establish Singapore as the medical centre of the region.   It

will  be  of  great assistance and therefore be an attraction

for medical researches to be conducted in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well suited to establish such a global

database   because   of   its   excellent   telecommunication

facilities and advancement in the field of IT.  This  is  not

something  that  should  be left to  the  commercial  sector.

Such knowledge should be openly shared and not be hogged  for

commercial purposes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Lim is not here. Mr Lim Hng Kiang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, first, I would like to thank

all  the  Members who have spoken for their various  comments

and suggestions.  I will take them up individually and follow

up, even if I may not have the time to give them a full reply

today.   First, I would like to address the key  themes  that

are  raised by the Members and then I will take the  specific

issues point by point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first theme is really how to ensure that we have the

best delivery of health care services in Singapore.  In this,

we  are talking about how to make the healthcare providers in

the  public  sector,  the  polyclinics,  the  hospitals,  the

national  centres  work together and how to  get  the  public

sector and private sector to work together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry announced its plans to reorganise the public

healthcare providers into two vertically integrated  delivery

networks   last   November.   Each  network   will   comprise

healthcare  providers  ranging  from  the  polyclinics,   the

regional general hospitals, the tertiary hospitals to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>

national  specialty centres. The networks will  provide  more

integrated  and  better quality healthcare  services  through

closer  cooperation  and  resource sharing.  This  will  then

minimise  the duplication of services and ensure the  optimal

development of clinical capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vertical integration will involve interfacing the

polyclinics with the regional general hospitals, the regional

general hospitals with the tertiary hospitals, and the  acute

hospitals with the national specialty hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Bernard Chen asked how would the national centres fit

into  this  framework and their relationship with  the  acute

hospitals.  The role of the national centres as spelt out  in

the  White Paper remains unchanged after the two networks are

formed.  The national centres will continue to deal with  the

more  complex  cases  requiring more expensive  equipment  or

highly  specialised expertise.  They will centralise all  the

more  complex cases so that the workload can sustain the very

special skills and expertise needed. Based on this rationale,

my Ministry has worked with the national specialty committees

to  define the level of medical care that will be provided at

the  national  centres  and the acute  hospitals.  The  acute

hospitals  will continue to provide secondary care  in  these

specialties, and refer the more complex cases to the national

centres.  The  national centres will also be the  centre  for

research and teaching for their respective disciplines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national centres are to treat the more complex and

rare  medical  conditions, and therefore  understandably  the

fees would be higher because more resources are incurred  for

these  very specialised treatments. We have centralised these

specialised  manpower and equipment in the national  centres,

thus avoiding the higher cost which would have resulted if we

duplicate all these in all the hospitals. For B2 and C  class

patients,   the  costs  of  land  and  buildings  are   fully

subsidised by the Government.  In addition, they are provided

with 65% and 80% subsidy of the running costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national centres are grouped with the network that

they are co-located with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>

so  that  they  can leverage on the network's  administrative

support.  However, the services and expertise of the national

centres will continue to be made available to patients across

the  two networks.  Patients from one network can be referred

to the national centre in the other network and will be given

the appropriate level of service and standard of care. So  as

far  as  the  patient is concerned, there is no  change.  The

changes  will  be  made to the integration  of  the  backroom

support and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me turn to the integration between the private

and  public sectors.   I agree entirely with Dr Lily Neo that

in addition to the vertical integration between the hospitals

and  the  primary care, there should also be greater  lateral

integration between the private sector and the public sector.

We  already  have  several avenues  for  the  private  sector

doctors  to  contribute to health care in the public  sector.

Let me give a few examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have the Visiting Consultant Scheme that Dr

Lily  Neo  also  talked about.  I think  there  is  room  for

improvement in that scheme.  Secondly, we involve the private

sector  doctors  to  contribute their  expertise  in  complex

procedures, like heart and liver transplant programmes.   The

transplant teams involve doctors from both public and private

sectors.   Thirdly , private sector doctors are appointed  to

various  committees  to  assist  the  Ministry  to  formulate

policies  in  clinical  practice, medical  research,  medical

ethics and training matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has suggested that public sector doctors be

allowed  to practise in the private sector.  This is  already

done. The issue is really how to extend the scope. Currently,

consultants  in  the public sector hospitals attend  to  both

subsidised  and  private patients. My  Ministry  is  studying

whether we could introduce greater flexibility to the private

practice scheme by allowing public sector doctors to practise

part  of the time in the private sector. There could also  be

other ways to extend the scope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also made several suggestions on the shared

use of expensive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>

equipment,  bulk  order of standard medical  items,  and  the

centralised  sterilisation of medical equipment.   All  these

suggestions   are  worth  exploring.   If  it   is   mutually

beneficial, I see no reason why the two networks  should  not

take this up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envisage that, with the reorganisation of the public

healthcare delivery system, the networks will be able to work

out  new  and  innovative  ways  to  involve  private  sector

specialists  and  general practitioners in the  provision  of

healthcare  services and together provide  Singaporeans  with

good quality health care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run this system, we need the people. So let me now

turn to the concerns raised by Mr Bernard Chen and Mr Ibrahim

Othman.  First, the issue of doctors. Over the past 10 years,

the  number of doctors in Singapore has grown  steadily.   As

at  end  1999,  we had about 5,320 doctors in  Singapore,  or

around 1,750 or almost 50% more than in 1990.   While at  the

national  level we may have sufficient doctors, we  share  Mr

Bernard Chen's concern that the public sector should continue

to have its fair share of the national talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the re-organisation of the health care system into

these  two networks, one of the key tasks of the networks  is

to  come  up  with  innovative methods to develop and  retain

their  medical  specialists.   For  example,  development  of

talent  would  be done across the hospitals in  each  of  the

networks.  The  remuneration  system  would  also   be   more

sensitive  to  market  conditions and commensurate  with  the

calibre of the talent.  The networks will also provide a more

conducive  environment for good calibre doctors to  practise,

teach, do research and develop themselves professionally.  In

this  way,  the  two  networks can  be  more  competitive  in

training  and  retaining their staff.   At the same  time,  I

would  convey the comments of Mr Peh Chin Hua to the networks

to  make  sure  that  doctors are more communicative  and  go

beyond the two words 'How' and 'Next'?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of nurses, my Ministry is also concerned

about the shortage of local nurses. We have to anticipate the

demand that would come from the development of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>

step-down care services to meet the healthcare needs  of  our

ageing  population.   This need will include  nursing  homes,

community hospitals and home care services that both  Dr  Tan

Cheng  Bock and Dr Jennifer Lee talked about.  In  the  short

term,  we  will need to recruit well-trained foreign  nurses.

But for  Singapore, it is better for us, in the long term, to

ensure  that  the nursing profession is attractive  to  young

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses form the backbone of the healthcare system. We

want to encourage capable and bright young people to join the

nursing profession, to build up the profession and raise  the

level of nursing services.  Over the years, the Ministry  has

taken  various  measures to enhance nursing as a  profession.

But  I think the key thing is still competitive remuneration.

Therefore,  we  have recently reviewed the  nursing  salaries

together  with  the  restructured institutions.  The  nurses'

salaries  have  fallen behind those in the other  professions

with  people  of  equivalent  educational  level.  There   is

therefore  a need to adjust the nurses' salaries so  that  we

can  continue  to attract a sufficient number of Singaporeans

to take up nursing as a career. There must also be incentives

to  compensate  for  the  onerous nature  of  the  job.   The

restructured  institutions will, therefore, be taking  action

to   increase  nurses'  salaries  in  FY2000.  The   proposed

revisions  will increase the nurses' salaries by around  13%.

This  is  not an  across-the-board increase. We will increase

the  starting  salaries  of Assistant Nurses  and  Registered

Nurses by 21% and 10% respectively. Corresponding adjustments

will be made to the rest of the salary scales. The new salary

package   will  include  better  shift  allowance  and  other

measures  to  better recognise the efforts of the  nurses  in

providing  24-hour  care  to patients.  We  expect  that  the

proposed revision will increase costs for the hospitals by an

estimated $33 million.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to the second theme which

Members raised,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>

which  is  how  do  we  approach the problem  of  the  ageing

population.  As I mentioned in previous sittings, this is not

the  first  nor  the last time we are going to  discuss  this

issue.   So,  again, today, let me take through with  Members

what we intend to do to address this tremendous challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the number of elderly persons in

Singapore,  aged  65  and  above,  is  currently  7%  of  the

population  and  will rise to almost 20% by  the  year  2030.

This  will put some pressure on our healthcare services.   My

Ministry recognises that therefore we have to start preparing

ourselves  early and put in place a framework  to  meet  this

challenge.  So what is this framework?  As can be  seen  from

the  various points raised by Members, I think the first step

we  must take is to keep the elderly fit and healthy  for  as

long  as  possible.   Second,  to  encourage  regular  health

screening so that health problems can be picked up early  for

treatment.   And, third, for those who fall  ill  or  acquire

severe  disabilities,  there must be  a  whole  continuum  of

healthcare  facilities, programmes and  services  to  provide

care  in the most appropriate setting to the elderly  and  at

affordable cost to them, their family and the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing all these, the public, the private and the

people  sectors will have important roles in this  framework.

So let me first address preventive healthcare.  These are the

points  raised  by  Mr  Bernard Chen and  Dr  Lily  Neo.  The

challenge is how to keep the elderly fit and healthy  for  as

long  as  possible.   I  think we  agree  entirely  with  the

speakers on this.  We all realise that a healthy lifestyle is

really  the  key  to the prevention of many chronic  diseases

which can eventually lead to disabilities.  This applies  not

only   to  the  elderly  but  also  the  general  population.

Therefore,  my  Ministry  sets high  priority  on  preventive

healthcare, health promotion and public education to  prevent

the onset of chronic diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members are all familiar with the various

campaigns that my Ministry runs to educate Singaporeans on  a

general healthy lifestyle as well as on specific

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>

illnesses.   These  programmes  all  adopt  a  multi-strategy

approach  which involves the media, direct contact  and  many

avenues  to  try  and raise the awareness of Singaporeans  on

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stage is health screening. Through health

screening  we can check whether the various health  promotion

messages  that we have put forward have been translated  into

good  health.   I  agree with Mr Bernard  Chen  that  regular

health  screening is very useful.  The issue is  what  do  we

look for in the screening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware of the National Health Survey in 1998

which  showed  that the prevalence of diabetes,  hypertension

and  high blood cholesterol level increased markedly from the

age  of  50  years  and above.  If these  conditions  can  be

detected and treated early, then we will be able to avoid the

high social and medical costs associated with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is how do we encourage regular health

screening for the elderly.  As Advisers and MPs, we  do  this

at  the  constituency level with the help of VWOs  but  often

times,  our best efforts are inadequate.  In fact, those  who

need health screening most are the ones not likely to turn up

for  the  screening.  Instead, the more enlightened residents

will  turn up regularly.  They are also likely to be the ones

who  are  more healthy.  Also, our efforts on the ground  are

often  not  comprehensive enough to  cover  all  the  elderly

citizens in our constituencies.  As Advisers and MPs, we also

have  limited resources to mount this effort year in and year

out.  After the screening, I think most of us feel that there

is inadequate follow-up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to redress all these shortcomings, my

Ministry will reinforce what is being done now on the ground.

We  will  embark  on a systematic National  Health  Screening

Programme  in collaboration with the charitable organisations

to  detect diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol  level

in  people  aged 55 years and above.  The screening programme

would start in the second half of this year.  The plan is  to

complete  screening all 374,000 of those aged  55  years  and

above within

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>

three  years.   To  make it convenient  for  the  elderly  to

participate in this programme, the health screening  will  be

conducted at venues near to their homes, for example, in  the

void  decks.   Every senior citizen would be given  a  health

booklet to track his screening results.  I think Members will

remember that this is one of the suggestions put up by Mr Ang

Mong  Seng,  and we are pleased to adopt his suggestion.   My

Ministry  will  maintain the central database for  all  these

screening  exercises.  All those screened and found  to  have

abnormal  results will be counselled on site and referred  to

their   family   doctor  or  the  polyclinic  for   follow-up

treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to extend the screening programme to those who

are  50  years  and  above when the plan is well  established

after  three  years.  We would also like  to  encourage  each

person  to  attend  screening  once  every  two  years.   The

estimated  cost  to  screen each person is  about  $20.   The

Government will subsidise $15 while the resident will  co-pay

$5.   The participating charitable organisations will pay for

those  who cannot afford the co-payment.  The pilot programme

will  involve 10 to 12 divisions in the first phase.  I  hope

MPs will volunteer their divisions for this programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to stress that there is a tremendous

long-term  potential  for this mass  screening  exercise.   I

would put this akin to the mass vaccination of our young.  If

we  can  organise  this  properly, we would  be  taking  full

advantage of Singapore as a small urban, compact society.   I

think  no  other country will be able to embark on a  similar

ambitious  programme such as this.  I hope  over  the  years,

such  screening exercises in our constituencies  will  be  as

regular as our meet-the-people sessions that we conduct every

week.   I  envisage  that  we will be  doing  this  screening

practically  once every two or three weeks and systematically

encourage  all  our senior citizens to go for the  screening.

And  we can help manage the medical conditions for those  who

have these illnesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me go to the next stage of the framework. If,

after the screening, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>

identify  those with health problems, then we would  like  to

encourage  them to be managed by their family doctors  in  an

outpatient  setting.  Most of the health care  needs  of  the

elderly  can, in fact, be met in the outpatient setting.   So

it  is  important  for  people with chronic  illnesses,  like

hypertension and diabetes, to be treated and managed properly

so  that  they  do  not acquire complications,  resulting  in

severe  disabilities.  If we do this well, and if we do  this

systematically, then those who suffer severe disabilities and

require long-term institutional care will be minimised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo urged for more shared care programmes

between  the primary care doctors to jointly manage  patients

with  chronic medical problems with the specialists.  I agree

with  her.   There are some programmes already in place.   We

can encourage both the private and public sectors to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also commented that private GPs should

remain the main providers for primary health.  This is indeed

the  case,  because  at the primary care level,  the  private

sector GPs cater for 80% of primary care needs.  In a rapidly

ageing  population, if we can move the centre of  gravity  of

managing  the  chronic illnesses to the  outpatient  setting,

then I see the role of the primary care providers continuing.

As  I  said  earlier, there is pressure for the primary  care

providers  to upgrade themselves and raise the confidence  of

the general public in their capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do so by better training of the family doctors

through  various  programmes,  like  the  Masters  in  Family

Medicine  and the Diploma in Geriatric Medicine.  If  we  can

upgrade  the  doctors through continuing  medical  education,

then the GPs would be equipped to provide better care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond care in the outpatient setting, both Dr Jennifer

Lee and Dr Tan Cheng Bock raised the issue of home care.   We

also  anticipated this requirement.  Just as in the US  where

the  acute  hospitals will only look after  the  more  severe

cases,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>

there  is  now a general sharing of care through other  step-down  facilities.   In  Singapore, in  fact,  we  are  taking

measures to develop this overall supporting structure.  There

will  be  a community hospital next to every regional general

hospital.    We   are   already   starting   to   build   the

rehabilitation hospital in Tan Tock Seng Hospital and that is

provided  in  the budget for this year.  We have embarked  on

many, many nursing homes.  So I can assure Dr Tan Cheng  Bock

that  the  full range of supporting facilities for  step-down

care is already in place, and the funds are available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how to provide this full continuum to meet the

various  needs,  both from the nursing homes to  the  chronic

sick  to  home  care?  Dr Jennifer Lee has spoken  eloquently

several times on the need for more home care services so that

the  elderly  can  be  cared for in  their  homes.   I  agree

entirely with her that institutional care should be the  last

resort and where we can, we should encourage home care.   But

home  care is a more complicated and a more complex  delivery

system.  Although we are working on it concurrently, I  think

Members will have to bear with us if we take a little  longer

to  develop  this  full  range of home  care  facilities  and

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have six VWOs who provide home care, home

nursing  and home help services for about 6,500 elderly.   My

Ministry  is actively encouraging other VWOs to provide  home

care  services  and  is also currently working  with  another

seven VWOs who have expressed keen interest to do so.  We are

also  currently reviewing the subsidy framework for home care

services  to  ensure that the lower income  group  will  have

access to such services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many GPs, nurses and private hospitals are also

providing  home medical and home nursing care  services.   My

Ministry  will encourage the private sector to reach  out  to

more  elderly  sick  in the homes and  we  will  provide  the

necessary  support  to  facilitate the  development  of  such

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond home care, we must also develop the nursing homes

for the elderly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>

with severe disabilities who cannot be cared at home and must

be  looked  after in an institutional setting.  Recently,  we

announced  the development plan for nursing homes up  to  the

year  2010.   Mr  Yeo Guat Kwang has asked  whether  the  40%

private  sector share for nursing homes is the right balance.

Let me explain the rationale for this decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the VWOs are the main providers of nursing home

services,  providing around two-thirds of the  total  nursing

home  beds.  As the population ages rapidly, I think it would

be  a  tremendous  challenge to find  increasing  numbers  of

volunteers  who are able to raise increasing  sums  of  money

from  the  community each year to run the VWO nursing  homes.

We  therefore need to establish the nursing homes on  a  more

sustainable basis.  The VWOs are charitable organisations and

should  focus  their efforts on the indigent  and  the  poor.

They  should also concentrate on upgrading their professional

capabilities and level of care.  If the VWOs can  look  after

60%  of the nursing home requirement, I would see that  as  a

tremendous achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement the VWOs, my Ministry will set up the

private nursing home market share at 40% by the year 2010, so

as  to provide more options to Singaporeans.  We will step up

the  development of private nursing homes with the  following

measures.  Firstly, we will help the existing operators using

these  buildings  to  secure  longer  tenancies.   This  will

encourage the operators to upgrade their facilities and their

service.   Secondly,  we  encourage  the  private  sector  to

develop  purpose-built nursing homes by tendering  out  sites

for such homes.  At least 10 sites, each sufficient for a 200-bedded nursing home, will be offered by the year 2010.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, of course, monitor and review these plans over

the  next  few years, taking into consideration  the  overall

supply and demand of nursing homes.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key element in this framework is to be able to

make sure that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans   can  afford  such  nursing  home   care.    My

predecessor has announced previously the consideration  of  a

severe  disability insurance to meet the high costs  of  such

long-term care.  We expect to launch this in about two years'

time after we have completed the actuarial study to determine

the appropriate levels of premium and benefits.  Once we have

this  severe  disability insurance scheme, then  Singaporeans

can  save  for  their old age and be covered by insurance  if

they suffer severe disabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee was concerned that by changing the name

of  the  scheme  from "long-term care insurance"  to  "severe

disability  insurance", she reads the nuance as a  diminution

in  the scope of the coverage.  Let me explain that, when  Mr

Yeo  Cheow  Tong announced last year the thinking behind  the

long-term  care insurance, he said that this insurance  would

not   cover   chronic  conditions,  such  as   diabetes   and

hypertension,   which   are  not   severe   disabilities   in

themselves,  but  require  outpatient  treatment.    So   the

intention  all along is to restrict ourselves  to  those  who

have  to  incur a very heavy financial burden as a result  of

severe disabilities.  Members will appreciate that if you are

running an insurance scheme, you want the appropriate pay-out

ratio.   The  more generous you make the pay-out  ratio,  the

higher  the  premiums will be.  That has been our  experience

with  MediShield.  If you have a pay-out ratio of 1:10,  then

you  can  keep the premiums low and everybody can afford  the

premiums.   If  you make the coverage wider and  the  pay-out

ratio  higher, then the premiums will be much higher.  So  we

need  to strike the right balance.  We have changed the  name

to "severe disability insurance" to better reflect the policy

intention and not to reduce the coverage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this sets out the framework of what we intend to

do   for   the  ageing  population.   We  will  continue   to

concentrate on preventive healthcare.  We will undertake this

very  ambitious programme to screen all senior citizens  aged

55  and  above and, over time, to bring it down  to  also  50

years  old, screening once every two years.  Then those  with

medical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>

problems, to manage them in the outpatient setting, and those

with  more  severe disabilities, to allow them to  be  looked

after  both in the home setting as well as the nursing homes.

We  have put in place the financing for the low income group.

They will be subsidised through the Eldercare Fund.  For  the

average Singaporeans, in two years' time, we will set up  the

severe disability insurance so that they can save and pay for

their long-term care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area that I would like to cover is the whole

issue  of affordable healthcare.  This was raised by  Mr  Low

Thia  Khiang, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam and also Dr Tan Cheng Bock.

Mr  J.  B.  Jeyaretnam is not around.  Every time he  is  not

around,  he  does not listen to our answers,  the  next  time

round,  he  will  ask  the same question.   He  asked  for  a

committee   to  be  set  up  to  study  national   healthcare

insurance.   In fact, that committee was set up in  1992  and

the White Paper on affordable healthcare was a result of that

committee.   That  committee  deliberated  and  decided  that

Singapore  would  not  have a national  healthcare  insurance

system,  but  our  system  will cover  the  3Ms  -  Medisave,

MediShield  and Medifund.  Today, our healthcare  expenditure

constitutes approximately 3.1% of our GDP.  So this  is  very

affordable  and  it  is a very good level  of  care  at  very

reasonable  cost.  The national healthcare expenditure  means

the  total expenditure by the country, people, employers  and

the Government.  If you look at the household expenditure  on

healthcare  alone, it is only 2.5% of household  expenditure.

Individual households spend on an average 2.5% on healthcare.

This is again very affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have done so because of this very sound 3M

financing framework - Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.  For

Medisave, 84% of our people have Medisave accounts.  This  is

a very high percentage.  But I think we can do more.  We will

want  as  many  as possible to have Medisave  accounts.   71%

today are covered by MediShield, insurance or its equivalent.

This is again a very high level

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>

of  medical insurance.  So instead of the national healthcare

insurance  that Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam talked about,  first,  we

ask people to save through Medisave and then we put people on

to  MediShield and equivalent catastrophic insurance schemes.

And  71% of our people are covered by MediShield.  For  those

who  cannot afford to pay their bills, they can apply through

the   Medifund  for  assistance.   Last  year,  97%  of   all

applications for Medifund was approved.  In the FY99  budget,

the  Government has topped up the Medifund by  an  additional

$100 million, bringing the total now to $700 million.  So our

healthcare financing scheme is very robust and helps keep our

healthcare costs down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked for a breakdown in the cost.

Every patient who goes to the hospital gets this breakdown in

cost,  systematically setting out how much it costs  to  look

after him, whether he is a C or B2 class patient and what  he

has  to pay and what is the Government subvention.  A typical

hospital  bill for a C class patient is less than  $700.   We

track  this all the time.  And the Government subsidises  80%

of the total cost.  So the breakdown of the cost is given for

every bill that every patient gets from the hospital.   So  I

do not quite understand what Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam wants when he

asked for a breakdown.  It happens all the time in every case

in hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also touch on the implementation of the casemix

and  some of the issues raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock.   He  is

concerned that casemix may lead to premature discharge and  a

poorer  quality  of care.  First, let me state  that  casemix

does not dictate to the doctors in all the hospitals how they

should  manage their patients, nor does it help hospitals  or

clinicians decide when to discharge the patients.  As always,

the   patient   shall  only  be  discharged  when   medically

appropriate.  Casemix is only classified after the patient is

discharged.   So the whole professional system will  continue

to   look  after  the  patient  as  before,  based  on  their

professional  judgement.  And the whole issue  of  subvention

and classification only takes place after the discharge.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock gave the example of outlier cases.

Let  me  try  to explain this to the House.  Casemix  assumes

certain  standard  cases,  say,  for  example,  the  case  of

appendicitis  that  Dr Tan mentioned.  In  general  standard,

typical  cases, it will take about four days and  the  person

will  be  well enough to be discharged.  If the case is  more

complex  and  requires seven days for  him  to  stay  in  the

hospital,  the doctors will continue to keep the patient  for

seven  days  in  the  hospital.  At  the  end,  when  he  has

recovered, he will be discharged based on the decision of the

doctors.  In the subvention for the subsidies, the Government

will  pay  to  the hospitals the four-day standard  rate  for

appendicitis, in this example.  And for the three days extra,

the  Government will continue to pay the hospital a  per  day

rate.   So it is not true that the hospital is under pressure

to  discharge the patient because he wants to stay under  the

four-day  standard  rate.   If it is  an  outlier  case,  the

Government will continue to pay both the standard  rate  plus

the  extra days on a per day basis.  So I want to assure  the

House  that  the casemix system will not result in  premature

discharge of the patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock is absolutely right about this shift

in  the  management  of patients because  we  recognise  that

hospitals  are  very expensive institutions and  they  should

concentrate on acute care.  As can be seen in many  developed

countries  and  also, in Singapore, there is a trend  towards

day  surgery, and there is a trend towards step down care and

there  is  a  trend  towards recovery in other  institutions,

other  than the acute hospitals.  As I mentioned earlier,  we

have to set up this full range of supporting facilities so as

to accommodate this shift in looking after the patient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also address Mr Low Thia Khiang's point about the

quality  of care in our hospitals.  I can assure him that  we

are able to achieve very good quality healthcare in Singapore

at  affordable prices, both to the individual as well  as  to

the  country  as a whole, and this is not at the  expense  of

quality.   When we audit the hospitals, we look at  four  key

parameters.  First, accessibility, to make sure that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>

everybody  has full access to the services and facilities  in

the  hospitals, and nobody is turned away because  he  cannot

afford to pay.  Second, the charges are affordable.  We track

the  total  bill size.  We track the cost to the patient  for

the  different  ward classes.  Third, we track  the  clinical

outcomes of all the major operations in the hospital.  So  it

is  not good enough that you can go into a hospital, the cost

is  affordable, we also track the clinical outcomes that when

you  go  in  for a particular ailment, you come out  properly

cured.   The clinical outcomes are rated with other reputable

hospitals  around  the world.  Fourth, we check  the  service

quality - how the staff deals with the public, whether it  is

the  waiting  time,  courtesy,  the  whole  range  of  PS  21

parameters that we also set for our hospitals.  We do monitor

the performance of our hospitals in a very rigorous way.   We

are  mindful  that we want to ensure good quality  affordable

healthcare  to Singaporeans, and not just look at the  bottom

line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even though the patient load has gone up, the

hospital  manpower may not have gone up as  much  because  of

productivity and efficiency.  But as I said earlier, we  must

keep our fair share of doctors, nurses and the whole array of

people  to  run the hospitals, and we must continue  to  keep

pace  with the market remuneration.  This means the  cost  to

the  hospitals will go up.  The Government will bear its fair

share  of these cost increases through higher subventions  to

the  hospitals.  But the public must also pay for their share

of the increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare is an expensive business because 60% of

healthcare is in manpower cost.  It is not possible for us to

ask the doctors and nurses to give us good quality healthcare

and expect them not to receive their fair salary.  We have to

continue  to give them a fair remuneration and that means  we

expect 60% of our cost to be increased every year.  Drugs are

also very expensive.  They constitute 10% of our cost and  we

must expect to deal with better drugs, new medical technology

and  Singaporeans' expectations that they get the  new  drugs

which are available in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>

market.  So there is an increasing pressure on cost.  We will

manage  it  well.  But at the same time, as I mentioned,  the

healthcare  burden on Singaporeans is manageable  because  of

the medical financing that we have put in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to ask my Parliamentary Secretary

to take over and answer the specific questions.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Sir, both Mr Low Thia Khiang, as well as

Mr  Peh  Chin  Hua, mentioned A&E services and  long  waiting

time,  quoting  some people having to wait  for  one  or  two

hours.   I  would like to say that in A&E, we aim  to  triage

patients within five to ten minutes of their arrival.   After

triage, patients are treated based on how serious his medical

emergency is, not on a first-come-first-served basis. We  can

assure  Mr  Low,  as  well as Mr Peh, that  all  the  genuine

emergency cases are given treatment in good time. The average

waiting  time in A&E is perhaps long, because we continue  to

have  plenty of non-emergency cases coming to A&E Department.

We  certainly agree with Mr Peh Chin Hua that to the  friends

and  relatives of some patients, everything is an  emergency,

perhaps because of lack of knowledge. That is why we have  to

continue  to  mount  public education exercise  to  tell  the

public how to identify emergency situation and where to bring

the  patients to if it is a non-emergency case.   As  Members

also  know, we have a two-tier system of charging people  who

come  to  A&E Department, higher charge for the non-emergency

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua is also concerned about eye problems

among  our  population,  citing  myopia,  cataract,  diabetic

retinopathy,  as well as glaucoma. Yes, we agree  that  these

are  all  serious  concerns  and  problems.  The  last  three

conditions, cataract, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma,  are

related  to an ageing population. The strategy to  deal  with

such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>

conditions  really is "prevention is better  than  cure".  We

will look into organising more screening activities to try to

identify  such conditions early, so that early treatment  can

follow.   Myopia,  on the other hand, is  a  serious  problem

amongst  our  younger  generation as  Mr  Peh  Chin  Hua  has

mentioned,  citing  some  very  pertinent  statistics.    One

problem  is that it has got so prevalent that I know of  many

parents, when their children start wearing glasses,  they  do

not feel sufficiently upset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will try to intensify public education programme in

order  to  persuade  members of the  family  to  pay  serious

attention  to  this  problem. We will also mount  educational

programmes in schools and for parents on proper lighting,  as

well  as  proper  inculcation of good reading  habits.   Some

schools  have even introduced eye exercises. We will also  be

embarking   on  a  national  myopia  programme  to   increase

awareness of myopia amongst all Singaporeans, to educate them

on the preventive measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as research on eye problems is concerned, we

would  like to assure Mr Peh that this is indeed a  priority.

In  fact,  it  is so important that in 1997, we  set  up  the

Singapore  Eye  Research Institute (SERI) to  function  as  a

research  arm of the Singapore National Eye Centre.  We  have

not  been  stingy  on  funding  for  research.  To-date,  the

National  Medical Research Council has committed $27  million

to  various  subjects of eye research. This amount  has  been

committed  but it may not have been spent yet.  As you  know,

the money is spent as and when the research is introduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo mentioned asthma amongst children. Yes, we

consider  this as an important medical concern.  In terms  of

death  rate  from asthma in Singapore, it is  not  abnormally

higher  than those in the developed countries. However,  over

the  years,  various initiatives have been put in place.  The

School  Health Service currently screens all students  during

their  annual check-ups for their suggestive history or signs

of asthma and refer them for treatment where appropriate. KKH

has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>

also  conducted workshops to train PE teachers on what to  do

in the event that some of the students suffer an acute asthma

attack in school.  Standards of asthma care for children have

also  been  set  with  the  development  and  publication  of

clinical practice guidelines for the management of paediatric

asthma.   A number of hospitals, including KKH and SGH,  have

established  shared-care programme with GPs that  will  allow

complicated  cases of asthma to receive specialist  attention

early.   Currently, the School Health Service,  KKH  and  the

Asthma Association of Singapore are working with the Ministry

of  Education on a scheme to equip all schools with  inhalers

and spacers for emergency use by students who are known to be

asthmatic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee mentioned IT and the potential of

exploiting  IT  for professional exchanges, as  well  as  for

teaching.   We  would like to assure Mr Ee  that  doctors  in

Singapore today have global access to information on state-of-the-art  medical  treatment  and  knowledge  through  various

means.   Mr Gerard Ee also mentioned Internet.  In  fact,  he

would  agree  that our doctors are very Internet  savvy.   In

addition  to Internet, our doctors have also been  active  in

participating  in  local,  as well as  international  medical

conferences,  and that includes tele-conferences  to  discuss

with  their  colleagues on the medical treatment of  patients

and  all  these are done regionally, some are done  globally.

Some of our hospitals have, in fact, established professional

links  with renowned medical centres overseas, such  as  Mayo

Clinic,  Stanford  and Johns Hopkins in  the  United  States.

Suffice to say that there are really a lot of initiatives  in

these  areas. I think we should allow the enthusiasm and  the

initiatives to take its course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our health administration here has also been

very  active in exploiting IT for health administration,  and

in  the  use  of  info-communications technology  to  capture

patients' records for use within the hospitals. The  Ministry

has   set  out  to  develop  a  National  Info-communications

Masterplan for Health.  The concept is being studied with the

medical community, not only for the public sector, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>

also with private hospitals.  Universities, IT vendors and so

on  have  all been invited to give input on what they  expect

out of this Info-communications Masterplan.  Of course, there

are  quite a lot of professional and ethical issues involved.

We  will examine these carefully when we establish the  Info-communications Masterplan.  But suffice to say that Mr Gerard

Ee's suggestion of using IT is something that we share.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Chan, just to remind you that

we have another amendment to take.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> If that is the case, I will just

address Dr Vasoo's point of patients coming to hospitals  not

carrying documents with them, and as a result, have no  money

to  pay for the deposit, and unable to be admitted.  I  would

like  to say that all hospitals are required by law to  admit

all  emergency cases. They are supposed to treat  them  first

and  talk  about  administration and money  later.   This  is

provided  for  in the law.  As for the case of  the  Filipina

lady, investigation is in progress.  We would like to get  to

the  bottom  of  the matter.  But since investigation  is  in

progress,  I think we should leave things as it  is  for  the

time being.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to seek a clarification

from  the  Minister. Earlier on, the Minister said  that  the

long-term  disability  insurance  would  not  cover   chronic

diseases.  May I ask the Minister: are we not leaving a crack

in  our  financing  system in medical  care  because  chronic

disease  sufferers  in the future will  be  flocking  to  our

hospitals as these are places where they can get paid through

Medifund, Medisave and Medicare?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Hiang:</b> Sir, my Parliamentary Secretary also

left  out the answer to Mr Gerard Ee on the hospital of hope.

I  will take this up first.  We thank him for his suggestion,

but  I think it is too ambitious a programme for us to embark

on. We do have today research programmes, experimental drugs,

experimental  treatments  that  people  who  may  not   avail

themselves of standard treatment can go for. But to expand it

hospital of hope is too huge a programme for us to undertake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Dr Lily Neo's point about chronic illnesses, we

will  keep  an open mind. I just want to lay out the  general

principles. When we start talking about insurance,  there  is

trade-off  between  premiums and  pay-outs.   The  wider  the

coverage,  the  more pay-outs.  If we include  all  kinds  of

chronic illnesses, then you must expect a very high level  of

insurance premiums. Just to give you an example.  In Germany,

they  have a similar long-term care insurance.  For them,  it

means  every worker setting aside 1% of his salary  from  the

day he starts work until 65. That money that he saves becomes

the  premium to pay for long-term care insurance. That is the

kind of money we are talking about.  The more you are able to

narrow  the  pay-outs, the more affordable the  premiums.  We

keep  an  open  mind.  We would like  to  cover  as  wide  as

possible, but insurance means that somebody in the end  would

have to pay.  Our experience with MediShield is that the more

narrow  you  can  keep the pay-out, the more affordable,  and

therefore the easier it is for you to encourage everybody  to

buy into the programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have two minutes left on this

amendment. Dr Tan, make your clarification quickly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I just want to clarify with the

Minister  about the funding of outliers.  He said  that  they

would  be  funded. I agree that they would be funded  but  at

what level.  Is it below the level of the running cost of the

hospital?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me just say that the bottomline

is  that we are subventing the hospital at the same level  as

we  did before.  It is just how we manage it. For example, if

you  discharge your patient earlier, if his medical condition

is  so  good that he is discharged in 3.7 days, we still  pay

you 4 days because it is the standard rate.  If you discharge

him  in 7 days, we will pay you 4 days plus 3 days per  diem,

on a per day basis. That is the formula.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I think the Parliamentary

Secretary should have one minute to answer my question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> He has less than one minute.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, as regards kidney patients, there

are two key priorities.  First, public education so that more

adopt  healthy lifestyle.  Second, encourage more  people  to

donate  kidneys, because kidney transplant is the fundamental

way  of solving the problem.  I have pledged to donate  mine.

Maybe you want to join me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chen, do you like to withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Chiam. There are

four minutes left.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code PA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just like to touch on admission fees of

Government and restructured hospitals.  Although the Minister

has said that medical cost is affordable and also accessible,

my  feedback  is  that some residents in my constituency  say

that  when  they  want to get admitted into a  hospital,  the

staff  insist  that  they  pay the full  cost  for  both  the

operation  and the ward charges.  I do not know  whether  the

hospital  staff  are  over enthusiastic in  collecting  money

first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand why they want to collect the money

first.  They want to make sure that all the services rendered

are fully paid.  But this may cause some problems to the poor

people,  because they are suffering and they  may  be  turned

away.   They  are turned away in the sense that the  officers

insist that they pay and they feel bad that they cannot  pay.

So in that sense, they are turned away, and they may really

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>

suffer.   As  far as I know, there are no reported  cases  of

Government  or restructured hospitals turning patients  away.

But the case mentioned by Members of Mount Elizabeth Hospital

turning   away  a  Filipino  lady  in  a  state  of  advanced

pregnancy,   just because she could not pay, she  was  turned

away.   Soon  after,  she gave birth in the  toilet  and,  in

despair,  she  put the baby in the toilet bowl.  Fortunately,

the baby cried.  A nurse heard the cry and saved the baby.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, are you expecting a reply,

because we are running out of time?  I think you should allow

the Minister to reply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I heard from the Parliamentary

Secretary that investigations are going on in this matter.  I

think  the woman will be charged for attempted murder, but  I

think  the  hospital is equally responsible and  they  should

answer for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, let us get the facts right.

First,  as  my  Parliamentary Secretary said,  for  emergency

cases,  the  hospitals,  under the law,  have  to  treat  the

patient first and deal with the payment administration later.

And  we  will deal with the investigation of this  particular

case.   For  the hospitalisation that Mr Chiam talked  about,

nobody  is  turned away in Singapore hospitals  if  he  is  a

Singapore citizen for inability to pay. If a person tells the

hospital  that he wants to be admitted to a C or B2 ward,  he

does   not  even  need  to  put a deposit.   Lawyers  collect

deposit   from  their  clients.   Hospitals  do  not  collect

deposits from their patients when patients turn up for B2 and

C wards.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I do not wish to go into an

argument  with  the Minister.  I beg leave  to  withdraw  the

amendment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Asia-Pacific has gone through a severe economic

crisis.   It  was like being on an endless roller coaster  of

political  upheavals.   New  fault  lines  have  opened   up.

Primordial forces of race and religions have been unleashed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, people are hungry, people are

unemployed,  and  people are restless.  Developments  in  the

past year have been unsettling and discomforting, to say  the

least.   Though  the situation has somewhat  stabilised,  the

problems  are  by  no  means over.  We must  continue  to  be

vigilant and on our guard, and not be overcome by surprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Michael Howard, a well-known military

historian, states that when there is a lull and all is quiet,

we  must  all  the  more expect the unexpected.   Events  may

suddenly  take a nasty turn for the worse.  We must hope  for

the  best, but prepare for the worst, and not be taken by any

surprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when some people thought that they

could  just walk in and walk over us.  Now, there is a strong

SAF  with the necessary firepower and mobility.  We are fully

committed   to  strengthening  and  upgrading   our   defence

capabilities, as without a strong and invincible  SAF,  there

will  not  be  a Singapore.  There will not be an independent

and sovereign Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence budget is $7.4 billion, amounting to 25.6%

of the total budget allocation for expenditures.  It is 4.48%

of  our  GDP,  still  way below the 6% cap  of  the  GDP  for

defence, set voluntarily by the Government some years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the GPC for Defence and Foreign Affairs

fully  supports the defence budget.  We hope it is sufficient

for  the needs of the SAF.  Our only worry is that it may not

be enough.  So, please let us know if it is not enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we are prepared to support a bigger defence

budget, we want good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>

value  for the dollars we put into defence.  Money should  be

well spent.  Our defence dollars must work for us.  Usage  of

land  and  facilities should be optimised and weapon  systems

wisely selected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wise management and fearless commanders, the SAF

will definitely be a force to be reckoned with.  The strategy

of deterrence, coupled with a balance of power in the region,

will  help  protect and preserve our national interests.   We

will  then  have  peace and security to pursue  our  economic

interests and development.  In this context, I would like  to

ask  the Minister if the SAF is operationally ready to  deter

and, if necessary, destroy any would-be aggressor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we go for strong defence capabilities, and

anchor ourselves in the strategy of deterrence, we should, at

the  same  time,  use  other instruments of  geopolitics  and

diplomacy.   We  should  make use of the  balance  of  power,

encouraging  more  big powers like the United  States  to  be

actively   engaged  in  the  region,  promote   multi-lateral

security   arrangements,   like  the   Five   Power   Defence

Arrangements (FPDA), engage in security dialogue through  the

ASEAN Regional Forum, pursue confidence and security building

measures,  and  work  on  preventive diplomacy  and  conflict

resolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also be aware that the security landscape is

ever  changing and shifting, and there could be a variety  of

threat  scenarios.   Such threats include terrorist  attacks,

subversion,  competition for vital resources like  water  and

oil,  biological and chemical warfare, and even cyber attack.

May  I  ask the Minister if Mindef is prepared and  ready  to

counter such unconventional threats?

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the years 1997 to

1999  were  good years for the SAF.  It brought home  to  the

people of Singapore the sobering truth on the vitality of the

region and the importance of a strong, credible SAF.  The SAF

enjoys  tremendous support among our people.  It is important

that  the  SAF  continues  to  remain  vigilant  and  further

strengthen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>

Singapore's defence capability to protect the sovereignty  of

the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional security situation remains uncertain.

China  continues to rely on threats and plans  to  use  armed

force  to  limit Taiwan's behaviour.  Tensions on the  Korean

peninsula still continue.  The multiple claims to the islands

in  the region still remain unresolved and skirmishes surface

intermittently.   The nuclear arms race is on in South Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US-Japan alliance is still the cornerstone of US

strategy  for the region.  It has been a cardinal  policy  of

our  Government  to  keep the US engaged  militarily  in  the

region,  as  a balancing force.  However, an article  in  the

International  Herald Tribune, which is  carried  in  today's

Straits  Times,  highlights  that  the  US  will  reduce  its

military profile in the Asia-Pacific.  Admiral Dennis  Blair,

Commander-in-Chief of the US forces in the  region,  outlined

the  US  military's new approach to Asia and the  Pacific  by

stating  that  the US intends to achieve this by  encouraging

local armed forces to work more closely together and to  take

the lead in any regional crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the DPM to share with the House

the strategic situation in the region and, in particular, the

US  defence  policy in the region.  Is the  new  US  military

policy  for  Asia-Pacific the beginning of  the  end  for  US

commitment to the region?  Are we doing enough to keep the US

engaged in the region?  How could we respond to this  new  US

policy  by  participating in more regional military exercises

which  are  aimed at creating better understanding  and  help

bring  the armed forces in the region together?  Could  these

regional  military exercises be the harbinger  for  a  future

regional military apparatus to be created in the region?  And

could  it  lead to a future regional military alliance  among

the neighbouring countries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the DPM share Mindef's policies and view on

these matters?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, much to our relief,

the relationship among the United States, China and Japan   - three  countries which hold the key to the security  of  East

Asia and South East Asia

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>

-   has stabilised.  A small state like Singapore may seem to

be at the receiving end of this triangular relationship.  But

we  really do not have to and must not allow ourselves to  be

just  a  small  pawn  in  a  big-power  game.   Through   our

relationship with these three countries and  other  countries

in  the  region,  we  have been training to  help  create  an

environment of peace and stability.  Can the Minister  inform

us  how  this  approach has helped advance our interests  and

security?   How  has  our defence relation with  neighbouring

countries developed over the past one year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the overall security situation in East Asia has

stabilised,  what  about the situation  in  South  East  Asia

following  the  economic  crisis and  intensified  separatist

movements in areas like Aceh in Indonesia?  Then there is the

potential  flash  point in the South China Sea.   While  much

attention  has  been  given to the cross-strait  relationship

between  China  and  Taiwan, or North  Korea,  or  especially

Indonesia,  what  about the situation in  South  Asia,  where

India and Pakistan have both tested nuclear weapons?  Can the

Minister  give  his  assessment  on  these  matters  and  the

possible impact on us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Singaporeans appreciate the Government policy

on  defence  spending, especially in the last two years  when

there  were  economic, social and political turmoil  in  many

countries  around us.  The policy to cap defence spending  at

6%  irrespective of our economic situation is appreciated, as

the   defence  policy  has  brought  about  confidence  among

Singaporeans  of their own security and among  investors  who

put  in  their money here.  We have invested much in  defence

technology and equipment.  What about staff development?  Are

our defence forces able to recruit and retain the good people

that they must have?

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the security framework

of Singapore includes not only the Singapore Armed Forces but

also  bilateral and multi-lateral arrangements with countries

in the region and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>

possibly  strategic  partners  in  the  world.   In   defence

spending, one would say that the SAF has over the years built

up  substantial  capability, and  this  capability  has  been

broadly recognised by many as one that is seriously credible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one would have it, we have built up a credible SAF in

the  hope that our soldiers would never have to fire  a  shot

against  another  in  anger.   In  order  to  minimise   this

possibility, it is important that we recognise  the  goal  of

bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation with other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have developed our broader security

framework  well.  For instance, at a multi-lateral level,  we

have   continuously  strengthened  and   worked   with   such

arrangements  as the Five Power Defence Arrangements  (FPDA).

The  FPDA  is  the longest standing multi-lateral arrangement

and  has  provided for the defence of Singapore and  Malaysia

since  1971.   One  does not deny that FPDA  has  contributed

quite substantially to the region's security architecture and

the region's business stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of our efforts at promoting the

international  framework to strengthen security  interest  is

the  ASEAN  Regional Forum.  This vehicle  promotes  regional

peace  and  stability.   At the moment,  although  the  ASEAN

Regional  Forum  is not akin to that which  is  available  in

Europe,  it  has nonetheless started out on the right premise

which  commits  the parties to the appropriate dialogues  and

discussions to resolve outstanding security issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from multi-lateral arrangements, Singapore has

been  engaged  in  bilateral ties with our  neighbours.   For

instance,  Singapore  has  very  strong  defence  ties   with

Malaysia and Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must recognise that bilateral and multi-lateral

defence  cooperations  are  essentially  confidence  building

measures  that help countries in the region resolve  disputes

through  peaceful  means and also to seek  regional  security

cooperation  to  achieve  common  strategic  interests.    By

providing a platform for alliance, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>

bilateral  ties  and  multi-lateral  arrangements  allow  the

respective  countries  to develop cooperative  programmes  to

complement rather than to compete with each other.  In  order

to  achieve  this, there must be a certain amount  of  inter-operability  of the armed forces.  To this end,  the  parties

would  need to cooperate with one another better as  alliance

partners.    It  is  obvious  therefore  that  by   promoting

bilateral   and  multi-lateral  arrangements   with   foreign

countries,  we  are  providing  a  framework  towards  better

cooperation  and  understanding at the  armed  forces  level.

Hopefully,  this would pave the way for resolving differences

by  peaceful settlement rather than to resort to  war  as  an

alternative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note that the multi-lateral security dialogues

and  cooperation  of  defence establishments  in  the  region

remain a relatively undeveloped area. With various forums, we

have  varying degrees of success. For instance, our ties with

the Malaysians have been relegated to the backwaters for now.

We  should  continue with pursuing closer cooperation.   Such

ties  and  cooperation would pave the way towards a reduction

of  suspicion of one another, which will be the case,  if  we

had no cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, Sir, whether the

Government  would  pursue this area of bilateral  and  multi-lateral defence cooperation as actively as we have been  able

to build our defence capabilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the Five Power Defence Arrangements

(FPDA)  did not conduct the Stardex air and sea exercises  in

1998. The joint military exercises resumed in the South China

sea  in  1999.  But the Malaysians had restricted the use  of

their  air  space during the exercise so much that during  an

accident  the  training  forces  had  to  apply  and   obtain

permission  from  the  Malaysian  authorities  for  emergency

rescue  cooperation.  The Malaysians had also indicated  that

in 1998 they would reassess their membership of the FPDA in a

defence review by mid-1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the FPDA is not a NATO-like military alliance. It

is a regional security treaty

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>

linking Britain with Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, and  New

Zealand. The FPDA only requires the three western nations  to

consult with the two ASEAN Members should they be subject  to

attack.   There is no automatic commitment to come  to  their

aid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned as the FPDA, being a loose regional

security  alliance, requires total commitment  from  all  its

signatories for it to be credible and a sound deterrent.  The

natural  question that arises is whether all the  signatories

are  serious about their commitment to the FPDA.   Could  the

DPM  please  update us on the developments in  the  FPDA  and

whether the defence arrangement still has a critical role  to

play  in the defence of Singapore?  I would also like to  ask

the   DPM  for  his  assessment  on  the  commitment  of  the

Malaysians to the FPDA.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, from time to time, there are

reported incidents of piracy in the seas around us.  They are

not  just a nuisance, but also a threat to shipping  and  the

orderly conduct of trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the problem of illegal immigrants coming

by sea or waves of refugees sailing in and attempting to come

ashore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a sea port. It is situated at the hub or

crossroads of Southeast Asia.  Through our port, we export as

well  as  import materials and essential food supplies.   The

sea  lanes  to  and  from Singapore, and  through  the  vital

Straits of Malacca, are not only our livelihood, but also our

life-lines.   We  must  keep the sea lanes  of  communication

open.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what measures are being taken to

tackle   the  problem  of  piracy,  illegal  immigrants   and

potential  refugees, and if the SAF is able  to  secure,  and

ensure, that the sea lanes of communications are kept open at

all times for trade and essential supplies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, most of the points

that I had intended to raise have already been said by Dr Ong

Chit Chung.  I will therefore not repeat them, other than  to

state that the problem of piracy is a regional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>

problem.   It  requires  the  coordinated  effort   and   the

cooperation  of regional countries in order to  address  this

problem.   Could the Minister tell us if there has  been  any

collaboration with the regional armed forces to eliminate  or

at least to control piracy in our regional waters?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, in certain scenarios, instead

of  big predators, there could be sharp and pin-point attacks

by  terrorist groups.  And terrorist attacks could happen  at

any time, any place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that in March 1991, four Pakistani terrorists

hijacked  Singapore Airlines flight SQ 117 flying from  Kuala

Lumpur   to   Singapore.   They  issued  an  ultimatum    and

threatened  to kill the passengers one by one.   Fortunately,

the  SAF commandos successfully stormed the place, killed the

hijackers  and freed all passengers.  And years  earlier,  if

Members remember, in 1974, there was the hijack of the  ferry

boat,  the Laju.  Indeed, President S.R. Nathan was  involved

in  this  rescue exercise successfully.  I therefore wish  to

ask  the Minister whether we are ready and able to deal  with

any terrorist attack, at any time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the suspension

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, in today's issue of the Straits

Times,  there is a report about the arrest by the Philippines

Police of two suspected foreign terrorists with links to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>

Moro  liberation organisation.  According to the report,  the

police  authorities  believed that  international  terrorists

were  using the Philippines as a training ground,  with  some

Moro  rebel  leaders  acting as hosts and  getting  technical

knowledge in modern urban warfare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent times, there have been incidences of hijacking

of airplanes in the Indian subcontinent, raising much concern

about  the security of travelling by air and airport security

in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to home, arms are easily available in some high

tension  areas in Indonesia, particularly in East  Timor  and

its neighbouring areas and in Aceh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is, are our defence forces ready and capable

in  handling  the  possibility of terrorist  attacks  at  our

airports  and the hijacking of airplanes?  Would the Minister

inform  the  House  about  our  capability  in  handling  the

potential attacks by terrorists?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, as a small nation, with limited

resources and manpower, we cannot count on mass in numbers to

overwhelm  the  potential enemy.  In  any  case,  it  is  the

skills, the firepower, and the mobility that matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our critical mass has to be in technology. It is the

cutting edge of technology that will give us a cut above  the

rest,  ensure our competitive advantage, and win the war  for

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was always the danger that the generals were

fighting  the  last  war.  On the eve of World  War  II,  for

example,  the Polish Army still had the horse cavalry,  which

was, of course, no match for the German tanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same today, even more so with the galloping

pace  of  advancing  technology,  which  made  equipment  and

doctrines  fast becoming obsolete.  So fast is  the  pace  of

change that there is now a revolution in military affairs  or

some call it RMA.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This revolution encompasses electronic information

system,  advanced  information technology,  precision  strike

technologies,  stealth technology, unmanned  technology,  and

cyber warfare, just to name a few.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if the SAF is keeping

track of the changing nature of warfare and is on top of  the

revolution in military affairs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Sir, I thank the Members of Parliament

for  their  comments  and I will endeavour  to  answer  their

questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our economic growth has rebounded strongly and we

can all look forward to more growth this year.  There will be

challenges, and there will be opportunities.  It is up to  us

to  meet the challenges and to seize the opportunities.   The

speed  of  change  is  quite awesome and  we  shall  have  to

continue to try to ride the changes to our advantage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our efforts to achieve our vision of a best home for

Singaporeans,  we  must  never forget  that  our  most  basic

requirement  is  security.  For the past 35 years,  Singapore

has  grown and prospered because we have peace and stability.

Singaporeans  know that they have a safe home, and  investors

know  that  it  is  safe  to invest here.   Singaporeans  and

foreign investors alike know that the Government is committed

to  investing in a defence capability to ensure the  security

of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our firm commitment to defence must continue. If there

is  one thing that the exciting events in our region over the

past few years have taught us, it is that we would be wise to

be  vigilant  and  prepared so that we  can  confidently  and

effectively deal with any negative fallout from economic  and

political developments elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also learnt how quickly things can take a turn

for  the  worse;  in  fact, things can  practically  unravel,

without any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>

warning  - I think a point made very cogently by Dr Ong  Chit

Chung.   And  when the situation turns bad, we have  seen  in

recent years how quickly a country can deteriorate, but  also

how quickly a country emerges from a crisis situation depends

on  how solid its foundations are and what is the attitude of

its people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While almost all Asian countries are today well on their

way to economic recovery, there is greater uncertainty in the

regional security environment - a point emphasised by Dr  Ong

Chit  Chung  and  Mr  Ravindran.  There are  still  areas  of

political  and social instability and a number of potentially

destabilising  issues remain unresolved.   Examples  are  the

Korean  Peninsula, the Taiwan Strait and the Spratlys.   Time

and time again over the past few years, we have seen just how

quickly  such  disputes could trigger  tension  and  threaten

security and regional stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would not be wrong to say that all nations today

desire peace and stability, and understand the importance  of

co-operating  for  mutual benefit.  Unfortunately,  it  would

also  not  be wrong to say that while we all hope and  strive

for peace, conflicts and tensions are very much unfortunately

a  fact  of  life.  As a small and young nation, it  is  only

prudent for Singaporeans to ensure that we continue to have a

defence  capability that is able to protect our  sovereignty,

territorial integrity and Singapore's national interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 35 years, we have done well in developing

the   SAF   into   a  well-trained,  highly   motivated   and

technologically   advanced  armed   force.    The   SAF   has

safeguarded  our security and given Singapore  more  room  to

adopt policies and take actions which best serve our national

interests.  Without the SAF, Singapore may not have been able

to  remain  the oasis of calm that we have been,  amidst  the

turbulence  and  tensions in the region particularly  in  the

past few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the SAF was not built up overnight. The

professional force that we see today is the result  of  years

of consistent effort and commitment - in training people,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>

developing doctrines and investing in capabilities.   It  has

long been our policy to cap our defence spending at 6% of our

GDP  and  maintain this in a steady manner.  This policy  has

served us well as it allows the SAF to take a long-term  view

of  its  capability development programmes and  to  structure

them  in  the most efficient manner.  Defence technology  and

doctrines  are  constantly evolving.   We  must  continue  to

maintain  a suitable level of defence spending each  year  to

ensure  that  the  SAF  stands ready  to  meet  any  security

challenges.   In  doing  so, we are  saying  to  our  people:

Singapore  will  remain  a  secure  home  for  you  and  your

children.   We are saying to our investors:  You  can  safely

put  your money in Singapore because it will remain a  stable

and secure place for your business.  And we are saying to any

potential aggressors:  Singaporeans are vigilant and prepared

to  defend our country against any threats to our sovereignty

and our vital national interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of our commitment and efforts, the SAF

is today a balanced, integrated and operationally ready armed

forces.   The  punch of the SAF comes not from its  size  but

from its ability to fight as an integrated whole that is more

powerful  than  the  sum  of  its  individual  parts.    Many

established armed forces recognise the professional standards

of the SAF and they are keen to exercise and train with us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to the point about technology in defence

which  has been raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung.  Looking  ahead,

the  advances in technology in the 21st century  will  confer

new  advantages  to  a  small  armed  forces  like  the  SAF.

Traditionally, victory in combat depended on the  ability  to

mobilise, deploy and utilise larger divisions or naval or air

fleets.  Skills certainly counted but numbers were decisive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, technology is changing that balance. The

incorporation  of  advanced technology in weapon  systems  is

enabling military forces to see the battlefield more clearly,

make better informed decisions in a timely manner, and strike

with more deadly accuracy, from greater distances

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>

than ever before.  The upshot is that in war, having superior

numbers  is  no  longer  enough.  What  is  required  is  the

capability  to  integrate platforms into a unified,  flexible

and  effective fighting system.  The side that can  make  the

best  use  of technology will have the edge.  The implication

is  that  even a small country, like Singapore, can tilt  the

odds  in  its favour if it can make smarter use of technology

than its opponents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is well placed to exploit technology. Many of

those   going  into  National  Service  have  the   education

standards  to be quickly and effectively trained  to  operate

high-tech weapons and equipment.  60% of each cohort  has  at

least  A-level  or Polytechnic qualifications.   The  SAF  is

constantly exploiting the opportunities presented by advances

in  technology.  This goes beyond merely buying more advanced

weapon  systems.   It also means being able  to  exploit  the

hardware  to  the  fullest  by constantly  improving  on  our

organisation, doctrines and training to keep the  SAF  highly

capable.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef will continue with our two-pronged approach to

strengthen  our technological base.  Besides  building  up  a

strong  indigenous defence technology capability to meet  the

SAF's  requirements,  we  will also continue  to  expand  our

international   linkages  and  strategic  partnerships   with

foreign  armed forces and research bodies.  With the  setting

up  of  the Defence Science and Technology Agency (or  DSTA),

which  comes into effect tomorrow, we will be able to respond

more  quickly and flexibly to technological changes, as  well

as  to  transcend our manpower limitations by  leveraging  on

external  engineering expertise from either local or overseas

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But advanced weapon systems by themselves cannot win a

war.   It  is people who win the war.  And we must have  good

soldiers  who  can  make good use of these  high-tech  weapon

systems  to  the SAF's best advantage.  Mindef has  therefore

always given priority to the recruitment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>

and  retention  of good people in the SAF.  And  I  thank  Mr

Hawazi  Daipi for pointing this out.  We launched a  manpower

management  initiative in 1998, called "The New  Partnership"

for  the  SAF  officers corps.  The New Partnership  aims  to

provide  a  first  class career that is both challenging  and

rewarding.  The New Partnership programme included changes to

the career structure, remuneration package, career management

and  performance management of the officers.   These  changes

have now been fully implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, we announced the New Partnership

for Warrant Officers and Specialists who form the backbone of

the  SAF.   Under  this initiative, the Warrant  Officer  and

Specialist  career  structure will be restructured  into  two

parts.   The  Specialist stage covers the first 10  years  of

service  in  the  SAF  and  emphasises  the  acquisition  and

application of skills-based knowledge.  The second stage, the

Warrant   Officer   stage,  emphasises  skills   proficiency,

experience and continuity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan also offers warrant officers more opportunities

to   upgrade   themselves  and  to  prepare   high-performing

servicemen  for  positions  of  leadership  by  giving   them

assistance  for upgrading their qualifications.   To  support

the new career structure, Mindef is introducing a savings and

retirement plan for Warrant Officers and Specialists known as

the  Premium  Plan.  This provides financial flexibility  and

stability to better cater to their needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while a strong SAF remains central in our defence

strategy for the 21st century, we recognise that we also need

to co-operate more closely with others to enhance Singapore's

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 21st century, there will be increasing

interconnectedness among countries - not just in the economic

sphere but also when it comes to security.  The security  and

prosperity  of  a small and open country like  Singapore  are

particularly  vulnerable to developments elsewhere,  many  of

which are beyond our control.  Both our security and economic

well-being will become even more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>

susceptible to any instability in our external environment as

we  become  more closely integrated into the global  economy.

Our borders may also become more porous to a diverse range of

security threats, including non-conventional ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take a more integrated and co-operative

approach  to  enhance  our security.   At  the  regional  and

international  level,  Singapore  will  work   closely   with

friendly  countries  to promote dialogue, confidence-building

and  co-operation to maintain a peaceful and stable  regional

and  international environment.  Sir, over the years, we have

built  up  extensive and good defence ties  with  many  armed

forces  and  defence establishments all over the world.   And

this  is  the  issue raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung,  Mr  Hawazi

Daipi  and Mr Sin Boon Ann.  We will do what we can  to  help

promote greater defence co-operation and dialogue - not  only

within  our  region  but also between our  region  and  those

outside.    By  doing  our  part  to  promote  regional   and

international  peace,  we would also  be  enhancing  our  own

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the national level, Mindef and the SAF will work

more  closely  with  other  government  agencies  to  enhance

Singapore's  capabilities  to  deal  with  a  range  of  non-conventional threats, such as terrorist threats,  piracy  and

cyber-attacks.  I would like to assure Dr Ong Chit Chung  and

Mr  Hawazi  Daipi that we are very much alive to the  dangers

which  terrorists  can  inflict  on  Singapore.   This  is  a

dimension  of  Total  Defence  that  will  take  on   greater

significance in the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these efforts will not be adequate without the

backing  of  a united population committed to the defence  of

our  country.  Every Singaporean has a part to  play  in  the

defence of Singapore.  The SAF's strength comes from each and

every  National Serviceman.  As a small nation, we  can  only

maintain   an  effective  deterrence  if  we  draw   in   all

Singaporeans  in Total Defence.  Every in-camp training  that

our  NSmen  go  to and every civil defence exercise  that  we

participate in, is an investment in our own future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our success over the past 35 years would not have

been possible without a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>

defence  capability.  We have developed a  thriving  economy,

our  own  distinct values and way of life, and above all,  we

have built and can be proud that we have a nation of our own.

If  we want to be able to carry on enjoying the fruits of our

own  work  and  the  hard work of the Singaporeans  who  came

before  us,  we  must continue to ensure  that  we  have  the

defence  capability  to  protect us and  to  provide  a  firm

foundation for Singapore's future development.  Only then can

we  secure more good years of peace and stability and achieve

our dreams and aspirations for ourselves and our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dealt with some of the issues which have

been  raised  by Members of Parliament who have  spoken.   My

colleagues in the Defence Ministry will deal with  the  other

issues which they have raised.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the DPM for his

comprehensive overview of the defence policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor-General, in his report for the

financial  year  1998/99, has  highlighted the irregularities

and  non-compliance with the Government financial  procedures

in  the Ministry of Defence.  The Auditor-General noted  that

five  full-time  National Servicemen  were  seconded  to  DSO

National  Laboratories, a privatised unit, in 1997 for  about

one  to two years and another 14 National Servicemen were  on

loan  to ST Automotive Ltd, a private company, in 1998.   The

Auditor-General deemed that there were irregularities in such

a scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audit revealed that in February 1998, full payment of

$976,000  was made to a supplier for goods that had not  been

received by Mindef.  The Auditor-General classified this as a

"false declaration".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General also reported irregularities in

contracts  awarded  to  DSO  National  Laboratories.   Mindef

officers  who  also  served  as the  company  directors  were

involved  in  decisions leading to the award of contracts  to

the  company.   Security  deposits  were  not  collected  and

banker's guarantee for advance payments of about $30  million

was waived without

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>

proper  approval.  Audit also highlighted that a bank account

for  fixed  deposits  of  $180  million  was  opened  without

approval  of  the Accountant-General, as required  under  the

financial procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor-General noted that there was repeated

failure  to  refund  security deposits  no  longer  required,

amounting to $196,000.  On the other hand, there was delay in

clearing and collecting long outstanding personal advances to

officers  for  official expenses, in some cases,  up  to  six

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the first time that such weaknesses are

brought  to  the  attention of the  public  by  the  Auditor-General.    It would not do Mindef's reputation any  good  if

this  continues.   I,  therefore, urge Mindef  to  act,  take

remedial  actions, exercise tighter supervision and undertake

preventive  measures so that such incidents would  not  recur

again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, our military is held in very high

regard  and Mindef has earned its reputation as an efficient,

credible, disciplined and honest organisation.  Therefore, it

was  with  much  concern that I read in the Auditor-General's

report for FY 1998-1999 where it was highlighted that certain

financial  procedures  were not  adhered  to  and  that  some

financial irregularities had taken place in Mindef.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef enjoys tremendous bipartisan support both within

the House and among the ordinary people.  Naturally, when the

AG's  report came out, there were eyebrows raised  among  the

public.  The matter is compounded by the fact that Mindef has

to operate in a cloak of secrecy.  Parliament assents to this

cloak  of secrecy by asking for few details on the budget  of

Mindef which amounts to $7.4 billion this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant of this cloak of secrecy by Parliament in turn

requires  an  even  higher  standard  of  responsibility  and

accountability  for  public  money  when  compared  to  other

Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that the Auditor-General's report was brief

on  Mindef's  reply.  I would like to ask  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>

firstly,  as  to  whether  the  Auditor-General's  report  is

accurate  on the matters raised; secondly, whether there  was

any loss of money to the Government on the matters raised  in

the report, and lastly, what measures will be taken to ensure

that such lapses do not recur in future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, like my colleagues before me, I

do have some concerns on the matters expressed in the Auditor-General's  report.   I would like to add my  comment  on  the

false declaration.  I perhaps understand that the idea was to

make  it easier to facilitate payment to the contractor.   In

this   case,  it  was  fortunate  that  the  certificate   of

completion was given not because of any attempt to cheat  the

Government,  but to help the contractor with the  payment  of

the goods.  Although malice was not intended, it nevertheless

shows  up  a weakness in the system.  Rather than counselling

the  parties  involved,  I would like  to  ask  the  Minister

whether  further  improvements  can  be  made  to  the  whole

process.   Perhaps, a system of double signatures be  put  in

place  or  an  alternative  scheme  to  ensure  that  similar

breaches will not take place in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second concern raised by the Auditor-General, it

was  noted  that  contracts  were  made  with  Mindef-related

companies  resulting in numerous instances of  non-compliance

with  the Government procurement procedures.  It appears that

Mindef officers who were appointed as company directors, were

involved  in decisions leading to award of contracts  by  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the instance cited by the Auditor-General is an

indication  of  how  defence  contract  between  two  related

parties  in  a cosy relationship can lead to an oversight  of

Government procurement procedures.  I would urge the Minister

to  be  on  a vigilant safeguard to ensure that such breaches

are not repeated again in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also note that in the case of transfer of funds, some

monies  were transferred to a bank account which  was  opened

without the approval of the Accountant-General as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>

is  required  by law and standing instructions.  The  Auditor

commented  that this was a serious break-down in controls  as

the  funds  in  the  bank could have been  siphoned  off  for

unauthorised use. Would the Minister kindly explain how these

accounts came to be opened and whether steps have been  taken

to  prevent  a  repeat of such breaches.  Like  my  colleague

before  me,  I would like to emphasise that Mindef  enjoys  a

high  level  of confidence among the members of  the  public.

These   instances  cited  by  the  Auditor-General  must   be

addressed  by the Government if the confidence of the  public

is to be maintained for the future.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

rise  because I am a bit uncomfortable about the  brevity  of

information  contained  in  the Budget  statement  under  the

Defence Ministry as it does not give me a good idea of how we

are  allocating resources to meet our defence objectives  and

priorities   and  I  would  ask  the  Minister  for   greater

disclosure of information in the Budget statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that there is a need to maintain

confidentiality on national security matters but  would  like

to  attempt  to persuade the Minister to give  this  House  a

little  bit  more information on the various expenditures  so

that  Singaporeans know how much we are paying  to  keep  the

peace   and  stability  in  Singapore  through  the   various

programmes and strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans understand the need to maintain a very

strong  total defence capability and that we need to maintain

a  consistently high level of investment so that the SAF  can

remain  to be a strong defence force.  Therefore, we need  to

take  a  very  long-term  view that even  during  periods  of

economic  crisis,  we have maintained a very  high  level  of

expenditure so that our long-term goals are not compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans also accept the fact that due to our

limited resources, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>

necessary for us to conduct training overseas, which  is  not

only a complex matter, but a very expensive matter.  As local

training  becomes  more  scarce, more sophisticated  training

facilities  will  need  to  be  built  to  provide   training

conditions  which are as realistic as possible.  It  will  be

good,  and  Singaporeans should know how much it  would  cost

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans also understand that as part of our defence

policy,  we  need to strengthen dialogue, confidence-building

and  cooperation in the region through military relations and

commitments through multi-lateral defence agreements. We have

witnessed  how  important these military relations  are.  For

example, the personal relationships between SAF officers  and

TNI officers have been significant in maintaining ties during

the difficult Habibie administration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue to maintain relations at all levels

between  SAF and other armies in the region, can I  interpret

from  the  budget that the financial resources available  for

these  programmes  are  available entirely  from  the  public

relations  budget?   How much are we doing  and  spending  to

develop better military relations with our neighbours?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans also recognise that we need to make in-camp training more convenient and as least disruptive as

possible  as people find it increasingly difficult to  juggle

between  their  work and their responsibilities  towards  the

SAF.  This is a small price we have to pay, but certainly  we

need to know how much it would cost us. I am aware of the on-going  innovation,  process  improvement  of  procedures  and

practices  to  make training more relevant and realistic.  As

this would become increasingly important, perhaps we need  to

ask  whether  we  can do more, or whether  there  are  enough

resources  allocated towards this objective.  Making  in-camp

training  more  relevant and meaningful is certainly  an  on-going   commitment.    As  Singaporeans,  we  need   to   ask

ourselves:  are we prepared and how much are we  prepared  to

pay  for  this? Singaporeans can also be proud to be able  to

contribute to international peace,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>

for  example,  to  be part of the United  Nations  effort  in

dispute  and conflict prevention worldwide, and in  terms  of

donation, assistance of equipment and personnel.  How much of

our defence budget is allocated for this purpose?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of community relations, we realise the

significance  of maintaining good communication  and  support

with the public. In this regard, I am specifically asking the

Minister  to consider setting up another RECORD Committee  to

recognise the contribution of NS men, in view of the changing

economic profile of the NS men.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said that on matters of developing strategic

components   of  the  SAF,  building  strong  and  indigenous

technologies  and purchase of military hardware,  it  may  be

best kept confidential in view of its implication on national

security.  But on all other matters that I have mentioned,  I

hope the Minister will not hesitate to inform this House  how

much  has been spent on the various programmes to keep  peace

in  this  country.  I think transparency,  and  a  more  open

disclosure  of information on the one hand and, the  need  to

balance and maintain confidentiality and secrecy on the other

hand, can be achieved and possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, under this cut, I had originally

intended to speak on new security challenges for the SAF.   I

note  in  the  Minister's reply that the SAF is committed  to

meeting  the new security challenges and I am much  comforted

by  the  assurance given by the Minister.  I shall  therefore

not  be  making any further speech in this area.  Can I  have

your permission to take the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, in the recent debate on the

Defence  Science and Technology Agency Bill, my parliamentary

colleague  raised the question of the Agency's accountability

to  Parliament. In the debate, it was noted that under clause

19  of  the  Bill,  the  Minister dispenses  money  given  by

Parliament  to DSTA although Parliament provides  the  money.

The Bill only requires that the annual report be given to the

Minister for Defence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>

and  he  in  turn will give the report to a Committee  to  be

appointed by the Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not appear that the money appropriated by DSTA

is  a  matter  that  is  subject to public  scrutiny  through

Parliament.   Some  concern was raised as  to  the  issue  of

accountability on the use of funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the work of DSTA has to be

shrouded  to some extent by secrecy as by its defence-related

work,  and by its very nature, it has to be secret.  DPM  has

in his reply confirmed this.  I agree that the fact that DSTA

is  now a statutory board does not remove any requirement  of

secrecy  and  the same has to be maintained for many  of  the

detailed activities of the DSTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can well appreciate the argument why matters of

financial  provisions of DSTA should  not  be  a  subject  of

public debate. However, I would like to mention that there is

a distinction to be made between public accountability on the

one hand, and private accountability to a group of people who

commands  the  trust  and confidence of the  members  of  the

public  to  play  their part in ensuring  that  the  relevant

agency is doing their work properly.  In this debate, we  are

not  saying that the Agency should subject its agenda or  its

programme   to   public  scrutiny.   What   I   believe   our

parliamentary colleagues are asking for is that  a  mechanism

be  set out which comprises independent parties who can  help

ensure that the funds appropriated by the agency are properly

spent. Indeed, it did not help to inspire much confidence  in

members  of  the  public  when  the  Bill  allowed  for   the

appointment of an auditor and not the Auditor-General, who is

an independent official of the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are fixed financial procedures that

are   in  place  to  ensure  that  the  integrity  of  public

administration is not compromised. However, I am  sure,  Sir,

that  you  will agree with me that unless we institutionalise

checks  on our systems, lapses may occur. We note the  recent

report of the Auditor-General of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>

numerous   instances   of  non-compliance   with   Government

procurement  procedures.  This happened in a situation  where

we  have  two  contracting parties  who  are  in  very  close

relationship to one another.  Without an independent body  to

watch  over  the  work of the DSTA, we cannot  be  sure  that

lapses in financial procedures may not occur in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in the light of our concern that I would urge

the  Minister to consider appointing the Auditor-General  and

members  of  the public, including MPs, who are  seen  to  be

independent  bodies,  to  sit on the relevant  committees  to

ensure  that  funds which are dispensed by the  Minister  and

which are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, are properly

utilised.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I understand Mr Ravindran is

not taking this cut. Can I take the three cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, but you have to speak on this cut

first  as  Mr  David  Lim has indicated that  he  will  reply

immediately after this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the SAF is made up of a

judicious mix of regulars, full-time National Servicemen  and

operationally-ready National Servicemen.  And every year, the

SAF  has  to make do and make the best use of the  cohort  of

male  citizens enlisting for full-time National Service.   It

emphasizes   higher productivity and reliance on  technology,

and at the same time outsourcing non-essential functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to note that Mindef will adhere to the

maximum  of  two  and  a  half years  of  full-time  National

Service, and will not seek further extension of the period of

service.  I would like to ask, with the changing roles of the

SAF,  whether  the SAF can cope with the increasing  manpower

requirements.   With  the recovery of the  economy,  are  the

various  manpower  schemes sufficiently  attractive  for  the

recruitment of regular officers and men?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, at the same time, that it is the declared aim

of  the  SAF  to  renew itself and keep  the  SAF  young  and

fighting-fit.  Is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>

this  working out well?   While the SAF may be achieving  its

overall  aim, may I ask if some officers are being  moved  up

the chain of command too fast, such that field commanders may

not  have sufficient ground or command experience at  various

levels of command.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that it is not just a matter of pay. It is

also  about  ethos, people management, the art of  leadership

and  staff  welfare.  It is this common bond and team  spirit

that hold a fighting unit together in times of crisis and  in

the  line  of  fire.   Are  our unit commanders  trained  and

groomed to motivate the men in their command?

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, I would like first to take the cuts on the Auditor-General and financial procedures in Mindef.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Ravindran

and  Mr Sin Boon Ann for raising their concerns regarding the

Auditor-General's  report on Mindef and this  opportunity  to

clarify the issues raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef takes the Auditor-General's report very

seriously.   Firstly, I would like to emphasise that  in  all

the breaches raised by the Auditor-General, there was no loss

of funds due to the misuse of public funds or fraud.  All the

breaches have been rectified and all monies were at all times

accounted  for.   Most of the breaches  were  the  result  of

administrative  lapses.  Mindef  appreciates   the   Auditor-General's  observations and help in discovering these  lapses

and measures have been taken to ensure that the same problems

will not recur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in some instances, Mindef felt that the

breaches did not have the severe consequential effects  noted

in  the  Auditor-General's report.  Sir, I would now like  to

take some time to give a more detailed explanation of the key

issues raised by the Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, bank account for deposits of $180 million

opened  without approval. The Auditor-General's  report  said

that the bank account for three fixed deposits,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>

totalling  $180 million, was opened without the  approval  of

the  Accountant-General.  It is said that this is  a  serious

breakdown  in control as funds in the bank could be  siphoned

off  for unauthorised use. This is a fairly complicated case.

Allow  me to briefly explain the transactions and assure  the

House that the funds were, at all times, fully accounted  for

and could not have been siphoned out of Mindef's accounts for

unauthorised purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds in question were part of a SAVER fund. The

SAVER fund board had decided that the SAVER funds were to  be

invested  in bonds, equities and cash instruments.   Separate

accounts  would  be opened for each category of  instruments.

At  the  material  time, accounts had been  opened  with  the

approval  of  the  Accountant-General  for  bonds  and   cash

instruments.   The funds in question were earmarked  for  the

cash  account  for investment in cash instruments,  that  is,

this  $180  million.  They were placed instead  in  the  bond

account.   However, they were not invested in  bonds  because

the  bonds  manager at that time had not yet been  appointed.

Instead, they were invested in fixed deposits, that is, in  a

cash  instrument for two months.  The officers in charge  had

done   this  because,  at  that  particular  time,  the  bank

operating  the  bond account was able to offer  a  much  more

attractive interest rate for fixed deposits compared  to  the

fixed deposit rates offered by other banks.  The higher  rate

earned Mindef more than $400,000, in additional interest over

the two months.  But the placement of funds earmarked for the

cash  account  into the bond account was wrong. The  officers

who   authorised   this   transfer  have,   therefore,   been

reprimanded for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mindef would like to point out that the

officers  were  able  to transfer the  funds  into  the  bond

account,  instead  of  the  cash account  only  because  both

accounts  were  properly  set up with  the  approval  of  the

Accountant-General. These accounts are subject to  the  usual

financial  controls adopted by the Government. The  funds  in

question were, therefore, at all times, accounted for  within

Mindef and could not have been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>

siphoned off to any unauthorised account outside of Mindef.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, irregularities and contracts awarded to DSO

National  Laboratories. The Auditor-General reported  certain

irregularities  in  contracts that Mindef have  entered  into

with  a  related company, DSO National Laboratories  (DSONL).

For  example, it said that one contract was signed before the

company  was  incorporated, and that Mindef  officers  signed

several  contracts on behalf of the company.   It  also  said

that  Mindef  officers, who were appointed as  the  company's

directors,  were also involved in decisions  leading  to  the

award  of  the  contracts to the company.  These observations

imply  that  because  Mindef officers were  acting  for  both

parties  to  the  contracts, the dealings were  not  at  arms

length.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these irregularities occurred during the

transitional period when the Defence Science Organisation was

converted from a Government department to a corporate entity.

The  formation  of a corporate entity meant  that  extant  or

existing  projects  in the department  had  to  be  converted

overnight  into  formal  contracts  between  Mindef  and  the

company  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  projects.    Mindef

officers were involved on both sides of the contracts because

DSONL  was set up specifically to serve Mindef and  the  SAF,

and  Mindef  officers were therefore appointed  to  hold  key

positions  in the company.  There was no collusion  to  award

contracts  unfairly to the company, nor to bypass  tender  or

other procurement procedures as these contracts were made  to

regularise  work that was already being done by DSONL  before

its  corporatisation.  I can therefore assure Mr Sin Boon Ann

that this was not due to any cosy relationship between Mindef

and DSONL.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor-General's Report said that Mindef had

made  a full payment of $976,000 to a supplier for goods that

had not been received by Mindef.  This matter

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>

concerned  the purchase of computer equipment.   The  project

engineer  had  issued  a  post-dated  acceptance  certificate

before  he physically accepted the goods.  The report pointed

out that this was a false declaration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of a post-dated acceptance certificate

was  a  wrong action on the part of the officer.  It was  not

done  so  much  to help the contractor, but it was  done  for

reasons that only the project officer would know.  Perhaps it

was to expedite payment towards the end of a financial year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mindef has investigated this matter, and found

that  all  the goods under this contract have been  delivered

and  certified  to be in good order and condition.   We  also

noted  that  payment was made only after the goods  had  been

physically inspected, certified and accepted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef has issued instructions prohibiting post-dating

of the certificate of acceptance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General also observed that the computation

of  employer  and employee CPF contributions  was  incorrect.

This  was  due to the different rounding-off method  used  by

Mindef   because  of  a  different  interpretation   of   the

guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Auditor General's input, Mindef has since

amended  the  computerised payroll  programme  to  apply  the

rounding-off method adopted by the Central Pay  Office.   The

earlier rounding-off method adopted by Mindef had resulted in

an  overall net over-contribution of CPF by Mindef  of  about

$613,000 over a period of five years, from 1993 to July 1998.

Essentially,   for   some  servicemen,   there   were   over-contributions of about $1 to $2 per serviceman per month.  As

it   was   not  cost-effective  to  recover  the  net   over-contribution,  Mindef has requested the Ministry  of  Finance

for permission to write off this amount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General felt that it was irregular for

Mindef  to  second  19 full-time national servicemen  to  two

companies that were not gazetted as designated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>

organisations for national service under the Enlistment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef referred this matter to the Attorney-General for

advice.    The  Attorney-General  has  confirmed   that   the

secondment  and  loan  of  the  servicemen  to  the  external

agencies  were  lawful.   However, Mindef  has  returned  all

payments received for the deployment of the servicemen to the

two organisations since the servicemen were in the employment

of SAF at the material time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor General also reported on several

instances of non-recovery of various types of monies, and the

failure  of  Mindef to refund deposits and clear  other  long

outstanding  accounts.  Mindef has replied  to  the  Auditor-General on these matters.  If Members are interested, I  will

give   them   a  full  account  upon  request.   Mindef   has

investigated these cases and rectified the matters raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong and Mr Ravindran have also asked what

measures Mindef has taken to ensure that such lapses  do  not

recur  in  future.  Mindef has implemented various programmes

to enhance the financial and procurement management in Mindef

and the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of education and training, Mindef has

launched  new  communication channels to quickly  disseminate

lessons learnt and best practices to the relevant Mindef  and

SAF   personnel.   In  addition,  all  audit   findings   are

circulated  to the various commanders so that they  can  take

steps to prevent similar problems occurring in their units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef is also stepping up training on financial and

procurement procedures.  For finance appointment holders, our

aim  is  for such officers to pass a proficiency test  before

they  are  allowed  to  perform  their  duties.   When  fully

implemented, this system would ensure that only  trained  and

certified   competent  personnel  are  appointed  to   handle

financial matters and payments can only be made if the claims

are handled by certified personnel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of accountability, procurement agencies are

now providing annual declarations that they have observed and

complied

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>

with  all  procurement policies and procedures.  This  is  in

line with the Ministry of Finance's requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to reiterate that

there  are  strong and sound systems of control in  place  in

Mindef.   As  a large organisation, occasional administrative

lapses may happen from time to time.  Nonetheless,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>

Mindef  is  committed to complying with Government procedures

in  procurement  and financial management.   We  continue  to

simplify  and clarify our internal guidelines,  and  to  take

various measures to further strengthen our systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mindef is mindful that it has a big responsibility

to ensure that defence funds are fully accounted for and well

spent  to  build up a strong SAF and defence  capability.   I

would like to thank Members for their continued support,  and

assure  them  that Mindef will continue to  be  vigilant  and

prudent in its financial and procurement activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to the cut by Mr Zulkifli on defence

expenditure and also by Mr Sin Boon Ann on accountability and

secrecy  in the SAF.  Both these Members have expressed  that

they  would  like to see greater disclosure on  the  part  of

Mindef.   Mr Zulkifli has suggested that without compromising

secrecy, we should have more disclosure on things such as the

cost  to  send  troops overseas for training or  for  in-camp

training  or  to  maintain good military  relationships  with

other armed forces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by its very nature - and the Members have noted

this   -  matters of defence and security must be kept within

the   realm  of  secrecy,  and  cannot  be  subject  to  open

discussion  in  public.   Public disclosures  of  details  of

Mindef's procurement and the SAF's operations will compromise

security.   It will be prejudicial to the national  interest.

For  this  reason,  Mindef has always  kept  details  of  its

finances secret.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef has also never published details of its defence

procurements.  This practice, which is also the case in  many

other   countries,  will  therefore  continue.   Nonetheless,

Mindef  is  very  conscious  of the  need  to  maintain  high

standards of prudence and accountability.  And as I have just

mentioned,  measures exist to ensure that the defence  budget

voted by Parliament to Mindef is well used, and that the  SAF

continues  to  be  an  effective force  able  to  defend  the

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within Mindef, there are comprehensive processes and

controls  to ensure that every defence dollar is well  spent.

There  are  also  internal checks provided both  by  Mindef's

internal  audit  department and this is in  addition  to  the

external  checks  by  the Auditor-General.   Ultimately,  the

Prime  Minister and Cabinet being responsible for Singapore's

defence  and  security  will ensure  that  defence  money  is

channelled  to  the  right projects and procurements.   These

various  checks  are a safeguard to ensure that  the  defence

budget   is   used  prudently  and  responsibly.   Sufficient

safeguards therefore exist to provide a check and balance for

defence  spending.  The public can rest assured  that  Mindef

and  the  SAF  will  continue to maintain high  standards  of

accountability in its operations and processes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann raised a matter of the annual

report  and  suggested  that  certain  external  members   be

appointed  to look through this report.  The Defence  Science

and  Technology  Agency Act already provides  for  the  Prime

Minister  to  appoint a Committee to receive and  to  examine

this  report,  and  I  think we can leave  it  to  the  Prime

Minister  to  ensure  that  persons  of  integrity  will   be

appointed to this role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin also suggested that the Auditor-General should be

appointed to audit the Defence Science and Technology  Agency

rather  than  an auditor to be appointed by the Minister  for

Defence.  I think the issue is not so much whether it is  the

Auditor-General  who  audits  or  whether  it  is  any  other

auditor, but that again this task is done conscientiously  by

men  and  women  who  are independent  and  take  their  jobs

seriously.  I can assure Mr Sin that the people who  will  be

appointed to this task will be such people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was another cut by Dr Ong Chit Chung about

manpower  in  the  SAF.   As  my Deputy  Prime  Minister  and

Minister for Defence has already noted, wars are not  won  by

technology  or  by machines but by people.  Manpower  is  our

most  important asset and Mindef spares no effort  to  ensure

that we are able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers  of

good  people  for  the  SAF.  As the  Deputy  Prime  Minister

mentioned,  the  new partnership schemes that were  announced

recently  for  military  officers and  warrant  officers  are

examples  of some of the measures that we have undertaken  to

ensure that the SAF is able to compete effectively in the job

market for limited manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, we have in place many schemes to

attract  talented people to join the SAF.   For  example,  we

offer  scholarships.  And at the apex of SAF is the  Overseas

Scholarships  Scheme to attract some of the brightest  school

leavers to join the SAF.  The Overseas Scholarship Scheme  is

second only in prestige to the President's scholarships,  and

it  is instrumental in ensuring that each year we have a fair

share  of  the  national talent pool.  Besides  the  overseas

scholarships, we have arranged for other local  and  overseas

awards  also  to attract bright students to take up  military

careers.   So,  Dr Ong can be assured that upon  joining  the

SAF, military personnel can look forward to a challenging and

rewarding career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also mentioned his concern that there may not be

enough time for commanders to spend time in specific commands

because  the  routes  of advancement and  their  careers  are

rather  short.  I would like to assure Dr Ong and Members  of

this  House  that this is an area that Mindef pays particular

attention  to,  and  routes  of  advancements  are  carefully

designed to ensure that commanders have sufficient command as

well  as staff responsibility before they move on to a higher

level of command.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister

of  State  for  his comments on my request whether  he  would

consider  setting  up  a RECORD committee  to  recognise  the

contributions of national servicemen?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> I am sorry I missed that question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last time we had a RECORD committee was some

four  or  five  years ago.  I would be happy to consider  the

Member's suggestion and make an announcement on this at  some

later date.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, first I want to thank the

Minister  of  State for his frank responses  and  trust  that

Mindef  will  put measures in place to ensure  accountability

and proper procedures are observed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we talk about maximizing our defence dollar and

getting  maximum value for each  dollar we put into  defence.

With  our  scarce  resources and limitation in  manpower  and

space, we must optimise the use of manpower as well as land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land use could be optimised by relocating and

redesigning  camps,  let units share common  facilities,  put

some   facilities  underground,  for  example,  putting   the

ammunition dumps underground, train more intensively overseas

and  use IT and simulation technology to cut down the use  of

space.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of manpower, courses and exercises should be

well  designed to optimise the time available.   Idling  time

should  be  minimized.  Those who have been through  NS  know

often  times the NSmen have to wait a long, long time at  the

range  for  their  turn to shoot.  It was a very  long  wait.

Can  we not revamp the system and cut down idling time at the

ranges, for example?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what further progress SAF has

made in optimising the use of land as well as manpower?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will go to my next cut. Some three years ago, we

had  a  number  of unfortunate casualties in the  SAF  during

training and exercises.  The whole SAF was geared up to  give

the highest priority to safety measures in training.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister for an update of the safety

measures  implemented, and whether such  measures  are  being

followed religiously by all units.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I support what has been raised by

Dr   Ong Chit Chung and I appreciate that SAF training has to

be  realistic  enough  to prepare our servicemen  for  actual

combat  situations.   I  understand that  the  SAF  has  very

comprehensive safety measures already established.   However,

could the Minister tell us what additional measures have been

initiated  to  enhance  safety  in  training,  especially  at

unfamiliar overseas training areas and whether these measures

are indeed effective?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, ultimately, defence is

everybody's   business,  not  just  that  of   the   National

Servicemen.    It   is  the  business  of  each   and   every

Singaporean.   It  is  the total defence.   It  requires  the

support  of  the  family:  the father,  the  mother  and  the

siblings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service is now accepted as part and parcel of

life,  part  of  the  Singaporean's way  of  life.   National

Service  is so institutionalised and ingrained, that  it  has

become  a  people's movement for the defence of the homeland.

I  call  it  "homeland", because we are defending our  homes,

every home and every inch of our land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, at the meet-the-people sessions, we see more

and  more cases of petitioners appealing for upgrading rather

than downgrading of medical classifications in NS.  Our young

men  would  rather be in the combat vocations.  They  compete

fiercely  for a place in the Officer Cadet School.   This  is

indeed  a  good sign.  There is no doubt that young  National

Servicemen are now better prepared and enlist with the  right

attitude  and  aptitude.  This, no doubt, is  helped  by  the

improvement in the facilities and services in the  SAF.   The

food, for example, has improved tremendously.  Some even told

their  mothers that the food in camps is better than that  of

mum's  cooking!  I am sure mum does not mind a little bit  of

competition.  My son told his mother that.  The point here is

that if all appreciate the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>

importance  of  defence and National Service, then  we  would

have  achieved the aim of Total Defence and the  strategy  of

deterrence.  As Sun Tzu, the strategist, said, we  would  win

the  war without fighting.  The enemy would not dare to  make

the first move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister if Mindef will further enhance

the  national  education programmes  in  the  SAF,  and  work

closely too with the Ministry of Education and the schools to

further promote the concept and practice of total defence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ravindran, you could take your three

cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, total defence highlights the critical

role everyone has to play in the defence of our country.   It

is  important that our citizens be constantly reminded to  be

ever  vigilant  and  prepared for  a  sudden  change  in  the

security situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy and impressed with the recent spate of

advertisements that were shown on television.  It was a  wake

up  call  to  Singaporeans who are complacent about  national

defence.   The  advertisements were direct and hit  home  the

message  clearly.   I must compliment Mindef  for  that  bold

initiative  in strengthening Psychological Defence  which  is

one of the five key elements in Total Defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, increasingly, more and more foreigners are taking

up  PR and citizenship here.  Many of them do not undergo the

growing up and shared experience of a Singaporean.  They have

not  studied  here nor done NS. I see a challenge  in  making

this  group  of new Singaporeans committed to the defence  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister in what other ways

the  Ministry intends to further inculcate the importance  of

Total  Defence  among  the people of Singapore,  particularly

among  our  new  migrants.  I would  also  like  to  ask  the

Minister   whether  a  co-ordinating  committee   exists   to

coordinate  our efforts at Total Defence.  If  so,  the  work

done by such a committee.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the next topic on the SAF and East

Timor.   I  must commend the SAF for the quiet but  essential

role  by the SAF in East Timor as part of the INTERFET  team.

Our  LSTs, though old, played a critical role in the transfer

of  much  needed logistics.  Our soldiers were also  said  to

have  conducted  themselves  in a professional  and  friendly

manner  with  all  the  other INTERFET participating  forces.

They have done the SAF and Singapore proud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the United Nations Transition Administration for

East  Timor (UNTAET) is now in place in East Timor.  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister in what ways the SAF  is  helping

UNTAET  and  the  people  of East  Timor  in  rebuilding  the

country.   I  would  also like to ask  the  Minister  for  an

assessment on whether there are any threats to the safety  of

our men and the challenges faced by them in East Timor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will move on to the third topic, defence science

and  technology research.  It has become a simple truth  that

superior technology capability is a force multiplier in  war.

Jane's Defence Weekly in its 9th February edition highlighted

the  future  role of autonomous weapons, robotic warfare  and

how they will greatly impact military doctrine in future.  It

is clear that superior technology is vital in winning wars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting up of the DSTA will provide the SAF

with  a  one  stop agency that will take care  of  the  SAF's

defence  science and technology research needs.  In  view  of

the  fast  changing pace of technology and equipment,  it  is

critical  that we do not rely on DSTA's inhouse  capabilities

for  all  our research needs. In fact, many overseas  defence

science and technology research organisations have gone  into

both  local and overseas joint collaboration  to conduct  R&D

in  these fields.  I am glad that Mindef has also embarked on

this  path  recently.   It  will certainly  help  reduce  the

learning curve and minimise the time to bring a product  into

use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the measures taken by Mindef to work

closely with the industry,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>

the    academic    institutions   and    overseas    research

establishments to ensure quality research and that  there  is

transfer  of knowledge from the private sector to Mindef  and

vice   versa,   particularly  in  R&D  which   has   civilian

applications?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Whether DSTA has plans to implement a scheme similar

to  the  one  in  place  by the DEFA in  the  UK  called  the

"Pathfinder" Programme which can allow industry  to  bid  for

DSTA  funds  for novel defence research in areas  which  meet

both  the  companies and the DSTA's priorities and  represent

ideas which are superior to those coming up within DSTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Whether DSTA would consider setting up dual use

technology centres where new technologies being developed can

be used both by Mindef and for civilian use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Whether DSTA has plans to sell its research

facilities and services for civilian application directly  to

the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Whether Mindef is going to set itself a minimum

percentage  benchmark  figure  in  their  budget  for  annual

research so as to ensure that research is never neglected  as

was found in some countries.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Ravindran asked about the Five

Power Defence Arrangements.  Since its establishment in 1971,

the  FPDA  has  been  an important element  of  the  security

architecture in our region. The underlying principle  of  the

FPDA  is  that  the  defence  of Malaysia  and  Singapore  is

indivisible.  Or as the then Malaysian Defence Minister  Dato

Abang  Abu  Bakar  put it last year, "Cubit paha  kiri,  paha

kanan pun sakit," or "If the left thigh is pinched, the right

thigh  also  feels  the pain."  Hence the  indivisibility  of

defence.  FPDA members would immediately consult together  on

what  measures  should be taken to deal  with  an  attack  or

aggression against Malaysia or Singapore. Any aggressor  will

therefore  have to take into account not only the  individual

responses  of Malaysia and Singapore, but also the collective

response of these two countries plus

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>

Australia, New Zealand and the UK. This is a deterrent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although FPDA exercises were suspended for a short

period  between 1998 and 1999, the FPDA is now back on track.

The exercises and activities resumed last year. This year the

FPDA  will conduct two major exercises. Exercise Flying  Fish

2000  will  coincide  with  the 4th FPDA  Defence  Ministers'

Meeting  in Singapore this July. FPDA members have also  been

reviewing how the operational arrangements and exercises  can

be   enhanced  for  greater  professional  benefit  for   the

participating forces and to ensure that the FPDA continues to

be relevant to the security of Singapore and Malaysia and the

region.   Sir,  Malaysia has assured the other  FPDA  members

that  they  are  fully  committed to  the  FPDA.   Since  the

resumption  of  exercises last year, they  have  participated

fully  in FPDA activities. Arrangements have also been worked

out  to  facilitate smooth and expeditious search and  rescue

should that be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Charles Chong have asked about

piracy  and  illegal immigrants.  The problem of  piracy  has

been  discussed  within ASEAN and the  ASEAN  Regional  Forum

(ARF).  ASEAN has agreed to intensify bilateral co-operation,

while  the ARF will explore co-operative approaches  to  deal

with the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a bilateral level, Singapore has a standing

arrangement with Indonesia called the Indonesia-Singapore Co-ordinated Patrols (ISCP) to help us deal with piracy  in  the

seas  around Singapore. Our Navy and Police Coast  Guard  and

the  Indonesian Navy and Police work together  on  this.  The

arrangement  allows an effective exchange of information  and

facilitates cross-border pursuit. This co-operation has  been

going  on  smoothly  and effectively. The  incidence  of  sea

robbery   within  the  ISCP  area  of  operations  has   been

significantly  reduced  since  this  arrangement  started  in

September  1992.   There  were some incidents  in  the  first

quarter   of  last  year  but  after  the  ISCP  stepped   up

surveillance  and patrols, there has been no  report  of  sea

robbery since

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>

mid-April  last  year. The navy has also been supporting  the

efforts  of the Home Team to prevent illegal immigrants  from

reaching our shores, both in the planning process as well  as

in  assisting  the  Police Coast Guard at  sea  by  providing

surveillance  to  detect suspicious vessels carrying  illegal

immigrants. And the Navy will continue to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Ong also asked about training

safety. The SAF takes training safety very seriously, whether

the training is conducted locally or overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the culture of training safety is deeply

ingrained  in  our system.  There is a strong and  continuous

emphasis  by  commanders  at  all  levels  of  the  need  and

importance of safety training.  The process begins at all our

training  schools  where future commanders  of  the  SAF  are

exposed   routinely  to  briefing  and  frequent  updates  on

training  safety so that they learn to accept  safety  as  an

integral part  of military training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for our ground commanders is not to avoid

training  but  to  proactively  manage  these  activities  to

minimise the  risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For training in unfamiliar training areas, both local

and   overseas,   the  accompanying  risks   are   identified

systematically  through  the use of  Risk  Assessment  Matrix

beforehand.   Thereafter, the potential risks are proactively

dealt  with through such measures as safety briefings, ground

orientation to unfamiliar terrain and rehearsals prior to the

conduct of the actual training.

Safety  audits are also carried out by Training Inspectorates

in  the  Army, Navy and Airforce.  Lessons learnt from  their

audits  are shared with other units and the findings  of  the

Inspectorates are routinely reported to the highest levels in

the Ministry of Defence.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to report that these and other measures

taken by the SAF have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>

been  effective.  The number of fatal accidents in  1997  was

six.   Last year, in 1999, there was unfortunately one  fatal

accident.   The  number of training injuries dropped  by  45%

between  1997  and 1999.  This improvement  is  a  result  of

sustained efforts by the SAF to improve safety and  has  been

achieved  without lowering the tempo of training and training

standards.    The SAF will strive to improve on this  because

even one accident is one too many.  The SAF will continue  to

ensure that our training is realistic and, at the same  time,

develop measures to proactively manage risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked about optimising of

land use.  The SAF works closely with other national agencies

to  identify  commercially less viable areas  to  locate  its

military  camps and to conduct its training.  The development

of  the  Basic  Military Training Centre and  the  School  of

Infantry  Specialists complexes in Pulau Tekong  are  notable

examples.   New camp designs have allowed for more  intensive

use  of  land.   In  addition, where  possible,  bigger  camp

complexes  are  built to replace several smaller  ones.   The

sharing  of  common facilities and services in the  big  camp

complexes has resulted in land savings.  As a result, in  the

last five years alone, a total of 27.48 hectares of land were

returned  by the SAF to the Land Office for other use.   This

is quite considerable, given the activity level of Mindef and

the scarce land resources in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mindef also continually seeks out new construction

technology  to optimise land use.  For example, in  1999,  we

launched  the  plan  to  excavate  a  large  cavern  for   an

underground  ammunition  dump out  of  solid  granite.   This

innovative  solution  will free more  than  300  hectares  of

surface  land  area for more intensive use.  The  underground

ammunition  dump is located in Mandai and is expected  to  be

completed in 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has also invested heavily in simulators. The

benefits  are numerous.  Simulators provide a high degree  of

realism,  reducing the need for large training  areas.   Tank

crews are now trained

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>

using  the  Integrated Armour Tactical  Trainer.   Simulators

also  enable  training  to  be carried  out  under  different

conditions,  some  of  which you cannot  do  even  with  live

training.  We also train extensively overseas and this  helps

to   relieve  the  problem  of  training  area  shortages  in

Singapore,  and  we  will continue to  use  our  scarce  land

resources as well as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked about optimising training time. In

the  1990s, we took a fundamental review to ensure that full-time  National Service training is focused and that the  time

spent  by full-time National Servicemen on mundane chores  is

minimised.   Where  possible, maintenance  services  are  now

commercialised.  Full-time National Servicemen are no  longer

required  to perform general housekeeping duties  for  common

areas,  such as wash room cleaning, maintenance,  etc.   This

enables  them to devote more time for training.  Some  people

complain, especially the older National Servicemen,  that  we

are  going soft.  But I think that if we can make use of  the

time  better  for  training and we can differentiate  between

things which are done for domestic purposes in the camps  and

actual live training in the training areas, and keep the live

training  in  the  training areas as realistic  as  possible,

while  making the domestic aspects as convenient as possible,

we will still be able to achieve our objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, those who are fit, for example, those who

have  attained at least a NAFA silver before enlistment,  are

exempted  from six weeks' physical training phase.   So  they

are  enlisted later compared to those who did not  attain  at

least a silver and have to undergo the six-week programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked about time spent at ranges. I know it

is very frustrating for people who go to the ranges.  We will

see  what more we can do.  But already we have done a  number

of  things.   Simulators are used a lot more  for  train-fire

with  rifles  and that cuts down the number of  times  people

need to go to the range and makes more productive use of  the

time that they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>

do  spend  on the range.  So it is quite common for  soldiers

who  go  for  the first time to the range now to score  very,

very  well,  because  they have become so  used  to  it  with

simulators.   We also have automated many of  the  ranges  so

that  soldiers  spend  much less time sticking  up  and  down

targets  and pasting targets by the butt party.  And we  will

continue to find better ways of doing this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For National Servicemen, we know the in-camp training is

disruptive to their civilian life and what we would  like  to

do  is  for the time that they are back in camp, to  use  the

time as usefully as possible.  For example, we minimise call-ups  on NSmen by grouping several activities together so that

they  would not be called up so many times.  I think  we  can

still do better.  We also do not call up all the NSmen in the

unit  altogether.  We stagger it so that those  who  need  to

come back earlier like the Commanders and so forth, come back

first,  and  the men come back later.  Also, Unit  Commanders

can  release  their units early if they achieve the  training

standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been using IT where we can. For example,

training materials are given to NSmen in the form of CD-ROMs,

so  that  they can train on their own and at their own  pace,

whereas  in  the  past we had to call them back  to  camp  to

undergo  that  kind of training.  We will  continue  to  seek

improvements  so that time spent on training  to  prepare  to

defend the country is well used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions have been raised on National Education.

National  Education is a key element in helping to strengthen

our  Total  Defence.   The Ministry  of  Defence  is  working

together  with Ministry of Education and other Ministries  on

Total  Defence  and National Education, to make  Singaporeans

and  new Singaporeans more aware of the need to be loyal  and

to  defend  Singapore.  And there is a coordinating committee

chaired by PS (PMO), who is also the PS (Defence), to oversee

the  National  Education  effort undertaken  by  the  various

Ministries and Government agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Ong for his complimentary

remarks about the food.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>

Regardless  of  that,  I  still  would  look  forward  to  an

invitation  to  his home for dinner.  I would  also  like  to

thank  Mr  Ravindran for his compliments on the recent  Total

Defence awareness programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran raised some points on defence science and

technology  research.  Technology is strategic to Mindef  and

the  SAF.  As a small country with limited resources,  it  is

important  for  us  to  leverage  on  others  to  obtain  the

technology  we  need.  Mindef actively seeks out  centres  of

excellence  in  our  industries,  universities  and  research

institutes, as well as those in other countries who are  open

to   collaborate  with  us.   Of  course,  there   are   some

limitations because of security considerations, both on their

part  and our part.  Mindef will continue to do this  in  the

new Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).  Funding is

awarded  to the most competitive proposals and joint  funding

is  the  norm where two or more parties are interested.   The

DSTA  will  continue to look at the best ideas regardless  of

their origin for the benefit of Mindef and the SAF.  In fact,

today,  defence  R&D  is not just done in  the  DSO  National

Laboratories  but also at our two universities  and  national

research  institutes  as well as with foreign  partners.   We

have  been doing this with our universities for over 10 years

and   a  number  of  dual-use  research  centres  have   been

established  to  better  tap universities'  expertise.   This

effort will be expanded further with the setting up of  DSTA.

DSTA's funding for science and technology will be directed at

solving  problems of defence.  But this can often be  applied

to   commercial  arena.   And  where  such  applications  are

beneficial to the nation, DSTA will be open to explore  their

exploitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Mindef does set aside a portion of its R&D

funding for the exploration of future technologies and system

concepts to ensure a good balance between technology push  as

well  as the demand pull.  That is, what the users want today

and what the technology can offer perhaps tomorrow.  This has

been an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>

integral  part of Mindef's policy on research and development

for  many  years.   This  approach  will  continue  with  the

establishment of DSTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ravindran also asked about East Timor. During

the  INTERFET phase - from mid-September last year to the end

of  February this year - Singapore contributed three  Landing

Ship  Tanks,  a  C-130 aircraft, a medical detachment  and  a

military liaison team.  Our LSTs were the main strategic lift

assets of INTERFET.  I understand that they carried some  60%

of  the  sea  lift  cargo  for INTERFET.   They  helped  meet

INTERFET's surge requirements during the build-up  phase  and

transition to UNTAET, lifting about 2,400 tonnes of cargo  in

all descriptions, shapes and sizes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of last month, our medical team had treated about

6,500  people,  both  INTERFET  personnel  as  well  as  East

Timorese.    All   in  all,  close  to  400   SAF   personnel

participated in INTERFET.  And this number includes 43  full-time National Servicemen who have volunteered for the mission

as well as eight regular servicewomen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For UNTAET, Singapore has contributed a 21-member SAF

medical  team, three military officers to UNTAET headquarters

and  40  civilian  police  from the Singapore  Police  Force.

Singapore is also prepared to provide technical assistance to

East Timor within our means.  We hope that East Timor will be

able  to  achieve  a  smooth transition to  nationhood  under

UNTAET.   But  East Timor's requirements for  rebuilding  the

country  are  enormous,  and  the  assistance  of  the  whole

international  community and not just the regional  countries

will be needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the threats to the safety of our personnel in

East  Timor, when we send our people to such missions and  in

such  situations, there will always be some  inherent  risks.

But  our  people  are professionals, and I am confident  that

they are trained to deal with such eventualities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have dealt with most of the issues that

Members have raised.  The Ministry of Defence wishes to thank

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>

Members  for  their questions and contributions  during  this

debate  and also for their support.  Mindef will continue  to

endeavour to do its best with the resources allocated  to  it

by  this House to fulfill its duty of defending Singapore and

Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the DPM and the

Ministers  for their very full and comprehensive replies  and

we  are rest assured that Mindef is in good hands and that we

are able to defend our country.  Also, I am glad that we have

used  our  time  very efficiently and that we  have  finished

before the "guillotine" time.  It is a very rare occurrence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $6,562,000,000 for Head K ordered to stand

like  to thank Members who have just taken part for being  so

merciful.  Perhaps for the remaining days, hon. Members could

take the cue from those who have just spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view that we have some time - it is a bit of a

bonus  for me - I would take the opportunity to elaborate  on

an  area  which is of interest to me, and I hope  that  other

Members  would be able to join in the debate to  make  it  as

lively as possible.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in connection with family and sports policies, I

see  it  is a very important issue.  As we have just finished

debate  on the Ministry of Defence, we are now entering  into

an  area of social defence and this is a very important  area

that  we  should  examine and see how we can  strengthen  the

people sector.  We should particularly re-examine and revisit

some  of  these  areas  in  order to  see  how  we  can  make

Singaporeans  more  caring and more supportive  in  terms  of

others  who need support within our community.  This is  very

critical because we need not only the hardware that  we  have

built  over  a  period of time, but also the  heartware.   We

require people to build better communities.  This is an  area

that  we  feel more funding can be deployed so  that  in  the

longer  term,  we  will  be  able  to  build  a  more  viable

community. Singaporeans can be more reciprocal and be able to

provide  the necessary support to those Singaporeans who  may

require assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, what I am saying is that those who can must

support  those  who  cannot.  The  question  is:  how  do  we

encourage  and  cajole Singaporeans who have the  ability  to

contribute to those who are less able than themselves?  To do

that,  I  would urge all Singaporeans to stand tall and  find

ways  that  they  can  contribute meaningfully  in  community

building and bring about a better social cohesion within  the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked about the digital divide, we have talked

about  communities with different social classes; we want  to

prevent abrasions in the community; we want to look at how we

can  socially  integrate communities and between  the  races,

social  classes and the different intellectual gaps  that  we

have.   All  these are essentially important and we  have  to

seriously  examine  what we can do as  a  community  so  that

Singaporeans  will be able to respond quickly to  participate

in  social defence, an issue which remains very critical  and

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge our community to examine what each of us

can  contribute.  It requires serious gumption, analysis  and

review of what we can do, as Singaporeans, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>

contribute  to the social development of our community.   And

we  are  talking about people development, an issue which  is

very  important, other than defence and economy.  It  is  the

people sector that we will have to seriously look at and find

ways  and  new  strategies to see how we can  strengthen  the

tenacity  and capacity of Singaporeans further.   This  is  a

serious business because dealing with people is very complex.

And  it is a very complex issue that requires the examination

mobilisation  of  different effective  people  strategies  to

build   people  to  be  better  people.   I  hope  my  fellow

Parliamentarians will be able to join me to see  how  we  can

encourage  and support the Ministry of Community  Development

to  undertake  its new mission and role because the  Ministry

has  added  a  new  portfolio, that  is,  sports  within  its

purview.   This  is a welcomed change and  we  are  not  only

trying  to  build a sporting community, but also a  group  of

people who are viable, caring and supportive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must draw your attention that we will be facing

serious consequences in view of our declining population.  As

you  know,  we are now having about eight persons  supporting

one  retiree.  In about 20 years, it will be half.   We  will

have  only  four  persons supporting one retiree  and  it  is

indeed  a burden that we will be running into.  It is a  very

important  arena and Singaporeans need to examine  what  they

can  do  to  arrest  this  declining  population  other  than

allowing  immigrants  and  others to  come  in  and  inviting

foreign  talents  and  other  people  to  contribute  to  our

economy.  Singaporeans themselves must critically study  what

they  can do to contribute to this declining population  that

we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue would have serious ramifications for our

community,   as   you  would  appreciate.    We   will   have

insufficient people to defend ourselves.  We have just talked

about  defence.    We  will have less people  to  defend  our

nation  and  to participate in National Service.  Eventually,

what do we do?  Where do we get sufficient people to serve in

the National Service?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>

Dr  Ong, Member for Bukit Timah GRC, has just spoken that  we

have  a very viable defence policy.  But there is nothing  to

defend  if we do not have any people.  That is an issue  that

we  need  to look at very seriously.  It is indeed a  serious

business that we need to examine and see how we can encourage

Singaporeans to replace themselves.  It is very important  to

find a reasonable replacement level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are unable to defend ourselves, where do we get

the  people?   If we do not have enough people,  we  have  to

import  mercenaries to defend us.  That is a serious question

which we have to look into.  I hope that we would not get  to

that stage.  Therefore, we will have to see how we can cajole

Singaporeans to find a reasonable replacement for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other serious consequence is that we will have less

manpower  to man our social and economic sectors.  This  will

in  the  long term affect our viability.  I am sure you  will

agree  with me that we require people to manage the  economy,

run  the  industries and to meet the challenges ahead.   That

you  will  require  the  people's contributions.   With  less

people  available, the burden will increase in the  hands  of

the few that we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we do not have enough people, the economy is likely

to  run  down.  We will become less productive and  therefore

less able to manage and mobilise resources to revitalise  and

make further economic progress.  That is a very serious issue

that  we  have  to  think about.  Who is  going  to  man  the

industries,  the  manufacturing  sector  and  the   different

enterprises that we have?  We have talked about a  knowledge-based economy.  We have talked about entrepreneurship.  If we

do  not  have  people,  all this comes  to  naught.  But  the

question is whether we would be able to arrive at that  level

if we are going to face the problems of population decline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of Members that our

replacement rate, in the last 20 years, had fallen  from  2.8

in 1970 to 1.5 in 1998.  Therefore, we are reducing by nearly

half.  This is indeed a very important issue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try and round up, Sir. There are some pressing

issues that I need to highlight and I hope you will give me a

few minutes to just round up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will give you one minute.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> We have young people whom we need to cajole.

Therefore, it is very important that we give them  the  right

signals.  I appreciate that it is a challenging task to bring

up  children.  There are different complex issues facing  the

family  today and we need to appreciate some of the  problems

so that we can make child rearing and bringing up children  a

pleasant  task.  But it is a challenging task,  I  must  say,

because there are competing demands on the family itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Community Development is trying its

best  to  strengthen  the  work  of  the  Family  Development

Division.  And I feel it has a very important role to play in

developing  more  programmes to  support  young  families  in

childcare  and encouraging the bringing up of more  children.

So  the  issue of procreation requires the attention of  more

Ministries  than MCD.  I do not think that MCD is sterile  of

ideas.  Given the current resources, MCD is doing a good  job

and with more help given it can be effective.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Vasoo, that is enough. Please

resume your seat.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, pleading the cause of the family

to  the  Minister for Community Development is not just  like

preaching  to  the  converted, but  to  the  bishop  himself.

Nevertheless,  I  think it may sometimes be  useful  for  the

bishop  to  be  able  to say to the other monsignors  at  the

Vatican that the parishioners are clamouring for attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has laid out in great detail the philosophical

and conceptual ground work on which we can start this debate.

I  am  going  to  talk  about  a  few  nitty-gritty  details.

Firstly,  I  am  really very happy to see in the  budget  the

provision  for 49 new childcare centres and 25  student  care

centres.   I  remember previous briefings that  I  have  had,

while serving on various

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>

committees,  from MCD officers who have spoken  of  plans  to

gradually  increase child and student care  centres.   And  I

would  like  to  commend the Ministry  for  delivering  these

commitments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49 childcare centres equate to about one new childcare

centre  every  week  and 25 student care centres,  one  every

fortnight.   However, numbers, although  important,  are  not

the  be-all  and  end-all of the issue.  The recruitment  and

training  of  childcare  teachers  and  assistants,  both  in

numbers  and  in calibre, remain a concern.  Last  year,  MCD

developed   guidelines   for   qualifications   required   of

supervisors  and  teachers  in  early  childhood   care   and

education.  But I suspect that we may be in a bit of  a  bind

here  as  the  poor  salaries that these  jobs  command  will

attract and retain staff of only a certain level of education

and  calibre.  Yet attractive salaries can only  be  afforded

with  higher fees and/or higher subsidies.  I wonder  if  the

Minister can share with us if there is any review plan  being

undertaken on this subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards and quality of care provided, methodology used

and curriculum covered and their consistency across the range

of  centres run by different operators with childcare centres

under the supervision of MCD and kindergartens under MOE  are

a  major  concern,  and  there  has  been  an  extensive  and

impassioned media coverage of the subject in recent weeks.  I

will  not delve on the subject here as I know the whole issue

of  pre-school  is currently being reviewed  by  a  committee

under  Senior Minister of State for Education, Dr Aline Wong,

with participation and representation from MCD.  I am sure we

will get a comprehensive and lively debate on the subject  of

pre-school education under the MOE cuts.  Suffice for  me  to

say  that  I  do hope that many issues brought up  in  public

discussion in recent weeks will be ironed out and we will see

a  system put into place which will put a stop to the  spiral

of increasing expectations on our very young children.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other item, with regard to childcare centres for the

Minister's consideration is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>

whether  the  provision of infant care services for  children

from 2 to 18 months can be encouraged, through increasing the

subsidy for this service to offset the higher cost that comes

from  the  higher  staffing ratios that  this  age  group  of

children require.  Currently, very few childcare centres take

in  children below 18 months and it will be most  helpful  to

those  parents who wish to use such a service if more  places

were available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to student care centres, my main request here is

for more school-based centres, as I believe this will be much

more  convenient for parents who would then not need to worry

about transporting the child to and from school and community-based  centres.  For both child and student care  centres,  I

hope  that  the  Minister  will periodically  review  subsidy

levels.  As the financial burden of childcare arrangement  is

not  insignificant, even with the Government  subsidies,  the

dollars  quickly  add up, especially if the family  needs  to

care for more than one child.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to get into

the  debate  again.   The family is under  competing  demands

today.  As  you know, many of them are dual income  families.

They  have to look after children.  They have to manage their

work,  and  they  have to cope with their household  demands.

These  are  issues  we need to address and I  understand  the

Ministry of Community Development has set up various  support

services  for  the families but I think it is very  important

for us to understand the changes that have taken place in the

family  and  there are more changes to come.  There  will  be

various  competing demands on the families of the future.  It

is  important  that  we set up at least an  Inter-Ministerial

Committee  on  Family Life and Development to look  into  the

matter more carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Ministry alone will not be able to

manage  and  tackle  the  problem  because  it  requires  the

intervention  of  other Ministries.  Therefore,  it  is  very

important that we draw the participation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>

of  other  Ministries to examine the issues  of  family  life

which  have implications on young children and young persons.

In  relation  to  this,  we  are  also  concerned  about  the

increasing  number of issues related to juvenile  delinquency

because  families are unable to provide care and  supervision

for  some  of them.  We have latchkey children and  therefore

there  is  an  increase in juvenile-related problems  in  the

community  and  this problem is related to the  family  as  a

whole.  I  would like to find out from the Minister what  has

happened  to  the revision to the Children and Young  Persons

Act  and  what steps would be taken to deal with the juvenile

delinquency problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with sports, to encourage children and

young  persons to become sportsmen, and as we want  to  be  a

sporting nation, we need to produce a number of international

sportsmen.   There  is a need to mobilise more  resources  to

promote outstanding sportsmen in the different areas. I would

like  to find out from the Minister what plans there  are  to

deal with the whole issue of sports and sports development.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister to comment on how youth affairs are managed  in

Singapore.   To the best of my knowledge, there are  a  whole

range of organisations that deal with matters of interest and

importance  to youth. We have the People's Association  Youth

Movement,   which  is  involved  through  its   multi-various

agencies  in  the  community  centres,  the  Youth  Executive

Committees. We have the National Youth Council, which is also

involved in youth-related affairs but largely working through

VWOs.  The Ministry of Community Development itself has  some

degree   of  focus  on  youth-related  matters  through   its

division,  and  other Ministries, such  as  the  Ministry  of

Education and the Ministry of Home Affairs, for example, deal

with  certain  aspects  of their work which  pertain  to  the

youth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be far-fetched to argue that there would be

significant scope for synergy in bringing some of the issues

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>

together  in dealing with matters that affect the  youth.  In

particular,  Sir, about a week or so ago, the National  Youth

Council held a seminar with young Singaporeans in which  many

voiced  out  this concern, that is, whether the interests  of

the youth are well-taken care of, especially when we have  an

ageing population which will appear, at least, in theory,  to

compete with the interest of the young and also as many other

social   pressures  are  brought  to  bear   on   our   young

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have for the Minister then is whether

there is scope to establish a focused central body, perhaps a

statutory  board,  or a department under  the  aegis  of  the

Ministry  of Community Development, to address youth  matters

on  a  holistic basis. This could be a variation of  what  we

already have, in the form of the NYC or the PAYM or it  could

be  something entirely new and it need not encroach into  the

areas that are traditionally the responsibility of MOE or the

Ministry  of  Home  Affairs. But  certainly,  on  the  social

aspects of youth matters, this can be addressed.   There have

been  calls for a Youth Ministry but I suspect the  arguments

there  are not strong enough or compelling enough, but  there

is  a  reasonable  case  to be made for  a  more  centralised

approach to coordinate certain efforts targeted at the youth.

I  would  appreciate  it  if the Minister  could  give  us  a

response on this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the dual-income families are a normal

phenomenon in Singapore these days and female workers account

for about 40% of our total workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contributions of women to their families and to

their  country  are indeed substantial.  A  majority  of  our

working  women  are  holding full-time jobs,  just  like  our

working   men.   But  women  continue  to  bear  the  primary

responsibility for family and childcare tasks.  Studies  have

found that women in dual-income marriages encounter more role

overload  than their husbands. Working mothers, who are  torn

between  the demands of home and the workplace, are sometimes

troubled by problems such as unsupportive and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>

demanding  husbands, and rebellious and wayward children.  On

top of all these family problems is job stress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to beseech the Ministry of Community

Development to look at the help that can be rendered  to  our

dual-income  families  to  support  them.   If  we   can   be

successful in this area, we will be able to ensure more ideal

families,  especially in areas of stronger marriages,  better

procreation  and stable families.  It will  be  best  if  the

effort  in  this  area is done jointly  by  the  Ministry  of

Community   Development   together   with   other   concerned

Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very important that we encourage a change in

the mindset of many Singaporeans.  Husbands cannot depend  on

their  wives  to care for the entire household and  parenting

tasks  and, at the same time, bring in additional income  for

the family. Many men see participation in household tasks and

child  rearing as a threat to their masculinity.   There  was

one Aryee's research in 1992 in Singapore that found that job-homemaker  conflict  experienced  by  professional  women  in

Singapore   is   significantly  reduced  when  the   husbands

contributed  more hours in doing housework.  Spouse  support,

both physical and emotional, is therefore a vital recipe  for

working  women to cope better and a formula for a  successful

marriage. The Ministry of Community Development should  steer

a campaign on this issue urgently and successfully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare is always an essential consideration for many

dual-income  families.  The Ministry of Community Development

should  therefore  continue  to provide  for  more  childcare

centres.  Could  the Ministry of Community  Development  also

provide  other new childcare assistance initiatives  such  as

"share-a-maid" and "borrow-a-granny" schemes?  Sir, with  the

"borrow-a-granny" scheme, a retired but well and able elderly

baby-sits  on  an ad-hoc basis for other residents  in  their

constituency. Such a scheme is best operated from our Centres

of  Activity for the Retired and Elderly where there are many

suitable elderly who may be willing to render such a service.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be beneficial if the Ministry of Community

Development  and  the Ministry of Manpower  work  closely  to

facilitate flexible work arrangements for working women.  The

Government   may  consider  providing  more   incentives   to

encourage  this  arrangement  and  to  ensure  its   success.

Employers  should be encouraged to transform  part-time  work

from  being  temporary and casual in  nature  to  that  of  a

permanent  scheme,  in  terms of job security,  remuneration,

benefits,  training  and  promotion prospects  to  the  part-timers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that is worthy of attention is job security

while families are pursuing procreation. Could the Government

persuade  employers, maybe in the form of certain incentives,

to  allow women to take longer unpaid maternity leave (up  to

one  year)  to care for their infants? Would the Ministry  of

Community   Development,   in   collaboration   with    other

Ministries, for example, Ministry of Manpower, facilitate the

option  of  job  sharing?   This has  worked  well  in  other

countries  and  a significant number of working  mothers  job

shared  effectively. Could we also look at more opportunities

being  made  available for working women to  work  from  home

either  on  a  part-time or full-time  basis?   Yet,  another

consideration is for the Government to approve paid leave for

a  parent  to  care  for  sick children.  This  should  apply

equally, both to a mother and to a father, and this will be a

strong  signal from the Government in encouraging  the  equal

role of child parenting in our families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Community Development could

consider  these  issues and help us have our families  strong

and stable.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, may I take my two cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Sure.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, MCD runs a family life education

programme.   The Ministry, through its various  agencies  and

working with other Ministries, for example, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>

Ministry  of  Health,  runs  a  whole  series  of  talks  and

organises workshops and seminars and produces a massive array

of  brochures and publications on marriage, married life  and

parenting.  Unfortunately, the reach of these efforts is very

limited.  The people who come for the talks and pick  up  the

brochures  are the ones already in the right church,  sitting

in  the right pew, nodding their heads in agreement with  the

sermon.   The  vast  majority of  Singaporeans  are,  in  the

meantime, carrying on chasing economic success with  no  time

at all to pay any attention to matters which, to them, are of

such  secondary importance.  Life in Singapore is couched  in

economic  terms,  that  is, gains and profits,  productivity,

value-added  propositions and marketability. We  have  little

time for family relationships and values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Singaporeans are delaying marriage and the

commonly  cited  reason  is  to achieve  financial  stability

first.  The  importance  of marriage  as  an  institution  is

undermined  by  the  monetary value  attached  to  the  first

matrimonial home that young couples aspire to own. I know  of

two young couples who rushed to the ROM to get registered  to

get  into the HDB queue, only to now be filing for separation

after finding out that they are not so compatible for a life-time   together   after   all.   Parents   abdicating   their

responsibilities  to  domestic helpers in  their  efforts  to

pursue  careers so they can afford the trappings of  material

success.    Students   are  focused   totally   on   academic

achievement.  Who has time for values?

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a much more concerted and comprehensive effort

to  address this culture and mindset which we have  built  up

over  the  past  couple of decades than it is  possible  with

MCD's  current resources available for family life education.

We  need  to  involve and engage many more  agencies  in  all

sectors,   public,  private  and  people,   the   media   and

individuals  themselves.  We should start in our  schools  to

broaden  the  life skills programme to include  making  right

life   choices,  gender  sensitivity,  civil   and   familial

responsibilities and care giving skills.  We need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>

think of all the ways we can reach out to catch the attention

of  Singaporeans, the young and the not so young as well,  as

they set the examples for the younger ones to follow, through

the  community, CDCs and grassroots organisations,  VWOs  and

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Community Development spoke over the weekend about  a  family

life ambassador initiative which the Ministry is preparing to

launch with companies at workplaces.  We need this and  other

such  efforts.   Hospitals could work with MCD  and  VWOs  to

reach young couples who come to these institutions when  they

have  their first and subsequent babies.  My own hospital  is

working on one such initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD can be the resource centre preparing the

informational, training and counselling materials, doing  the

research  on trends and tracking other countries' experiences

for   us   to  learn  from,  and  the  coordinator  and   the

facilitator.   But  we  need many,  many  more  parties,  all

sectors and individuals to be engaged in this effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked for an Inter-Ministerial Committee to

be  established  to  bring together a coordinated  effort  to

sustaining  and  strengthening  the  Singapore   family.    I

wholeheartedly support his call.  Obviously, many  Ministries

must  be engaged in this.  It is hard to divide clearly where

the  responsibility  and  impact of one  Ministry  stops  and

another begins.  I understand, of course, that there  may  be

other  similar  requests for such attention to  be  given  to

other issues that cut across Ministries, especially with  the

fine  example  of  the  effectiveness  of  such  an  approach

following  upon  the good work done by the  Inter-Ministerial

Committee on the Aging Population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation, I would like to suggest that every one

or  alternate years, the Prime Minister's Office selects  one

major  issue of concern for which an IMC be set up  to  drive

and coordinate the national effort.  And the first one on the

list must surely be an IMC on the family.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, we read in the

papers recently that babies were abandoned by parents.   Some

were  left at rubbish bins.  One was even found in the toilet

bowl.  Although the number is still small, there seems to  be

an  increasing trend since 1996.   These babies are at  great

risk  and may even die if they are not found in time.  May  I

ask  the Minister what is being done to educate young  people

about  the  help  that  they can receive  even  if  they  are

pregnant?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also want to know what studies have been done to

understand  the  profile of the parents who  abandoned  their

babies.   What  percentage of abandoned babies were  reunited

with their parents?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cities such as Hamburg in Germany where about 20

babies  were  abandoned  in  a  year,  the  authorities  have

introduced  what  is  known as babies slot,  where  desperate

mothers  can deposit unwanted babies.  When a baby is  placed

in the chute located at a daycare centre, it will fall into a

warm bed and is then registered at that centre.  Parents were

given  a few months to change their mind and they claim  back

the  baby.   Some  other  cities in  developed  nations  have

implemented similar baby deposits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the Minister's view of such a baby deposit?

Could  the Ministry try out one pilot site with a  VWO?   The

whole idea is to try to save as many babies as possible.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, building a cohesive and resilient

society by fostering strong and stable families is one of the

missions of the Ministry of Community Development.   The  way

MCD  aims to achieve this target is to try and reinforce  the

value  of  marriage, procreation and family.  As  dual-income

families have become the norm in Singapore, childcare  issues

have  also become an important component for the MCD and  its

mission.   I  would like, therefore, to raise  the  following

issues in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a shortfall of about 20% of childcare

centres  at the moment.  Some popular centres have, in  fact,

an uncomfortable waiting list of a few years. What

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>

are  the steps taken by the Ministry of Community Development

to  address  this  shortfall?  Could  the  MCD  rectify  this

shortfall as soon as possible?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New and densely built condominiums with many young

families  are the ones that need childcare centres the  most.

Disappointingly,  they are the ones that  have  no  childcare

centres within easy reach.   Residents of  new HDB flats have

to  wait  quite  a  while to get their  centres.   Could  the

Ministry  of Community Development have better provision  and

planning, in collaboration with other relevant Ministries, so

that sites for childcare centres for both the private and HDB

estates can be designated?  Sir, I hope that when it comes to

national  issues like this, the Government will  not  aim  to

cater  only for the public housing residents.  The Government

should  provide for all Singaporeans to reinforce the  values

of marriage, procreation and family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some private childcare centres are doing very well

and are in great demand.  However, many VWO childcare centres

cannot  do  as well, because they are stifled by Government's

intervention  in  "fees  fixing".  May  I  suggest  that  the

Government allow privatisation of the VWO childcare  centres?

The  Government could instead subsidise the more  needy  end-users.   A  "means  test" could be applied.   The  Government

should have a hands-off approach in the actual setting up  or

running of such centres.  Let more private organisations  run

such   centres.   The  Government  should  just  confine   to

stipulating  certain basic requirements to  ensure  standards

and  conformity.  Some may cite the fear of escalation in the

prices  charged  by VWO childcare centres  as  the  stumbling

block  for  such an idea.  Sir, this fear will  be  unfounded

when  there  is  competition and prices are  reached  through

market forces.  Furthermore, the Government can still control

the market through planned release of permits or premises for

childcare centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Community Development could

give us a favourable response to my above-mentioned requests.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, currently, there are 532 childcare

centres providing service to more than 33,759 children.  With

so  many  childcare centres set up by different organisations

ranging from VWOs to profit-making entities, there must be  a

variation  in the standard of service.  While there  are  MCD

guidelines  on  the  physical  standards  of  the   childcare

centres, there are variations in the service provided by  the

childcare  teachers.  Has the Ministry done  any  studies  to

profile  the  different  standards  of  service  and  try  to

normalise the standards?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, MCD announced that in five years'

time,  the  qualification  requirement  for  supervisors   of

childcare  centres would be raised from the current  advanced

certificate level to diploma level.  I support this  move  by

the  Ministry  to  raise the quality of care  which  children

receive in the childcare centres.  Many families make use  of

childcare  centres and the children spend long hours  in  the

centre.  It is therefore important that the centre is able to

provide  a  nurturing  and stimulating  environment  for  the

children.  Recent research has shown that the early years  of

a  child's  development is crucial and can have  a  long-term

impact.   This  adds to the need to focus attention  on  this

area.   Since  the  Ministry is raising the standard  of  the

supervisors,  is  there  any plan to  gradually  improve  the

standard  of the childcare teachers and to raise the standard

of service?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that the Ministry has licensed childcare

centres  for many years.  With increasing evidence  that  the

early years of development are important, what other measures

the  Ministry has taken to ensure that the children are given

good care in our childcare centres?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, for young parents

living in new HDB estates, looking for a childcare centre  to

look  after their young children is invariably a big problem.

In  the new estates like Punggol and Sengkang, because of the

great number of young couples, the need for childcare centres

is also very great.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in my constituency, I requested the NTUC to

open a new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>

childcare  centre.  This childcare centre has  yet  to  start

operation  but  already the list is full.  Some  parents  are

very  anxious,  particularly those who have no  relatives  to

look  after  their children.  The MCD should also  coordinate

with  HDB  in  the development of these new towns,  providing

more childcare centres to satisfy the needs of the people.  I

hope  that MCD would empathise with the worried young parents

and  should not only depend solely on the old data of  demand

and supply.  We should also consider other factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, working mothers' participation in the

workforce is relatively low compared to other countries.  The

main  factor  is because there is no one to look after  their

children.  Can we do as in the European countries to  provide

more  subsidy to professional childcare providers  so  as  to

encourage  more women to go back to work?  More  importantly,

providing   more   childcare  facilities  will   reduce   our

dependence on foreign domestic help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now have 100,000 foreign maids. I hope that we

should  let children in the 3-6 years old age group be looked

after by well qualified and trained childcare operators,  and

we  should  not  leave them to foreign maids  who  come  from

different  cultural and language backgrounds.  The  formative

ages  of  3-6 years old are very important to the development

of children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, marriages to foreigners have been

a   subject  that  has  received  much  media  publicity  and

interest.   Not  too long ago, we read in  the  papers  of  a

widely  publicised divorce between a lady from  Shanghai  and

the son of a family that runs a successful shipping business.

That  case generated much interest because of the substantial

amount  of  money  which  this lady  received  following  the

divorce.  In the minds of many Singaporeans, I am sure, is of

the view that this lady from China had a windfall as, but for

the  marriage,  she would probably not have acquired  even  a

fraction of the assets that were given to her.  This case has

also  left  many  Singaporeans wondering  whether  this  lady

actually married the man for his money.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not passing judgment here, as I do not think I

am  in  a position to.  However, this anecdote does highlight

one  potential  problem of Singaporeans marrying  foreigners.

Objectively  speaking, one would often ask how many  of  such

marriages are really out of feelings for one another and  how

many are contracted by the foreign party as a means to escape

the  harsh realities of the home environment, and that  there

was not any serious intention of settling down with the party

concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me tell you yet another story. A constituent

came  to  see  me  one  day.  He walks with  a  limp  and  is

handicapped and I learned subsequently that he is handicapped

because of a gunshot injury that he received in the course of

his  duty as a policeman.  He was compensated for his injury.

Upon his discharge from the force, he managed to set up stall

as a canteen operator to support himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, life was lonely for him. Being unable to marry

a  local lady, this man resorted to looking for a bride  from

China.   He  found one from a big city and married  her.   He

thought he had found marital bliss.  This was not to  be.   I

learned that his wife was not really keen on helping  him  to

manage  his  business.   Soon she  left  him  and  filed  for

divorce,  even though, as he claimed, he  had been very  nice

to her.  She claimed a substantial portion of his assets, and

even  got  his car seized to satisfy the order of court.   On

top of it all, he tells me that she started cohabiting with a

man  in  the  same flat that she paid for out of the  monthly

maintenance  sum that he gives her.   This man  has  seen  me

many times and pleads for justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not hear the full story. It may be that she

genuinely wanted to start a new life with another man, or  it

may  be  that  she  is  the devious scheming  lady  who  took

advantage  of  my constituent.  If the latter were  true,  it

would indeed be a tragedy for him.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This episode raises a basic question of whether the

State has any responsibility

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>

towards  Singaporeans of similar circumstances  that  I  have

described.   I  know that it would not be  possible  for  the

Government  to keep a look-out for every Singaporean  who  is

gullible or weak.  Neither can it be said that the Government

has  no  duty  in a situation like this.  Instinctively,  our

sense  of  justice  tells  us  that  what  has  happened   to

Singaporeans who married scheming spouses who took them for a

ride,  is  not  right.   It is not easy  to  deal  with  this

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given the immense trauma that broken marriages

bring  about,  I would like to ask the Minister  to  consider

getting proper marriage counsellors to help Singaporeans come

to  a  carefully  thought  out  decision.  Additionally,  the

Women's  Charter is primarily meant to protect the rights  of

women.  However, the Women's Charter should not be abused  by

others  for  their own benefit.  This was certainly  not  the

intention  of this House and should not be seen by others  as

such.   Perhaps  the Women's Charter should  be  looked  into

again to see how such abuses can be avoided.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According to

the  records, there is a clear decline in our birth  rate  in

Singapore.   In 1988, the average birth rate was  1.96  child

per  family.   In  1999, it has reduced to 1.48  per  family.

This  clear  decline of birth rate  is a very serious  trend.

We are already approaching Japan's low birth rate of 1.42 per

family.   We  have to do something seriously and urgently  to

address the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, the problem then was that there were some

highly  educated people who were not married.   Now,  in  the

1990s  the problem is further extended. Even among  the  non-graduates,  there  are  many who  are  not  getting  married.

According  to statistics, about 15% of  our people above  the

age of 40 are single.  Our society has also faced the problem

of people getting married very late and had their first child

late.  The average age of having the first child increases to

28.5  last year from the 27.5 in 1990.  The situation now  is

that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>

are  unable to replace ourselves.  This would imply  that  in

future we would face the problem of an ageing population  and

it will affect us socially and politically.  As it is, we are

expecting that by 2030 every four economically active persons

will have to support one senior citizen above the age of  65.

So  our  economic  burden  will be very  heavy  and  it  will

certainly  affect our quality of life.  More importantly,  we

may  not be able to look after our aged relatives and we  may

have to depend on foreign maids to look after them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, our economic prospects for the 21st

century  are quite  optimistic. We are forecasting some  5-7%

annual  growth  rate.   However, if  our  population  is  not

growing  enough in the next 30 years, this vision of  a  5-7%

annual growth rate cannot be sustained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Dr Vasoo asked Dr Ong who is going to defend

us in time of war.  Even with the most sophisticated weapons,

if  we  do  not  have enough people, who shall operate  these

weapons  to  defend us?  If we cannot replace ourselves,  our

population  will  shrink  and we may  have  problems  in  our

national defence in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, our Minister for National Development

painted  a  picture  of how Singapore is going  to  become  a

vibrant  city, that is,  by the year 2040.  Our society  will

be  able to accommodate some 5.5 million people.  We want  to

have a population of 5.5 million in 2040, but our people  are

simply  not  giving birth to enough babies to  make  up  this

number.   Then, perhaps some 30% of the population will  have

to  be foreign immigrants and  not descendants of our present

population.   This will result in great changes to our social

structure.   Now  we  are talking about how  to  enhance  our

social  cohesiveness, how to preserve our roots  and  how  to

maintain  our traditions and social values.  If  we  have  to

depend  on  the large inflow of immigrants and  their  number

become  significant in our society, then all these values  we

talk about will, therefore, no longer be relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, the political scene at that time may

be quite different from what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>

we  may imagine it to be.  This is a very serious problem. We

have to resolve the matter and find thorough solutions to the

problem  before it becomes worse.  This is not a new problem.

The problem is that before the measures taken could have been

effectively  solved, the problem happened in  the  past,  new

problems  have emerged and resulted in the awkward  situation

that we are now in.  In the past, we gave a lot of incentives

to  encourage our people to have more babies.   We  gave  tax

concessions, priority for  HDB flats, longer maternity leave,

etc.   But  these  measures were unable to reap  the  desired

results.  Come to think of it, if we had not done all  these,

the situation could well be worse now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this problem should not be left solely to

the Ministry of Community Development to solve. It has to  be

resolved by a high-level Inter-Ministerial Committee. This is

a  very  complicated matter because every individual  in  our

society has his or her own problems. The needs are different,

the aspirations in life are different.  We have to resolve it

according to their needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would classify the reasons for people not having more

children into the following six categories:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can give birth and willing to give birth, but no

opportunity to give birth -  non-marriage;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Willing to give birth but cannot give birth - infertile;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can give birth, but unwilling to give birth - unwilling;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Can give birth and willing to give birth, but

unwilling  to  give birth early in life - unwilling  to  give

birth early;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Can give birth, willing to give birth but unwilling

to have many children -  limited birth; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Can give birth, willing to give birth, and willing

to have more children but received no encouragement - refused

birth.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no simple solution to all these problems. For

those  who would like to have children, they may not be  able

to give birth. Some of them do not want to get married.  Some

want  to  get  married but do not have the opportunity.   For

example,  one  well-known local columnist  mentioned  in  her

column  that she could have lost her chance in life.  In  the

past,  we  had  the SDU, the community centres and  even  the

universities  trying  ways and means to create  opportunities

for  young  people to be paired up, to develop  a  courtship,

with  the  hope of leading to marriage. But the results  have

not  been encouraging.  Among  those who are 40 years old and

above,  16% are not married.  This is a high figure.  Perhaps

in the past we had not done enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, we have to redouble our efforts and the

Ministry   has  to  spend  more  money  and   organise   more

activities.   The Ministry of Education has to  work  on  the

school  children.  As for cases of infertility, we  have  now

all  sorts  of   scientific methods, such  as  the  test-tube

babies  and  surrogate mothers, etc. to  help  the  infertile

couples.   However,   notwithstanding  all   these   advanced

technologies,  the cost is still exorbitant. Only  those  who

are  from  the  well-to-do families can afford such  methods.

This  is a very important problem. The Government should  see

how  it can help to cut cost or subsidise the needy, so  that

even  ordinary  citizens can avail themselves  of  all  these

medical  technologies to give birth to  their  own  children.

For  those  who  are  willing to have children  but  are  not

prepared  to have them at a young age, some do not  have  the

confidence  to  be  father and mother, they  need  plenty  of

encouragement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, you have exceeded your time.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Let me conclude.

Generally  speaking, this is a matter which has to  be  taken

beyond  MCD.   It  has to be done through  an  inter-ministry

effort. This is not for just one Ministry to tackle.  I  hope

the  Government  will set up an Inter-Ministry  Committee  to

thoroughly resolve this matter

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Claire Chiang, you can speak now.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank

you, Sir, for the opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take my first cut on restoring family ties. In

our   efforts  to  globalise  in  a  pace  that  results   in

fragmentation  of the self and family ties,  the  family  has

become  an  endangered institution because of  the  pressures

which  are building up from within and without.  These issues

concern me because the weakening of the family ties erodes  a

fundamental capability - our ability to mobilise  our  people

and enterprises to upkeep our national resilience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, Sir, to give a quick snapshot on some trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Marriages are not the norm. Statistics show that

better  qualified females are more likely to  be  single  and

single males too are on the rise.  Something is happening  at

the dating phase between boys and girls which need our honest

tackling of gender relationships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The average family size is getting smaller from 4.7

in  1980 to four in 1995 because young couples prefer to  set

up  homes  away  from  their parents  and  are  having  fewer

children.  What  this  means is we have lost  the  "extended"

family ties to support the needs of working couples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The number of divorces registered under the Women's

Charter  among non-Muslim couples increased 14% between  1997

and  1998, the Muslim divorces increased  in the same  period

by  21%.   What  we are saying is that in 1998 we  had  5,651

divorces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Family violence was another cause for divorces,

increasing  from  978  in 1995 to  2,000  in  1997.   It  was

forecasted  that by end of 1998, there were 2,600  complaints

being filed.  Some cursory observations also noted that older

persons  were divorcing due to mainly incompatibility.   What

this  all means is the rise of single family households  with

women looking after the needs of children on their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) With more parents working, children who were

unsupervised easily fell prey to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>

bad  company.  We saw the rise in juvenile delinquency  among

those  aged between 7 and 15 years old by 14.5%.  Of the  495

rape  victims between 1994 and 1998, 32% were between 10  and

14  years  old.   Parents  were often  shocked  to  find  out

afterwards what their children had been up to, indicating the

loss of communication and proper supervision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The Singapore population is aging. We have

highlighted  in  this  House  the  real  problems  of   their

employability   and   declining  healthcare   compounded   by

inadequate  savings  and  social  isolation.   Worse   still,

children  are  caring  less of their parents.   The  Minister

highlighted in a written reply that more than half  of  those

ordered to pay maintenance to their aged parents defaulted on

payments  last  year.   In  some families,  parents  took  up

enforcement proceedings against their children, resulting  in

sentencing them to a term of imprisonment.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this is a small number. It nevertheless

points  to  an  increasing pressure felt by the children  who

cannot  afford to meet the needs of parents.   Of  the  total

number of calls in CDCs National Helpline for 1999, close  to

60%  were  training  enquiries, job  matching  and  financial

assistance, including help with school fees, indicating  that

Singaporeans  were  facing real pressures of  employment  and

financial insecurity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are finding difficulty in forming family ties

and  once  formed, we are seeing faultlines  at  all  levels,

between   spouses,  between  parents  and  children,  between

elderly  parents  and  mature children.   We  also  see  more

households  consisting of siblings, grandparents,  aunts  and

uncles  who offer invaluable support to strengthening  family

ties.   In  particular, the singles are the ones who continue

to  care for the old and the young.  In changing times,  with

increasing pressures, family ties will be forged by different

components  within the clan, creating a new understanding  of

"extended family" which must be respected and provided for.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all these permutations, the family cannot

reach  its  goals to make Singapore our Best Home by  itself.

It needs many helping hands from the social service sector as

well  as  the  public  and  private  sectors,  that  is   the

"community, infrastructure" to restore the "hardware"  within

the family members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoring family ties no longer can be the sole

responsibility  of  MCD,  because  as  every  Ministry  fixes

policies  on  taxes,  work arrangement, housing,  healthcare,

transportation and education, their decisions impact  on  the

resources  of  family.  The more resources we can  pour  into

organising these areas, in line with what Dr Jennifer Lee and

many  Members of the House had passionately put  across,  the

better we are in restoring family ties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will not delay in visibly putting

this  important  agenda on the family  at  the  forefront  of

Singapore's  development.   Whether  you  set  up  an  Inter-Ministerial  Committee on Family, or whether it should  be  a

Family  21, which I raised in last year's Budget debate,  let

there be a mechanism set up for deliberation and consultation

on family policies.  Family care may not configure in our GDP

calculations  and the return on investment in this  area  may

not  be as tangible as the financial sector, but a commitment

to  restoring family ties is providing Singapore  families  a

stronger  rudder to control its direction of travel  in  ever

rougher waters ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I would desire several small Inter-Ministerial committees which are issue-specific instead of

one  large  and  formal one, which often lacks  the  kind  of

processes and intimacy that encourage free-flowing  of  ideas

and  exchanges.   I  look forward towards a  mechanism  which

includes  representations from the  people  sector,  parents,

social  workers,  educators,  human  resource  officers   and

volunteers, so that we really make the strengthening  of  the

family the business of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I proceed to my second cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Thank you. I will do my

cut on parent care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have to indicate a crisis which the family is

facing  at  this point, I will say it is our parenting  role.

Sir,  parents  are  a special category of  people  who  needs

focused  attention,  the  same  way  we  focus  on  children,

students,  elderly, entrepreneurs, and so  on.   Parents  and

children are pulled by social forces between the pressure  of

work,  school work, friends and entertainment which  resulted

in them spending less time as family.  Having time to parent,

knowing  how  to parent and willing to parent  and  co-parent

between  husbands and wives are all significant issues  which

require  our  deep  reflection to restore  parenting  as  the

cornerstone of family development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me, Sir, to chart a wish list by parents in

different  stages of development so that policy  makers  with

the  help of CDCs and VWOs can plan their outreach programmes

with a more focused strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with children from 0-6 years old looks for

childcare facilities and good pre-school education to provide

the  foundation years for the child's growth.   It  does  not

matter  whether the parent is working or not, the search  for

good instruction to maximise children's total development  is

a strong desire in all parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with children from 7-12 years is obsessed by

making sure that their children pass examinations well.   One

of   the  best  attended  seminars  in  Singapore  are  those

organised  on "How to raise a successful child?" or  "How  to

increase your child's IQ?"  This pressure to perform well has

resulted  in  hot-housing  which stresses  both  parents  and

children.    What  this  portends  for  the  development   of

creativity which requires a free-will spirit is something  to

think   about.   Parents  want  to  learn  how   to   balance

expectations and capabilities without destroying the  natural

inclinations of the child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with children 13-16 years old looks for

instructions on how to discipline and teach his children good

values, how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>

to  transmit  life  skills  and  communicate  about  boy-girl

relationships.  This is the most critical and difficult phase

of  parenting, yet this is one area that many parents do  not

know  how  to  take  charge because they lack  the  know-how,

resources  and time.  As most children lack the communication

skills  to express the conflicts and anger in them, they  act

out  by shutting themselves out, or sometimes in defiant ways

like  joining  street gangs and indulging  in  all  sorts  of

undesirable  behaviour.  Parents want to  learn  how  to  re-connect  and  communicate with their teens and  their  peers.

Parental   re-education  and  retraining  becomes   just   as

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with growing teens from 17 to 20 is most

concerned with making sure that his children do not mix  with

the  wrong  crowd.  This is a real dilemma.  Given  the  fact

that   many  households  are  double  income  families,  with

husbands  and wives working long hours with little  rest  and

energy  left to mend and repair the home front, children  are

hence  left  to TV and friends to shape their growing  years.

Parents  wish  to learn how to spend quality  time  with  the

family  and  more  tips about how to stay "cool"  with  their

growing teens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably, by the age of 21, the role of parent is less

custodial  and  protective because by this  time,  the  child

should have some cognitive and emotional fundamentals to take

on life independently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need good programmes for parenting education.

No one can assume that parents know how to parent.  They must

be  given  the  tools,  skills and  encouragement  to  attend

seminars,  to  share  and  hear  how  other  people  cope  at

different   stages  of  family  development.    The   serious

challenge  to all this is:  how do we get these  parents  who

most  need the programmes to come forward in the first place?

How  do we change their mindsets about parenting and ask them

to  look at this responsibility seriously.  Sir, I will start

by encouraging every company in Singapore to allot one hour a

month for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>

such  talks  to  be  organised for their employees.   I  look

towards MCD and the National Youth Council, as well as  CDCs,

for their leadership in prioritising parenting education as a

paramount  component in family development strategy.   And  a

side  point,  I  hope the Leader of the House will,  in  next

year's  Budget meetings, not schedule Budget sittings on  the

week  of the school vacation because this deprives a  lot  of

parents in having this vacation with our children during  the

whole week.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, Assoc. Prof. Low

Seow  Chay  who  spoke before has already  touched  upon  the

declining  birth rate in Singapore.  I agree  with  him  that

nations  that cannot reverse their declining birth  rate  are

effectively committing collective suicide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, Japan has the most severe challenge in this

respect  as the number of children per woman in that  country

has  dropped  to  1.38.   The  Japanese  government  recently

commissioned  a  survey  of  young  men  and  women  of   the

marriageable age group to determine the reasons.   I  thought

it  would  be interesting to share some of the key  findings.

Of the men surveyed, 30% considered marriage a burden, and of

this,  50% gave financial factors as reasons.  Secondly,  40%

of  the women surveyed also viewed marriage as a burden,  and

the reasons given included house work, child rearing, looking

after   aged   parents-in-law  and  coping  with   the   dual

responsibilities of work and homemaking.  Asked whether  they

felt  that married couples should have children, over 20%  of

the  women between the age of 18 and 39 said "no".  And  this

is close to twice the percentage for men.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be interesting to find out the views of

young   Singaporeans  regarding  child  rearing  today.    In

response  to  the  survey I mentioned earlier,  the  Japanese

government  is introducing some of the measures  to  help  to

promote   child   rearing  support  and   they   are:     (1)

establishing  day care facilities near train stations,  which

is  quite interesting, and (2) extending child allowance  for

children from birth to pre-schools.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, of the various conveniences and incentives

that Members have come up with, all are remedial actions.   I

think  it  is  more important to determine what is  the  root

cause of declining birth rate.  We should dwell into what are

the perceptions of young men and women regarding family life.

It  must be stating the obvious, Sir, to say that the  number

of  children a family would have is largely determined by the

wife.  Whether a woman would like to have a large family or a

small one depends on the values inculcated in that young lady

many  years  ago.   Presumably, those  growing  up  in  large

families  that  are  warm and loving  will  hopefully  prefer

larger families, and those growing up in small families  will

naturally consider small as beautiful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to use my own family as an example.

Growing  up  in Singapore, I was conditioned to believe  that

two was the right number.  On the other hand, my wife grew up

in Hawaii in an extended family   So when we married 19 years

ago, her ideal family was to have five children.  Reality set

in  very  quickly  as  we both discovered  that  bringing  up

children  was a very demanding process.  And the end  result,

we  ended up with four.  But the important thing is we should

start  with  a  large number and hopefully you  end  up  with

something close to what we want to have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, the lesson learned is that it is very

important for a man to find a wife who wants a big family  in

the  first place.  Sir, I am not asserting that we  can  draw

conclusion  based on a sample size of one.   But  I  believe,

unless  we  inculcate the desire for children  in  our  young

women,  we  cannot  reverse the trend towards  our  declining

birth  rate.   Since we do not have large families  today  as

role  models,  we have no choice but to turn to the  schools.

But  I  doubt  this is a task that the Ministry of  Education

considers  as  part  of its portfolio.  So  somehow  we  must

change  the  perception, especially among  the  young  women,

towards  family.  In this aspect, I think I  am  treading  on

very  thin  ice.  If we need to change the woman's perception

from career orientation towards family orientation, and it is

the only way to reverse this trend, I think we have to do it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, turning around this view will require the

concerted effort of the whole Government and not just one  or

two  Ministries  alone.   In this respect,  I  would  support

wholeheartedly  the call by Dr Jennifer  Lee,  Dr  Vasoo  and

Prof. Low Seow Chay to have an Inter-Ministerial Committee to

work on this very important matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will now move into the sporting arena.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I would like to first declare

my  interest  as the President of the Singapore Table  Tennis

Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has provided a strong injection into

the  development of sports by incorporating sports  into  the

Community   Development  Ministry.    The   National   Sports

Associations   have  embraced  this  move   as   a   positive

inclination  towards Government's emphasis on the  growth  of

the sports industry in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Singapore Sports Council's Sports

Excellence  programme, with a number of  assistance  schemes,

provides a basic framework and infrastructure for our  sports

development.   Our  National Sports  Associations  have  been

categorised and received different amounts of subsidies  from

the  scheme.  However, this is not sufficient.  More  support

should  be  considered  for the areas  of  concern,  such  as

technical  development  of  the  core  sports  and   a   more

structured leadership development programme for all the NSAs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key area of concern is the housing scheme for

the various NSAs.  Homes for our National Sports Associations

are  important.  I hope the Government could evaluate on  the

various  sports  housing  schemes  for  our  National  Sports

Associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the local sports fraternity also needs human

capital.   Scholarships  and  a tailored  tertiary  education

programme  should be considered and provided in this  respect

to  assist  the  growth of the industry.   And  I  hope  more

support would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>

also  be  given for the organisation of international  sports

events in Singapore, like the recent 14th Commonwealth  Table

Tennis Championship.  This will give Singapore a new light as

a  country  with  a  positive outlook  towards  international

sports development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, in propelling Singapore's sports industry

in   a   new   time,  injection  of  subsidies  for   housing

development,   leadership  development  and   assistance   in

organising  international  sports  events  for  our  National

Sports Associations are very crucial.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, with the expansion of the MCD to

include sports at the Ministry level, sports finally  have  a

higher profile.  The signal is that the Government is finally

serious about sports.  In 1990, the formation of MITA allowed

the  arts  to take off in Singapore.  Hopefully, we  see  the

same results in sports.

Besides  Sports for All and Sports for Life, the  message  is

now  Sports  Excellence, Sports Tourism.  This will  spawn  a

whole  new sports industry with many exciting careers.   When

we  think  of  a career in sports, we probably think  of  the

professional  athlete winning the championship, world  famous

coach, sumo wrestler or sports commentator on TV.  But  these

high  visibility  roles are only the tip of a  business  that

spawns  professional sports, sports education, amateur sports

and all the services that support them.  So if a person loves

sports  and wants to spend a sports career, there is probably

a  role that will match the passion and skills set that  will

provide  a  sports  career.  The sports industry  in  Britain

generates  more than pound8 billion sterling in  revenue  per

year.   The  number of sports-related jobs in British  sports

increased from 10,000 in 1985 to 470,000 in 1990.  There  are

literally  thousands  of  different jobs  related  to  sports

encompassing virtually every business discipline in  addition

to  actual play and coaching.  The Americans spent about US$6

billion a year on spectator sports.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, until now, the main concern of parents when they

decide  whether  their children should go into  training  for

sports  excellence  is whether there is a good  career  path.

Sportsmen  and  sportswomen themselves are  also  asking,  is

there  any  sports  career?  Even that we  want  more  sports

persons.   We need to consider what is being done to  develop

the  sports career or sports persons.  What is the Ministry's

plan on this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give our sports a boost and lift it to higher levels,

foreign  talents would have to be imported.  While  they  can

play  a  supporting  and aspiring role with  local  athletes,

challenging  and  motivating them to excel, they  should  not

replace  our local talents.  With money, we can buy the  best

sports persons and field them in our national teams.  But  we

must  ensure  that  the  foreign  talents  must  be  able  to

assimilate into our Singapore society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what strategies and programmes

would  be put in place to provide our local sports talents  a

good  sports  career. The field lives of many  career  sports

persons can be limited perhaps due to injuries during play or

to  ageing.  The Ministry must therefore have a comprehensive

retraining programme for the career sports persons so that by

the  time  they retire from the field, they can also  have  a

rewarding second career.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> In December last year, at

the  Timesport  50  Greatest Athletes'  Ceremony,  our  Prime

Minister said that the time was right for Singapore  to  seek

more  ambitious  goals in sports.  In order  to  reach  these

goals,  I  believe we need a whole array of people,  and  not

just the sportsmen alone, to support this effort and build  a

general  infrastructure for sporting excellence.   First  and

foremost, we need to identify and cultivate sporting talents.

I  believe there are such talents, among our young, who  have

the  ability and inclination for sports.  However,  some  may

not  have  the ability to do well in mainstream subjects  and

who  may  drop out of school if they were to pursue  extended

curriculum.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there is a way to allow them to pursue their

talent more effectively, that is, to set up sports schools to

give  them  a customised programme to match their  interests,

career aspirations and abilities.  These sports schools could

be modelled after the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).

In  this case, we would be offering subjects that are related

to sports and sports businesses.  Besides scheduled training,

they  could  study other subjects, such as nutrition,  sports

psychology,  training  methodology  and  principles,   sports

sociology,   basic   bio-mechanics  and  sports   management.

Students would also have access to facilities, equipment  and

training that most could not otherwise afford.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such institutions could stand these students in good

stead,  helping  them carve out a future as  a  sportsman  or

woman, or being a part of sports management promotion, or  as

Dr  Ho  mentioned  just now, as part of the sports  industry.

Such  an alternative educational offering would also dovetail

nicely  into  the  Ministry  of  Education's  goal  of   mass

customisation  to  give students a basic  education  and  yet

provide  them with teaching in other selected areas.   Sports

schools  are  common  in other countries that  have  produced

world  class athletes.  Such schools are formidable, offering

boarding facilities, sports experts in various subjects along

with teachers in basic curriculum.  Such schools can play  an

essential  part in providing the infrastructure for  building

accomplished athletes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I begin by stating that I am

the  President  of the Singapore Badminton Association.   The

Prime Minister has set goals for the nation to achieve in the

international   competition  for  football,   badminton   and

sailing.    For   Singapore  to  achieve  consistently   high

standards  in  all these sports and other core sports,  there

should   be   a  concerted  effort  to  train  the  athletes.

Obviously,  the  skills,  interest  and  commitment  of   the

athletes  have to be inculcated from young.  The best  period

is  actually when they are in schools.  However, the Ministry

of Education views sports as only part of its core curriculum

programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to win honours for Singapore in the top league

competition, it is necessary for the new Ministry to take  on

producing  athletes as its mission.  Today, we are  depending

on  chances  for  young  boys and girls  to  emerge  who  are

prepared  to  sacrifice the standard career  path  to  pursue

their  interest in sports.  Furthermore, to do so, they  need

to have the support of their parents in this area.  Given the

Singapore  environment,  therefore,  producing  champions  is

going to be a random and very rare event.  If we were to have

any chance of meeting the goals set by the Prime Minister,  I

believe  we need a process, something that Mr Ong had pointed

out,  to  produce a steady stream of young athletes  so  that

some  might go on to become champions.  Perhaps, the Ministry

should  take  this  on as part of its mission  for  producing

sportsmen  and women who are able to stand on  their  own  in

international competitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way of doing so is to establish sports schools for

young  and  budding athletes.  The sports  schools  could  be

modelled  after  those in Malaysia where  students  with  the

talents  in  sports  could focus their energy  in  developing

their   skills   and   yet  receiving  a   quality   academic

qualification  with  classes tailored around  their  training

schedules.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Ministry of

Community  Development  will  be  renamed  the  Ministry   of

Community  Development and Sports next month. It  shows  that

the Government is very serious about sports and has long-term

objectives to attain good results in the sports arena.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now competing in the Asian level. The Prime

Minister  has  set his goal for our national soccer  team  to

fight  for a place in the World Cup tournament proper by  the

year  2008.  In other sports, we have also set certain goals.

For the attainment of these goals, I have some suggestions to

make.  First,  we  must set up a sports  training  school  in

Singapore.  For the arts, we have the Nanyang Academy of Fine

Arts. For sports, we should have an Academy of Sports.  While

we have upgrading for our HDB flats, and even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>

private housing estates, we should also have plans to upgrade

our National Stadium and Indoor Stadium and develop them into

a  centre  for sports training and competition, or  a  sports

village.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have facilities to house our sportsmen and

sportswomen  so that they can train in an in-camp environment

to have better concentration to undergo more focused training

in  order to improve their performance and go all out to  win

medals for Singapore in international competitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must also set up scholarship schemes for

our   talented  sportsmen  and  sportswomen  who   have   the

aspiration to be world-beaters. The Government has all  along

been  giving  scholarships to students who excel in  academic

studies.  I  think it is time for the Government to  consider

giving  sports scholarships to encourage our young people  to

contribute in the field of sports.  These  scholarships would

enable them to go overseas for professional training.  I read

in  the  newspapers about our crop of young  talents  in  the

various sports such as martial arts, bowling, swimming, table-tennis,  etc.   There  is  no  lack  of  sports  talents   in

Singapore.  We should identify them from young and give  them

the  much-needed encouragement and incentives in the form  of

sports scholarships.   We know that horses can run.  But  not

all horses can run well all by themselves. They need training

to turn into top race-horses. We must devote our resources to

encourage  and  train our sportsmen so that  they  have  good

training  facilities, good coaches and  good  environment  to

bring out their best performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must ensure that there will be a career for

our  sportsmen.  We note that our youths, and their  parents,

are  not  very keen to take up competitive sports  seriously,

because  they  worry about their future.   While  young  they

could  be  very good and could put in some good performances.

But what happens after they have passed their prime? There is

no safeguard in their career.  For example,  we have Chen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>

Yeow  Chuan and Ong Chin Hai who excelled in the martial arts

and  won  medals for Singapore in international competitions.

They  were  spotted by TCS and were offered a  career  as  TV

actors.   For  their future, they have to make  acting  their

career,  rather than staying on as sportsmen.  They  are  the

lucky  ones.  At least they can still practise their  martial

arts.  But there are many other sportsmen and sportswomen who

simply faded out of the sports scene in order to pursue other

careers as a means to earn a living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the Government should do something to provide

some  safeguard  for the sports people by  guaranteeing  them

some  form of job security.  We should help to map  out  some

kind of career path for them so that they will have the peace

of  mind to concentrate on their sports training to bring out

the best in them and win medals for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we must have sufficient budget for all the

sports  associations.  Many of our sports  associations  have

funding  problems  and  they seem to be  spending  more  time

trying  to  raise  funds  than to  promote  sports.   Council

members  in  the  sports associations spend  a  lot  of  time

organising  all sorts of events to raise funds, year  in  and

year  out.  They have simply no time to develop their  sports

and  their  associations.  I hope MCDS  can  consider  giving

these  sports  associations 1  to  2,  or  1  to  3  matching

subsidies,  like  it  is  done for the Community  Development

Councils.    This way, the sports association will have  more

time  and  resources  to help our sportsmen  and  sportswomen

develop  their  potentials to the fullest,  and  hence  bring

glory to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Kenneth Chen is not here. Mr Ong Kian

Min.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> In promoting sports, I believe that

there  is  one  more sport in which Singaporeans  can  attain

international standing, that is, the sport of figure skating.

Singaporeans  can do well in figure skating for two  reasons.

First,  we  can  skate  on ice indoors all  the  year  round.

While  it  may be too hot and humid to play football outdoors

in the sun, at noon, it is not a problem to practise and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>

train  on  the ice skating rink indoors throughout the  whole

day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not need winter to have a frozen surface of

ice.   Unlike  skiing, when you need a mountain covered  with

snow,  you do not need a frozen lake to ice skate.   Whatever

the  temperature is outside, ice can be man-made by  machine,

whether  it  is  rain  or shine, hot or cold,  night  or  day

outside. We can ice-skate indoors any time of the day.

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, figure ice-skating does not require a strong

physique.   In sports like athletics, swimming or basketball,

a  tall or well-built person has a distinct advantage but  in

competitive  figure  ice-skating  where  both  artistry   and

athleticism   are  required,  a  small   built   is   not   a

disadvantage.  In fact, there are examples where  ice-skaters

have  overcome their own physical disadvantages and  excelled

in  the  sport.  These examples can be an inspiration to  our

young, whether they are budding sportsmen or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott Hamilton is a four-time world and gold medal

Olympic figure skating champion. He was a normal healthy  kid

until  he mysteriously stopped growing when he was five years

old.  The doctors never knew what was wrong with him. He just

had  no physical development at all. For four years, his body

was unable to absorb virtually any nutrition from the food he

ate.  For four years, he thought he would never grow  another

inch.   One day, he tried figure ice-skating and said, and  I

quote,  "It  was the one thing that I could do  on  an  equal

basis with the other kids."  After taking up the sport, Scott

regained  his health and had grown some more.  All  signs  of

his  illness  had  disappeared. Some  attributed  it  to  the

vigorous exercise of ice-skating. He never grew taller than 5

feet  31/2  inches but he certainly stands tall on  the  ice.

Another  example  is  Kristi  Yamaguchi,  an  American   born

Japanese, who herself overcame her small stature and a turned-in  foot  condition  to become an Olympic gold  medallist  in

1992.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond the competitive level, ice-skating can also

provide viable career

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>

opportunities  for  ice-skaters.  If Singaporean  ice-skaters

can  excel,  they  can even be full-time professional  figure

skaters.   One example is the Disney World on Ice,  which  is

currently  performing  in our Indoor Stadium  at  this  time.

Skaters  could  also  end up as coaches  to  teach  the  next

generation of young students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote and encourage ice-skating among

Singaporeans, I would like to suggest two things we  can  do.

The first is to put in place the infrastructure by building a

world-class  ice-skating rink. Kuala Lumpur has a  number  of

international standard ice-skating rinks which  have  allowed

the  staging  of several regional competitions and  attracted

good international participation and coverage. The second  is

for the Ministry of Education to accept ice-skating as a core

curricular activity and to encourage students to take it  up.

In  spite  of  our physical limits, I believe that  Singapore

could  very  well  produce future champions  in  ice-skating.

Given proper support, I believe that figure ice-skating  will

be  one  of the sports in which our athletes will  shine.   I

hope  the Ministry will support this sport and pave  the  way

for aspiring skaters to succeed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to make some

points relating to MCD.  Each year, I have urged the Minister

to  try and see what he can do more for the voluntary welfare

organisations and I would like to remind him this year  again

that   the   subventions   provided  to   voluntary   welfare

organisations are not as attractive as it should be.  I  know

his  hands are tied but I will try and help him to  urge  the

Ministry  of Finance.  I am sure that Members here will  join

me  to  urge the Ministry of Finance to find ways to allocate

more  funds  to  the people sector.  As I have said  earlier,

this is very important because the people sector too requires

more support in order to build a healthier community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I see that $42.8 million has been allocated

as  subvention  grant to the voluntary welfare organisations.

This  is,  to my mind, indeed too small.  I feel that  a  bit

more could be given so that the voluntary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>

sector  will  be  more viable and will be  able  to  take  on

additional  responsibilities. This is one of the missions  of

MCD  and  the Government to encourage more helping hands.  In

order  for  them to participate in more self-help programmes,

it  is  essentially necessary to find ways  to  increase  the

subventions to voluntary welfare organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the dollar-to-dollar contribution which is

being given at the moment to programmes could be reviewed.  I

suggest that a 60:40 formula be considered so that the burden

of  fund-raising by the voluntary welfare organisations could

be reduced. The volunteers could therefore be able to look at

how   they  could  extend  their  programmes  and  find   new

strategies to address the challenges which many Members  have

brought  up  relating to families, population decline,  young

persons,  family conflicts and other related problems.  These

are  issues which are very complex and therefore if you  want

the  voluntary sector to be more involved, I would  urge  the

Ministry to re-look at the funding formula which will provide

a  new  headstart  for the organisations to  be  involved  in

promoting more self-help in the community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support the appeal

by  Dr  Vasoo.  We  should give more help  to  the  voluntary

welfare  organisations, because feedback from many  voluntary

welfare   organisations  indicate   that   it   is   becoming

increasingly  difficult for them to raise  funds  to  finance

their  activities and projects.  Based on the report  on  the

Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare  for  the  Elderly,

the  VWOs are encouraged to continue providing long-term care

services  at  community  hospitals, chronic  sick  hospitals,

nursing  homes, day-care centres and in the elderly  people's

own  homes.   In view of the increasing needs  of  an  ageing

population, VWOs are needed to provide more such services  to

accommodate the increase in demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only are more VWOs needed, the services that they

provide must also be of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>

high  quality.   To ensure that the care they provide  is  of

good  quality, the VWOs are expected to actively explore  and

implement  various assistance programmes to help  to  improve

the  process and outcome of care for the elderly.   To  carry

out these programmes, much time and efforts are required from

them. This leaves them with little time to raise funds to run

the services.  In order to ease the burden of the VWOs and to

encourage more VWOs to provide services for the elderly,  the

Government  should provide more funding to  them,  even  more

than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, perhaps the Government would like to

consider  reviewing the current funding principles of  up  to

90%  for  capital expenditure and up to 50% of the  recurrent

expenditure  or the VWOs' deficit, whichever is lower.   This

would help to reduce the burden of fund-raising for the  VWOs

to enable them to concentrate on their core activities.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I echo the call by Dr

Vasoo  and Mr Ong for more funding for the VWOs. May  I  just

use  one  case study as a concrete example to show  what  are

some  of  the difficulties faced by the VWOs in the  area  of

funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use the example of Bukit Ho Swee Social Service

Centre.  It was in existence since 1969 and in their 30 years

of  service, they have taken up the challenge of establishing

separate facilities for the family and youth services.   They

wanted  to  appeal for more funds to start up another  family

service  centre  to cater to expanding needs and  more  youth

activities.  The  move  for them was  not  an  expansion  for

expansion  sake,  but  was  a much needed  response  to  curb

juvenile delinquency and to increase family functioning among

the  disadvantaged low-income community.  In my view, I  know

that  it was a very good initiative, especially when  we  are

aware  and  from what I said earlier, that teenage crime  has

been  on  the rise since 1990. Street corner gang  activities

were  widespread and if this phenomenon is not arrested, many

young people would either be victims of senseless violence or

ended up in penal institutions.  These youths come from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>

multiple-problem  families and they  need  various  kinds  of

methods to reach them.  Because they are trapped in a culture

of  poverty  and  delinquency, their needs  are  varied.  The

activities and the plan will have to be of a wide  range  and

the  attention  given to them is intense and  extensive,  but

resources are scarce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group had appealed for funding but the Ministry has

declined. My question is: what criteria should be used by the

Ministry to fund or not to fund? What sort of guidelines have

been drawn up to identify the continuum of social services to

meet  the range of needs faced by young people, dysfunctional

families, disadvantaged families and the rest of it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge the Ministry then to review the

funding principles.  The 90:10 formula in capital funding  is

a  good one because it is co-sharing of responsibilities. But

could  the Ministry not review the 50:50 percentage operating

funding  instead and amend it to 70:30 or even 80:20 so  that

VWOs  are  less stressed by having to seek for funds  to  run

their operations?  Because their job is really to service the

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it will become a bit disorderly

if  we move into Community Development Councils and since  we

have  gained  some time today, as a matter of  bonus  to  the

Defence  people, we can stop here.  Do I have the  assent  to

stop here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon, Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to report that the

Committee  of  Supply  has  made  further  progress  on   the

Estimates  of  Expenditure for the financial year  2000/2001,

and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
