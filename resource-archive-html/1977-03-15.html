<div align="center"><b>MAJLIS UGAMA ISLAM SINGAPURA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Management of new mosques)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for

Social  Affairs  what plans the  Majlis  Ugama  Islam

Singapura  will  implement to  ensure  that  the  new

mosques  in  the housing estates will be  efficiently

managed  and  that the mosques will be  utilised  for

broader community and educational purposes as well.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Administration of

Muslim  Law Act, one of the responsibilities  of  the

Majlis Ugama



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



Islam Singapura is the administration of all mosques

in  Singapore.  When the new mosques are  ready,  the

Majlis  will appoint Mosque Management Committees  to

look  after  them  and  to  plan  and  oversee  their

programmes  and  activities.  Such  Committees   will

comprise residents from the housing estates in  which

the mosques are sited and who are capable and willing

to render their services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the new mosques to be built under the Mosque

Building Fund Scheme implemented by the Majlis  Ugama

Islam Singapura with the assistance of the Government

are  constructed as large multi-purpose mosques. They

will  have ample facilities such as conference rooms,

libraries, halls for social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



gatherings  and other purposes, classrooms  and  even

washing  rooms  for  the  dead.  Each  mosque  is   a

religious  complex in itself, designed  for  use  not

only   for   religious  purposes  but  for  community

programmes as well. The facilities in the mosque will

be   made  available  to  the  residents  within  the

satellite town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majlis Haiah Dahwah which is a Sub-Committee of

the   MUIS  dealing  with  matters  on  religion  and

education,   will   supervise  and  co-ordinate   the

religious, educational and cultural programmes of the

mosques to ensure that such programmes meet the needs

of Muslims in the area. Close liaison with the Mosque

Management Committees will be maintained through  the

Honorary  Secretary  of each Committee  who  will  be

represented  on the Majlis Haiah Dahwah.  All  Mosque

Management  Committees  will be  required  to  submit

their   mosque   programmes   to   the   Majlis   for

consideration.  Periodical reports on the  activities

implemented  together with financial reports  of  the

mosques are also expected from the Committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds are needed to maintain a large multi-purpose

mosque.  The  MUIS on its part has set  up  a  Mosque

Maintenance Fund. For deserving cases, the MUIS  will

recommend  the  use  of part of  this  Fund  to  help

maintain  and  defray some expenses incurred  by  the

Mosque  Management Committees. However, the MUIS  has

no  special  allocation  of  funds  to  pay  for  the

maintenance  and management of all the  new  mosques.

Mosque   Management  Committees  should  not   expect

everything to be paid for through the Mosque Building

Fund  collections or by the Majlis.  I  suggest  that

they  continue with their fund-raising programmes  to

make  the mosque building project a community  effort

with   the   active  participation  of   all   Muslim

residents.  The MUIS will issue licences as  provided

under section 73 of the Administration of Muslim  Law

Act to enable Mosque Management Committees to collect

donations  from  Muslims to defray expenses  such  as

salaries  for  Imams,  Noja,  Bilal, allowances  for

religious teachers and other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



functions organised by Management Committees for  the

benefit of Muslims in the area.

<div align="center"><b>BASIC COURSE AND JUNIOR TRAINEE SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs   and   Education  whether   facilities   for

vocational training are available to each  and  every

student   who  is  unable  to  complete  primary   or

secondary education so that he or she will  be  given

an opportunity to be trained in a useful trade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the introduction of

the  Basic Course this year, pupils from the  primary

school system who are less academically inclined  and

unable  to cope with the Standard Course are  offered

places  in  the  Basic Course. The  Basic  Course  is

designed  to provide such pupils with the opportunity

to  continue schooling up to a ninth year at  primary

level  concentrating on the first language, a  spoken

second language, basic numeracy, arts and crafts  and

proper social and work attitudes. In addition,  those

in  the  final  year  of the Basic  Course  who  have

attained  the  age of 14 1/2 are provided with  domestic

science  practice for the girls and workshop practice

for  the  boys.  Basic Course pupils  will  have  the

opportunity  to  go on to the Junior  Trainee  Scheme

under which they can obtain on-the-job training.  The

Basic Course and Junior Trainee Scheme will therefore

provide  opportunities  for  vocational  training  to

those  leaving  school at the primary level.  Of  the

4,376  pupils  who failed the Primary School  Leaving

Examination last year and who were offered places  in

the  Basic  Course,  a total of  3,450  accepted  the

offers and were enrolled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary level, there is presently no system

for  channelling  those  pupils  who  are  unable  or

unlikely to complete the course with a minimum  of  3

passes  at  `O'  level in the General Certificate  of

Education examination. Some do, however, leave school

on their own to seek employment or admission to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



vocational   courses  conducted  by  the   Industrial

Training  Board  or  the Adult Education  Board.  The

Ministry  of  Education is now  studying  a  possible

scheme,  in consultation with the Industrial Training

Board  and  the  Adult Education Board,  under  which

pupils  in the secondary school system who are unable

or  unlikely to complete the course with a minimum of

3  `O'  level passes in the GCE examination could  be

channelled into vocational training to be provided by

the ITB and the AEB. When such a scheme is introduced

as  a follow-up of what is now being practised in the

primary school system, both the ITB and the AEB would

have   to   increase  their  intake  capacities   for

vocational courses. Presently, the ITB can take in  a

total  of about 7,500 per year for such training  and

the AEB a total of about 3,000. Additional facilities

will be added to meet the need if necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, could the Senior

Minister of State for Education enlighten this  House

as  to  when such a scheme could be implemented since

the  feasibility studies are being carried out by his

Ministry now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, if everything goes on

smoothly, it may be next year.

<div align="center"><b>(Development as a tourist resort)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether it is planned to develop Changi Village as  a

tourist stopover point in view of its close proximity

to the Changi International Airport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to the Member for

Changi's  question  is a definite "Yes".  The  Member

would  have  noticed  that Changi  Village  has  been

redeveloped  into  a  modern  complex  consisting  of

shops, flats, a hawker centre and a market, all  set

in  a  landscaped  site  bordering  the  sea  with  a

pedestrian mall, bandstand and shady trees.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board is organising

an East Coast Tour covering visits to Changi Village,

Selarang  Barracks, Changi Prison, East Coast  Lagoon

and  possibly a visit to a kelong. At Changi Village,

tourists  will be able to do shopping and enjoy  cool

drinks  and  hawkers'  food  under  open-air  kiosks.

Historical pictures with write-ups of the history  of

Changi  Prison  and Selarang Barracks will  be  sold.

Visitors, particularly   British   and   Australian

servicemen  who have served in Singapore,  and  their

families, may find Changi a nostalgic place  worth  a

visit.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Implementation of new budget system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what  difficulties  are  envisaged  in   the

implementation  of  the new Budget  System  and  what

measures  are being or will be taken to  ensure  that

the system is implemented smoothly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the new budgetary

system will be a major departure from the present. It

will  naturally  pose a number  of  problems  in  its

implementation but these are likely to be  mainly  on

orienting   the  civil  service  towards  performance

criteria in estimating and expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new system will do away with the present

preoccupation on "things to be bought" and  emphasise

"the things to be done". The Budget will be framed to

show  each  Ministry's programme, that  is,  what  it

intends  to  do.  All expenditure  items  under  each

programme will be arranged according to projects  and

activities.  Since each programme will  constitute  a

separate   subhead,  Ministries   will   have   great

flexibility  to  reallocate expenditure  within  each

programme to make the best possible use of the  funds

to achieve the objectives of the programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all this implies that in estimating

expenditure requirements, Ministries submit proposals

on  the  basis of performance. For example, for  road

construction, estimates will have to be based on  the

total length of roads



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



to  be  built and the cost per unit run and how these

compare against past costs and achievements and  what

the  targets  for  the  new  year  represent  in  the

Ministry's  total  5-year plan and  other  costs  and

benefits data.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side, Ministries will have to

monitor expenditure from the point of view of results

and  whether alternative means cannot be found to cut

costs  and improve, productivity. Because there  will

be  greater flexibility, there will be less delays in

changing  the  nature and content of expenditures  to

meet  changed  conditions. For  example,  within  the

constraints  of their manpower budget, each  Ministry

will be able to employ more staff or less staff on  a

particular programme if conditions require this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, these changes will require quite

radical  changes in the mental attitude of the  civil

service. There will have to be a greater awareness of

cost-benefit and cost-effective criteria. There  will

have  to be a greater emphasis on the correlation  of

financial  requirements with objectives and  targets.

The  civil  service will have to develop  performance

indicators, norms, standards and historical data  for

estimating   budgetary   requirements.   For   actual

expenditure  the  civil service  will  have  to  find

effective ways of achieving the objectives or targets

of  their Ministry's programmes. Finally, at the  end

of  the financial year, performance will have  to  be

measured and evaluated. The evaluation of performance

(the  performance annual review) will be an  integral

part  of  the  budgetary system,  because  this  will

enable  the  assessment to be made for the  following

year  of  the  size of funds to be allocated  on  the

basis  of  performance. In view  of  the  nature  and

complexity of Government activities, much effort will

be  required  to  devise systems of  measurement  and

refinements  of performance indicators and  norms  as

well  as  procedures for evaluation  and  assessment.

Action has already been taken to explain to the civil

service  the  new system and to train those  officers

directly  involved in the budgetary  process  in  the

Ministries  and  Departments.  The  first  rounds  of

discussions and talks involved recasting FY



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>1976&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget into the new format. Numerous sessions

were  held  to  explain the principles  and  concepts

involved.   The   major  problems  and   difficulties

associated  with the system have been identified  and

in  the  second  and  third  rounds  of  discussions,

solutions  and various compromises were  worked  out.

When  the  FY 77 Budget has been approved, a  similar

exercise  will  be done to recast  it  into  the  new

format.  This  will  give the civil  service  further

experience  with the new system and hopefully  enable

the  framing of the FY 78 Budget to be made  properly

and in time for the next financial year.

<div align="center"><b>DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENTS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Assessment of benefits)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister

for  Finance what benefits Singapore has derived from

the  many  double taxation agreements concluded  with

other  countries; how are the benefits assessed;  and

whether  a  similar agreement will be concluded  with

Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, it is easy to understand that

the   inflow  of  funds,  investments  and  technical

expertise to Singapore from another country would  be

greatly  discouraged if full taxes have  to  be  paid

according  to  the  laws of both  countries.  In  the

absence  of  any  agreement otherwise,  income  which

arises and is taxed in Singapore and is then remitted

home  by a foreign company would still be subject  to

tax  in  its  own country. At prevailing  income  tax

rates,  such  cumulative taxation  by  two  countries

would  be  prohibitive.  It  would  completely  deter

foreign investment in Singapore. The converse is also

true  for  Singapore companies which have  plans  for

substantial investments overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bilateral tax treaties to avoid this situation,

double taxation is eliminated through full or partial

tax  credit  or  exemption on  interests,  royalties,

dividends, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important feature found in bilateral tax

treaties   between   Singapore  and   the   developed

countries  is  "tax  sparing". This  is  a  means  of

ensuring that the tax on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



profits  of foreign-owned companies foregone  by  the

Government through various tax incentive measures  is

"spared" from tax by the foreign government.  Without

such  bilateral  treaties,  incentives  such  as  tax

holiday  benefits granted to such companies could  be

nullified  if the foreign country should unilaterally

decide to increase its tax by an amount equivalent to

the tax remitted by the Singapore Government as a tax

incentive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the avoidance of double taxation, tax

treaties also contribute to the prevention of  fiscal

evasion.  As  a  company's books and records  in  one

country   are  generally  not  available  to  another

country,  effective control is only possible  if  the

two  countries agree on the exchange of  information.

Tax treaties therefore invariably have provisions for

the prevention of tax evasion and for the exchange of

fiscal information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have concluded avoidance of double taxation

agreements  with  all  the major  EEC  countries  and

Japan.   In  ASEAN,  agreements  with  Thailand   and

Malaysia  are in force, while an agreement  with  the

Philippines was recently initialled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no simple method of assessing the benefits

which  Singapore  derives  from  the  conclusion   of

avoidance  of double taxation agreements, but  it  is

significant  to  note  that it  was  only  after  the

conclusion  of tax treaties with Germany. Netherlands

and  Japan that big multi-national corporations  from

these  three  countries such as Rollei,  Philips  and

Mitsubishi  established themselves  in  Singapore  in

response   to  the  various  tax  incentive  measures

granted  by  the  Government. The tax  treaties  with

these  countries ensure that these benefits  are  not

eroded   through  increased  taxation  by  the   home

countries.  Rollei  Singapore  Private  Limited   has

invested  $106  million,  Philips  Singapore  Private

Limited  $45  million and Mitsubishi Singapore  Heavy

Industries  Private Limited $110 million as  at  June

1976.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal benefits flowing from tax treaties are

the  encouragement  of  the  inflow  of  capital  and

technical  expertise. In the process, local technical

and   managerial   skills  are  upgraded   and   more

employment opportunities are provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary discussions were held in Djakarta in

November 1973, on a Double Taxation Agreement between

Singapore  and  Indonesia.  An  Indonesian  team   is

expected  to come to Singapore for the next round  of

negotiations,  but the date has not  been  fixed.  We

would  welcome an early agreement with  Indonesia  as

this  would  contribute to expansion  of  intra-ASEAN

trade  and would encourage greater investments  among

member states. However, pending the conclusion  of  a

tax treaty with Indonesia, Singapore grants exemption

from  tax  on  income derived from  certain  approved

Singapore   investments  in  Indonesia  which   enjoy

pioneer status or tax holidays in Indonesia.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE AIRPORT DUTY-FREE EMPORIUM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sale of Government's equity)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister

for Finance what is the rationale behind the sale  of

31  per  cent of the Government's equity  holding  in

Singapore Airport Duty-Free Emporium Private  Limited

to  Singapore  Airlines Limited;  and  what  are  the

benefits to the Government from that transaction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not consider it

appropriate, as a rule, that I should be called  upon

to  explain  operational  decisions  on  investments,

particularly where they involve transactions  between

one Government company and another. I shall, however,

make an exception in this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Airport Duty-Free Emporium was set up in

October   1974  as  a  joint  venture   between   the

Government, Singapore Airlines, and Singapore Airport

Terminal  Services.  SIA is owned  by  the  Singapore

Government  while  SATS is owned by  SIA.  The  joint

venture company is therefore essentially a Government

company. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



Government's shares in both SIA and SADE are now held

by  Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd, which is a Government

company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March last year the SIA Group suggested that its

stake  in  SADE should be increased to  reflect  more

closely its major involvement in SADE's operations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Group was managing the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. SIA was promoting SADE not only in its ticketing

outlets in Singapore but throughout its network.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. SIA would prefer to sell duty-free goods at the

Airport than on board its aircraft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was agreed, and after negotiations, a suitable

transfer price was agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits to Government from the transaction are

presumably that credit is given where credit is  due,

higher  profits accruing to the organisation striving

to promote increased business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, will the

Minister  please inform the House,  as  a  matter  of

principle  why  should he make an exception  in  this

particular case?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the object of this exception is

to inform Members that, in operational details, there

is  really no purpose in the House enquiring  nor  is

there any purpose in the Minister enquiring why in  a

particular  company,  the SIA, for  example,  chooses

Boeing 727 instead of the Airbus. This is a matter of

commercial judgment and the details are best left  to

the company concerned. The Minister would himself not

be  in  a  position to make any better  judgment  nor

would  the Members of this House if the details  were

known.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, who are the owners of all

these monies belonging to all those companies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Minister for Finance

is  ultimately the owner. This is a corporation which

is  enacted  under  an  Act of  Parliament,  so  that

ultimately the Singapore Government is the  owner  of

all the monies of all the Government companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, would the Minister not agree

that  since we are all representatives of the people,

and  the people own the money, but which the Minister

alleged  that  he owns them, are `we not shareholders

in all these companies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui San:</b> I agree entirely that the people of

Singapore, including  Members  of  Parliament,   are

shareholders in the Government companies. But  as  to

the process of enquiring into the operations, I think

the shareholders of companies are not really asked at

annual general meetings to consider whether, in fact,

SIA  or  any other company has made a good commercial

judgment in, say, using Sulzer Diesel Engines  rather

than  Burmeister and Wain Diesel Engines, or  whether

they should buy a Boeing 727 rather than an Airbus. I

can   see  no  connection  between  shareholding  and

enquiries into operational details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Is the Minister

suggesting  or  implying  that  Members   may   raise

questions concerning policy matters relating  to  all

these  companies  and  not day-to-day  administrative

matters?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Certainly. All matters of policy are

the   concern   of  the  Minister  for  Finance   and

consequently, since he is accountable to  Parliament.

he is accountable to Members of Parliament.

<div align="center"><b>CULTURAL SHOWS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Exemption from entertainment duty)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what are the criteria for exemption of cultural shows

from  entertainments duty; and whether he will revise

the  criteria to encourage more cultural  shows  with

local content to be staged in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, briefly where shows are

organised   for  profits  and  not  for   charitable,

philanthropic,  educational  or  sporting   purposes,

entertainments  duty  exemption  is  a  discretionary

matter  but will generally be granted to performances

of  intrinsic  cultural value.  It  is  difficult  to

define



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



precisely   what   shows  are  of   cultural   value.

Exemptions  have,  however,  been  granted  to   such

performances  as  symphonic concerts,  chamber  music

ensembles,   operas,  ballets,  plays  and   national

cultural  shows. Other factors that have  been  taken

into  consideration are whether the artistes  are  of

international  status  and whether  the  performances

would attract a reasonably large public audience. The

unduly  esoteric  or the mundane  will  not  normally

qualify for exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards encouragement of more cultural shows of

local content, my Ministry has granted exemption from

entertainments   duty  to  shows   and   performances

presented,   sponsored   or   organised    by    such

organisations  as  the National  Theatre  Trust,  the

People's  Association  and the  Kreta  Ayer  People's

Theatre  Foundation.  Favourable  consideration  will

continue  to  be given to applications for  exemption

from  entertainments duty on shows  and  performances

displaying  the  various facets of  our  rich  multi-cultural heritage.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Main and Development Estimates of Singapore for the financial year 1st April, 1977 to 31st March, 1978, contained in Paper Cmd. 3 of 1977.

For  convenience. I shall take the  totals  for  each

head  of  expenditure in the Main Estimates  and  the

Development Estimates as they appear in the fifth and

sixth   columns  respectively  of  the   Summary   of

Estimated Expenditure on page 43 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in

respect of which amendments stand on the Order  Paper

Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head K -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1002*.  (* The same amendment also stood in the names of

Messrs P. Govindaswamy, Ivan Baptist and Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Main and Development Estimates allocation

for  the Ministry of Defence amounts to $908 million.

This is a good portion of the total budget provision.

Of  course, we know that it is important to build our

defence capability for our security. For a young  and

newly emergent country like ours, it is all the  more

necessary to consolidate our defence so as to protect

our independence and territorial integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, our national service scheme has been

successful, However, as regards training, whether  it

is proper and adequate and whether our servicemen are

being trained to be good soldiers and of good quality

are  matters  for  the authority  concerned  and  the

officers in charge to exercise constant review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, I believe we have all heard of

unpleasant  incidents taking place in  the  camps  or

barracks.  There  were instances where  soldiers  and

officers  have quarrelled, leading to tragedy.  There

was  such  an incident not long ago where a  soldier,

because  of  personal affairs, had  gone  beyond  the

bounds of a soldier, Although such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



instances  are rare, it is a matter that worries  us.

My  question is: after two years of military life  in

the  camps whether these youngsters have been  taught

the   proper   attitudes   towards   life, personal

behaviour, good discipline, and a civic sense so that

they  are  more disciplined, more matured and  better

behaved. This is a very important matter that  merits

the serious attention of all concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise three questions to the

Minister.   First,   will   the   Minister   consider

abolishing the decision to enlist women into national

service, although the actual date has not been fixed?

As  it  is now, we are able to recruit women  by  the

"voluntary  and  open method". So is  it,  therefore,

necessary for us to conscript our women? I am  not  a

male  chauvinist or under-estimating the capacity  of

our  women and girls, but there is nearly a  thousand

years'   history  about  women's  role  in   military

activities. I am sure you have heard of Hua Mu Lan, a

girl in ancient China.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, it is not the policy of the Government during

this  financial year to recruit women into  the  NSF,

nor  is there any money provided for such enlistment.

Under  these  circumstances, would the Member  be  in

order to raise this matter which is not provided  for

in the budget?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In that case, I

will  not  touch  on  it. I think  the  Minister  was

perhaps not prepared as to how to answer my question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me raise the second question. It relates to

consideration for exemption from national service for

those whose families are in financial difficulty. For

instance, if the only son in the family is  the  sole

breadwinner,  or  in  the case  where  two  or  three

brothers  are being enlisted at the same time,  there

should be some arrangement where they can be enlisted

for  national service consecutively in order to  help

them in their financial difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my meet-the-people sessions in the past I have

also been asked to request the Ministry concerned  to

allow  them  to  opt  for part-time  police  national

service, so that for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



the period of their obligation these youngsters could

help  their family by earning some money.  Some  such

applications  have been rejected which act,  I  feel.

was  too  stringent or not quite humane. So  I  would

like   to  ask  the  Minister  to  ask  the  Advisory

Committee  to exercise more sympathetic consideration

for  such petitions. Although the Committee comprises

representatives  from  the various  quarters  of  our

society,  including  the  industry, public  service,

higher  institutions  of learning,  and  professional

circles,  I  think  it  would be  better  to  include

representatives from the Social Welfare Department as

they  understand better the plight of a  poor  family

and  so can provide the Committee with better grounds

for a more sympathetic and proper consideration. What

does the Minister think about this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question I would like to raise is about

drug-taking incidents in the camps. This  is  a  very

serious matter. I would like to ask how many cases of

drug-taking  have been discovered  in  the  past  few

years and what measures or action have been taken  by

the  military  or  camp authority to eliminate  this

abuse?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, national service was introduced

sometime  in  1967. During the initial period  a  few

batches  of  recruits were sent to the  1st  SIR  for

three  months  training and were  absorbed  into  the

People's Defence Force. Subsequently, after a  couple

of years when they were performing part-time service,

some  of  these  recruits  were  transferred  to  the

Special Constabulary. There is a standing instruction

saying  that those affected by national service  must

compulsorily perform part-time national  service  for

12  years  or  until  they reach  40  years  of  age,

whichever  is the later after having completed  full-time  national  service. I have  received  complaints

from  many national service reservists, who had  been

transferred  to the Special Constabulary,  that  they

were  told  that  the period reckoned  for  part-time

national  service would commence from the  time  they

were transferred to the Special Constabulary. Can the

Minister enlighten the House on this point?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that there are rumours that the

part-time performance of reservists who have  reached

the age of 40 years has been abolished. Is this true?

Could the Minister clarify this point?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether exemption from part-time

national service would be considered for a person who

has  passed  the  call-up age but who  is  called  up

because of his employment in the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the case of a person who wrote to the

Central  Manpower  Base that he  had  served  in  the

Special  Constabulary for a period of six years  from

1962  to 1968 and that he had undergone all the basic

police training at the Police Academy and that he was

in   active  service  during  the  riots,  the  civil

disturbances and other emergencies during that  time.

However, due to pressure of shift duties and  private

studies,  he was unable to continue service with  the

Special  Constabulary and he ultimately  resigned  in

1968.  Currently, he is working in a statutory  board

where his presence is required in times of emergency.

Besides  having to work on shift duties, he  is  also

pursuing  private studies for a promotion. Therefore,

he  would like to know whether consideration would be

given  for his past performance. I wonder whether  an

exception could be made for such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another case of a breadwinner of a family

who  passed away recently. The widow, a housewife now

has  to look after five children. The eldest-son  has

been  serving full-time national service for the last

one  year. Can consideration be given for the boy  to

be discharged from national service, so that he could

seek  employment to help the family financially?  Can

the Minister reply to this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parents have now more or less accepted the

concept of national service. But then I have received

numerous complaints from parents that their boys have

been   spoilt  after  being  enlisted  for   national

service.  Many of them indulge in undesirable  habits

like drinking and smoking which they never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



knew  before  they were called up. The  Minister  may

blame the parents for their sons' behaviour. But then

we cannot expect the parents to know what is actually

happening in the camps. I understand that drinks  and

cigarettes  are  sold cheaply in the camps  and  this

could be the reason why the boys indulge in these bad

habits.  When I say "bad habits". I do not mean  that

an  individual should not drink or smoke.  I  believe

that acquiring these habits at a very young age,  and

especially in the army, could be considered as  anti-social.  Basically,  even  the  Government  does  not

encourage these habits and here in the army  we  find

our  youths merrily drinking and smoking. I  have  to

say  this because in later years if the boys  indulge

in  excessive  drinking  and  smoking  and  become  a

nuisance  to  society, the parents  would  definitely

blame  the army. When they drink and smoke, the  army

would not be run properly also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, touching on the make-up pay for national

service reservists who have been posted to the  Army,

Special Constabulary and Vigilante Corps, there seems

to  be some confusion in financial matters. Some  get

allowances  and others get a remuneration,  depending

on whether he is in the Army, Special Constabulary or

the  Vigilante  Corps. For instance, it  is  gathered

that   a   national   serviceman   in   the   Special

Constabulary  who  has to be on duty  outside  normal

office  hours will receive an allowance. He  will  be

permitted  to  retain  this  allowance  without   any

deduction from the salary for the period of his  Army

duty.  When he is called up for in-camp training,  he

will receive a remuneration and not an allowance. And

his   normal  salary  will  be  deducted   from   the

remuneration  and paid the difference,  whichever  is

the greater. But those in the Vigilante Corps get  an

allowance  for  in-camp training, and their  salaries

are  not  affected at all. Why is there  no  standard

rule  for  the  various services?  Can  the  Minister

explain?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Ministry issues instructions relating

to  national service, it does not specify  the  shift

hours;  instead  it  uses a vague term  like  "normal

office   hours"  which  causes  confusion  to   those

departments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



which have shift workers. This results in unnecessary

communication  with  the Central  Manpower  Base  for

further  information  and  clarification,  especially

when money is involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that in future, any instruction issued by

the  CMPB should be very clear and specific  and  not

vague  which  may  result  in  unnecessary  time  and

stationery  being wasted on communication.  Sometimes

because  of  this, the original standing  instruction

may be distorted.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

permit   me   to  refer  to  the  Addendum   to   the

Presidential  Address  at the opening  of  the  First

Session of the Fourth Parliament on Tuesday, the  8th

of  last month. I am referring, in particular, to the

submission of the Ministry of Defence standing in the

name  of  the Minister of Defence. Without  a  doubt.

Sir,   the  citizens  of  Singapore  accept  national

service  as a necessary duty of the young,  and  they

proved  this  by  returning the PAP to  power  by  an

overwhelming  majority at the  general  elections  of

December 1976. The Addendum on Defence stressed  this

point, and I quote [Hansard, Vol. 36, Col. 21]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'However, since our defence forces have to import

nearly  all  their weapons and equipment, the  rising

prices  of  these products impose a severe  financial

burden.  It  is therefore necessary to  exercise  the

utmost economy in defence expenditure..'



<br><br>A   committee  of  Finance  and  Defence  Ministries'

officials  was  appointed in November  1976  to  keep

watch  over  expenditure and prune it.  The  Addendum

carries on, and I again quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It will certainly be necessary to trim down manpower

establishments  and reduce or even abolish  vocations

which do not contribute much to the combat efficiency

of army units.'



<br><br>It  is,  therefore, surprising, Sir, to  notice  that

this  pruning  down  of  expenditure  results  in  an

increase  over FY 76 by 6.7% on Manpower  Expenditure

and  by  22.9%  on Other Operating Expenditure.  This

amounts  to a total increase of 22.5% in FV  77  when

compared to FY 76. In addition, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



Development Estimates show an increase of 16.4%  over

FY  76. If I may refresh the memory of this House, an

increase  of  only 25.4% over FV 75  was  tabled  for

approval  about this time last year. I  am  wondering

whether  or not this is contradictory to the Addendum

to   the  Presidential  Address,  or  is  there  some

rational  explanation  as to  the  state  of  affairs

indicated  in the Main and Development Estimates  for

the financial year 1st April, 1977 to 31st March, 1978, under Head K, Ministry of Defence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to raise a matter which I hope the Hon. Minister

of  Defence  will  consider. This  is  in  regard  to

starting some form of compulsory saving scheme or CPF

contributions  for  national servicemen.  Sir,  I  am

aware  that  a good number of our national servicemen

are  paid  reasonably well for their term in national

service, particularly   those   with   `A'    level

certificates.  I  think it is far in  excess  of  the

market  value  that holders of `A' level certificates

will command outside, either in the public or private

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, we know that Officer Cadets receive a

sum  of $420 per month; a Second Lieutenant $580  per

month,  and  a full Lieutenant about $700 per  month.

This  is a huge sum of money for a young person. What

happens is that many of them may not be careful  with

the  way they spend and, therefore, they tend to  get

used  to  a lot of money at a rather young age.  Once

they  leave  national service, they are  imbued  with

high  expectations. I am told this  has  resulted  in

certain  problems  for some young  people  once  they

leave   national  service  because  when  they  leave

national  service  and  enter  society  they   expect

similarly  high  salaries and, where  possible, soft

jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that the Ministry of Defence

consider  some  form  of compulsory  saving  for  our

national   servicemen,   maybe   in   the   form   of

contributions  to  the Central  Provident  Fund  like

other working men. Secondly, for those who intend  to

pursue  a higher education, this saving scheme  could

help them out during the forthcoming lean years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> With your permission. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  perhaps I had best reply to the matters  raised

under  this particular subhead now. First, the Member

for Sembawang regarding appeals. He is not satisfied,

or rather his constituents are not satisfied with the

decisions  of  the  Appeals Board.  But  I  am  quite

satisfied   that   fairness   has   been   done.   My

Parliamentary Secretary is personally responsible for

seeing  that the Appeals Board's decisions are  fair,

and  he  has  power to overrule the  Appeals  Board's

decision if he thinks it has been harsh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised a number of points.

some  of  them  under the wrong subhead, particularly

matters relating to the Special Constabulary and  the

Vigilante  Corps. These two subjects are administered

by  the Minister for Home Affairs and he should  seek

clarification from my colleague.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member says that some of his friends have

complained that soldiers take to bad habits, such  as

smoking  and drinking. He even thought that  we  give

duty free cigarettes and duty free drinks. We do  not

give  duty  free cigarettes. We give duty free  beer.

But  this  is the strange thing. The ration for  duty

free  beer  is  9 litres per soldier per  month.  The

Units can draw the rations and sell it either in  the

canteen  or  in the SAF messes at duty  free  prices.

Although the entitlement is 9 litres per soldier  per

month,  the  Units  take  less  than  10%  of   their

entitlement. It averages up to about half a litre per

soldier per month. So ours is not a boozing army as I

have  mentioned to Members before. For  other  drinks

like hard liquor, they have to pay the full price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised the question of

drugs.  He wants to know what is the drug problem  in

the  SAF.  The drug problem in the SAF is just  about

the  same  as the drug problem outside the  SAF.  The

Central  Narcotics Bureau once made an estimate  that

about  1%  of  the adult population of  Singapore  is

hooked  on  drugs, and it is getting most serious  in

recent  years  because they move on from  soft  drugs

like  marijuana to heroin. Something like 1%  of  the

adult population is hooked on heroin. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



about  more than 1 1/2% for males and rather less  than 1/2% for females.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drug position in the SAF is like this. Soldiers

convicted of drug offences - these are mostly  heroin

cases  - and serving detention sentences number  196.

475  soldiers have confessed to being on  drugs.  109

soldiers  are  under close arrest and awaiting  court

martial  if  the  urine tests turn up positive.  That

gives a total of 780 soldiers on the record, which is

just over 1% of the SAF population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures are we taking? We are taking very

energetic  measures. Towards the middle of last  year

it  became  apparent  that this is  becoming  a  very

dangerous problem among soldiers. First of all,  very

stern  punishment  is necessary. Any  soldier  caught

with  a positive urine test gets 18 months' detention

for  the  first offence. Then we recruited a team  of

full-time   counsellors,  34  actually,   under   the

direction  of  a  medical  doctor  and  three  social

science  graduates.  They  are  trying  to  work   on

soldiers under detention in getting them out of  this

habit.  In addition, it has been proved necessary  to

establish our own drug analytical laboratory, because

urine  samples  sent to the Department of  Scientific

Services  take too long to process. We have  got  one

drug  laboratory established on the 1st of  February.

At   present  we  can  handle  70  samples  per  day.

Eventually,  when  new  equipment  arrives,  we  will

handle 200 samples a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my intention that every soldier in the SAF

will  be  periodically examined for  drug  addiction.

Drug  suspects will be tested every week, so that  if

they  revert and get caught again then they  will  be

sentenced  to  a much longer term of imprisonment.  I

will  give a full report to Parliament in due  course

on  how  successful  or otherwise  we  have  been  in

handling this very vexatious problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Kim Seng. Actually what he has

proposed is being implemented. A Defence Committee of

Cabinet  has  agreed that national service  officers,

who  just leave school and want a big pay as  he  has

stated,  will  have a good portion of their  salaries

docked into the CPF for the very reasons he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



has  mentioned, i.e, with too much pay they  tend  to

waste their money and have exaggerated ideas of their

market value when they leave the army.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir raised the point about

the  Defence  budget and quoted my  Addendum  to  the

President's  Address, that in spite of the  need  for

economy  there has been a big increase in the Defence

budget for this year. Well, this is for the reasons I

have mentioned in the Addendum, that hardware is very

expensive and we have to pay an awful lot for it.  In

fact,  the reason for this need to economise  derives

from our purchase of two pieces of equipment for  the

Air Force, the F-5 supersonic fighter we are buying a

squadron and we have to pay $283 million for it.  And

not only that, we have to pay in advance. 70% of this

money  will have to be paid before the first aircraft

arrives  because, for some unfathomable  reason,  the

Pentagon  believes that we are very  rich.  There  is

also  another  $50  million for  the  purchase  of  a

squadron of helicopters, and again we have got to pay

most of it in advance. So that makes $333 million,  a

hefty whack, and as a result of that we have to carry

out a very stringent economy drive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested in some proposals which

will  be implemented from next month. All battalions.

training schools and other units will be placed under

rationing  for water and electricity.  They  will  be

placed under water rationing if we can get the PUB to

instal  water meters in these places. If their  quota

for water is up, well that is that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object is not so much to save money. I do not

think  we can save an awful lot of money by rationing

petrol,  water or electricity, but to drive  home  to

every soldier that they have to save money so that if

this economy habit spreads into other spheres, then I

think the real savings will come from that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think these are the only main points raised

by Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of

Defence said that I was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



wrong. Regarding the national service reservist  who

was  from  the Special Constabulary, he  has  already

undergone  training. Now that  he  is  working  in  a

statutory board, he has been asked to go for training

again.  This  is  unreasonable. Most  probably  I  am

wrong, or the Minister is wrong. I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This looks to me a peculiar case.

I  suggest the Member gives me the full facts of this

case  and we can go into it and see if there  is  any

injustice.  I  doubt there is. But  if  there  is  an

injustice, it will be set right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister

has   given  us  a  somewhat  unsatisfactory  answer.

Nevertheless.  I  would  beg  leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask what useful functions the Outward Bound

School  is  involved in? I remember a few  years  ago

this  school was well known for producing people with

leadership qualities. The training offered  was  such

that those who went through its programmes or courses

learned  a great deal. Of late, it seems to  me  this

school  is  lagging  behind  in  the  production   of

leadership  material, It is this leadership  material

that  we require very badly in our community centres,

schools,    vocational   institutes,   and   tertiary

institutions. Could we not send students and teachers

in  the  various schools, institutions  and  tertiary

institutions to the Outward Bound School so  that  we

can have a corps of good leaders?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is true that community

centres  do  not  send many of their staff  or  their

youth  leaders  to  the  Outward  Bound  School.  For

instance,  between  January 1969  and  December  last

year,  4,642  persons went through the Outward  Bound

School    courses.   2,500   were   from   Government

departments  and  only  32 were  from  the  community

centres.  This is not the fault of the Outward  Bound

School.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



Community centres must be urged to send more of their

staff  to  these courses which are pretty useful  and

have been acknowledged by many people as being useful

training.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation

of the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (b) of subhead A.AA 3020.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice in the Estimates that the sum allocated for

the  Junior Flying Club has been slightly reduced.  I

am  wondering why this is so. Is it because of a lack

of  support for the Junior Flying Club, or has  there

been  some form of cost reduction? I would also  like

to  know  what  results have the Junior  Flying  Club

obtained  in respect of their members graduating  and

becoming pilots in our Singapore Air Force?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about our Air Force, national servicemen and

officers  who  have completed their national  service

have  joined our universities. I feel that we  should

get  undergraduates  in the universities  to  form  a

University Air Squadron where the SAF could  continue

to give them pilot training so that they could obtain

their private pilot licence, and perhaps even sitting

for  a commission and be paid whilst studying in  the

university, and signing a bond. After graduating from

the  university  they  can go  on  with  their  pilot

training  and be useful members of our Singapore  Air

Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that training can be done during weekends

and  vacations. They can be attached to  the  various

active squadrons where further training is available.

For  those  who do not make the grade in  flying  and

airmanship  training,  they can  be  made  useful  in

groundwork, such as air traffic controllers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



I  wonder whether the Hon. Minister can enlighten  me

on this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Junior Flying

Club has really proved its worth in many ways. It  is

extremely popular among school boys and indeed  among

school  girls as well. The membership now  stands  at

1,571,  of  which  337 have the  basic  academic  and

physical  requirements for flying in the  Air  Force,

The  others can take part in aeromodelling  and  also

enjoy  facilities  of the Club, such  as  joy  rides,

picnics and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards university undergraduates, there was a

University Air Squadron in existence years ago but it

was  abolished in 1975 when the squadron  was  merged

into the Junior Flying Club. Since then, no less than

39  undergraduates have been enjoying the  facilities

of the Club.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real purpose of the Club is not only to increase

and spread enthusiasm for flying among young boys and

girls  and  undergraduate students but also  to  give

practical training to young people who want  to  test

their ability and aptitude for training as Combat air

force  pilots. Since 1971, 276 school boys and  girls

have  been given flying training lessons and  a  good

number  of  them  have obtained their  private  pilot

licences  (PPL). Of the boys, 83% of those  who  have

obtained  the PPL have applied to join the Air  Force

and  a  good number of them have succeeded  in  their

applications and have done exceedingly  well  at  the

Air  Force  training  school. In fact,  the  wash-out

rate,  as  it is known in the Air Force, is extremely

low  among ex-members of the Junior Flying  Club.  So

this is a very worthwhile enterprise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, in view of the Hon. Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 4002*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Teo Chong Tee.)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am bringing up this matter in relation to

national service because of the importance of a sense

of    concern   and   good   communication    between

Singaporeans,  in this case between  Singaporeans  in

the Singapore Armed Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since national service was started, its organisation

has  improved  greatly as those in charge  have  been

quick  to  react  positively  wherever  the  occasion

demanded adjustments and improvements. This point has

already  been repeated in this House on another  sub-head. Young people as well as their parents have come

to regard national service as an essential measure of

government  and  a familiar feature of  life.  In  my

constituency and in other places when I enquire about

experience  of national service. I find young  people

saying how they have found it exciting or uneventful,

how  they have taken it in their stride, and  I  come

across parents who comment on how well their children

have  appeared physically after training and how much

better  disciplined  they are, and  so  on,  in  such

neutral  or favourable terms, contrary to some  other

indications we have had in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I have been occasionally vexed by

reports  indicating  that  the  relationship  between

servicemen may well too often be characterised  by  a

sort of careless nonchalance, indifference and, worse

still   (even   if  in  cases  that  do   not   occur

frequently), extreme antagonism. At the  very  least.

we  have  a  frank  indication from the  Minister  of

Defence  himself in the remark he made recently  that

there seemed to be a camaraderie among members of the

PDF battalion which was not often found in other army

units.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF receives into National Service,

Singaporeans  who have had their minds and  attitudes

and  ways  of  behaviour set in the circumstances  of

their   upbringing.  The  Singaporean  is  a   rugged

individualist,  prone more than  less  frequently  to

place  his own concerns, convenience even comfort  at

quite  a  premium, He chafes under discipline.  Young

officers, given rank, may all too easily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



allow this to get to their head. Yet for the sake  of

morale,  the  SAF  has  to concern  itself  with  the

problem   of   improving  the  sense  of  camaraderie

prevailing in all units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems of indifference we can see in other armies.

You  will  frequently find jokes about this  sort  of

relationship. If I might be allowed to  recount  one.

It  appears  that  an  army doctor  was  examining  a

prospective  serviceman, "Sit down  in  that  chair",

ordered   the   doctor   sternly.   The   prospective

serviceman  obeyed. "A 1", cried the doctor.  "Next".

"What?",  exclaimed the recruit, "why, you  have  not

even  looked  at me." "Well", said the  doctor,  "you

heard me tell you to sit down, you saw the chair  and

you  had enough intelligence to carry out the  order.

Move on, soldier!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has given indication that our

medical examination is a serious matter, for  he  has

said  that exemptions on medical grounds are  granted

only  if the person is certified by a medical  board,

consisting of, I think, three doctors. Yet there have

been cases of persons entering national service,  who

have  physically and emotionally in a  few  instances

not  been able to bear up in the stresses and strains

of soldiering. In isolated instances the results have

been  grave, and in other instances could  have  been

graver, as reports and descriptions in the newspapers

have indicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that there are cases where

parents  correctly feel they have  good  reasons  for

entertaining some apprehension about a condition that

may have arisen regarding the health or well-being of

their son in national service. In such instances such

parents  would feel immensely relieved  if  they  had

access  to  a  person or committee with authority  to

consider  facts  placed  before  them  and  to  order

immediate  action. Such early action may  well  avert

unpleasant  consequences  resulting  from   lack   of

sufficient attention being given to the special needs

of some servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to train fighters, and the army is a big

place;  but wherever we can introduce a more personal

touch,  we should try to do so. I have observed  that

the Minister of Defence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



is  carrying  a copy of Sun Tzu. Perhaps a  quotation

from  Sun Tzu would not be out of place and I hope  I

have  not  lifted  it  out of context.  The  Griffith

translation says "Command them (troops) with civility

and  imbue them uniformly with martial ardour and  it

may  be said that victory is certain". The Minister's

copy  has  this  translation.  "When  an  army  prove

amenable  to  civil treatment as well as to  military

discipline, they will surely become invincible".  (gu

ling zhi yi wen, qi zhi yi wu, shi wei bi qu.) (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to make an enquiry

regarding  the dissemination of the code of  conduct:

what  methods are used, and what improvements may  be

contrived, if any. Incidentally, Sir, I know that the

lines  that  follow the quotation I  have  given  may

contradict what I have said, but that is  up  to  the

Minister to make the point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Sir, a small nation like

Singapore has been able to build up a strong  defence

force so rapidly to replace the vacuum created by the

withdrawal  of  the  British,  Australian,  and   New

Zealand Forces. The achievements and success are  due

largely to the able leadership and farsightedness  of

the Minister of Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, national service has become an aspect of our

national  life, which is here to stay.  Thousands  of

our  young men have served it with pride and  honour,

but this cannot be said of the many who are presently

serving.  Misconduct on the part  of  some  of  these

soldiers when they are out of their camps is a breach

of  discipline that will undoubtedly tarnish the high

reputation of our Armed Forces. In many public  areas

such  as  bus stops, food centres, cinema  halls,  to

name  a  few,  one  can find national  servicemen  in

groups  of  two  or more people, in sloppily  dressed

military   uniforms  mingling  with  the  crowd   and

misbehaving  in the eyes of the public.  The  abusive

language  they use to curse shylessly and  freely  at

each  other  either jokingly or seriously  in  public

places



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



are  signs of bad upbringing of these young soldiers,

in so far as their discipline is concerned. Uncalled-for remarks are being complimented to young girls who

walk past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, once they are out of their camps, they

are  just  like  birds out of their cages.  Possibly,

they just want to let off steam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think this is a pleasant thing for them to

do   while   still   in   their   military   uniform.

Nevertheless,  it has happened and I am  sure  it  is

still  happening. The discipline of these  young  men

leaves much to be desired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry will look into this matter

more  seriously as the good name of the Armed  Forces

is   at   stake.  These  may  be  isolated  incidents

involving a minority group but, whatever the  number,

their  misconduct  in  public  places  is  definitely

affecting the good reputation of our Armed Forces. If

this is allowed to go on in Singapore unchecked,  the

high  reputation that the Armed Forces  has  attained

will  be  tarnished not only locally but overseas  as

well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Katong has

been  regaling us with a shaggy-dog story  about  how

doctors  dispose of recruits. It is  about  the  same

level  as  the  Member for Anson who  said  that  his

relative's  children joined the  Army  to  smoke  and

drink.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually a recruit goes through not just one but two

medical  examinations.  I have  been  advised  by  my

Manpower  Division  that  each  examination  lasts  a

minimum  of 75 minutes for those who have no  defects

either  of eye, foot or whatever. For those who  have

to  go  for  a  further  test, do  so  because  their

eyesight  is  not good, or something  is  wrong  with

their  blood, leg or chest, and the examination lasts

110  minutes. If the Member for Katong has any doubt,

he is free to go to the Manpower Division at any time

to see how the medical examinations are carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has raised a serious point about soldiers who

break  down  under  stress and commit  all  kinds  of

unseemly conduct. In this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



morning's Straits Times there is a picture of a half-naked  soldier on the sixth floor of a Housing  Board

flat  threatening  to  jump down.  This  is  quite  a

familiar  experience in the SAF. We call them  "para-suicides"  - they  threaten  to  commit  suicide   but

actually they never do. The favourite forms of  para-suicides  are consumption of insect repellents,  soap

solutions,  Brasso; sometimes even pins and  needles,

but  that is rather rare. When para-suicides  consume

these  things, they make sure that people are  around

so that help is immediately forthcoming. At one time,

and acting on the advice of psychologists, we thought

we  should  treat them rather gently;  for  instance,

giving them psychiatric treatment and changing  their

vocation  from a hard one to a soft one.  The  result

was  that the para-suicide rate doubled. So now after

each  act  of para-suicide, a board of officers  goes

into   the   details   to  see   whether   there   is

justification  for  further  punishment,  and   there

usually  is.  These people break down  under  stress.

They  cannot  cope with their work, and  they  commit

these acts partly as a means of protest and partly as

a  method  of drawing attention to what they consider

as their "distressful" situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been following this over the years. This

happens not only in the SAF but also in other  armies

of  the world, in fact, all armies of the world.  The

rate of para-suicide among our national servicemen in

the  army  last year was 55, about one a  week.  This

works out to 128 per 100,000 of population. The  rate

of  para-suicides for other armies,  the  Member  for

Katong  might be interested to know; in the  American

Army for the year 1969/70, the para-suicide rate  was

392;  in the Australian Army for the year 1971/72  it

was  225.  The  figures are not  strictly  comparable

because  definitions are not precisely the same.  But

it  does  show  that what happens in  our  army  does

happen  in  other  armies in more or  less  the  same

proportions. In fact, the suicide rate in the SAF  is

always  the  same as that in the American  Army.  The

suicide  rate among soldiers last year was  15.3  per

100,000  in  1976, In the American Army it  was  15.6

between the years 1959 and 1964.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the solution? Perhaps if there is some way

of testing young men to see whether or not they could

stand up to the stresses of army training, this would

be the best way. But so far as I know, no country has

devised this kind of test. In any event, if we  apply

this  kind of test, there is no way of ensuring  that

those who go through it might not be malingering. The

problem  is  a  real  one  in  the  army  and  it  is

unavoidable   when  you  handle  large   numbers   of

soldiers. I think I have dealt with the points raised

by the Member for Katong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi objects to young men in

uniform  making  catcalls at girls  or  whistling  at

them.  Not so many years ago he himself was  a  young

man.  I do not know whether he did not engage in this

kind  of  activity. I would hate to  think  that  our

youth  are  so  lacking in red blood corpuscles  that

they do not do these things. However, if it is really

serious, the Member should get the details, time  and

place of occurrence, and there is a good chance  that

we  will catch the culprit; but it must really not be

harmless  remarks made in good fun and  clean  spirit

which  probably the girls themselves might not object

to.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, there is another point regarding

the  question I asked about the dissemination of  the

code of conduct.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. The Member is interested in

this  because he has played a prominent part  in  the

drafting of this code of conduct. It was through  him

that  I contacted a Jesuit priest who made the  first

draft.  I  am  afraid the teaching  of  the  code  of

conduct in the SAF leaves much to be desired,  partly

because  it  is taught by officers who go through  it

year  in  and  year  out and not  to  a  particularly

inspiring class. In one case, we found that a soldier

put a transistor radio under his cap during this code

of  conduct  lesson. We are trying to  find  ways  of

improving it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the humane treatment of soldiers, I agree

completely  with  what the Member  for  Katong  said,

particularly as he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



was able to back Sun Tzu for his views. But I would

also like to quote another part from Sun Tzu.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Which page?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Page 83. First in Chinese. He

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hou er bu neng shi ( )

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai er bu neng ling ( )

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luan er bu neng zhi ( )

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bi ru qiao zi ( )

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bu ke yong ye ( )



<br><br>It  means  roughly that if you are over-indulgent  to

your  soldiers,  you lose command  and  control  over

them;  then they become like spoilt children and  are

totally  useless. So we must find a  balance  between

humane treatment and over-indulgence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I just want to make some

clarification. [Interruption] I am afraid I am not  as

adept as the Minister of Defence. The point is that I

did relate that shaggy-dog story but that was not  in

any  sense trying to make fun of the SAF. I  did  say

that  the medical examination was thoroughly  carried

out. I would like to thank the Minister very much for

comparing me with the Member for Anson because I have

a  high  regard  and respect for him because  of  his

performance in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $799,334,410 for Head K ordered to stand

part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $109,600,000 for Head K ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head L -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1003* (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Ivan Baptist and Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, provision has been allocated for improvements

in nearly every hospital. May I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



know what improvements are to be carried out in these

hospitals, and how would these improvements  be  felt

when  there is an acute shortage of medical personnel

at the moment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago, there was mention of a zoning system

for  the hospitals. I wonder how this is working out.

I  gather  that the Singapore General Hospital  still

treats  a  lot  of cases from other  zones.  Is  this

system really workable?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Health Ministry is aware of the plight of

those  who  are over 60 years old, as they  are  more

vulnerable  to  illness because of  the  degeneration

process.   Though  they  constitute   6.6%   of   the

population,  they  comprise  15.5%  of  all  hospital

admissions  and 27.4% of long-staying  patients.  The

Ministry  itself is aware that this group  of  people

fall sick off and on and that hospital bills have  to

be paid whenever medical attention is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old people in most cases are not well-off like the

others.  The  marginal utility of money for  them  is

great.  With the present high cost of living, medical

bills are quite often a burden to them. It is a  fact

that a general reduction of hospital charges will not

be  possible.  But I wonder whether a concession  for

the  aged  would be considered. I know  of  many  old

people  who  do  not consult doctors because  of  the

heavy  charges.  Will  the Minister  look  into  this

matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a shortage of male nurses or manpower

in  certain  hospitals or clinics. Just to  quote  an

incident.  An emergency call was put through  Control

requesting for an ambulance for an orthopaedic  case.

The  call was diverted to Siglap Orthopaedic Hospital

since  the accident occurred in that area. At present

the  ambulance at this centre is manned by a  driver,

an  attendant and a nurse, who are on stand-by  duty.

What  is  alarming  is how could these  three  people

handle a heavily-built person from a high rise flat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in this home accident case, a heavily built

man weighing 200 lbs, fractured



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



his  leg  and had to be carried down from the  fourth

storey. When the ambulance came, the driver stood  by

the  ambulance, the attendant carried  the  stretcher

and  the nurse followed him up to the flat where  the

accident occurred. They had a tough time carrying the

patient  onto  the  stretcher.  Then  there  was  the

problem of how to carry this patient down the  flight

of stairs. The nurse could not do much and had to ask

for help from the neighbours. But there was not a man

around  to help, as all the men had gone to work.  So

unfortunately  the  nurse and  an  old  lady  from  a

neighbouring  flat had to carry this patient  to  the

waiting  ambulance. The question is: why is a trained

male nurse not provided in all ambulances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again there are complaints of inadequate

transport   facilities  for  patients   referred   by

specialist clinics to the major hospitals. There have

been  instances where patients who have been attended

to  by  Government doctors in specialist clinics  are

referred for admission to a major hospital. A patient

arrives  at  the clinic at about 8.30 a.m. and  after

consulting  the  doctor  at  about  9.00  a.m. he  is

referred to a major hospital. The staff at the clinic

then summons for an ambulance, and this is where  the

long wait starts. The ambulance arrives sometimes  at

about  11.30  a.m. If the patient needs  an  ambulance

badly, other means of transport is provided, in which

case  he  has  got  to be uncomfortably  transported.

Having  arrived at the hospital and by  the  time  he

goes   through   the   administrative   process   for

admission, it would be about 1 p.m. Thus, he may have

to  skip  his lunch. Some patients have to go without

lunch  and  in  some cases, they would  have  already

missed  their breakfast, as they have to  be  at  the

clinic  before  8.00 a.m. to beat the  rush.  In  most

cases, investigations have revealed that there  is  a

shortage   of  vehicles  to  immediately  cater   for

admitting  patients.  This  has  inconvenienced  many

patients  due to the frustration caused by having  to

wait for medical attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the Maternal and Child Health Clinic and also at other outpatient clinics,

whenever  a  resident doctor is  not  available,  the

doctor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



on  duty  is  normally summoned by the staff  of  the

clinic  and he takes a long time to arrive.  This  is

because of the shortage of doctors which seems to  be

a perpetual problem. Last year, 100 doctors resigned.

What  is  the Minister going to do? He will  have  to

employ  more doctors. I admit it is difficult to  get

the doctors but we should stop them from migrating to

other  countries,  Meanwhile, the  patients  normally

small  children  and toddlers, start  to  cry  for  a

considerable  time at the clinic.  Can  something  be

done to summon a doctor early?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to mention is that

generally  the  wards  and toilets  in  most  of  our

hospitals  are filthy and at times vulgar scribblings

are found. I wonder whether checks are carried out to

see  that  all  the wards and public toilets  in  the

hospitals are kept clean. Sir, most probably all  the

toilets  are  cleaned  by the  time  I  filed  in  my

amendment to speak on this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard comments from nurses that while they

are  expected  to present a neat and tidy  look,  the

uniforms   supplied  to  them  are  generally   below

standard. This is probably due to the acceptance of a

cheap  tender. Even the shoes are not up to standard.

Some of the nurses, therefore, have to sew their  own

uniforms.  Alternatively, why do we not provide  them

with  a uniform allowance instead of supplying  them?

The  Ministry could give them a uniform allowance of,

say,  $100.  It  is better that they make  their  own

uniforms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, tuberculosis is an

infectious disease common to man and certain animals.

In 1960 the PAP Government initiated the programme to

ensure  that the incidence level of this disease  was

suppressed. The Tuberculosis Control Unit was set  up

aiming  at, among other things, active  case-finding

and  adequate treatment for all tuberculosis  victims

discovered and immunisation of all children. The  BCG

vaccination programme covers over 90% of all  infants

in Singapore. This is indeed a laudable achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, from the figures of the 1975 Annual

Report of the Ministry of Health on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



specified  notifiable diseases, of which tuberculosis

is one, there is no significant drop in the number of

tuberculosis notifications over the last  six  years.

In  1971,  3,407  cases were notified;  1972,  3,109;

1973, 3,037; 1974, 3,451; and 1975, 3,097. They have

been hovering on the 3,000-plus mark, and one wonders

why  such a situation exists when in addition to  the

Tuberculosis Control Unit we have SATA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the role of SATA in relation to the

Tuberculosis Control Unit? Is SATA performing as well

as   to   be  expected?  For  that  matter,  is   the

Tuberculosis  Control  Unit performing  an  admirable

task? The figures speak for themselves, Sir, What  is

most  worrying, Sir, is the fact that most  employers

utilise  SATA  to  check the pulmonary  condition  of

their  workers and SATA. I believe, does not go  into

the  treatment  of tuberculosis. How  many  cases  of

active  pulmonary lesions have been referred by  SATA

to  the Tuberculosis Control Unit for treatment? What

is  SATA's grant from Government, and are we  getting

the  best  from SATA? These are bothersome  questions

that  must  be  answered.  I  hope  some  active  and

positive steps will be taken to ensure a drastic drop

in the Tuberculosis figures in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime in October last year it

was  reported that more than 30 people  died  in  the

United  States  of America of heart or lung  diseases

after  receiving  swine-flu  vaccination.  Could  the

House  be  enlightened as to whether the Ministry  of

Health  did  purchase such vaccine? If  so, at  what

cost,  and  whether  the vaccine  was  used  and  its

effect. How long will this vaccine retain its potency

if  kept unused? And in the light of what took  place

in  the  United  States, will the  Ministry  use  the

vaccine  at all? If not, what does it propose  to  do

with the stock?



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, where credit is

due, credit should be given. I think the Ministry  of

Health has seen more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



changes  over  the last two years than  the  ten-year

period  previously.  I therefore disagree  with  some

expressions made here that things have not  improved.

Actually  things  have  improved.  They  are  moving.

However,  there still remains some needling  problems

which I believe are being taken care of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been reminded every so often that costs

of    medical   services,   medical   treatment   and

hospitalisation,  have been increasing  by  something

like  12%  per  annum.  We see  that  this  year  the

Ministry's estimated expenditure is somewhere in  the

region  of $187 million and development estimates  at

$62  million. This, therefore, places the expenditure

for the Health Ministry fourth after Finance, Defence

and  Education.  Coupled with this is the  increasing

expectation  of  our  people  for  better  and   more

sophisticated  medical attention.  I  therefore  feel

that somehow things are not going to be that easy for

people  to  seek treatment in the future, considering

the  rather nominal charges that have been levied to-date. I would therefore request the Hon. Minister for

Health  to  enlighten this House if his  Ministry  is

considering any possible hike in medical fees in  the

near future and, if so, what form it will take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point on which I wish to seek

clarification is in regard to a newspaper report that

the  Health Ministry is considering classifying wards

into  five categories. At the present moment we  have

three,  and  I  cannot see any real reason  for  this

further  classification which, I think, may just  add

on to the confusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to raise is in

respect  of  the  construction of a  convalescent  or

nursing  home  which will serve more  as  a  half-way

house   for   total   patient  care.   As   correctly

emphasised,  the present hospitals are to  cater  for

acute medical attention and treatment. But even  with

the decentralisation of our hospitals, we still get a

good  number  of long-staying patients  who  clog  up

acute  beds.  These cases are not fit  enough  to  be

discharged  from  hospital  because  they   are   not

independent enough to be at home. There are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



many  such  problem cases which we  see  in  hospital

routines everyday. I would therefore ask the Ministry

to consider setting up these convalescent homes which

can  be  run rather cheaply, requiring little medical

attention  but  more nursing care. I  appreciate  the

fact  that  the  Home  Nursing  Foundation  has  been

established.  But  I think that caters, only  for  a

specific  type of home nursing care. We are aware  of

many  medical  problems, for example,  patients  with

stroke  who  tend to lie in hospital  for  weeks  and

sometimes months; surgical problems of patients  with

diabetes and those who are amputees and are not  able

to  go  home  early.  On top of  that,  we  have  the

multiple-injured patients who cannot possibly be sent

home  in  the 20th storey of a HDB flat. In  view  of

these  problems  I  sincerely  suggest  to  the  Hon.

Minister  that  some consideration be given  for  the

setting up of such a hospital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission  if  I may pick the point  raised  by  the

Member  for  Anson  with regard to the  shortage  and

recruitment of doctors in the hospitals. I would just

like to make `the suggestion to the Hon. Minister for

Health  that  in  future medical students  graduating

from  the  School of Medicine should compulsorily  be

made to serve in the hospitals, say, for a period  of

five years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just take up the

specific points raised by Members of the House before

I  enter into a general statement, particularly  with

regard  to  staffing the hospitals with doctors.  The

Member  for  Anson has stated that  we  are  spending

money  to  improve  hospitals  and  he  has  enquired

whether  we  have  adequate  doctors  to  man   these

hospitals.  I would like to explain that improvements

which  we  are  going to make to the  hospitals  will

amount to only $9 million, and they are intended  for

old  hospitals,  such as the Tan Tock Seng  Hospital,

Alexandra  Hospital,  Kandang  Kerbau  Hospital   and

Woodbridge  Hospital. All these hospitals were  built

before the war. I have visited all the hospitals  but

I must confess that I have not made an exploration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



into  public toilets. If the Member for Anson reports

that  the toilets are in a disgraceful state, then  I

must  say that it might be a good idea if he  carries

out  an  education campaign among the users of public

toilets so that they do the right thing in the  right

place.  However.  I shall bring this  matter  to  the

attention  of  the  Medical Superintendents  and  the

secretaries  in the hospitals so that public  toilets

will be used for what they are intended to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also mentioned that the

Maternal  and  Child Health clinics are understaffed.

Strangely  enough.  I hear from the  Member  for  Toa

Payoh  that his Maternal and Child Health  Clinic  is

irrelevant  because, as a result of a very successful

family  planning campaign, there are very few mothers

taking  their  children  to the  Maternal  and  Child

Health Clinic at Toa Payoh. And he is requesting that

this   clinic   be  converted  into   an   outpatient

department. It is true that in the past the  Maternal

and Child Health Clinics were run separately from the

Outpatient departments and from the school  services.

Because  of this set-up, the utilisation of  manpower

was  not  optimum, and last year we  integrated  the

Maternal  and  Child Health Clinics  and  the  school

services together with the Outpatient departments  so

that  we can make full use of the staff. In this  way

we  hope to be able at least for the next three years

to overcome the problem of shortage of doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambulance services will be integrated by April

or  May  of  this year after a discussion between  my

Ministry  and  the  Ministry of  Social  Affairs.  In

future the public need ring only one number and  they

will  be  able to get a public ambulance provided  by

the   Fire   Brigade.  There  will  be   a   distinct

improvement  in  the  ambulance  services,  Moreover.

these ambulances will be controlled by radio so  that

there will be constant contact between the ambulances

and  the  Accident and Emergency Departments  in  the

hospitals.   However,  with  regard   to   ambulances

carrying  patients  from  one  hospital  to   another

hospital, I would say that after the integration  the

load  on  hospital  ambulances  will  be  eased   and

therefore patients need not have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



to wait that long if they have to be transported from

one hospital to another for specialist treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has mentioned about the

prevalence   of   tuberculosis   cases.    For    his

information, there were 4,711 cases in 1965 and 2,815

cases  in 1976. If we were to calculate the rate  per

thousand population, they work out to 250 in 1965 and

124  in 1976. This means that the rate has gone  down

by  50.6%  in 12 years. So there has really  been  no

increase  in  the number of tuberculosis  cases.  The

reason why we are still seeing a significantly  large

number of tuberculosis cases is that tuberculosis  is

prevalent  among  that  generation  which  has  never

received   BCG   vaccination.  BCG  vaccination   was

introduced in Singapore only in the late 195Os and it

is  to be expected that the older generation will  be

carrying  tuberculosis and spreading it to those  who

are  at  risk.  So it will be many more years  before

tuberculosis disappears entirely from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SATA is a separate organisation. It has no

connections with the Ministry of Health. It  receives

a  subsidy  of  $35,000 from the Ministry  of  Social

Affairs.  I am told that operations of SATA have  now

expanded  to cover heart and chest diseases. However,

SATA  is  bound to notify the Ministry of  Health  of

tuberculosis cases that it comes across,  SATA,  like

any  other private practitioner, is entitled to treat

tuberculosis cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his question on swine-flu vaccine,

the  Ministry has ordered several thousand  doses  of

vaccines,  but  they have not yet  arrived.  Off  the

cuff, I think that the total cost would come to about

$600,000.

The  number  of doses ordered has been calculated  to

provide,   first,  for  those  who  are  working   in

essential  services. If there is a demand by  members

of  the  public, then more doses will be ordered  but

they  will  have  to pay at about $5  per  dose.  The

vaccine  that  we have ordered will offer  protection

against swine-flu, Hongkong flu and Victoria `A' flu.

It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



is a tri-valent vaccine. When the vaccine arrives, we

will first vaccinate national servicemen because they

live  together in camps and are very likely to spread

influenza among themselves and to their families when

they return home from camp.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Member for Kim Seng as to whether

there will be any increase in medical charges. I must

say  that  this is being looked into.  In  the  first

instance,  we  are  studying  the  rationale  for  an

increase  in  dental  charges.  As  of  this  moment,

Members are aware that the Ministry is charging  only

$4  per patient per treatment. This, of course, leads

to  pressure  in  the  demand for  treatment  in  the

Ministry's Dental Department. For a charge of $4, the

dental surgeon has to spend probably half an hour  on

a patient. This is patently absurd. So we are looking

into the matter to vary the charges, according to the

type  of treatment that is to be provided as well  as

according  to  the time that has to  be  spent  on  a

particular  patient. When there is  any  increase  in

dental  or medical charges, we will announce them  in

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers have got hold of a story that we are

contemplating on introducing five classes  of  wards.

It is a true story. As of this moment, there are only

three  classes - A class for which we charge $60  per

day. B class $30 per day and C class $4. There is  an

enormous gap between $4 and $30 and $30 and $60. With

successful  family  planning and  greater  acceptance

that  two  children  are  enough,  more  parents  are

anxious that they and their children receive the best

medical  care. Doctors and the nurses at the  Kandang

Kerbau Hospital have been plagued with requests  from

C class patients, even B class patients, to be lodged

in  A class wards. The number of requests amounts  to

about  eight to 1 2 per day. I believe that  $60  per

day  may  be too high for some middle income  groups,

and  likewise  $30 may be too high for  some  working

class  people.  But  bearing in mind  that  there  is

increasing affluence, and there has been  a  rise  in

wages or income among the population, we have decided

to introduce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



a  second A class ward and a second B class  ward  so

that  a  patient can pay according to  a  progressive

scale  of charges. This. I think, is fairer than  the

present  system  where there is an  enormous  quantum

jump  from $30 B class to $60 A class and from  $4  C

class to $30 B class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C class ward will be intended primarily for

those who really cannot afford to pay, and I think it

is  fair  that  the  people of  Singapore  should  be

conscious that medical costs have gone up by 300%  in

the  last  five years, or about 1.15% of the  GNP  in

1975, and therefore part of the cost will have to  be

paid for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's suggestion that we should open a

nursing  or  convalescent home for stroke  and  other

chronic  patients. I regret that our studies indicate

that  it  is  going  to be very difficult  to  do  so

because we have discovered from the experience of the

United  Kingdom that nursing homes or even homes  for

the  aged  are very expensive to run as  compared  to

treating   them   as  outpatients.   In   1970,   the

expenditure  spent by the British Government  on  in-patients   was  �293  million.  On  outpatients   �24

million.  On home nursing only �12 million.  But  the

cost  of  running homes for the aged shot up  to  �53

million. And presumably the same economic rules  will

apply  to  us if we try to run homes for the  chronic

sick.  Worse  than that, I am afraid that  in  future

years  we are going to face a labour shortage. Mindef

is  already facing that problem. It has announced the

need  to  recruit  women into non-combatant  national

service and maybe in 10 or 15 years' time we may  not

even find the people who want to work in convalescent

homes or in nursing homes for the chronic sick.  This

is  a  nagging  problem.  I  am  already  finding  it

difficult  to recruit people who will want  to  work,

let   us  say, in  Woodbridge  Hospital.  Woodbridge

Hospital  is intended to house those who are mentally

ill.  But  those  who are mentally  ill  have  become

geriatric cases. From a state of mental illness  they

have  advanced  to  a  state of mental  senility.  So

Woodbridge Hospital is really a combination of a home

for  the aged as well as a home for the mentally ill.

Doctors in particular are very reluctant to work in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



Woodbridge  Hospital, and that is why  my  sympathies

and my encouragement go to those who are prepared  to

take  on a job which is unpopular and not at all very

attractive, because working in a home like that  does

not provide an outlet and encourage a doctor to leave

the Ministry to enter into private practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore decided to concentrate on home

nursing   as  explained  in  the  Addendum   to   the

President's Address. The Home Nursing Foundation will

deal with patients referred to by hospital doctors in

the  first  instance, and it is part of primary  care

service.  This is one sector which we hope to  expand

and on which money will be spent. More nurses will be

recruited for this particular aspect of home  nursing

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me come to the vexing problem raised by

the  Member  for Anson and the Member for Punggol  on

the  shortage of doctors. I am afraid that there  are

many  factors relating to the exodus of doctors  from

the  Ministry  of Health, and it is a  problem  which

requires  some  degree of analysis. I would  like  to

make it quite clear that we should make a distinction

between  doctors who migrate and leave Singapore  and

doctors  who  leave the Ministry of Health  to  enter

private  practice. Members may be aware or  recollect

that  the  Ministry of Defence last month  advertised

that two of their doctors holding the rank of Captain

deserted  national  service by  absconding  overseas.

Both   of   them  were  doctors  trained  in  foreign

universities and, therefore, were registrable abroad,

one  in  Canada  and  one in the  UK.  They  did  not

therefore require certificates of good standing  from

the  Ministry  of  Defence or the  Singapore  Medical

Council in order to register abroad. This made  their

flight from Singapore easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta will recollect that in July

last year he questioned me on the number of Singapore

doctors  who  were  registered in foreign  countries.

(Hansard, dated 23.7.76, cols. 983-5). I  could  not

then  give  him an accurate answer but  provided  the

House  with information on the number of certificates

issued from 1973 to 1976. I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



since examined the problem and discovered that it  is

not   obligatory  under  the  written  law  for  such

certificates  of good standing to be issued  at  all.

Furthermore, such  certificates  have  been   issued

freely without the applicant providing evidence  that

he is of good standing during his period of practice.

In  fact,  every  doctor who has  just  finished  his

housemanship if he asks, will be automatically  given

a  Certificate of Good Standing. This, of course,  is

an  extraordinary  position. I feel  that  in  future

applicants will have to prove that they are  of  good

standing, and I do not see how good standing  can  be

proved unless the applicant has at least three  years

of  practice, either in the private or public sector,

to   show  his  competency.  A  Certificate  of  Good

Standing  as  I  see it, is like a testimonial,  very

much  like  one  given on behalf of a person  by  his

referee  to  a prospective employer. I can  say  from

experience   that   not  all  referees   write   good

testimonials.  Any  doctor  who  wishes  to  register

overseas   can   produce  his  own   Certificate   of

Registration  in Singapore. But we are  going  beyond

our  obligations  to issue so-called Certificates  of

Good Standing to every applicant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to this problem of doctors who move

out of the Ministry of Health into private practice,

because  it does hurt the Ministry. I think I  ought

to  expound  a  little. There are many  reasons  why

doctors  move  out. Some of the major reasons  which

have  been listed by private practitioners who  once

upon a time worked in the public sector are:-

<pre>

    Job is not challenging.

    No opportunity for promotion.

    Poor physical working environment.

    Poor salary

    Poor staff relationship.

    Inability to get requested postings.

</pre>



These  are  the major reasons. The other reasons  are

that  they  have got more freedom and that  they  are

able  to  do  other  business. Obviously,  we  cannot

satisfy  anyone or everyone because of  the  numerous

reasons that have been given.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me deal with some of these reasons. In

the case of salaries and promotions, I would like  to

say this for the information of Members of the House.

In  the  Soviet Union doctors are paid less than  the

ordinary  industrial  worker. Doctors  are  paid  120

roubles per month. The industrial worker is paid  162

roubles  per  month  because he  is  the  person  who

produces  the  goods. And the rate  of  inflation  of

retail prices has been kept at 2% in the USSR.  I  am

not  suggesting that Singapore can operate  like  the

USSR  because we are an open economy. There is a free

market here and we operate on free market rules.  But

bearing  in  mind  that expenditure  for  the  health

services has increased by 300% in five years, and now

our  health  expenditure is as high as 1.15%  of  the

GNP,  I  think it is very difficult indeed to satisfy

doctors or to match doctors' salaries with what  they

can  earn  as private practitioners. By  the  time  a

Chinese newspaper editor comes to the conclusion that

the  private  practitioner can earn two to  10  times

that  of a Government doctor, I do not see how it  is

possible  for the Minister for Finance to agree  that

the immediate solution to the shortage of doctors  in

the Ministry of Health is to proportionately increase

their  salaries. It will lead to a demand for similar

increases   among  other  professional   staff   - the

lawyers,   the   architects,   the   engineers,   the

accountants and so on.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this score, therefore, I can say that little can

be  done but on promotion something can be done. I am

in  sympathy with those doctors who have  worked  for

many  years  in the Ministry of Health. I think  they

deserve consideration for promotion although they may

not   have  a  post-graduate  qualification.   I   am

convinced  that  medicine is still  an  art  acquired

through  experience and medicine relies  on  clinical

judgement, which  again  is  based  on  experience.

Therefore,  by virtue of this experience,  I  believe

that   those   with  eight  years'  service   deserve

consideration for promotion regardless  of  the  fact

they  do  not have a higher qualification. After  all

many  civil service administrators have been promoted

not because they have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



Ph.D  or  any  other  higher  university  degree  but

because   of  their  experience  and  their  personal

capability.  I  think, likewise, the  same  criterion

should be applied to doctors. However, this does  not

mean  that  we are discouraging doctors who  wish  to

improve their knowledge and learning by taking higher

examinations.  On the contrary, the present  practice

of  awarding doctors with allowances, if they hold  a

higher qualification, should be continued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of poor staff relationship, this is

a  point  which  I am afraid the Minister  is  in  no

position to handle. Staff relationship has got to  do

with  doctors and doctors. Some doctors are soloists.

You will notice that some doctors who go into private

practice  do  not  practise as a group  but  practise

solo.  So also, I feel that such people will not  fit

into  a  team  in a hospital because  in  a  hospital

doctors are required to work as a team. Once they are

in  a team there is a hierarchy. The junior doctor or

medical   officer  has  to  take  orders   from   the

Registrar, who   takes  orders  from   the   Senior

Registrar, and  who in turn takes  orders  from  the

Consultant,  and  so  on. There is  a  "hen  pecking"

order.  It  is  very much like what you  get  in  the

Singapore Armed Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned indeed that the man at the top should

be sound headed and competent so that he can hold his

team  together. I would be very worried indeed if  we

do  not  try  to bring up a generation  of  gurus  or

teachers  who  can  collect  around  them  disciples.

because  it  is  through  their  leadership  that   a

tradition  can  be  built in the hospitals.  If  each

doctor looks after his own interest, I am afraid  all

medical  traditions will disappear.  It  is  not  the

private  sector  or the private medical  practitioner

who  is  setting tradition in Singapore, or standards

if  I may add. It is those who work in the hospitals,

in  the  University  units, who  have  a  very  large

responsibility for collecting disciples around  them,

for  building a medical school. And you can  only  do

that  if  there are good gurus. So long as we  search

for  good gurus and as long as there is hope that  we

can  find good gurus, I think they ought to  be  duly

rewarded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am afraid doctors are difficult persons to

deal  with, like  lawyers. You know,  lawyers  never

agree  with each other. So also, doctors rarely agree

with  their diagnoses or even their treatments.  That

is  why  both lawyers and doctors have one  thing  in

common - plenty of words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason why they leave is that the job is

not  challenging and that they are unable  to  get  a

requested  posting.  I have discovered  that  doctors

have been posted by computers. I believe this is  not

a  clever  idea. For one thing, the man who  did  the

programming had left the Ministry. Circumstances have

changed  and there is nobody to change the programme.

So the computer is operating on old yardsticks for  a

new  generation of doctors. So wrong people are being

posted  to  the  wrong places. For instance,  when  I

visited Woodbridge Hospital I was greeted by a  young

medical  officer. Far from smiling at me,  he  grimly

told  me  "I want another posting." Looking into  the

complaints  made on the inability to  get  the  right

posting,  I  have  suggested  to  my  officers   that

henceforth  the  posting  of  doctors  will  be  made

according  to where vacancies occur, so that  when  a

person applies for a job he knows what he is in  for.

I  would  rather  have happy doctors working  in  the

right  places than reluctant doctors in the  service,

because they will demoralise the whole service. These

are the gripers and grumblers who will collect around

them  dissidents  and who keep on pressing  home  the

point that there is no job satisfaction. A doctor  is

a doctor. If a doctor cannot find satisfaction in his

job,   then  obviously  he  has  chosen  the   wrong

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were given the responsibility of having to

build a completely new medical school in a completely

new country, I would insist that all those who aspire

to  enter medical school should do a spell of nursing

for  two years. As it is, entering medical school  is

like  first passing your GCE "O" Level, then the  "A"

level, then the first MBBS and then the second  MBBS:

a  series  of passing examinations. Medical  students

have  little  concept  that  their  profession  is  a

vocation and even among nurses there is a 20%



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



dropout  during the training period. I am quite  sure

that  if  we  ask  those who wish to  be  trained  as

doctors  to do a spell in nursing, some of them  will

change  their  minds after they have gone  through  a

period of nursing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more particularly concerned because last year

50%  of medical students in the first year are girls.

So  this is going to pose a genuine problem, not only

for  my Ministry but for the Ministry of Defence. The

Ministry   of  Defence  requires  male  doctors   for

national  service. So if there are less male doctors.

there  are  going  to  be less doctors  for  national

service.  Since  the lady doctors have  prospects  of

getting married and bringing up a family, in the  end

we  might  not  be  having the  effective  number  of

material whom we can recruit as doctors, particularly

when  the  experience of Britain shows that at  least

15%  to  20%  of  female  doctors  are  lost  to  the

profession. This is a point which I ought to bring to

the  attention of the House because it  is  food  for

thought  and  I am just thinking what I ought  to  do

with  regard  to future intake of students  into  the

Medical School and how I ought to correspond with the

University of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be truthful, I believe there is a trend among the

younger generation. This is a new trend which we  did

not  see  20  years' ago. In the 50s I remember  some

colleagues  of  mine who retired from the  University

Service as doctors did not collect enough from  their

pension  or the Provident Fund to buy a house.  These

days  the young doctor who graduates immediately asks

for  a house. The Member for Kim Seng mentioned in  a

speech at a Rotary Club which was reported recently -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Toh, may I remind you that we have

got  another four amendments to go before  guillotine

time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will cover everything

as fast as I can, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please carry on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I would just like to say that

there is a trend among the younger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



generation,  and  the trend is to  achieve  the  good

things  in  life  as  early as  possible.  It  is  an

indictment, of course, that our social values that we

wish to impart are not there. All that you have to do

is   to  watch  the  commercial  advertisements  over

television.  They  are  all directed  at  urging  the

consumer instinct in the young. You see the case of a

24-year-old  entertaining  ambitions  of  becoming  a

millionairess at her age, going to work in a chauffer-driven  Mercedes  Benz.  By the  time  she  has  that

ambition, what about the younger doctors?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker reminds me that there are four more

amendments to go; perhaps I will reserve what I  have

got to say when the other four amendments are moved.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, as the Senior Minister for

Health  has given a long explanation, I beg leave  to

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> At this stage, I think we shall have a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head L - (cont.)



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Sir, two different topics to raise under

this amendment. Firstly, I would like to find out the

exact  position of a Singapore citizen who is married

to a non-Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



citizen  but a permanent resident. They were  married

with  the  permission of the Labour Office. The  wife

who  was pregnant went to a hospital here to have her

baby.  Why was the husband asked to pay a deposit  of

$2,000 if he can afford it? If he cannot, why has  he

got  to pay $60 for a class C ward? That is my  first

question.   I   may  be  wrong  but  I   would   like

clarification on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have a situation in Singapore where in

the  last  two  years  there seems  to  be  a  little

encouragement  on  breast feeding. The  situation  is

that  a  nurse will go up to the mother and ask,  "Do

you want to breast feed or bottle feed your baby?" If

the mother says "bottle feed", a bottle is given; and

if  she  says  "breast feed", breast  is  given!  But

unfortunately the nurses are really not aware of what

constitutes breast milk. They actively discourage the

mothers  from  giving the colostrum, the  first  flow

from  the breast, to the baby because it is  not  the

colour  of milk. They discourage the mothers  because

they  say  it  is no good. If you read last  Sunday's

Sunday Nation about X factors and also about what  is

in  the colostrum, it is good for the baby. It  helps

to give immunity to the baby. Why is the hospital not

actively  encouraging breast feeding?  In  the  olden

days  we  had no problem. In my younger days  mothers

used  to  breast feed their babies in  buses.  Today,

with  modern commercialisation of tinned milk,  young

mothers  are  now  ashamed of feeding  the  baby  the

natural way. There are so many good things in  breast

milk and yet our hospitals discourage it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this from first hand. In the last three

months  two  of my sisters have given birth,  and  in

both  cases they were discouraged from giving  breast

milk.  I  am  surprised at this. We should  encourage

mothers  to give breast milk to their babies  because

of the very many factors that are helpful to both the

mother and the baby. The baby will get immunity  from

taking  the  natural mother's milk  and  the  mother,

contrary to some myth, will regain her figure faster,

So  I  am quite surprised that breast feeding is  not

being encouraged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter, which is again quite surprising to

me, is  that after both my sisters have given birth,

there  came a lady dressed as a nurse and unsolicited

(we do not know who she is). She said, "I am a mother-care  nurse".  She  came in, weighed  the  baby,  and

immediately tried to sell a brand-named milk. I  want

to  know  how  this milk company got  the  names  and

addresses  of the mothers. I thought that  the  names

and  addresses given to the hospital are confidential

and should not be given to anybody who asks for them.

So how did their names get to the milk company? These

people are dressed as nurses, and a woman who is  not

fairly  well educated may think that they are  nurses

and  are giving good advice about giving tinned  milk

or  formula  milk to the baby. She might  immediately

change from breast feeding to tinned milk which is, I

think, rather undesirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group willing to teach young mothers how

to  breast feed before they go to hospital to deliver

their babies. It may sound ridiculous that mothers do

not  know  how  to breast feed, but it is  true  that

there  are  certain problems associated  with  breast

feeding.  This  group  is  willing  to  teach  breast

feeding  and yet I understand that it is not  getting

any  encouragement  from the  hospital.  In  fact,  I

understand  that one hospital medical  superintendent

is  definitely hostile to the group that he would not

allow  any of its members into the hospital to  teach

the  young mothers how to breast feed. I am wondering

why  there  is this hostility towards breast  feeding

which is a natural thing to do. If God meant to  give

the  baby  cow's  milk, then He would  do  away  with

breasts  for  women! I would be most obliged  if  the

Hon.  Minister could answer the questions that I have

posed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, may I just take up the point

immediately since you indicated to me that there is a

guillotine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ought to explain that under the present scheme of

medical charges all those who are in possession of  a

work  permit  or  Employment Pass are  considered  as

residents and are charged residential fees, obstetric

cases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



excepting.  Unfortunately,  this  interpretation  has

been  applied  even to those who hold Singapore  blue

identity  cards. It does not make sense  indeed  that

permanent residents who hold Singapore blue  identity

cards  but do not work are charged residential  rates

whereas  those who are willing to work and hold  work

permits  are  charged nonresidential  rates.  I  have

reviewed  the  matter and decided that  henceforth  a

permanent resident holding a blue Singapore  identity

card regardless of whether he holds a work permit  or

an Employment Pass and who is the wife of a Singapore

citizen  will be charged the same hospital  rates  as

for residents in all obstetric cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the second point on breast feeding, I

cannot remember whether all of us were brought up  on

mother's milk. But at least I assume some of  us  are

well  aware  of the campaign conducted by the  Member

for Potong Pasir, He is a great enthusiast for breast

feeding, excepting that I have to remind him "that is

meant for kids only". I am not aware that any of  the

obstetric departments in our hospitals are hostile to

the  practice of breast feeding. In fact, the  Member

for Potong Pasir is very pleased indeed with the milk

bank that we have helped him to establish. But if  it

is true, as the Member for Telok Blangah has alleged,

that  there is a campaign at marketing cow's milk  in

hospitals,  I would like to know the full particulars

so that action can be taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hospitals are not areas which I would normally

like to tread nor is it prudent on my part to cock  a

snook  at  the guardian of our health. But  when  the

addition   of  two  posts  under  subhead  BAA   1101

increases the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



appropriation by over $2 million, I am interested  to

know  if million dollar men are being created in  the

surgery  of the Singapore General Hospital. Sir,  the

physical creation of Singapore's own bionic  man  may

be  a  mythical  project, but let me hasten  to  draw

attention to a more serious and down-to-earth problem

in the hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read with great concern the reported resignation

of  100  Government doctors in a New Nation editorial

23rd February, 1977

has  called the mass resignation and emigration  "mob

hysteria" in a recent talk to the Rotary Club. Unlike

the  Member  for Kim Seng, I am a layman  in  medical

affairs  but even a layman knows that health  service

is  labour-intensive and its quality  hinges  on  the

availability   of   suitably   qualified   personnel,

particularly doctors. With due respect to the  press,

laymen  also  know that press reports  based  on  so-called  reliable  sources  often  turn  out   to   be

unreliable.  Could  the  Hon.  Minister  for   Health

therefore  enlighten  us as  to  the  true  situation

regarding  the reported mass resignation  of  doctors

from  the  medical  service and whether  or  not  the

problem  of "mob hysteria" exists. Having  asked  the

question,  Sir,I  hope I would  not  end  up  in  a

hospital.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the Member for Marine Parade

has  raised  a  very important question.  Firstly,  I

would  like to congratulate him on his sharp  eye  in

detecting  the  enormous difference  in  the  subhead

under  Singapore General Hospital for  the  financial

year  1977-78. I must confess it was a ghastly error.

An  investigation  has shown that  in  reality  $0.368

million  is  intended  for  annual  increments,   the

balance of $1.797 million was to cover 606 new  posts

proposed by the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation given to me was that most of the

new  posts proposed were not approved by the Ministry

of  Finance  when the Estimates were submitted  under

subhead  BAA 1101, and because of clerical  oversight

it  was  too late to adjust the provision  since  the

Estimates had already been finalised and printed. The

error would be rectified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



administratively by freezing the excess provision.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the second point with regard to the question

of  the  resignation of doctors - I  think  it  is  a

continuation  of what the Member for  Kim  Seng,  the

Member for Anson and the Member for Punggol have said

a little while ago, and so may I continue with what I

said  a little while ago before? While I do not  want

to appear to be harsh in my judgment of the attitudes

of  the younger generation, I think it is fair enough

that we should try to be as objective as possible  in

our estimation of trends. I made a speech at a dinner

two  weeks  ago in which I stated that about  60%  of

doctors  had resigned with less than three  years  of

service.  I  am  afraid it was  a  very  conservative

estimate.  I should have qualified that statement  by

saying  that  at  least  60%  had  resigned.  I  have

examined  the  trend and I would like to  inform  the

House  of  what I have discovered. The percentage  of

doctors resigning within three years was:

<pre>

          1972   ...   44%

          1973   ...   65%

          1974   ...   69%

          1975   ...   74%

          1976   ...   73%

</pre>



<br><br>So  there is a clear-cut trend, and not to understand

this trend means that we will forever be chasing  our

tails  and  listening  to  complaints  made  by   the

doctors' union on inadequate salaries, unsatisfactory

conditions  of  service, and so on. I have  indicated

earlier  that the eagerness to enjoy the good  things

in life exists among our younger generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of private practice, market forces of

supply and demand apply. We all like to believe  that

our  doctors  are  serving  only  the  population  of

Singapore of 2.3 million permanent inhabitants.  This

is  not  really so. There were 1.5 million  transient

visitors  last  year, plus another 120,000  estimated

floating population of expatriates. In other words, I

put  it that the doctor-population ratio in Singapore

is  less than what it is. Therefore, as long as there

is  a demand and as long as members of the public  or

even visitors are prepared to pay the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



prices which the private practitioners call for,  the

exodus  from  the Ministry of Health  will  continue.

Hence. I have suggested earlier that there is a clear-cut  distinction  between migration and  leaving  the

Ministry of Health for private practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as migration is concerned, it is very

difficult   to   control  the   doctors,   short   of

withholding their passports. I do not think that  can

be  done.  But there is no reason at all, as  I  have

said  earlier, why the Ministry  of  Health  or  the

Medical  Council  should ever  give  an  applicant  a

Certificate  of Good Standing when there  is  nothing

under the law to say that this should be done. On the

other   hand,   I  have  appealed  for  institutional

loyalty. I am rather amazed or stunned by the  Member

for Jalan Kayu when he suggested that it is pointless

to  appeal to the doctor's loyalty and that he  would

rather  pay them. This is suggesting that all doctors

are  mercenary  and  that  they  have  got  no  other

instincts. I do not believe that all doctors are  the

same  and  there can be no institutional loyalty.  My

fear  is that the young doctors are leaving too early

for their own good.

Choo Kok and Dr Ong Leong Boon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that our Prime

Minister  and  our  Foreign  Minister  are  doing  an

excellent   job  for  Singapore  in  their   overseas

missions.  Every  time they visit a  foreign  country

some  sort of social, economic and regional agreement

with  the country seems to result, and in most  cases

the  agreement  is more or less in our favour.  Their

visits  have charted our little nation in  the  world

map  as  an important nation in this region. This  is

indeed remarkable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to know what are our overseas

missions   doing  besides  looking  after  passports,

visas,   and  encouraging  tourism  and   trade   for

Singapore? Are they advertising Singapore through our

missions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Foreign Ministry has stated that the major

powers  would  treat  our  region  as  an  "area   of

contest".  Except  for  Japan and  China,  the  other

powers no longer regard Southeast Asia as crucial  to

their  interest, as it once was. But then  the  major

industrial  powers are important to us  economically.

Their  investment  markets and their  technology  are

necessary  for  our continued economic  progress.  In

line  with this statement. I wonder what the Ministry

has  done so far or what it intends to do in the near

future for the benefit of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ASEAN Secretariat in which Singapore is

involved  was  formed sometime  ago.  I  gather  from

reports that the Secretariat is not fully functioning

in  Jakarta. What is happening to the Secretariat? Is

Singapore fulfilling its role in the Secretariat and,

if so, to what extent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, we seem to hear numerous news about our

connection  with the other ASEAN countries.  This  is

indeed important for our progress and survival of our

nation and region.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what has happened to our relationship with

the  Commonwealth countries? Sometime ago we had  the

pleasure of hosting the Commonwealth Conference  here

in  Singapore, but after that we seem  to  hear  less

about  our connections with the Commonwealth nations.

Why  is this so? Is there any intensive dialogue with

the Commonwealth nations for the economic, social and

regional benefit of our country. Or are we neglecting

our  interest with these countries? Can the  Minister

comment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget Estimate there is a sum of

$82,000 allocated for Foreign Service Training. May I

know  what  is this training all about, and  who  are

involved in the training?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, under the Expenditure on Manpower, I notice

that  the Ministry is finding it difficult to recruit

staff for our various overseas missions. Why is  this

so?  Is there a barrier in the selection of the staff

or  is it because there is a lack of response to this

Ministry?  As  far as I understand,  there  are  many

people  in  the  civil service  who  would  not  mind

offering  their  services in  the  Foreign  Ministry.

Could the Minister explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according

to the Memorandum on the Main Estimates there are two

decreases  in  the Ministry. Under EOM,  there  is  a

decrease  of $1.02 million and under OOE, a  decrease

of $1.00 million. The reason given is that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`no financial provision has been entered for the new

posts  and  vacancies .., in view of the difficulties

in recruiting staff for the various Missions.'



<br><br>Sir, it seems to me that the Ministry has made up its

mind  not  to recruit any new staff for the vacancies

in  the  various missions by not making any financial

provision  for  the  new  financial  year.  Sir,  the

reduced  budget only serves to give those  who  would

like  to make foreign service their career the  wrong

impression  that there is no future  in  joining  the

foreign   service.  I  wonder  whether  our   foreign

services will be weakened by this reduced budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has said in his 1977

Budget Statement that "to safeguard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



our  economic  interests, our trade,  investment  and

diplomatic  offices  will  be  strengthened  in   key

centres."  Sir, how could our diplomatic  offices  be

strengthened  by  unfilled  vacancies  and  a   total

decrease  of  about $2.00 million for the  staff  and

expenses for overseas missions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has encountered difficulties in

recruiting staff, as the Member for Anson has pointed

out, over  the  years. I want to  know  whether  the

Ministry  has up till now come up with  any  plan  to

solve   the  recruiting  problems  and  whether   our

diplomatic  offices in the various key  centres  have

been  affected  by the weakened foreign  service  and

shortage of diplomatic personnel.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as usual, the Member for Anson tries to kill

many birds with one stone. This time he tries to kill

six birds with one small stone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, in regard to what our

overseas missions are doing, I can assure the  Member

for  Anson that our overseas missions are not idling.

In  fact, they  are rather hard pressed  with  work.

Members  of our foreign service are actively  working

at  all  times  to encourage tourism  and  trade  for

Singapore. The Foreign Service officer is expected to

perform  a  varied task when serving in  one  of  our

overseas  missions.  Because of  Singapore's  limited

manpower resources, each officer is expected to  pull

his  weight and pay equal attention to the  political

and  economic  functions. In fact,  in  some  of  our

smaller  missions  one officer is  expected  to  look

after   many  jobs  in  connection  with  Singapore's

interests in the postings overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to mention in passing that this

reminds  me of my assignment when I was in  Cairo.  I

had  only  three staff, one Third Secretary  and  one

First   Secretary, and  we  had   to   cover   three

continents. Egypt, Yugoslavia, Ethiopia,  Beirut  and

Pakistan.  So Members can be sure that  we  have  not

been idling. So are the overseas diplomats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Commercial Secretariat service was established in

1976 under the charge of the Department of Trade. The

officers under this service are expected to do  hard-selling  of  Singapore  products.  This  means   that

Foreign  Service officers have now to concentrate  on

intensive economic monitoring of the countries  where

they  are posted to. They are expected to be  on  the

alert  for  protectionistic  tendencies  as  well  as

report  on  any economic opportunities available  for

Singapore.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question about some big powers no more

interested in this region and so what do we  do,  the

presence  of  major  powers in Southeast  Asia  is  a

permanent  feature  of the political  scene  in  this

region.   However,  some  powers  no  longer   regard

Southeast  Asia as crucial to their interests  as  it

was once. These are facts we have to live with and to

tailor our foreign policy objectives accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these powers no longer regard Southeast

Asia  as crucial, they nevertheless continue  to  pay

much  interest in the region, particularly  when  the

ASEAN  countries  have demonstrated the  benefits  of

foreign  investment in the region.  Our  task  is  to

ensure   that   such  interest  is   maintained   and

increased.  To this end, the Government has  embarked

on  a  range of activities which include the despatch

of  Singapore  trade missions and  the  reception  of

foreign  business  delegations.  For  instance,   our

Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  will  personally  be

heading  an  economic delegation of 20 persons  early

next  month to Brussels where a high level conference

will  be  held. This conference is organised  by  the

European   Economic  Commission  and   the   European

International  Bank and will be attended  by  leading

business   magnates  of  Western  Europe  and   ASEAN

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have publicised Singapore's

attractions   by  such  means  as  inviting   foreign

journalists to our country. For instance, a group  of

Swiss  journalists  were  invited  to  Singapore   in

conjunction with the recent flotation of  a  loan  in

the Swiss money market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At another level, my Ministry is posting high

calibre officers to key overseas missions. Commercial

secretaries  are  sent  out to  tap  new  markets.  A

mission will soon be sent to Jeddah. The EDB overseas

representatives  work hand in glove  with  diplomatic

officers,  as  they  are doing in  the  case  of  our

mission in Tokyo and Osaka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ASEAN front, dialogue which started with the

EEC.  Australia. New Zealand and Canada will soon  be

embracing  Japan  and the USA. There  is  potentially

great  benefits to be gained from these dialogues  in

terms  of greater investment, transfer of skills  and

technology and access to new markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the third question of ASEAN

Secretariat, we have only recently made two important

decisions  by the ASEAN Standing Committee which  set

up  the  ASEAN Secretariat in motion. These  are  the

approval  of the budget for the Secretariat  and  the

appointment of senior staff to the Secretariat  on  a

rotational  basis  in alphabetical  order.  Singapore

will continue to actively support the efforts of  the

ASEAN   Secretary-General.   General   Dharsono    of

Indonesia,  to  develop  the  Secretariat   into   an

effective organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question deals with the Commonwealth. I

can  assure  the Member for Anson that  we  have  not

neglected  the Commonwealth. In fact, our  ties  with

member-countries are increasing both on  a  bilateral

and  multi-lateral basis. Let me give some  instances

of  the  importance  we  continue  to  place  on  our

Commonwealth links. Since the Commonwealth  Heads  of

Government meeting was hosted by us here in Singapore

in  1971, the  Prime Minister and the  Minister  for

Foreign Affairs have attended biennial gatherings  in

Ottawa and Jamaica. This year they will again  go  to

London  where  the  meeting will  coincide  with  the

Silver Jubilee of the Queen's accession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore provides financial support to the

Commonwealth   Secretariat, particularly   to   the

Commonwealth  Fund  for Technical  Co-operation.  The

CFTC has helped



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans   to   acquire   new   skills    through

Commonwealth fellowships in national development. Our

cash  contributions and fellowship awards also go  to

the    Commonwealth   Institute   and    Commonwealth

Foundation.  As  part  of the Commonwealth  Technical

Assistance  and Cooperation. Singapore has  over  the

years  received  and  trained  many  nationals   from

Africa,  Papua New Guinea. Fiji and Sri  Lanka  among

others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Kingston meeting in 1975, the Commonwealth

Heads of Government set up a body of economic experts

to  examine ways in which the association can help in

bridging the gap between the rich and poor countries.

A separate group of industrial specialists was formed

with  10  members. Singapore was represented in  this

select group. The findings of these specialists  will

be considered by the Commonwealth Heads of Government

in June this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another level, Commonwealth Ministers meet

regularly on a variety of issues; monetary,  economic

development, trade,  law and so  forth.  At  various

international   forums,   Commonwealth    delegations

exchange  views,  try  to  coordinate  positions  and

minimise contentions. Yesterday, the 14th March, was

the  first  time  Commonwealth Day was simultaneously

observed  by all the 36 member-states. In  Singapore.

all  schools  observed the occasion on  the  11th  as

school  vacation started on 12th March.  Competitions

and  exhibitions  were organised. My  colleague,  the

Minister    for   Education.,   issued   a    special

Commonwealth Day Message. Tonight after this session.

I  have been invited by the Commonwealth Society to a

reception.  So  Members can  see  that  we  have  not

neglected the Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Over-worked!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question

of  recruitment  and training of diplomats,  this  is

quite a difficult problem for us because recruiting a

diplomat is not an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



easy    matter.   There   are   so   many   stringent

requirements. First of all, personality. A diplomat's

success wherever he may be depends to a large  extent

upon  the  way he cultivates friendship and  develops

contacts.  This  in turn is related directly  to  the

personality characteristics of the diplomat  and  his

spouse. He should possess both social graces as  well

as  a  friendly,  pleasant and outgoing  personality.

Secondly,  integrity  and  loyalty.  A  diplomat   is

entrusted  with the nation's plans and secrets.  This

great confidence which is entrusted in him must never

be  violated.  Therefore, he must be a  person  whose

integrity  and loyalty is beyond question.  Then,  we

need  someone with knowledge of sensitivity. He  must

be  able  to  understand strange customs, traditions,

ideology  which  are  fundamental  to  each  overseas

assignment.  The  officer  must  be  alert   to   the

psychological  sensitivity  of  foreigners  and  must

avoid  unwittingly insulting or offending them.  This

calls  for tact and discretion of the highest  level.

Then  he must have good judgment because in terms  of

crises, when he is under pressure, he must be counted

on  to  think clearly and to make correct  decisions.

Faulty  judgments can jeopardise the  interest  of  a

nation.  Therefore, there can be no substitution  for

clarity of thought and judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualities enumerated above are universally

considered to be professionally necessary.  They  are

exacting  qualities and, therefore, the  standard  of

selection has to be high. For these reasons, we  have

not  been able to select sufficient suitable  persons

for  appointment  to the Foreign Service.  Among  the

steps  we have taken in our recruitment exercise  are

talent  scouting within the civil service and in  the

universities and perhaps maybe amongst  some  of  our

colleagues and we hope when their services are called

upon they will not shrink.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Joe!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Apart from this, a diplomat also

has   to   make  certain  sacrifices,  such  as   the

disruption of his children's education by  reason  of

his being transferred



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



from  one  posting to another; and then the  adequate

job  opportunities and good living in  Singapore,  in

contrast  with  the inconvenient and  unsettled  life

associated with the job in the Foreign Service.  Such

reservations against joining the Foreign Service  are

expected  to  be diminished with time as the  Foreign

Service  develops and the challenges  and  honour  of

representing Singapore overseas are fully realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the $82,000-question put forward by the Member

for  Anson,  I have just mentioned the difficulty  of

recruiting  diplomats and we have  been  taking  some

steps  to  train  diplomats. We have organised  basic

administration courses for Attaches conducted by  the

Civil Service Staff Development Institute which  take

about  10  full days. Then we have basic courses  for

Foreign  Service officers giving them  the  craft  of

diplomacy,  political, economic,  consular,  protocol

functions  for diplomats serving abroad.  The  course

will  take  eight days and are conducted by lecturers

at  the University of Singapore. Trainees will attend

courses    on    international   law,   international

relations, economics, contemporary history. This will

take  three  months. And then they  need  to  undergo

language  training. In 1976, a total of  43  officers

were  reimbursed with tuition fees under the  foreign

language  scheme. Then trainees are given  on-the-job

training  where  they are trained in headquarters  or

attached  to  the various Ministries or to  statutory

boards  for briefings. And also overseas attachments.

This is a full-time two-month course where an officer

is  attached to an overseas mission. Or alternatively

he   is   sent  to  attend  conferences   to   gather

experience.  Apart  from that,  we  also  have  taken

advantage of the following overseas courses  extended

by   various   governments  to  the  Public   Service

Commission,  The Australian Foreign Service  training

course  duration  is  five months;  the  New  Zealand

Foreign  Service course duration is six  months;  and

the  French  Government  scholarship  is  a  two-year

course  comprising a French language course  and  the

diplomacy  course at the International  Institute  of

Public Administration in Paris.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta asked

why  we  did  not  fill  the  provision,  giving  the

impression that there is no future for diplomats. One

of  the  main reasons for the reduction  of  the  EOM

provision  for  the  Financial  Year  1977   is   the

inability  to  fill the large number of vacancies  in

the Foreign Service. I have explained why we found it

difficult  to  fill the vacancies. The  prospects  of

filling all of them in 1977 are not very bright.  The

provision  for the 1977 EOM is based on the  salaries

of  the  actual number of officers, including  normal

increments and the sum of NWC allowances for 1977. In

other  words,  there is no provision of salaries  for

the  vacant  post  or  the new post  which  has  been

created  for  the  Regional  and  Economic  Division.

Should  the  need  arise in the course  of  1977, to

supplement  the  EOM provisions such amount  required

can  be vired from the OOE provisions to augment  the

EOM provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned about the recruitment of officers.

Insofar  as  the  Foreign Service is  concerned,  the

quality  of  manpower  is  far  more  important  than

quantity.  The  selection of  the  right  person  for

posting  to  the right place at the right  time  will

always  be a matter of crucial importance.  It  will,

therefore, fill  the  existing  vacancies  when  the

persons are found. I am not optimistic, however, that

all  the vacancies will be filled during this  period

and in order not to unnecessarily inflate the budget,

I  have  decided to reduce the EOM provisions.  Until

such time when sufficient officers are recruited, our

overseas officers will remain not fully staffed.  The

result  is that overseas officers are called upon  to

work harder and they have responded well.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir,I beg leave to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Dr Lau Teik Soon -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head M be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head M be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 4001.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, in view

of  the  fact that the Senior Minister of  State  has

preempted  my  comments and answered  some  of  those

questions that I would have raised, I do not wish  to

move my amendments,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $26,125,650 for Head M ordered to stand

part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head N -



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1003*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs.

Cheong Yuen Chee, P. Govindaswamy, Ivan Baptist and Tan Cheng San).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law prescribes limits to the payment of annual

wage  supplement.  This  is  desirable  and,  indeed,

imperative  in  an economy such as Singapore's  where

our  progress is dominantly dependent on  inducements

to  prospective investors to invest in Singapore, and

to ensure that our manufactured goods are competitive

in overseas markets. The rationale behind the law is,

therefore,  perfectly  understandable  and  one  with

which  our  trade  union movement will  go  along.  A

balance, however, will have to be struck between what

has  been paid before and what is to be paid  now  so

that the workers will not lose out. But it would seem

that  the law is heavily weighted against bargainable

employees   in   relation  to   the   non-bargainable

employees  particularly those who, because  of  their

positions,  become non-bargainable. These are  junior

executives   and   others  who  are  categorised   as

confidential staff and who, because of  the  type  of

work they perform, may be labelled as confidential or

managerial,  in many instances, at the discretion  of

the management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that such employees should not

be paid the annual wage supplement or bonus, but when

the disparity between what they are paid and what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



workers receive becomes acutely significant, then one

wonders why the non-bargainable group should be  paid

significantly  more  than the  bargainable  group  of

employees.  I  know of many cases. I  would  like  to

quote  one  instance where, according to my analysis.

the   non-bargainable  category  of  executives   and

confidential staff constitutes some 14% of the  total

workforce  and have received almost 44% of the  total

amount  of  annual  wage supplement  or  bonus  paid.

Perhaps the Minister for Labour and this House  would

like  to  know  that the Chairman of  this  Company's

Board of Directors is a top civil servant. I must say

that  not  all the top civil servants really practise

what  they preach. In this company there are not less

than  888  employees.  The  company  classified   127

employees as "managerial" staff. In other words,  the

ratio  of managerial staff in this company is 1:8.  I

must  compliment  this top civil servant  who  really

trains  managerial  people in this  company  and  who

really  pays the company's managers well.  The  total

annual  wage supplement paid by the company is  about

$1.4  million  and the managers and the  confidential

staff  got  more  than 44%. This I  submit,  Sir,  is

unjust  to the bargainable employees who fall  within

the  ambit  of  the Employment Act, while  the  non-bargainable  employees who are  not  covered  by  the

Employment  Act enjoy enhanced benefits.  I  suggest,

Sir,  some acceptable limit should be imposed on  the

quantum payable to such employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter that is a cause for concern is that

pertaining to the practice of granting a half-day off

on the eve of important festivals. Here again, I must

say that the civil servants do not practise what they

preach. It is common practice for employers of white-collar  workers to grant a half-day off; and  no  one

raises  an  eye-brow when this is freely  granted  to

them. But I note with some wonderment that when blue-collar  workers request for a half-pay  off  on  such

occasions  they  face difficulties. I  quite  realise

that in circumstances where the work is essential  to

the  life  of  the community or when a disruption  of

work  will  have  adverse economic or social  effects

this will not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



possible.  I must say that the organised  workers  in

Singapore,  like the transport workers  and  the  bus

workers,  are  responsible workers. We know  that  on

Chinese  New Year Eve we have to have family  reunion

dinners but we do not go and ask for time-off. We ask

only  in  those  areas where their absence  does  not

disrupt  production  of work. In  other  words,  non-essential  areas. But where disruption of any  nature

will  not arise, it is manifestly unfair not to grant

this  facility  to blue-collar workers.  This  year's

Chinese  New Year eve was an instance in which  where

even  Government officials seemed to be  inclined  to

the  view that requests for a half-day off from blue-collar  workers to their employers should be  treated

differently.  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  such  a  view

becomes  incomprehensible and untenable in the  light

of  the  present policy to encourage our  workers  to

take to blue-collar work. It is obvious, Sir, that if

we  continue to adopt different standards for  white-collar  workers and blue-collar workers, it  will  be

difficult to obtain the desired objective.  I  would,

therefore, like to see the application of, at  least,

uniform standards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, in last year's

Budget   session  I  raised  the  question   of   the

possibility   of  certain  companies   indulging   in

unjustifiable  and unfair retrenchment exercises.  In

his  reply, the Minister of State for Labour  stated,

and I quote from Hansard, Vol. 35 col. 404:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The managements of firms which intend to retrench

workers  have been advised by the Ministry of Labour,

and  guidelines have been given by the  Ministry  for

such an exercise ...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been monitoring closely the

retrenchment   Situation.  We  are   satisfied   that

generally there have not been abuses by managements.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like, in this instance, to bring to the

attention  of  the  House  a  blatant  abuse  of  one

particular  company. I shall be bringing  up  another

case  when  I  have obtained sufficient  facts.  This

company  I  am  now  referring  to  carried   out   a

retrenchment  exercise in 1975 and a  second  one  in

1976. A total of 207 workers were retrenched in  both

cases.  In 1975 the company paid out $1.7 million  in

retrenchment benefits but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



subsequently  made a net profit of  $2.9  million  in

that year. In 1976 the same company paid out $539,000

in  retrenchment benefits and made a  profit  of  $10

million,  This  is  net profit.  In  a  statement  to

shareholders, the chairman of this particular company

spoke in glowing terms, which I would like to quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the momentum generated by management and the

improvement in trading conditions, the company  looks

forward to the new year with some confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to mention the particular model of

the  car.  This particular model which was introduced

in   October  1976  was  well  received.  The  demand

outpaces  the  supply.  Then  another  make  of   car

continues  to  achieve higher market  penetration  in

both  Singapore  and  Malaysia. Sales  of  commercial

vehicles  are  improving and  the  Company  has  been

successful   in  penetrating  the  bus  business   in

volume.'



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is understandable for companies to resort to

a  retrenchment exercise to avoid successive  trading

losses   or  adverse  trading  conditions.  But   for

companies to resort to retrenchment exercise  at  the

expense  of  workers, I must say, is highly  immoral.

This  brings up the question of whether the  Ministry

of  Labour's monitoring system is effective enough to

counter  such  abuses and also whether employers  are

paying  heed  to the Ministry's guidelines.  I  would

therefore, urge the Ministry of Labour to  look  into

such abuses more seriously.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



these permits? Can the Minister explain this anomaly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to employment, it is observed that ex-convicts find difficulty in getting jobs. Why is this

so?  If they cannot get a job, what do we expect them

to  do?  Most probably, they will continue to  commit

crime.  We must not look down on ex-convicts  because

there is such a thing as turning over a new leaf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also observed that too many employers complain

about  job-hopping. Have we analysed the root problem

of this? Do the workers job-hop merely for the fun of

it?  Because  of a few isolated cases of  job-hopping

without  good  reason, we should not condemn  workers

for   job-hopping.   Financial   incentives,   family

problems,   distance   from   home,   poor    working

conditions, and unreasonable employers could  be  the

cause    for    job-hopping.   In   contract    work.

particularly,  some  contractors  cheat  the  workers

wherever  possible. Yet these people  go  unpunished.

Some    employers    in   the   various    industrial

establishments treat workers badly. Yet they also  go

unpunished.  Blaming workers for job-hopping  is  not

the    answer.   Penalising   workers   through   NWC

restrictions  may  not be the answer  to  solve  this

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote an example of a contractor who has been

awarded  the  contract for cleaning services  in  the

Airport.  This contractor has riot paid some  of  his

workers  for some months. However, the workers  still

carried  on with their work in the Airport.  Then  to

their  surprise, they found that workers from another

contractor have come to take over the job. It appears

that  the first contractor has lost his contract.  He

has  still not paid his workers and he did  not  even

have  the courtesy to inform his workers that he  has

lost  his  contract. Some contractors never  pay  the

salaries in full to their workers. What they do is to

pay  75%  of their salary and withhold the  rest.  Is

this  permissible?  What is being  done  about  these

unreliable  contractors  and  also  contractors   who

exploit  foreign  labour by not contributing  CPF  or

paying  the  right  amount  of  contributions?   Many

workers  do not report these matters to the  Ministry

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



Labour,  simply because some of the contractors  have

secret  society connections, and they  are  therefore

afraid of repercussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we emphasise so much on productivity that we

have  forgotten  where productivity lies.  Sometimes,

the  wages  paid are such that they do not  encourage

productivity. I quote an example. The Airport  junior

staff and the daily rated workers have to work in the

rain  and  sun  under very difficult conditions.  Yet

their  wages  are  far  below  that  of  workers   in

factories  who work in air-conditioned comfort.  What

incentive  is  there  for the productivity  of  these

workers? I think most probably the Member for  Changi

understands  this  matter and he will  know  what  is

happening in the Airport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I crave your

indulgence. May I bring up matters under a  different

subhead  AHA  1101 of which I have given  notice,  as

they are related?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You may speak on it in passing, but if

you  wish to go into specific details, I suggest  you

wait until that subhead comes up for discussion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> In that case I will not be speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As you please. Mr Tan Cheng San.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, young people of Singapore do not want

to  engage  themselves in laborious and  heavy  work,

particularly in building construction work. There are

reasons  for this. Generally, such work is contracted

out  to  contractors.  There are  chief  contractors,

contractors and sub-contractors. The workers  do  not

have  any safeguards over their employment.  They  do

not enjoy paid holidays or double pay for working  on

rest  days. They do not enjoy paid sick leave, annual

leave,  or maternity leave under the Employment  Act.

All  these unreasonable and unjust working conditions

are found among workers on building sites and also in

places  where  the  contract system  is  done.  These

workers do not enjoy all these benefits. The only way

to do away with this anomaly is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



organise  the  workers  under  contract  labour   and

unionise them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as soon as the contractor comes to know that the

workers  have  joined the union, he will  immediately

dissolve his company and sack all of them. This means

that  as  soon  as the workers under contract  labour

unionise so as to protect their interests, they  will

lose  their jobs. Some private companies also  resort

to  the  same tactics as the contractors  by  sacking

their   workers  and  hand  over  the  job   to   the

contractor.  This happens very often  in  the  recent

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Labour Ministry find out from the Registry

of  Companies  how many HDB worksites  and  buildings

have  been  used  by  contractors  to  put  up  their

offices.  So I hope the Minister realizes the  plight

of  these workers and take necessary action to  amend

or   enact  the  relevant  Act  so  that  workers  of

contractor  can enjoy all those benefits provided  by

the  law. The principal company should be responsible

in awarding such benefits similar to what is provided

in  the  Workmen's  Compensation Act.  The  principal

company should also be responsible for the workers to

join a trade union for their interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of medical facilities provided

for  the  workers, according to the present Act,  any

sick leave could only be allowed on the production of

a medical certificate issued by the company doctor or

in  the  absence  of  such doctor,  by  a  Government

doctor.   When   the   Singapore  Industrial   Labour

Organisation   complained  about  its   members   not

receiving  good  medical care because of  restriction

under  the  terms  of  their contracts,  the  company

doctors  immediately protested. According  to  recent

newspaper  reports, some doctors have confirmed  such

restrictive   regulations  in  respect   of   medical

charges.  In  view  of  the  restriction  on  medical

charges,  nobody believes that company doctors  would

be  so  generous  as  to give expensive  medicine  to

employees  of  a company because they know  that  the

employer  will  refuse to pay such expensive  medical

costs. Therefore, we can come to only one conclusion,

i.e, under these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



circumstances, employees will not be  able  to  enjoy

adequate  and fair medical care. Worse still,  if  an

employee is not satisfied with the diagnosis  by  the

company doctor, he is not allowed to see a Government

doctor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers also understand that Government doctors

are  neutral. From the point of professional  ethics,

when  there  is a difference of opinion  between  two

doctors, one  should not challenge the other.  There

are  a  few  local organisations who neglected  these

medical  ethics.  Instead,  they  instigated  certain

companies   not   to  recognise  the   diagnosis   by

Government  doctors. Because of these differences  of

opinion, the life of the patient is at stake. A widow

once told me that if her husband had not paid heed to

his employer's threat to sack him if he were to visit

the  Government doctor during working hours, he might

still be alive today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the seriousness of this matter, I hope

the  Minister for Labour will pay attention to it and

properly amend the Employment Act so that the workers

will  be  entitled to sick leave on certification  by

the   company   doctor   or  a   Government   doctor.

Alternatively,  if  there  is  a  difference  in  the

diagnosis of these two doctors, then the diagnosis of

the Government doctor should be upheld because he  is

more  neutral  and there is no conflict  of  personal

interest involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the existing law, it is an offence for

a  trade  union to claim for anything  in  excess  of

frozen  quantum  but  the law does  not  make  it  an

offence  for an employer to pay less than the  frozen

quantum.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees are accustomed to expect a certain quantum

of  Annual Wage Supplement on a fixed date, under the

terms of Collective Agreement. At the 11th hour, many

companies  do  not  pay  the frozen  quantum  on  the

pretext  that they have no capacity to pay. Would  it

not  be  fair  for  such companies to  apply  to  the

Arbitration Court



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



for variation of Collective Agreement or apply to the

Minister  for  Labour to reduce the quantum  well  in

advance  so that the employees will not be  taken  by

surprise if they do not receive the quantum of Annual

Wage  Supplement  that they are entitled?  This  will

also  not give the workers cause to suspect any  foul

play, otherwise it will appear unfair to them.  If  a

company  wants  to continue to pay  the  annual  wage

supplement  more  than the frozen quantum,  it  would

have to get the approval of the Minister for Finance.

It  is  now  up to the company to decide  whether  to

apply or not. It is an offence for the union to  even

enquire  whether  the  company  wishes  to  make  the

application. Similarly, when approvals are given, the

unions   are  not  informed.  Consequently,   several

companies make their own announcements when they make

the application and when approvals are received. This

definitely is unfair to the unions because they  have

to  hear  about  the  additional  payments  from  the

employers and in many instances after the payment  is

made, Such practice makes the union members feel that

the  company is the benefactor and more generous  and

that  the union is in a helpless position and useless

to  them. When a company which has paid more than the

frozen quantum refuses to apply for approval for  the

continuation  of  the payment of additional  quantum,

the  Minister should direct the company to apply  for

approval  and let the Ministry of Finance  to  decide

whether the company has the capacity to pay or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour is very keen in according

equal  treatment to all the employees. When the trade

union  has  got  better  conditions  of  service   or

remunerations for its members, the Ministry will  see

to  it  that the non-unionised workers will  also  be

accorded equal treatment. Once the unionised  workers

get  certain benefits from the employer, the Ministry

of Labour would quickly see the employer and urge the

employer to accord to the non-unionised workers equal

benefit.  On  the  contrary, when a trade  union  has

concrete evidence to show that a certain employer has

been  giving non-unionised workers higher annual wage

supplement, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of  Labour officials would  say  that  they

could  not  help the unionised workers to  get  equal

treatment  because they were not given the  power  to

deal  with  such  an  employer  to  give  such  equal

benefits  to  them.  If this is so,  why  should  the

Ministry   of   Labour  intervene  when   the   union

negotiates and comes to an agreement for better terms

to its members?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the term "non bargainable

employees" used by the Member for Boon Teck  normally

refers  to  managerial  executives  and  confidential

staff.  The  Employment Act does  not  cover  persons

employed  in  a managerial, executive or confidential

position.  The  provisions in the Act  governing  the

payment  of  annual bonus and annual wage  supplement

are,  therefore, not applicable to them. Besides  the

National  Wages Council has decided, as a  matter  of

principle, that its wage increase guidelines are  not

intended  to  cover  these  categories  of  employees

except those who are subject to collective agreement.

They are excluded because their salary structure  and

promotion prospects and system of rewards are  worked

out  competitively and applied individually according

to performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in certain small establishments due

to  the  nature  of the business or  profession,  the

majority   of   the  staff  are  in  the  managerial,

executive or confidential categories. The common ones

are  the  consultancy firms where  the  engineers  or

professional   executives  outnumber   the   clerical

employees. But this situation is not present  in  the

industrial sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the exclusion of the managerial

and  executive staff from the ambit of the Employment

Act  and  the  NWC  wage  increase  guidelines  would

encourage  employers  to upgrade certain  subordinate

employees to the non bargainable categories with  the

aim   of   discriminating  against  the   bargainable

employees.  Economic  reasons would  be  a  deterrent

against exploitation of the situation, Besides, there

are  provisions in the Industrial Relations  Act  for

trade    unions    to   challenge   the    unilateral

classification of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



non  bargainable employees by the employers  and  for

the  Industrial  Arbitration Court to  rule  on  such

dispute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has long been an established practice for

Government where the exigencies of the service permit

to  allow the employees to take a half-day off on the

eve   of  festivals,  such  as  the  New  Year,  This

arrangement   is   subject  to  the  condition   that

departments  having  business  with  members  of  the

public have to keep their normal working hours and no

additional   expenditure  should   be   incurred   on

overtime,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-festival time-off with pay is quite prevalent in

the  trade and services sectors. It could be regarded

as an existing fringe benefit in establishments where

such  an  arrangement has been in practice  for  some

years.  The  Member for Boon Teck is  well  aware  of

Government's policy that there should be a freeze  on

the range and quantum of existing fringe benefits and

that  the  bizarre  ones  or  those  which  are   not

conducive   to   our   economic  growth   should   be

discontinued. Therefore, there is nothing to  prevent

firms  from continuing to observe pre-festival  time-off  with pay if such an arrangement is an accustomed

benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh has referred to a case of

retrenchment by a certain company in 1975 and in 1976

while  at  the same time showing profits.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I do not know the particular  company

concerned  nor  do  I know the reasons  for  the  two

retrenchments carried out by this company. But it  is

possible that the retrenchment could be the result of

over-staffing   or   better   management   and    the

introduction   of  labour-saving  techniques,   hence

resulting in redundancy. If this is the case, then it

makes  economic sense to retrench the redundant staff

so as to make its products more competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore has to face intense

competition  for markets abroad. To do so,  it  means

that   a   company  has  to  constantly   raise   its

productivity  and  this may involve  either  improved

techniques  of  production, the introduction  of  new

machinery, and sometimes reduction of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



labour forces as a result. This is probably the  only

way  for  the  company, or in the wider  context  the

country,  to  survive and prosper in  this  intensely

competitive world. The workers so retrenched  can  be

redeployed in other productive activities and in  the

tight  labour  market like Singapore they  will  soon

find alternative employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar

has called for an amendment to the Employment Act  on

the provisions covering sick leave. He has urged that

in  the  event  the  medical report  of  a  company's

appointed  medical  practitioner  differs  from   the

Government  medical  officer's  report,  the   latter

should  be  accepted. The Employment Act  at  present

provides  for  an  employee  to  consult  first   the

company's  medical practitioner. If no  such  medical

practitioner  has  been appointed, the  employee  can

consult  the  Government  medical  officer.  When   a

company  has  appointed  a  duly  registered  medical

practitioner  or has set up a medical  clinic  within

the  factory  premises, it is  only  right  that  any

employee  falling  sick  should  first  consult   the

company's  doctor. There are many  reasons  why  this

should  be  so.  Firstly, the  company's  doctor  can

attend to the employee immediately should there be an

urgent  need  for  medical  attention.  Besides, the

company's  doctor would have the medical  history  of

the   employee  and  can  make  proper  and   correct

diagnosis.  Secondly, by providing immediate  medical

services  productivity  is maintained  by  curtailing

unforeseen  disruption  of work  due  to  illness  of

employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Paya Lebar

that  the Ministry of Labour adopts a flexible  stand

and   has   advised  companies  to   accept   medical

certificates  issued by Government  medical  officers

even  when companies have their own appointed medical

practitioner. Furthermore, hon. Members would like to

know that it is the prevailing practice in collective

agreements  to recognise medical certificates  issued

by  the company or Government medical officers or  in

the case of a bona fide emergency by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



any   registered   medical   practitioner.   In   the

circumstances,  it  is  unnecessary  to   amend   the

Employment Act relating to sick leave.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised the issue of job-hopping and cautioned against condemning workers who

change  jobs for valid reasons, like adverse  working

conditions, distance from work, etc. The latter point

is well taken. However, of equal consideration is the

need  for  our  workers to imbibe higher  skills  and

competence and thus increase productivity. It is only

through  increased  productivity that  Singapore  can

compete  effectively in the international market.  If

job-hopping  especially among the younger  generation

affects overall productivity, then this habit has  to

be  stopped. Most cases of frivolous job-hopping  are

due  to lack of dedication and personal pride in  job

accomplished.  This is compounded by  the  impatience

for higher monetary rewards and rapid promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already informed the House earlier during the

debate  on the President's Address that to discourage

job-hopping  for frivolous reasons, the NWC  will  be

asked  to  consider whether such employees should  be

deprived    of   the   full   NWC   wage    increase.

Notwithstanding  this, all employers should  exercise

greater  initiative to inculcate and  motivate  their

work  force  towards  greater harmony  and  increased

output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members for Anson and Paya Lebar have

raised  the  subject of unscrupulous contractors  and

poor  working conditions in the building construction

industry. We are all aware of the tight labour market

in  this  sector.  That being  so, it  will  not  be

feasible  for  a  contractor to  unduly  exploit  his

workers  without  risk  of  losing  them  to  another

contractor. It is true that some workers due  to  the

casual  nature  of  their jobs may  not  be  enjoying

benefits  like  annual leave,  rest  day.  CPF, etc.

However,  this  is  sometimes done  with  the  mutual

consent  of both parties. The Central Provident  Fund

Act, for   instance,  lays  down   explicitly   the

liabilities of the employer and employee. Workers can

always lodge a complaint to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



CPF  Board  in cases of non-CPF payments  where  such

payment is due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the examples cited of some contractors

withholding salaries, the Employment Act provides for

the  payment  of salaries before the  expiry  of  the

seventh  day after the last day of the salary period.

Failure to do so is an offence under this Act. Again.

workers can seek redress through the Labour Ministry.

Cases of non-adherence to paid holidays, annual leave

and  paid  sick  leave can also be  referred  to  the

Labour Ministry for appropriate action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has referred to job

opportunities   for  ex-convicts.   Sir,   Government

departments and statutory boards have in recent years

adopted  a  more liberal and enlightened policy  with

regard  to the employment of ex-convicts in order  to

assist them in integrating into society. In order  to

enhance  the  employment prospects  of  prisoners  on

their  release, the Government has set up a statutory

board,  the  Singapore Corporation of  Rehabilitation

Enterprises, which  provides  specifically  for  the

industrial and vocational training of prisoners.  The

objective  of such a training programme is to  instil

work  discipline  in  the prisoners  as  well  as  to

promote  their vocational skill. Prisoners are  being

trained  in  a  wide  variety  of  trades  for  their

eventual  employment in both the public  and  private

sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry's Employment Service also renders

employment   assistance  to  every  job  seeker   who

registers  with  the Service, irrespective  of  their

background.    Introduction   of    registrants    to

prospective   employers  for  employment   is   based

strictly  on their work suitability. In other  words,

an  ex-convict seeking employment assistance from the

Service   is   given  the  same  treatment   in   job

opportunities as the others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also mentioned that there

were some marriage applications between citizens  and

work  permit holders which were turned down, and that

although  appeals  made by Members of  Parliament  on

their   behalf   were  not  successful, subsequently

approvals for their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



marriage  were  granted. I wish to  assure  the  hon.

Member  for Anson that there are no double  standards

in  the  consideration of applications  for  marriage

between  citizens and work permit holders. The  cases

of   subsequent   approvals  are  those   where   the

applicants  later meet with our policy  requirements,

like  the requirement of having to work for at  least

five  years, or being skilled after having been trade

tested by the Industrial Training Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered most of the points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

like to have two points clarified by the Minister for

Labour. First, the company which I mentioned just now

is  a  manufacturing company. It  is  not  a  service

company  as the Minister has stated. I must say  that

it is quite prevalent in a number of companies to try

to  exclude  as many employees as possible  from  the

Employment   Act   and   pay   higher   annual   wage

supplements.  In  the  case of the  company  which  I

mentioned,  how can we convince the workers  that  we

cannot  go  beyond the annual wage supplement  limit?

For  every eight workers in this company, one  worker

gets  four  months, whereas those  workers  who  come

within  the  ambit  of  the Employment  Act  get  two

months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to find out from the Minister

is:  will he consider amending the Employment Act  or

other  legislation to make sure that the annual  wage

supplement is applicable to everyone, irrespective of

whether   they  are  in  the  bargainable   or   non-bargainable category. We are not certainly  objecting

to  a  few top managerial personnel who deserve  more

than what the Employment Act permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of clarification is the question of

half-day  off  for the workers, What I am  saying  is

this. If the Government which is the biggest employer

sets the example of giving half day off on the eve of

the  four  festivals and also on New Year's Eve,  how

can  we encourage more and more workers to go to  the

manufacturing sector? I do not think that this is  an

area where it can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



considered  bizarre. In the past,  the  employer  has

been giving these benefits but because of the NWC  we

trade  unionists are prepared to accept the  freezing

of  all fringe benefits and the employer conveniently

also tries to take away the half-day off benefit from

the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have

said  just  now, it does not make economic sense  for

the  company to upgrade bargainable employees to  the

category  of non-bargainable employees and  pay  them

higher  annual wage supplement unless there are  good

reasons  for doing so. In any case, there  are  these

provisions  in the Industrial Relations Act  for  the

unions   to   challenge  the  company's   action   in

unilaterally  reclassifying its  employees  from  the

category of bargainable to the non-bargainable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the half-day off for New Year

festivals, I have said that where it is an accustomed

fringe  benefit then the workers should  continue  to

enjoy the benefit. I think there are a good number of

manufacturing companies offering their employees more

than  just half a day off. In any case, I shall refer

the  point raised by the Member for Boon Teck to  the

Minister  for  Finance for his  consideration  as  to

whether the half-day off for civil servants should be

abolished completely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, I would definitely take up the

case  with  the  Ministry of  Labour  regarding  this

company  and, if possible, with the NWC to make  sure

that there is no abuse. I thank the Minister for  his

reply and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Tan

Cheng San.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the matter I would like to raise before this

House,  which  comes  under  the  portfolio  of   the

Ministry  of Labour, concerns the case of a  marriage

between  a  Singaporean and a Malaysian. This  couple

applies  to  the  Commissioner  for  Employment   for

approval  to  marry  in 1 973.  The  application  was

approved  on the condition that they should  sign  an

undertaking to undergo sterilisation after having two

children.  This  couple  signed  the  undertaking  to

obtain  the  Commissioner's approval, and  they  were

married.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trouble begins after the arrival of their second

child,   as   they  are  now  required   to   undergo

sterilisation. The woman was willing but the man  was

not.  He  argued that it would suffice  if  his  wife

alone  was  sterilised. He said  that  even  if  they

continued  to  cohabit as man and wife, they  cannot

produce  any  more  children.  But  the  Commissioner

insisted  that  both the husband and  the  wife  must

undergo  sterilisation, and warned the  husband  that

his  wife  would  be expelled from  Singapore  if  he

failed  to  comply. The man did not  go  despite  the

warning. This resulted in the wife being sent back to

Malaysia.  The woman now lives in Malaysia while  the

two  children  live with their father  in  Singapore.

Thus  this  once  happy  family  is  now  broken   up

virtually  by  the injustice of a man-made  decision.

Why  must the Commissioner insist on both the husband

and  wife  to undergo sterilisation? So long  as  the

wife is sterilised and medically proved incapable  of

giving  birth  to  any  more children, is  this  not

enough?  What  is  the  necessity  to  sterilise  the

husband also? To



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



add  insult  to  injury. I was told that  this  woman

concerned   was   sent  back  to  Malaysia   by   the

Immigration  Department  on the  instruction  of  the

Commissioner for Employment. Since then she has  been

prohibited from entering Singapore to visit  her  two

children  and  her  husband because  the  Immigration

Department refused to endorse her passport  when  she

applied  for  the  usual two-week temporary  stay  in

Singapore. I think this is wrong and unjust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seriously urge the Labour Minister to put a stop

to this kind of restriction, like requiring people to

undergo   sterilisation   before   approving    their

marriage.  The Commissioner's duty is  to  accept  or

reject  according to the merits of the case.  If  the

application  merits consideration, then  he  approves

it,  otherwise  he  rejects it.  Trading  a  marriage

approval  for sterilisation should not be allowed  to

be practised in future. If we believe in achieving  a

more just and equal society, moral duty requires  the

Labour  Minister to act and restore the happiness  of

this family concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this

amendment,  I  want  to raise two  matters,  Firstly,

according to complaints, it takes a very long time to

get  work permits, sometimes stretching to more  than

one   month,  This  is  very  inconvenient  to  those

factories which are in urgent need for workers.  Some

garment  factories which have large  orders  have  to

recruit many female workers, but it is very difficult

to  recruit  them locally. Therefore,  they  have  to

recruit from abroad. They approached the Ministry  of

Labour  for  work permits, but it takes a  very  long

time.  This is very inconvenient for these  factories

as  it retards production. Therefore, I suggest  that

the Minister concerned should ease the restriction on

issue of work permits to facilitate manufacturers  to

fulfil their orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter is a request to ease the

restriction  or  to  liberalise  the  issue  of  work

permits   to   drivers,  barbers  and  general   shop

assistants, I have often received complaints from the

public  concerning  the difficulty  in  getting  work

permits for these people. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



majority  of  their applications have been  rejected,

causing  much  inconvenience  to  many  people.   For

example, the  Secretary of the Citizens Consultative

Committee  in  my  constituency is  the  owner  of  a

bookshop.  He  wanted to employ a  driver  from  West

Malaysia  at a monthly salary of $280. He applied  to

the authority in charge for a work permit, but it was

rejected.  I  also appealed to the authority  on  his

behalf,  giving my reason that it was very difficult,

in  fact impossible, to get drivers locally.  But  it

was  also  rejected.  There are  many  other  similar

cases. Therefore, I hope the Minister concerned  will

liberalise  the  conditions for  the  issue  of  work

permits. This problem has existed for many years.  In

the  past,  restriction on work permits  for  foreign

workers  was  meant  to reserve jobs  for  our  local

people.  At  present, our employment  situation  has

improved, and  also  there is a  shortage  of  local

drivers, barbers, grocers and coffee shop assistants.

Since  this is the case it is time that the  Minister

concerned  reappraised the situation and  review  the

policy  of  work  permits.  If  these  over-stringent

measures    were   continued, it   would    greatly

inconvenience   the   small   businessmen   adversely

affecting  their  business.  Therefore.  I  hope  the

Minister concerned will take immediate steps to  ease

the   restrictions  on  work  permits  to  solve  the

difficulties of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, work permits are no doubt

supposed to be issued only to legitimate cases. But I

feel   that  common  sense  should  prevail  in  some

deserving  cases.  We have a bad labour  shortage  in

certain  occupations, construction workers being  one

of  them.  We have no alternative whatsoever  but  to

employ foreigners. Therefore, I suggest that the Work

Permits  Office  should be more liberal  in  granting

work permits for these workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, there is a shortage of workers in

domestic labour such as cooks, servants, etc. Let  me

deal  with the question of servants. Quite often work

permits  are not issued to those who want to work  as

domestic  servants. But let me put the  problem  this

way. If we do not get domestic servants, then our own

women who are highly educated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



and employed have no choice but to resign and stay at

home  to  look  after  their  children.  Servants  in

Singapore  are  in great demand. They have  become  a

very  expensive and precious category  of  labour.  A

number of highly educated women are unable to work in

the  civil service, because they are unable to employ

domestic servants. Their resignation is a great  loss

to the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will use his good offices to

rectify  the problem and deal with it in an  amicable

way.  Work  permits should be granted  liberally  and

fairly to all races.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho Kah Leong and Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon

are not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Sir, the Member for Khe Bong is of the view that it

is  inhuman  for  the Government to  allow  marriages

between  Singaporeans and work permit holders  unless

both  parties undergo sterilisation. The Member  also

added   that   the  wife's  agreement   to   go   for

sterilisation should suffice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will recall that with effect from July,

1973, prior approval is necessary if the work permit

holder wants to marry a Singapore citizen. Such prior

approval  is  given if the work permit  holder  is  a

skilled  worker.  If  the work permit  holder  is  an

unskilled worker, approval is given if he has  worked

for at least five years on work permit. In both cases

no  sterilisation  bond is required.  A  work  permit

holder who contravenes the marriage policy will  have

his  work  permit cancelled. The citizen  party  will

also  be  subjected to disincentives. He or she  will

not be eligible to apply for HDB flats nor will their

children   enjoy  free  education  or  their   family

subsidised medical treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer of the sterilisation bond is made in

certain circumstances, like where the couple does not

qualify for marriage approval but the female party is

in the family way. It is a humane way out for couples

in  such  a situation. The concept of a sterilisation

bond is in keeping with the family planning ideal of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



a   two-child   family.   The   acceptance   of   the

sterilisation bond is strictly voluntary. The  couple

is  given medical counselling on sterilisation  after

which it is up to the couple to accept or reject  the

bond.  On  signing the bond the couple  will  undergo

sexual  sterilisation only after  the  birth  of  the

second  child. It is only fair that both  parties  be

requested to undergo sterilisation. This is  in  line

with our objective of a two-child family. If only one

party  is  required to be sterilised.  I  would  have

thought that the husband rather than the wife  should

be  the  one.  I  must  stress  the  point  that  the

sterilisation bond is undertaken voluntarily.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unreasonable in such circumstances where

couples have been granted early marriage approval for

the couple concerned to honour their undertaking. The

undertaking  can,  of  course, be  withdrawn  by  the

couples  but then they must be prepared to  face  the

consequence of disincentives being applied on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member suggested the abolition of this

humane way out. He wants this sterilisation bond  to

be  abolished. I think he has forgotten the feelings

of  young people who are bent on getting married. If

he  were to look back on his young courting days not

so  many  years ago. I am sure he was  no  different

from other young couples in love at that time. I  am

sure   he  would  not  suggest  rejection  of  their

application  to get married immediately. Personally.

though I may be old in age but I can assure -



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Young at heart!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I am still young at heart, that is

right. The Member for Katong is very quick. He  knows

exactly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Same feeling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> In all respects!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> We would like to find ways and means

whereby  the wish of young couples to get married  is

fulfilled and that they live happily ever after.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has stated that he has

received complaints that the Work Permits Office took

a  month or more for a work permit application to  be

processed and he considers this to be a delay. Let me

assure him that the Work Permits Office does not take

a   month  or  more  to  process  and  decide  on  an

individual work permit application. The time taken is

usually  about a week or so from the date of  receipt

of a work permit application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an approved application, he must

remember  that  the  non-resident applicant  will  be

asked  by  letter  to undergo a medical  examination,

including X-ray and blood test at the medical  centre

in  the Work Permits Office, and at the same time the

applicant  is informed that temporary permission  for

one  month  is granted to him to start work.  So  the

Member  for Sembawang will appreciate that given  the

thorough nature of the medical examination, it  will

take  about  two weeks for the result of the  medical

examination to be conveyed to the Work Permits Office

by  the  medical authority. On the date of the expiry

of  the  one month temporary permission, he  will  be

issued  a  work  permit  if  he  has  been  certified

medically fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some cases which require

verification or clarification of certain  information

which  either  has not been given  or  has  not  been

clearly  stated  by  applicants in  the  work  permit

application  form. Because of this they are  required

to  appear  for  an interview. From experience, more

often  than  not, they do not turn up  punctually  or

sometimes  they do not respond at all. For this  type

of  cases it would therefore take a much longer  time

to  process.  The  present system of processing  work

permit applications is satisfactory. Nevertheless, we

are  constantly on the look-out to cut  out  any  red

tape found unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his second point, I can see the hon. Member

for  Sembawang is very persistent indeed. This is the

third  consecutive year that he has  brought  up  the

subject  of giving work permits to certain  types  of

applicants. I do not think I can give a better  reply

than that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



given by my Minister on the last two occasions and  I

would  invite him to read the reply given as recorded

in the Hansard of the last two Budget sittings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore's continued policy of rapid

industrialisation it is of vital importance that  the

manpower requirements of the industries should  first

be  met. In line with this policy we have to continue

to  accord priority in applications for work  permits

from non-citizens seeking employment in factories and

other   industrial  undertakings.  So  long  as   our

economic  objectives and manpower  strategies  remain

unchanged, non-citizens wishing to pursue  soft  jobs

and relatively unproductive jobs like shop assistants

could not be given priority at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that this year he has chosen to add drivers

to  the list of such occupations as barbers and  shop

assistants  which have been brought up in  the  past.

With regard to the post of drivers they can be filled

by  Singaporeans. So the employers will probably have

to  pay a bit more. Last month alone. 47 applications

were approved. In fact, there are about 3,500 drivers

on  work  permits at this moment. So each application

is considered on its own merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of barbers, we have not been unduly

restrictive  in granting work permits to non-citizens

engaged  in  this  particular  occupation.  This   is

because  the  Ministry is aware that few Singaporeans

are  interested in taking up such employment. For the

past year, 45 out of 85 male applicants to be barbers

as  against  133 out of 282 female applicants  to  be

barbers were approved. The majority of those rejected

were found to be job-hopping, while a minority failed

to   pass   the  skill  evaluation  test  as  barbers

conducted  by the Adult Education Board.  So  in  the

circumstances, the Ministry will not relax the policy

pertaining to barbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Anson brought up the question of

certain  types  of jobs which are very  difficult  to

fill  by citizens because they are not available,  We

are  aware  that some professionally qualified  women

have  been  unable to take up employment  or  gainful

employment and had to give up jobs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



because  of  the  difficulty  in  obtaining  domestic

servants.  The  Ministry has,  in  fact,  been  quite

liberal  in  the  issue of work permits  to  domestic

servants. As at the end of February 1977, there  were

3,732   non-citizens  on  work  permits  working   as

domestic servants and last year. 1,702 work  permits

were   issued  to  non-citizens  to  work   in   such

employment.  Householders who intend to  employ  non-citizens  as domestic servants have little difficulty

in  obtaining  work permits if both the  husband  and

wife are in gainful employment or if the husband  can

satisfy the Commissioner for Employment that his wife

would  take up employment within a reasonable  period

of  time  upon being granted approval to employ  non-citizen domestic servant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the employment of cooks who are non-citizens,

their applications are favourably considered if  they

possess  relevant experience, while applications  for

work permits from young and inexperienced workers are

rejected. As at the end of last month, there were 867

non-citizens  on work permits working as  cooks, and

last year, there were 371 work permits issued to non-citizens to work in such employment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not

believe  the  Minister of State is talking  from  his

heart  because I know he is a very religious  man.  I

think  it  is  not  difficult for me  to  refute  his

argument.   In   the  first  place,  he   said   that

sterilisation  is  required of  this  couple  not  by

pressure or force. That I quite understand. But there

is  a  subtle pressure behind that. If a couple  just

marries without the approval of the Commissioner  for

Employment the consequence is obvious, the woman will

be  sent back to Malaysia. I am not quarrelling about

the objective which is to reduce our rapid population

growth and that is why we have to bring in all  kinds

of  measures to achieve this objective. But what I am

quarrelling about is that the Commissioner should not

bring  in this condition to induce a couple to  agree

to sterilisation which will later on bring about this

tragedy and trauma. Now the family has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



broken  up  virtually. I disagree with this exercise.

So I say, "OK. Since he wants to get married he signs

the  bond," All right, he faces the consequences. But

in future I say that this exercise should be removed.

Otherwise, you will create more cases  like  what  I

have referred to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to supplement what the Minister of

State for Labour has said regarding marriages between

citizens and non-resident work permit holders and  at

the same time indirectly answer the point made by the

Member for Khe Bong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a citizen marries a non-resident work

permit    holder   without   prior   approval,    the

Government's policy is to cancel the work  permit  of

the  holder and at the same time ask him  or  her  to

leave  the  State, as is what happened  in  the  case

cited by the Member for Khe Bong. Several MPs at that

time  appealed to me on behalf of those  affected  on

compassionate  or  humanitarian grounds  because,  by

asking the work permit holder to leave the State,  it

means the break-up of the family and worse still,  if

the  couple concerned has already had children or are

expecting  a  child  on  the  way.  The  anxiety  and

hardship  suffered  are even greater  in  the  latter

case. It was in response to these appeals by some MPs

and   also   numerous  appeals  from  those   couples

concerned   that  a  decision  was  made   to   offer

sterilisation as the humane way out. This  in  a  way

will  meet  the  national  interest  of  keeping  the

population increase under control so as not to  over-stretch  our  social, medical and education  services

while   at  the  same  time  the  marriage   can   be

regularised and the family unit can be kept intact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasise again that acceptance of

sterilisation is strictly voluntary and the operation

is  only  carried out after the birth of  the  second

child.  Sterilisation  as a way  out  of  the  couple

involved  is only offered after repeated  appeals  by

the  parties concerned and with great reluctance.  It

would have been better if the work permit holder  can

wait until he or she has worked for five years before

entering  into matrimony or if he or she can  acquire

the necessary skills to qualify for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



permanent  residence and thereby approval  for  early

marriages without having to undergo sterilisation.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I fail to see how the offer of

sterilisation  which will only be carried  out  after

the  birth  of the second child can be inhumane  when

our  own citizens are being asked to stop at two.  It

would  appear  that a kind and humane act  to  assist

couples,  who,  either  through  folly  or  force  of

circumstances, have to get married early is not being

appreciated. If the Member for Khe Bong is reflecting

the  general  feelings of the great majority  of  the

people concerned, the Members of this House included,

and  not just the selfish interest of the husband  he

is  championing,  then  I am prepared  to  reconsider

whether   the  offer  of  sterilisation   should   be

withdrawn,  in which case, I must point out  that  it

will  mean loss of job to the work permit holder  and

the separation of husband and wife and children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Khe Bong, on behalf of the

couple  that he is championing, has asked.  "Why  not

just  sterilise  the woman instead of requiring  both

parties  to  undergo  sterilisation  operation."  The

answer,  I  think,  is quite obvious.  To  be  really

effective   in   controlling   population   increase,

especially when both parties are young and in view of

the  high  divorce rate, there is nothing to  prevent

the divorcee to marry again and raise another family.

I  am  surprised that the Member for Khe Bong  should

advocate  sterilisation for the woman only.  I  would

have  imagined that it should be the man  for,  quite

apart  from  a simpler and easier operation,  in  our

Asian  society  it is invariably the  man  who  keeps

mistresses   and  maintains  more  than  one   family

establishment. In the specific case that  the  Member

for  Khe Bong has mentioned. I do not see why the man

should refuse to go for sterilisation if he genuinely

loves  his  wife and his two children and  wants  his

wife to join him and to look after the two children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister has

just said - (In English) Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> According to the Standing Orders, if a

Member  commences to speak in one language, he should

continue to speak in that language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I have said just now that the Minister has been

"fathoming  a  gentleman's thought by  a  petty-man's

measure."  Why  should he suspect  that  the  husband

would  keep mistresses? In Singapore we have the  law

of  monogamy.  Unless a man is divorced  by  law,  he

cannot marry another woman. Why should he raise  this

question in his answer to me? I am rather surprised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am

surprised at the ignorance of the Member for Khe Bong

in  this respect. Surely he must know that there  are

hundreds  and  thousands  of  cases  of  men  keeping

mistresses.  They  are  not  registered  or   legally

recognised.  Surely the Member knows  many  prominent

people  in  Singapore who have  kept  more  than  one

establishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is

exactly  what I have said. The Minister is "measuring

other people by his own narrow yardstick." He has got

only  one  wife, but he believes that everybody  else

would take concubines. I think that is a wrong way of

putting things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is

precisely my point. If the man is sterilised, then no

matter  how  many  establishments  he  maintains,  he

cannot produce any more children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, similarly I

have  said  just now that if the woman is  sterilised

and medically proved incapable of giving birth to any

more children, is that not enough? He has already got

his two children. Why should the Minister insist that

the man must also go for sterilisation?.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  my  point  is that that man can  go  about  and

maintain another establishment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  concerning the answer given by the Minister  of

State,  I  am  quite  satisfied  with  it  generally.

However, I want to raise a supplementary question.  I

hope  the Minister of State will answer it.  He  said

that we should give priority to industrialisation.  I

agree.  But  in  addition to being an industrialising

country we are also a commercial state. We have other

economies  and  commercial  enterprises.  Ours  is  a

plural  economy.  In our commercial  enterprises,  of

course,  we  need workers. If we do not  have  enough

local  citizens to work in the commercial enterprises

we  need  to  reassess the situation and  allow  non-citizens  to  fill the vacancies. The  situation  has

changed   and  our  employment  rate  now  is   high.

Therefore, restrictions should be eased in  order  to

allow  foreign  workers to work  here  in  commercial

enterprises. This is my first point. The second point

is  this. He just said that if we pay a higher salary

to  our  local  citizens, then we would  be  able  to

recruit   them   to   fill   those   vacancies.   But

Government's labour policy is to restrain from paying

higher wages in order to keep this State so as to  be

in a competitive position to attract more investments

from  abroad.  So a higher salary is incompatible  to

our policy. Could the Minister of State explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think he

has  missed my point about priority. If we have steel

factories  and  productive  establishments  requiring

manpower, and we have to go outside the  country  to

get  the  workers, we must have these  places  filled

first,   But  we  cannot  allow  people  from   other

countries  to come in and take up unproductive  jobs,

when   there  are  so  many  vacancies  in  factories

requiring  to  be filled. Therefore, soft  jobs  and

unproductive types of jobs cannot get priority. We do

not issue work permits for such kind of employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said that we had to pay higher wages to local

people,  I  am  just stating a fact that  if  we  pay

foreign workers less, and we just get hold of foreign

workers to come into Singapore, then what is going to

happen to our workers? We still need to have jobs for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



our people. Therefore, they must be paid. And as long

as there are workers available, it is just a question

of  having  to pay a bit more. There is no particular

reason  why  we should bring in foreign workers  just

for that particular reason.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I seek

clarification on a point? The Minister of  State  has

mentioned  that work permit holders who  have  worked

for  five  years  need  not  undertake  the  bond  of

sterilisation,  Now, at the moment, as  I  understand

it, there is rigidity in the calculation of the five-year  period, i.e, the work permit holder  must  have

served  five  years  in  one  work-place.  Would  the

Minister  of  State consider approving a work  permit

holder who has worked for five years, irrespective of

whether or not he or she has worked in more than  one

work-place?  I  am  not encouraging job-hopping, but

merely to refer him to the plight of such work permit

holders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

I think the Member for Serangoon Gardens did not have

his  premise right. When we say "five years",  we  do

not  say that a work permit holder must work for five

years  in one establishment. In other words, he  can

have  more  than  one employer. But  when  this  job-hopping question arose, there is a minimum period  of two  years  - at the beginning it was three  years  - during  which a work permit holder must work for  one

employer  before  he can leave. Therefore,  logically

one  person  cannot  be working  for  more  than  two

employers, or at the most three employers,  within  a

period  of five years. As long as he can work  within

this period for two or three employers, well, he  has

done  his five years. We do not say that he must work

for five years with one employer. That is not the way

the period is calculated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just on a

point  of  clarification. Does the Minister of  State

not  realise that even with an increased  quantum  of

wages for certain jobs, Singaporeans still shun  away

from these jobs? The work establishments cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



carry on without these personnel who are necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir

will notice that in my reply I have quoted the number

of work permits issued to exactly the kind of persons

that the Member for Sembawang was talking about, that

is,  drivers, and the Member for Anson  was  talking

about,  that is, cooks. We do not say that we do  not

issue  work permits at all. We do give work  permits,

but then each case would have to be considered on its

own  merits.  We do not give a blanket  approval;  if

somebody wants to employ a driver, we give him a work

permit.  No.  We have to consider whether  he  really

needs  a  driver and that it is absolutely necessary.

We  do  give work permits. It is not that we  do  not

give them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, is it the policy not to give

work   permits   for  shop  assistants?  Singaporeans

normally do not like to be shop assistants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, in the majority of

cases  I  would say that we do not give work  permits

for shop assistants because we consider such a job as

extremely  unproductive. Such  manpower  is  required

elsewhere.  If we were to issue a work  permit  to  a

shop  assistant  so that he could bring  a  katty  of

sugar  up  the  stairs to a buyer in a Housing  Board

flat, my goodness, we will have to issue thousands of

work permits for shop assistants. If all these people

come to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



Singapore to become shop assistants, what will happen

to our factories? Nobody will go to the factories if

they can get a soft job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, although the answer is unsatisfactory, I still

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report that the Committee of Supply has made progress

on the Main and Development Estimates for the

1st March, 1978,

and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
