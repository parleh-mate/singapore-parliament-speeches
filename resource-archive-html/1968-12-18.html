<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Madam

Chan Choy Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Law and National

Development  whether  work  has  commenced   on   the

proposed public garden at Tiong Bahru Road for  which

funds  have been approved; and when the project  will

be completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Madam Chan Choy Siong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang):</b> Question No. 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, work on the

public  garden at Tiong Bahru commenced  in  February

this year and is expected to be completed

by the end of January next year.

<div align="center"><b>(Projects carried out)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development (a) what is the  extent  of

the  projects  carried out since 1st  January,  1968,

towards  making Singapore a garden city;  (b)  if  he

will  give  details of (i) the areas where trees  and

plants  have  been planted; and (ii) the  number  and

location  of  new gardens developed; and (c)  whether

there are any plans in hand to construct fountains in

every constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since January 1968

about  13,000  trees have been planted at  about  240

roads  and  sites. These trees, together  with  those

planted  last year, bring the number of trees planted

as at October 1968 to about 28,000 at about 380 roads

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



sites. The sites include 21 traffic islands, 20  road

circuses and 23 Government buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development of the "floral mile" along Bukit

Timah  Road, ten nurseries and a drive-in  restaurant

have been constructed. Nine of the nurseries and  the

restaurant block have already been let.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floodlighting of King George V Park has been

completed  at  a cost of about $26,880.  Lighting  is

also   being  provided  at  several  children's  play

grounds, e.g., the Hindoo Road children's playground,

the Kampong Wak Tanjong children's playground and the

children's  playground between  Lorongs  38  and  40.

Floodlights have been provided in the Botanic Gardens

which are now open to the public nightly till 10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of the development of Tiong Bahru

Regional  Park with an area of about seven acres  has

been  completed.  This involved landscaping  and  the

planting of trees and shrubs. The second phase  which

includes the provision of lighting, benches and other

facilities will be completed soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public amenities have also been provided at Mount

Washington and the site has been landscaped and trees

and shrubs planted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans to construct fountains in every

constituency.

<div align="center"><b>(Allocation of flats nearest to applicants' places of work)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development if he will ascertain  from  the

Housing  and Development Board what steps  are  being

taken by the Board to ensure that applicants for  the

Board's flats are allocated flats in estates that are

nearest to their places of work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the time of

registration,  applicants are asked  to  state  their

choice   of   localities  and  order  of  preference.

Allocations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



are    made   accordingly   and   wherever   possible

allocations are made of flats in estates  of  choice.

However, difficulties a rise when applicants begin to

apply  for flats in housing estates that are  already

fully occupied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the difficulty of more popular areas

where, because of land limitations, only a few blocks

are  built  and  the supply cannot meet  the  demand.

Under such circumstances, the applicants will have to

wait  for  casual  vacancies which are  few  and  far

between,  and  they have to wait for  a  considerable

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On occasion, the Board allocates to such applicants

new  flats that may not be too far from the  locality

of the applicants' choice, but often such allocations

are rejected.

<div align="center"><b>(Policy on applications for transfer to larger or smaller flats)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development Board if he will ascertain  from

the  Housing  and Development Board (a) what  is  the

present   policy  in  regard  to  applications   from

existing  tenants for transfer to larger  or  smaller

flats;  (b)  how  many  such  applications  were  out

standing on 31st October, 1968; and (c) whether there

has  been  any delay in dealing with the applications

and the reasons for the delay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, applications from

existing tenants for transfer to other flats are  not

given  priority because there is a larger  number  of

applicants  waiting  to  be allocated  accommodation.

However,  transfers are permitted when the  applicant

is suffering some hardship, e.g., overcrowding or due

to financial circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 31st October, 1968, about 5,309 applicants had

been  registered for transfers, most of whom had been

made offers by the Board which they hail rejected. In

the  result, there has been no delay in dealing  with

transfer applications.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

will  the  Minister  consider  transfers  within  the

estate whenever there are vacancies available,  as  I

understand these vacancies are normally reserved  for

rehousing dispossessed families?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if such vacancies are reserved for

resettlement  cases  who  are  given  priority,  then

transfers  within  the estate will  not  be  approved

unless  it  is  an exchange between two  tenants  who

desire to exchange accommodation.

and  National  Development if he will ascertain  from

the  Housing and Development Board what measures  are

being taken by the Board to make available more flats

in  the  Toa  Payoh  Housing  Estate  for  rental  to

applicants  who are in no position to participate  in

the Board's "Home Ownership Scheme".



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, currently about 9,000

units of flats have been completed and occupied while

another  8,000  units are under construction  in  Toa

Payoh  Housing Estate. It is the Government's  policy

to    sell   as   many   flats   as   possible,   but

notwithstanding this, approximately 40  per  cent  of

the  flats in Toa Payoh will be set aside for  rental

to  accommodate those applicants who  are  unable  to

participate in the home ownership scheme.

<div align="center"><b>(Revision of limits of incomes for eligibility to purchase)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development if he will ascertain  from

the  Housing and Development Board whether the  Board

will  consider revising the limits of individual  and

total  family  incomes, at present $800  and  $1,000,

respectively, for eligibility to purchase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



the  Board's  flats,  in  the  light  of  the  recent

amendment  to  the Central Provident  Fund  Ordinance

raising  the maximum of contributions to the Fund  to

encourage workers to become home owners.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government's policy in

respect of the home ownership scheme is to limit  the

income  level of the applicant to $800 per  month  in

the  case of individual incomes and $1,000 per  month

in  the  case of joint family incomes. Those  earning

above  these  limits are considered to be  reasonably

well  off  and their housing needs should be  catered

for  by  private developers. The income restrictions,

however, do not apply to sitting tenants who may wish

to  use  their  Central Provident  Fund  balances  to

purchase the flats they now occupy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent implementation of the amendments to

the   Central  Provident  Fund  legislation  and  the

reduction  in  the  deposit  requirements   for   the

purchase of flats, more families in the lower  income

group  will be able to purchase a home of their  own.

For  the time being, therefore, the Government  feels

that  it should not revise the income limits to which

I referred.

<div align="center"><b>(Eviction of tenants)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development (a) if he will  ascertain  from

the  Housing  and  Development Board whether  tenants

are,  as  a rule, evicted from the Board's flats  for

contravening any of the tenancy conditions  or  being

in  arrears in rent; and (b) whether he will issue  a

directive  to  the Board to adopt a  more  reasonable

attitude in the eviction of tenants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for Law and National Development)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, normally

the  Housing  and Development Board, in dealing  with

tenants  who have infringed any conditions of  rental

or are is arrears in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



rent,  will carry out investigations into these cases

before action is taken. So far, the measures taken in

dealing with these cases have been very reasonable. I

am  of the view that my Ministry does not have reason

to  believe that it is necessary to ask the Board  to

adopt  a  more  reasonable attitude in  dealing  with

these cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a tenant contravenes any tenancy conditions or

is in arrears in rent, the Board do not usually evict

him  immediately. As usual, the Board  will  issue  a

notice  of warning to him and ask him to comply  with

the  necessary requirements within 10 days. If  after

receiving  this notice the tenant still  persists  in

contravening  the said regulations,  then  the  Board

will ask him to move out from his flat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, there should be  changes

in  the  Board's  regulations. For instance,  when  a

family  is starving, how do you expect it to pay  the

rent?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee, there are altogether 18

questions  on  the Order Paper, and if you  have  any

criticism to make on this point, I suggest  that  you

speak  tomorrow  in  the  Estimates  debate  on   the

Minister's   salary.  Do  you  have  a  supplementary

question now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I merely want

to  say  that the action taken should depend  on  the

merits of individual cases and should also take  into

account  the financial condition of the tenants.  The

regulations  should also be amended and harsh  action

should not be taken to force the tenants to move out.

For instance, the Board ask a tenant to buy a flat at

Toa  Payoh Housing Estate and he says he is not  able

to  buy  it. Then the Board ask him to buy a flat  in

another estate and he is also unable to buy it.  Then

the  Board kicks him here and there. This will  cause

inconvenience  to the tenant. Does the  Parliamentary

Secretary  not  agree  that as we  are  a  democratic

country we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



should not therefore adopt an imperialistic attitude?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will clarify certain points raised by the Member  for

Ulu  Pandan  on the action taken by the  Housing  and

Development  Board to evict tenants who have  engaged

in  gambling and also those who have bought their own

houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member should understand that the flats rented

out  by  the Housing and Development Board are  meant

only for dwelling purposes. If they are used for  any

other  purposes,  the Housing and  Development  Board

will  take  action  to  evict the  tenants.  This  is

expressly provided in the tenancy agreement.  If  the

tenants of the flats have the financial means to  buy

their  own  houses, then they should  give  up  their

flats  to the Housing and Development Board  so  that

the   vacated   flats  can  be  allotted   to   other

applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tenants not being able to pay

their  rentals and have been notified to move out,  I

must  explain  that the Board has to collect  rentals

from  the  tenants  because it is  not  a  charitable

organisation.  If  the  tenants  are   in   financial

difficulties  or  are unemployed,  they  should  seek

assistance from the Social Welfare Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Parliamentary  Secretary has not  given  the  correct

answers to the questions I have raised. I was  saying

that  we should not force a tenant to move out if  he

talking about tenants buying their own houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I missed the point about tenants, not being able

to buy Housing and Development Board flats. The Board

has  always  taken a very liberal attitude'  in  this

matter.  For instance, if a tenant is unable  to  buy

the  flat  he is occupying, the Board will allot  him

accommodation   in   some   other   housing   estate.

Generally,  the Board will not force him to  buy  the

flat he is occupying.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  he  will consider extending the boundary  of

the  area served by the Thomson Road General Hospital

to  include the Constituency of Jalan Kayu in view of

its nearness to that Hospital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the area served by the  Thomson  Road

General  Hospital is periodically reviewed. Extension

of the boundaries served by the hospital by taking in

other  constituencies,  such  as  Jalan  Kayu,   will

certainly  be  considered. But it is  regretted  that

extension  of the area served by the hospital  cannot

be  accepted now. The hospital is relatively new  and

its facilities have been only gradually increased. It

would  be  unwise if it attempts to take  in  a  much

larger area than it could properly deal with.  It  is

better  to  start off with a smaller  area  and  when

staff and other facilities are increased, it can then

expand its services to a wider area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area served by the hospital itself is rapidly

developing.  The  satellite town of Toa  Payoh  alone

will  have  around 250,000 persons. A  population  of

this  size will sorely tax the hospital which  has  a

total  capacity  of only 396 beds.  The  addition  of

other constituencies within its responsibilities will

probably overwhelm it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the demand for Jalan Kayu is to be met by the

Thomson    Road   General   Hospital,    the    other

constituencies  such as Nee Soon,  Serangoon  Gardens

and  Thomson  which are closer and intervene  between

Jalan  Kayu  and the hospital would also have  to  be

entertained. It is for this reason that it would  not

be  prudent  at this stage to consider extending  the

areas  served  by  Thomson Road General  Hospital  to

include the constituency of Jalan Kayu.

<div align="center"><b>(Admission of confirmed tuberculosis cases to medical wards)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Health

why  confirmed tuberculosis cases are admitted to the

Medical Wards in Tan Tock Seng Hospital not meant for

such cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there have

been  occasions  where tuberculosis cases  have  been

admitted  to  the  Medical Wards  in  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital. These were for the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it was not known that these patients at the

time   of    admission  were   suffering   from

tuberculosis; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in those confirmed cases of tuberculosis,

they  were  admitted for some  other    medical

condition  requiring investigation or treatment

in  a Medical Ward. It should be mentioned that

the   Medical  Wards  in  other  hospitals   do

occasionally,  also for the same reasons,  admit

tuberculosis cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten is assured that there is

no  danger  whatsoever  to other  patients  or  their

visitors  in  a  ward  where tuberculosis  cases  are

present. A patient suffering from tuberculosis  in  a

hospital   is   under   treatment   and   in    these

circumstances is not infectious. If there is a chance

that he is infectious, special precautions are taken,

for  example, by isolation in a separate room in  the

same  ward,  and  his clothes and utensils  are  kept

separate and are carefully sterilised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Health

why  persons who are well able to afford  paying  for

hospitalisation have been, and are being, admitted to

the Medical Wards in Tan Tock Seng Hospital admission

to which is free.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Tan Tock Seng

Hospital  is  a  free hospital. There are  no  paying

class wards in it. Hence any patient admitted to  Tan

Tock Seng Hospital, whether to the Tuberculosis Chest

or  Thoracic, Surgical or Medical Wards  is  admitted

free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admissions to the Medical Wards at Tan Tock Seng

Hospital  are taken from the Admission  Room  of  the

Outram  Road General Hospital on a roster basis.  The

sole  criterion for admission is whether or  not  the

patient  requires admission to the hospital,  and  no

account  is taken whether or not the patient  may  be

able  to afford admission to a paying class ward,  as

the  hospital, as mentioned previously, does not have

paying  class  wards.  But if  the  patients  request

admission  to  paying  class  wards,  they  are  then

returned  for admission to the paying class wards  in

the Outram Road General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development estimate proposals have been made to

convert  two  wards  in the hospital  to  accommodate

paying  class patients. The estimate for  making  the

conversions  has  been  given  by  the  Public  Works

Department as costing $75,000. The cost for furniture

and equipment will bring this up to about $112,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval for conversion of these paying class wards

has  been  just given and is included in next  year's

estimates,  and  it is the intention  to  effect  the

conversion in the very near future. These two  paying

class wards will be used for general medical as  well

as tuberculosis patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present four free class medical wards.

When   the  revised  ward  charges  are  implemented,

patients  admitted to these medical  wards  will  pay

similar  rates  chargeable to those admitted  to  'C'

class wards in other hospitals.

<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Health

why  the  Public Health Department is not undertaking

the  cleansing  of completed roads  in  some  private

housing estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is provided under section 66

of  the Local Government Integration Ordinance,  1963

-the relevant law relating to public cleansing - that

the  Health  Authority  shall cause  public  streets,

including  footpaths etc, to be swept  and  cleansed.

Under section 67 (1) of the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance,  it is further provided that  it  is  the

responsibility  of  the  owner  or  occupier  of  any

premises  on a private street to keep his portion  of

the street .and drain abutting his premises clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding these provisions in 'the law, the

Public  Health  Division  does  lake  steps   to   do

cleansing  of  private streets  and  the  removal  of

refuse  in  a 'substantial number of private  housing

estates  where the streets are still private streets.

As  far  as  departmental resources will  permit,  in

terms of funds and labour, the Public Health Division

will  provide a cleansing service to private  streets

in  housing  estates which are completed  and  'fully

occupied.  This is already being done in many  areas;

where  it  is  not  done,  the  reason  is  the  non-

availability of labour and funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many housing estates, individual houses are

occupied gradually while physical construction of the

estate   is   still  in  progress.  More  often   the

occupation  of houses in such estates is before  the

issue  of  a certificate of fitness by the  competent

building authority. Because of building operations in

progress in other parts of the estate, there is often

all  the  accumulation of refuse,  lumber  and  other

material usually present in a developing estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual practice is to require the developer to

provide  the maintenance and cleansing service  while

building operations are in progress. It will  not  be

practical  until an estate is occupied  and  building

operations  have  ceased and the  drains,  pavements,

sidewalks, etc, are properly completed before  it  is

taken over for cleansing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has, however, to be emphasised that the streets

in such private housing estates and drains should, by

and  large, remain in a clean and sanitary state,  as

these  often are areas with limited movement  of  the

general  public. A high standard of sanitary care  by

the  residents will ensure that both the streets and

drains are kept clean and free of refuse and  filth.

This,  however, is not always so and the co-operation

of householders is often needed to ensure this.

diseases  during  the  period  1st  January  to  30th

September, 1968; and whether any distribution pattern

is discernible in the incidence of such diseases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the mosquito-borne diseases in Singapore are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Malaria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Dengue and haemorrhagic fevers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Japanese encephalitis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Filariasis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaria is notifiable to the Public Health Division

under   the  Quarantine  and  Prevention  of  Disease

Ordinance;  dengue and haemorrhagic  fevers  are  not

notifiable  under  this  law,  but  are  notified  by

administrative arrangements from Government hospitals

Health  Division  for follow-up. No  notification  is

required  in the cases of encephalitis and filariasis

and  figures  are  therefore not  available  for  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reported incidence of malaria and dengue and

haemorrhagic fevers during the period 1st  January  to

30th September, 1968, is as follows:-

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of malaria substantially reflects the

situation  in  neighbouring countries.  Only  two  of

these  cases (the first in Punggol and the  other  in

Pulau  Ubin)  could  be considered  to  be  of  local

origin,  whereas  the  rest  of  the  340  cases  are

imported  cases.  Surveys have shown  that  no  local

transmission of malaria is occurring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of the dengue and h‘morrhagic

fever  cases  are found in urban areas.  This  is  in

accord  with the distribution of the Aedes mosquitoes

which  is  essentially urban in character. The  cases

occur  mostly  among children and young  adults  with

more or less equal sex distribution.

<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  yesterday I outlined a situation which may  not

inconveniently persuade our populace  to  infer  that

the  constitutional protection that a person may  not

be  kept  in custody by the police for more  than  24

hours  without bringing him before the court is being

evaded  by  the  apprehension of  persons  under  the

detention  laws, namely, the Criminal Law  (Temporary

Provisions)   Ordinance,   under   which   a   person

apprehended may be kept in custody for more  than  24

hours.   Admittedly   this   occurs   after   certain

precautions have been taken.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reply to a question which I submitted to the

Minister  for  oral  answer,  I  learned  that  1,408

persons had been arrested for the period 1st January,

1967,  to  30th June, 1968, of whom as  many  as  438

persons were subsequently charged in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the detention laws provide that a police

officer  may,  without warrant, arrest and  detain  a

person  pending  inquiry in respect of  whom  he  has

reason to believe that there are grounds which  would

justify  the detention of such person under a certain

section  in  the Ordinance. The grounds  which  would

justify the detention of such a person would  be  the

person's  association with activities of  a  criminal

nature  and  that the person's detention  is  in  the

interest  of public safety, peace and good order.  In

other words, in my view, before this exceptional  law

is  enforced, the police authorities would first have

sufficient  recorded information that the person  has

been  involved in criminal activities for a  span  of

time,   because  the  word  "association"   certainly

implies  a  prolonged association with such  type  of

activities.   Secondly,   that   the   police    have

insufficient  evidence to support the  charge  before

the  court, and that is why the person is apprehended

for  detention.  If  that is so, and  if  the  police

authorities  have  complied with these  requirements,

why  do  they find it convenient to charge the person

in court a few days after his apprehension?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the apprehension of a person under the

detention laws is to appear credible to the populace,

then it must demonstrate a deliberateness which comes

after  a  careful and responsible assessment  of  the

person's danger to society. But the populace will not

see  this credibility if persons are apprehended with

ease   and  a  few  days  later  charged  in   court,

especially  if the figures revealed that as  many  as

396  persons  out  of 420 charged  in  court  pleaded

guilty.  A  lot of unpleasant questions  arise,  Sir.

Would  these persons have pleaded guilty if  they  in

fact  had  been  apprehended under the  laws  of  the

country  which guaranteed their being in custody  for

only  24 hours? Or is it because of their having been

in  custody for more than 24 hours - for three, four,

five  or  six  days  - which provided  them  with  an

opportunity  for  introspection and  repentance  and,

therefore, they pleaded guilty?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point of all these observations is simply

this.  There  are 58 of us here in this Chamber,  all

belonging  to the People's Action Party.  That  being

the  case,  in  my view, I say that it is  absolutely

imperative  that this Government give the  people  no

reason - none at all - at any time to suspect that it

is  prepared to ignore constitutionalism or  that  it

can afford to dispense with the fundamental rights of

the individual.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  associate myself with the points raised  by

the  Member  for Delta yesterday evening  before  the

House  adjourned.  I do not want  to  understate  the

importance   of   building   our   nation's   defence

capability  in  the short time available  before  the

British  military withdrawal to secure  our  nation's

independence and sovereignty. But, at the same  time,

we  must bear in mind that with the phased withdrawal

of  the  British military forces within a  period  of

three  years, the Republic will have lost  an  income

from outside sources to the tune of $400 million  per

year,  totalling $1,200 million by the end  of  1971.

This gigantic loss of foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



exchange  will  create huge problems in  unemployment

and  loss  of income to a great many of our citizens.

To   offset  this  loss,  we  must  generate  greater

economic  growth  at  the same time.  With  political

stability  and good industrial relations  created  by

the  recent passage' of the Employment Bill  in  this

House,   we  have  already  attracted  many  overseas

investors.  As  stated by the Finance Minister,  they

are  already  committed to put their capital  in  our

Republic to set up industries which are mainly export-

oriented.   But   the  greatest   drawback   to   the

realisation  and  fruition of  these  export-oriented

industries,  which  can  employ  many  thousands   of

workers,  is  the  dearth  of  trained  manpower   at

professional, technician and craft levels,  and  our

inability to supply these trained men at this time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to the fact that his Ministry has called up every graduate within the age group from the three levels of technical education to join national service as soon as they have passed out from the institutions. The Minister will agree that

the calling up of these graduates to undergo national

service  training  is  a  great  wastage  of  trained

manpower  which, although non-productive, is  vitally

essential. If these graduates are called up  as  soon

as  they  pass  out,  they  will  lose  much  of  the

theoretical  and academic knowledge which  they  have

acquired in their three or four years of education in

the  higher institutions of learning after two  years

of national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully endorse the Government's policy that all

able-bodied  young men of all types of  training  and

educational standards within the age group should  be

trained  and called up for national service. But  our

Government must make a more pragmatic approach to the

problem  of defence and economic growth as  they  are

complementary to each other in our national survival.

We  must  strike a balance. In other words, a certain

percentage  of the technical graduates at  the  three

levels of training should be released to build up the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



industries during the three critical years,  so  that

by  the  end of 1971 these industries will be  viable

and will be able to expand to provide more job opport

unities for released national service men and school-

leavers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here the Singapore Polytechnic Annual Report

for 1967-1968. If you turn to page 39, you will find

that during the years 1961 to 1968, we produced only 502

professional   graduates,   1,043   technician

graduates,  and 520 craft graduates. In other  words -





<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Low, I find it difficult

to  see how what you are saying is relevant to  this

head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn:</b> I am coming to this question now.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please get to it quickly, because I

think  we  are going to run against time before  very

long.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn:</b> In other words, the ratio of

professional to technician level is only one  to  two

graduates, and the ratio of technician to craft level

is   two  to  one  graduate.  This  is  a  ridiculous

situation when we talk of industrialisalion. In  view

of the foregoing situation facing Singapore today,  I

would  appeal to the Minister to reconsider  relaxing

his  present  policy, i.e., whether  he  would  allow

graduates  of technical institutions within  the  age

group who can get employment to remain at their  jobs

but  to  do  part-time instead of full-time  national

service training, as some of these graduates are  the

sole breadwinners of their family.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, before taking up the issues which  were

raised by Members yesterday and today, may I take the

opportunity  to  touch  briefly  on  one  item  which

appears  in  the  Budget  Estimates  under  both  the

Ministry  of  Communications  and  the  Ministry   of

Defence,   namely,  the  subject  of   good   conduct

allowance.  I would like tu congratulate  the  Member

for  Serangoon Gardens on having very arduously  gone

through this thick book of Estimates to find and draw

attention to this item which has appeared year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



in and year out in the past without any Member making

any  reference to it. We all agree with him  that  as

civil  servants,  and more so as  policemen  who  are

supposed  to  uphold law and order in  this  country,

they  are  expected to show good conduct and,  having

conducted  themselves well, there is  no  reason  why

they  should be paid an allowance over and above what

they  should  normally get. However,  I  am  glad  to

inform  this  House  that  in  time  this  item  will

disappear.  I  have been delving into the  historical

past  to  find  out the whys and wherefores  of  this

allowance being paid, but I regret to report  that  I

have  not been able to find any reason for it at all,

except   that,  in  looking  through  the  files,   I

discovered  that  the allowance is an  incentive  for

policemen  not to sleep at their posts! I  think  the

present  lot of policemen need no incentive  to  stay

awake at their posts. I am glad to report that since 1965 we have not been

paying this allowance at all. As the years go by, the

provision  for this allowance will be less and  less,

and ultimately there will be none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have referred to the Member for Serangoon

Gardens,  I  may as well take up the issue  which  he

raised  yesterday and again today. His fear  is  that

the   constitutional  rights  of  the   citizens   of

Singapore  will  not  be  protected  because  we  are

abusing  the  powers that we have under  the  special

detention  laws  to detain people for  more  than  24

hours  and  then bring them to court. I  think  every

Member  in this House is as zealous as he is  to  see

that  we  protect the constitutional  rights  of  our

citizens. I dare not say that the powers given  under

the  special  detention laws have  not  been  abused.

Perhaps  in  their  zest  to  rid  this  country   of

undesirable  elements, officers in the  police  force

may have made use of these powers.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can assure the Member that every precaution

has  been and will be taken to see that advantage  is

not taken of the special detention laws.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member seems to impute that 438 persons were

charged  after detention of 24 hours.  I  doubt  that

very  much,  Sir. Probably a majority  of  them  were

charged within 24 hours. But I do wish to assure  him

and  the  House that I will take every precaution  to

see that advantage is not taken of the special powers

under the detention laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Mount-batten who wants to

know why there is no provision under the Ministry  of

the  Interior  and  Defence to  celebrate  our  150th

anniversary  next year, all I can  say  is  that  the

planning  and  co-ordination for the  celebration  of

this  anniversary come under the Ministry of Culture.

That is why there is no provision under my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang claims that members of the

Vigilante  Corps are given only one suit  of  uniform

each. I wish to correct him. They are given two suits

of  uniform. They are not given transport  allowance.

But  they  can  claim whatever money  they  spent  on

transport from the Commandant of the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta asked four questions. I can say

that  she  is  in very good company indeed  when  she

wants  to  know how long the Australians are  staying

here.  I  think all of us want to know that. I  would

answer  the question if I could, and things would  be

made  much  easier for us because we could then  plan

our defence with more precision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's other question is: can we fill the

vacuum left by the British military withdrawal? I  do

not believe any nation in Southeast Asia can fill the

vacuum  left  by  the British. In fact,  I  feel  the

British  have  probably calculated that  they  cannot

hold their position in Southeast Asia as well as they

could before, and that is one of the reasons why they

are leaving. As regards the filling of the vacuum, we

are  building our armed forces in order to fulfil our

share  in trying to fill that vacuum, and that vacuum

can  only be filled either by a major power or by all

the nations in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



Southeast Asia, extending as far as Australia and New

Zealand, working together in concert for the security

of  this  region. We are taking every step to prepare

ourselves  in  order to play our part when  the  time

comes  when  all these nations can work together  for

peace and stability in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether there is any

possibility   of   lowering  the  age   of   national

conscripts.  In the foreseeable future, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  do  not think there is a likelihood  of  our

lowering  the age of national conscripts. I  say  "in

the  foreseeable  future", but if  anything  untoward

happens,  then we have got to find ways and means  of

increasing our manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta also wants to know whether the

women's  defence  force are working  under  the  same

conditions as the men. I do not know what  she  means

by  working under the same conditions. They  are  not

given  the same kind of training physically. Our  men

conscripts  have got to go through a  very  strenuous

course  of  basic training which taxes them  mentally

and  physically to the utmost. I do not think we  can

equate women with men here. Therefore, women are  not

given  this training. But as regards pay, where  they

do  the same kind of work we consider them equal  and

have given them equal pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley alleges that the dearth

of  manpower to help us in our economic growth is due

to  the national call-up. I cannot agree with him. He

says that technical graduates of the Polytechnic  and

the University have been called up by my Ministry. If

it  had  been so, my men and I would not  be  running

around today trying to find technical men to man  the

positions  that  we  have. Only  graduates  who  have

graduated  since  1967 have been called  up.  So  the

figures  he  mentioned  of 502 professional  men  and

1,043  technicians  -  I  did  not  catch  how   many

craftsmen  there were - the majority of them  are  in

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards reserving a proportion of these graduates

to  help  in our industrial growth, I cannot  promise

him that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



because  we  are at the very outset of our  build-up.

Here  again  it is a question of priority -  economic

growth or defence capability. I would like Members to

think  that without this defence build-up, there  may

come a time when all the economic growth in the world

will not stand us in good stead, because we would  be

captured and it would be too late to regret  that  we

should  have  given priority to our defence  build-up

first.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered one of my

questions. I said that the salary paid to members  of

the women's defence force is different from that paid

to  the men serving in the armed forces. I understand

that  when  women were called up by the  Ministry  of

Defence,  there was a stipulation that they would  be

given  the  same pay as the men serving in the  armed

forces and that their training may bc different. I am

raising  this  point  because a few  members  of  the

women's  defence force have complained to me of  this

anomaly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister for Defence

whether  the  strength of the women's defence  force

will be increased.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that women

are paid the same salary as the men if they are doing

the  same kind of work. So there is no discrimination

in  my Ministry between men and women on the question

of salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards an increase in the strength of the

women's  defence  force, of course, we  will  recruit

more  members for the women's defence force if  there

is  a need to. I think there is a need because we are

expanding  very  fast. We have not reached  our  peak

yet.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head [1901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our implementation of national service has been

quite successful. It is mainly due to the support and

cooperation  of  our people because  they  know  that

patriotism  and  defence of  the  country  are  their

bounden   duties.  But  I  wish  to   raise   certain

complaints  about the Central Manpower Base.  I  have

recently   received  complaints  from   parents   who

complained  that  the efficiency of this  office  was

very  poor. They also said that the officials of this

office adopted a bad attitude towards their work. For

instance,  conscripts who went  to  register  at  the

office had to wait from 8 a.m, to 12 noon before they

were  called  up  for  actual registration.  This  is

undeniably too long a time to expect the boys to  get

registered.  I would like the Minister  to  urge  the

office  to  improve  the system of  registration, if

there is no time, then another day should be allotted

to the youths to be registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about parents accompanying their

children  to get registered. We all know  that  women

are  very  concerned  with their  children.  National

service  was  introduced only recently in  Singapore.

Before  this,  the people did not know what  national

service  was all about. When they went to the office,

the  officials there did not welcome them. This  kind

of attitude is not right. I feel that the people need

co-operation from the officers concerned so that they

may have a favourable impression of national service,

our  Government, our political institutions, and  our

country as well. I feel that when parents bring their

children  along  to get registered  at  the  National

Service  Office,  they  should  be  well  treated.  A

waiting  room  should be provided for  them.  At  the

moment,  they  are all standing around.  I  hope  the

Minister can consider my points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

information of Members, I would like to say that  the

procedure  of  registration takes  quite  some  time,

largely  because  there are a  lot  of  tests  to  go

through  and  a lot of information to be sought  from

conscripts. I will briefly give the procedure that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



national conscript is expected to go through and  the

time taken. There are several stages.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is documentation. This requires about 40

minutes  per person. After this, there is an aptitude

test  which  takes one and a half hours  per  person.

This  aptitude test is to find Out what the  national

conscript is fitted for technical, combat or for  the

various  vocations that we have in the armed  forces.

Then  there  is  a language proficiency  test  and  a

personal interview which require about 20 minutes per

person. Therefore, all in all, it takes about two and

a  half  hours for each conscript. So it is  expected

that   every  conscript  who  presents  himself   for

registration has to wait quite some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, 400 people are called up a day. When

we   first  started  conscription  and  call-up,  the

parents  who  accompanied these youths  were  allowed

into  the  camp, but after some experience of  it  we

found   that  it  delayed  the  interview   and   the

registration  itself because of  the  limited  space.

Hence,  parents are now not allowed inside the  camp.

Unfortunately,  we  do not have sufficient  space  to

provide  places  for these parents  to  sit.  We  are

trying to find whether we can make use of the canteen

of   the  People's  Association,  which  is  situated

nearby, for the parents to wait for their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself do not understand what the Member meant

when  he  said that the staff of the Central Manpower

Base  have not treated the mothers well. Does he mean

that they do not allow the mothers to accompany their

children  when  they  go  through  these  stages   of

interview, or does he mean that they were asked to go

away? Can he clarify that point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, regarding

this   point,  the  parents  who  accompanied   their

children  to the registration centre found  that  the

officials did not like them to go near the office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



because there were too many people in the office. The

parents  were  not given places to sit and  wait.  In

other  words, the attitude of the officials  is  that

parents are not welcome to the centre. Perhaps  there

is  insufficient space because every day  400  youths

have  to be registered and including the parents  who

accompany their children, it will come to 700 or  800

persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like the Minister to look into

this   matter  and,  if  possible,  to  improve   the

situation by providing facilities for the parents  to

wait for their children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the presence of

parents  will  interfere with the  registration  and,

furthermore,  there  is  a limitation  of  space.  Of

course,  we are trying to see whether we can  provide

waiting space for the parents. But I believe, Sir, if

we  go to the secondary schools where the youths  are

registered - they are much younger than those who are

being  called up we do not find parents holding their

sons'  hands when they go for registration. I  expect

very  soon that parents will treat their children  in

the same way as those being registered in the schools

and we will not have parents holding their children's

hands when they go for registration. While trying  to

make  it as comfortable as possible for those parents

who  still  have doubts whether their  children  have

grown  up  or not, I think it is a question  of  time

before the necessity for providing waiting space  for

parents does not arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  do  not  agree  with what the Minister  has  said,

because  if  there  are  complaints  there  must   be

problems  involved. If problems arise,  the  Minister

must  try  to  solve them. We can always  reduce  the

number of youths to be registered from 400 to 300 per

day and the time for waiting will be shortened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only natural that parents accompany their

children   to  the  registration  centre.  Even   the

Minister  will  accompany his son to the  centre  for

registration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The translation of the Member's

speech  did  not come through quite well. However,  I

have already indicated that we will try to make those

parents   who  are  at  present  accompanying   their

children to the registration centre as comfortable as

possible.  But it is my considered opinion that  very

soon there will be no more parents accompanying their

children there. I can assure the Member for Sembawang

that when my son is conscripted, his mother will  not

accompany him to the registration centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  beg  leave  to withdraw my amendment  because  the

Minister  has assured me that he will take  steps  to

look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1301*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some criticisms to make of the behaviour of

some  of our police officers. When they deal with  an

emergency  case, they are rather slow in their  work.

When an emergency case occurs, they merely go to  the

spot and take a look at it only. When they arrive  at

the  spot,  the evildoers have already escaped.  They

are  too slow to rise to the occasion. Although  they

are  there  in full force, they are still  unable  to

arrest  the  culprits. When a police  patrol  car  is

summoned, it does not go to the spot in time.  Is  it

because  they do not know the route to the  scene  of

the  incident or the locality of the incident?  I  do

not think this is possible.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that when members of the public

summon  a  police patrol car, the car, while  on  its

way,   will  sound  its  siren.  I  think   this   is

unnecessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>





because the sound of the siren will warn the culprits

who will then try to escape. If the patrol car sounds

the siren in order to warn on-coming traffic, I would

suggest a special type of light be installed  in  it,

and  whenever it signals this light, road users  will

then make way for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are some members of the police force, especially those in the lower ranks, who still adopt the colonial attitude. One night I went to a police station to speak on behalf of a resident who broke certain traffic rules. The police officers on duty seemed to be very rude to

members of public. They should have been courteous to

them, otherwise the public will have a bad impression

of our police force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about a person who was detained by

the police for eight hours because they wanted him to

act  as a witness and to co-operate with them.  After

having  been  detained for so  many  hours  and  also

because he was feeling hungry, do you think he  would

cooperate  with  the police? I feel that  the  police

should  be  polite and courteous to the public.  They

should  be  friendly, dedicated and kind.  I  believe

this is also the aim of the Government.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not correct for me to criticise the police

force.  Perhaps the people will say that  the  Member

for  Paya  Lebar is not satisfied with anything.  Now

let  me  give  credit where it is due to  the  police

force.  I  would  like to draw the attention  of  the

Minister  to  the plight of the bereaved families  of

those police officers who have sacrificed their lives

in  the course of their duties. I wonder whether  any

compensation  or  pension is given  to  the  bereaved

families.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I wish to touch on one subject.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has said that the

policemen are proud but I do not agree with  him.  As

far as I am aware, they are not arrogant at all. Some

officers  in charge of police stations are good,  but

others are not so. For example, last Saturday at 1.00

p.m, a  resident of my constituency came to  me  and

said  that four of his sons had been arrested by  the

police. Their ages were 27, 25, 21 and 17 years.  The

youngest child was still schooling. I therefore  went

with the father to the police station. The officer in

charge,  Mr Chin, was out at the time. It was  about 3.00 p.m., or 4.00 p.m.

I did not know that the 'four

sons had been arrested by Mr Chin. He was 'arrogant.

I do not know why. I cannot say whether he recognised

me  or not. His colleagues introduced -me to him'  as

the  Member  for Ulu Pandan. His manners  were  very,

very  arrogant  indeed. He did  not  even  smile.  He

treated  me as if I were a culprit. This attitude  on

the   part   of  such  a  high-ranking   officer   is

meaningless. Even a Superintendent of Police does not

behave  like this. What is the use of employing  such

an officer who ill-treats the people? He arrested the

four  brothers  with the use of force. He  threatened

the  youngest boy with a gun and knife to answer  his

question,  "Tell me whether you have associated  with

bad people." I-Ic made it look as if he was going  to

shoot  the  boy. This is very bad. I-low can  such  a

thing  be  done? A police station is not a court.  If

the  boy  did not commit any offence, he should  have

been  released.  He should not have  been  threatened

with  a  gun.  Ours is a democratic country.  Such  a

Government  servant is described by  the  Chinese  as

despotic  and  dictatorial. Police officers  who  are

impolite to Members of Parliament are bad. I dare say

that  our  Government will be toppled as a result  of

the  attitude of such Government servants. Therefore,

I  hope the Minister will investigate the matter  and

see what kind of a person that officer is.

the Member for Paya Lebar thinks that only a minority

of   the  police  force  are  acting  in  this   way.

Nevertheless, it is our duty to weed them out. I will

be  glad to receive more detailed information so that

I can take appropriate action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar complained about the

slowness  of the police to appear at the scene  of  a

crime. Here again, I think it is a general statement,

and  if  specific instances can be given, I  will  go

into  the whys and wherefores. The Member - in  fact,

all  of  us  -would like the police, when called,  to

arrive  at  the  scene  of  a  crime  as  quickly  as

possible.  On the other hand, he suggested that  they

should  not  use their car horns to get a  clear  way

through the traffic. I am grateful for his suggestion

that  lights can be used to alert the road users that

the police are on duty or in a hurry to go somewhere.

But  as  I am not a specialist, I do not know whether

lights in the daytime will have the desired effect of

alerting  the  cars  in front to  make  way  for  the

police. Anyway, I am grateful for his suggestion, but

the best way that we know of clearing the traffic  is

for  the  police to sound their horns. If the  Member

can  pinpoint  any incident where the police  arrived

one  hour after they had received a call, I will look

into  it.  As  he  knows, sometimes  the  traffic  in

Singapore  is  quite  congested  and  it  takes  some

considerable time to get from one place to another.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister has

said that I should have reported the matter to him. I

feel that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>





not  as  good as when I make a report to this  House

because the people will learn about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister is more concerned

with  remedying the situation than with  getting  the

people to learn about it.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, we all know that the police are the eyes of  the

people.  They  have  to protect us,  look  after  our

country  and  maintain law and order.  They  are  the

protectors  of  our  rights. Besides  the  army,  the

police  should  look  after our personal  safety  and

property.  However, since the P.A.P, came  to  power,

the  standard of conduct and efficiency of the police

has  improved. It is possible that there is  still  a

minority  in the police force who adopt the  colonial

attitude.  This should be put right. There  are  many

officers who are well-mannered and are doing well  in

their  jobs.  But there are still some  flaws  'which

need  to  be corrected so that the police can  render

good service which is expected of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one aspect of the police force on which I

would  like  to touch. We learn from the  press  that

sometimes  the  police resort to  the  use  of  their

pistols  when carrying out their duties.  There  have

been  reported  cases of the loss  of  pistols  as  a

result  of a quarrel over some women and some  people

were  murdered,  and so on. This is not  an  isolated

incident. This kind of news appears in the press  now

and  then.  As  a result, people form the  impression

that  the  police  are careless with  their  weapons.

There  is a doubt in the minds of the people  whether

the police can really look after their safety.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also learned that there are many restaurants

and  bars which have recently been set up by some  of

our  police  officers, though not under their  actual

names. But, in actual fact, they are the sponsors  of

these restaurants and bars where many crimes are  committed.

This is an open secret to many people. I feel

that this is bad for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



good reputation of the police force and calls for  an

investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that most of our secondary school

pupils  have  organised a police cadet corps.  Police

officers have also been sent to the schools to  train

the  students. In order to improve the  standards  of

our police, I wonder whether the Minister is prepared

to  consider  police cadets who have  graduated  from

schools  and  recruit  them direct  into  the  police

force.  These  police cadets have already  had  basic

training and have acquired skill in police duties. As

such, we do not have to recruit other people who have

not  been  so  trained,  and  thus  incur  additional

expenditure.  In  this way, we  can  also  raise  the

standards of the police.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The Member for Delta alleges that a

large  number o police personnel are careless in  the

handling  of  their weapons. I do not know  how  many

cases  she has read in the papers. But whenever these

cases are known, disciplinary action has been taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also alleges that it is common knowledge that

police officers have shares in businesses, especially

bars.  Police  regulations do not  allow  any  police

officer  to  have any interest in any business  which

may prejudice his work. Though it is common knowledge

to her, I have not received any complaint about that.

Here  again, if she can give specific complaints,  we

will look into them.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, students who have been members of the

school  police  cadet corps will be given  preference

when they come for recruitment into the police force.

There is no doubt about that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister has asked

me just now to provide details of the the cases that I have

brought up. as I recall it, on 31st August this year, at

about 7.00 p.m., members of the Barisan Sosialis gathered

at a theatre in Paya Lebar Road. Sombody rang me up about

the matter, and I asked him to ring up 999 since the

Barisan Sosialis were creating some incidents there. In the

end I myself





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



rang up 999. This was just after I had left school. I

then took my supper. After I had finished my supper, the

police had still  not yet come. When they actually arrived

at the P.A.P. branch in Paya Lebar, they behaved as

though they would like me to be polite to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I say, I would

like  Members to forward me the details  and  I  will

make the necessary investigation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

Minister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2007.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, this item is in respect of telephones in M.I.D, headquarters. I wish to ask the Minister whether he is aware that there are not enough lines in the telephone exchange of the M.I.D. From experience I find that sometimes it takes almost half a day to get a call through to his Ministry

because  of  over-loading at the telephone  exchange.

M.I.D, being an important Ministry, I feel that  this

matter  should be drawn to his attention so that  the

situation can be improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  agree  very much with what has been  said  by  the

Member  for  Kampong Kapor. Sometimes I  myself  have

rung  up the Ministry of Defence. Almost half an hour

would  elapse before I could get the call through.  I

hope the Minister will expedite action to improve the

position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that it

is  quite  difficult  to get through  a  call  to  my

Ministry  because  we have a very limited  number  of

lines.  I wish we could increase the number of lines.

But due to technical difficulties it is riot possible

to  do  so.  We  are in close consultation  with  the

Singapore Tele-

phone  Board  to  see  whether  we  can  remedy   the

situation.  I would like to' be in a position  to  be

able to receive phone calls immediately from the  Mem

ber  for  Sembawang or the Member for Paya  Lebar  so

that  I  myself can accompany the police car wherever

it goes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2009.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item concerns the Vigilante Corps and the

expenditure  allotted for it.  Some national  service

youths  have been absorbed into the Vigilante  Corps.

It  has now become a force supplementing the work  of

the  police.  They have contributed much  by  way  of

maintaining law and order in our country. Our purpose

in  getting  national servicemen into  the  Vigilante

Corps  is  to inculcate in them a spirit of  national

consciousness  and service to the people.  Since  the

past  few weeks, a number of Vigilante Corps  members

have  completed their training. They have  graduated.

So  far  they  have not been sent  to  serve  in  the

various community centres. The Vigilante Corps  posts

are still being manned by volunteers. I would like to

ask the Minister whether these well-trained Vigilante

Corps  members who are national servicemen  could  be

sent  to  serve  in  the various  community  centres.

However,  there are many community centres  which  do

not  have Vigilante Corps posts. I wonder whether the

Vigilante Corps members could set up a post in  every

community centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister also tell the House how many

Vigilante  Corps training centres there are  for  the

training of national service personnel and where they

are situated?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask a very important

question. I wonder whether the Government can provide

these national servicemen serving as Vigilante



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



Corps members with work as is now being provided  for

full-time national servicemen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, unfortunately for

the Member for Mountbatten, the answer to all his queries  is  no.  He  must understand that  the  present

organisation  of  the  Vigilante  Corps  is  entirely

different  from that of the Vigilante Corps  that  we

had during the Indonesian confrontation. At that time

we  had volunteers who came forward to help us patrol

the   beaches  and  stand  guard  against  subversive

elements. But at the moment the Vigilante Corps takes

in young conscripts and we have an entirely different

kind of programme for these people. Therefore, though

they  have  completed their basic training  and  have

passed out, it is not the intention of my Ministry to

post  these people to the various community  centres.

Security,  that  is, the patrolling  and  manning  of

beaches,  will  be undertaken by the police  and  the

Special  Constabulary. The Vigilante Corps has  other

objectives which I need not go into detail here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For security reasons, it is not the policy of my

Ministry  to  make  known  the  number  of  training

centres we have and where they are. But if any Member

of  the House is really interested to know these  and

want more details, he can approach me and I will give

him   the  information  in  private.  But  under   no

circumstances  must Members divulge  the  number  of

training  centres  and where they  are  situated  and

similarly  also the number of national servicemen  we

have  trained as Vigilante Corps members. It  is  not

the policy of my Ministry to divulge these figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is not willing to guarantee work for

national servicemen in the Vigilante Corps as it does

for those who serve full-time military service in the

army. We feel that national servicemen who serve  two

full years in the army have been deprived of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



opportunity of looking for work during the two  years

they  are in service, whereas Vigilante Corps members

and the Special Constabulary Corps members spend only

part  of their time in training and, therefore,  they

could still be working while they are being trained.

Speaker.  Sir,  due to shortage of  time,  I  am  not

amendment (7) . Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $100+.







<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (6) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3170.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to ask the

Minister  to  pay  attention to two matters.  Perhaps

Members  are  aware that the Singapore  Armed  Forces

Training Institute is situated in my constituency. In

Jurong,  there  is  also  a  camp  of  the  Singapore

Infantry  Regiment. It appears that  my  constituency

has  become a training ground for military personnel.

Sir,  I  do  not object to the training  of  military

personnel  in my constituency. I realise that  troops

must be trained in military capability because I am a

member of the People's Defence Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, we are seven minutes short of

"guillotine" time and I would ask you to mention  the

two  points very quickly so that we can get  a  reply

from  the  Minister before debate is curtailed  under

Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am coming to

the  point  very  soon. Owing  to  the  frequency  of

exercises, 3-ton military trucks using the good roads

in my constituency have spoilt them. These trucks are

sturdy and therefore they are not damaged. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



when   the   roads   are  spoilt,  the   people   are

inconvenienced.  Requests  have  been  made  to   the

Ministry of National Development to repair the roads,

but  usually  it takes some time before they  are  re

paired.  I  would like to ask the Minister whether  a

sum of money could be allotted under his Ministry for

the  repair  of  roads  which have  been  damaged  by

military  trucks.  Perhaps he  can  also  direct  the

troops  to  repair the roads in order to improve  the

relationship  between  the  troops  and   the   rural

residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that when the troops are on an

exercise  some  of  them steal  rambutans  and  other

fruits belonging to the rural folk. This usually  hap

pens  at night. This should be stopped, otherwise  it

will create bad feeling among the rural folk and  the

good  relationship between the troops and the  people

will  deteriorate. I hope the Minister will look into

this  matter  and make the troops realise  that  they

should not do such a thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, perhaps I should

inform  Members of the House that we encourage  commu

nity  service in the armed forces as much as possible

and  some of our battalions have adopted orphan homes

and  community centres. If my memory serves me right,

the  last  group  of cadets before  they  were  given

commissions as officers did participate in some  road

construction.  Where  members  of  the   M.I.D, are

responsible for spoiling some of the roads,  I  think

it  will  not be difficult at all for them to  repair

these roads where-ever possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards stealing of rambutans by the troops at

night while under training, I have given instructions

that incidents of this nature should not be repeated.

But,  as  you  know, our youths are  physically  fit,

robust and high-spirited. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



one  or  two  incidents of this nature are  expected.

Anyway,  I  do not believe it is done on an organised

scale.  It  is  more  out of mischief  than  for  any

benefit  which  they  get. I have given  instructions

that  these  incidents should not  be  repeated.  The

troops should keep' good relationship with members of

the  public.  With the training given. I  can  expect

them  to  keep law and order even while they  are  on

training under difficult circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, Madam Chan has indicated that

she   is  not  speaking.  Are  you  withdrawing   the

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek your leave to range over the Registry of

Marriages  if I may and I will not move the amendment+

thereunder because I now wish to raise an issue which

is connected with the Registry of Marriages.



<hr size="2" noshade>

+  The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1121.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister for Defence is not

answerable for the Registry of Marriages. But if what

you  say  is  ancillary to what you  are  raising  on

Immigration, then please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Yes, Sir. The answer is substantially

to be given by the Minister for Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, basically there is an absence of co-ordination

between  the Immigration Department and the  Registry

of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



Marriages.  In  a  way, it touches a  matter  of  the

heart.  We  may have a male non-citizen, a foreigner,

in our country for short periods of stay and the more

selective of our charming females may decide  to  tie

the  matrimonial  knot with such a male  non-citizen.

The result of it is that our female citizen makes  an

application  to  the Registry of  Marriages  for  the

issue  of the necessary licence and the Registrar  of

Marriages   appears   to   issue   it   without   any

inhibitions. Of course, solemnisation of the marriage

takes  place  and  the  two  are  married.  Then   an

application  is  made to the Immigration  authorities

for  residence  of the husband of our female  citizen

who  is  told  - also without inhibitions - "Very sorry.

Residence  in Singapore cannot be given to  him."  Of

course,  this would necessitate a separation  between

husband and wife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However much it appears that efforts have been made

in  the  past by our female citizen to get  her  non-

citizen   husband   into  Singapore   for   permanent

residence,  she is told that that, unfortunately,  is

not possible because the law is so. I tend to believe

that  if  co-ordination had existed between  the  two

departments, perhaps the Registrar of Marriages might

not   be   issuing  licences  of  marriage  in   such

circumstances which do create hardship. I do not know

what  is the situation now and I would be obliged  if

the Minister could inform the House whether this sort

of   practice  has  ceased  and  licences  for   such

marriages  are no longer issued by the  Registrar  of

Marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also opportune, Mr Speaker, Sir, to raise a

question under this subhead if the Minister cares  to

answer  it,  because I wonder whether  it  is  really

relevant  to  this  subject; that is,  the  rationale

behind  the  law  offering a non-citizen  female  who

happens to marry one of our male citizens entitlement

to  residence  in this country. What  is  the  reason

behind this discrimination? On the one hand, we allow

a  non-citizen female who is married to  one  of  our

male  citizens residence in the country. On the other

hand, we do not grant residence to a male non-citizen

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



marries one of our female citizens. There might be  a

rational explanation for this. I do not know. But  if

the Minister chooses to answer, I think this could be

an opportune time to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy is not here.

Madam Chan is not speaking. Mr Sim Boon Woo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

doubtful  when the Member for Serangoon Gardens  said

that  in the case of a male citizen of Singapore  who

marries a non-citizen from another country, the  wife

can  reside  permanently in Singapore.  I  have  come

across   several   cases  during  my  meet-the-people

sessions  of male Singapore citizens who got  married

in  Johore  and have children born in Singapore.  The

wife  was  sent  back  to Johore.  When  the  husband

applied for permanent residence for the wife, he  was

told  that the application was refused on the  ground

that he could not support his wife.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to make this point a

little  bit  clearer  so that  we  do  not  have  any

difficulties in dealing with the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to refer to the immigration check-point

at  the Woodlands end of the causeway. The process of

checking  passports  should  be  speeded  up.  I  can

understand  that  sometimes delays  are  caused  when

checking  non-Singapore passports but, with Singapore

passports which are not stamped, a few seconds should

be  enough. Sir, I think you will agree with me  that

if  you go to the satay club in Johore Bahru and  you

come back during the weekend you will experience  the

same thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be grateful if the Minister can look into

ways  and  means of reducing the time taken to  check

Singapore passports.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  just want to give two more illustrations  on

this matter. There may, on principle, be a difference

between a female citizen of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



getting  married  to  a  male foreigner  and  a  male

citizen  of  Singapore getting married  to  a  female

foreigner. So far as the law is concerned, a girl who

gets  married to a foreigner will have to follow  the

domicile  of the foreigner and there are a number  of

legal consequences that follow from this fact. But  I

am  much more concerned with a male Singapore citizen

getting  married  to a female foreigner  who  is  not

allowed  to  bring  his wife into Singapore.  The  Immigration  Department  steps in  and  says  that  she

cannot be allowed the necessary permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a much more harassing situation is this. It

has,  in fact, happened in Singapore and I have  come

across  this  case  personally.  A  female  Singapore

citizen  got  married to a teacher in the  Federation

who was a Federal citizen. She went to the Federation

to stay with him and in the process had two children.

Unfortunately, her husband died in a  car  crash  and

she came back to stay with her mother because she did

not   have  any  relatives  in  the  Federation.  The

Immigration Department stepped in and said  that  she

could not bring her children in. In other words,  the

children  could  not stay in Singapore  although  she

could.  These  matters  must be rationalised  because

they are patently inhuman.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Members who spoke before me have brought  up

some  points of interest. I have similar issues which

have to be looked into by the Immigration Department.

In  the  course  of my meetings with my constituents,

dissatisfaction has been expressed with the manner in

which  the Immigration Department appears to operate.

As  the  Immigration Department is only part  of  the

portfolio of our Minister, I think this is the proper

place to air some of the grievances.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As briefly as possible!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I will try to be as brief as

possible,  Sir. This refers to persons who  are  non-citizens but have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



been  residents in Singapore for a number  of  years.

Some of them have qualified for citizenship and their

cases are pending approval or disapproval. Others who

have   not  qualified  due  to  lack  of  residential

qualification   are   unable  to  obtain   restricted

passports to go across the causeway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if these persons were born either in India or

Thailand  or  anywhere else, they  could  go  to  the

respective  High  Commissioner Consulates  to  obtain

letters stating they are stateless and we would  have

no    objection    in    issuing   them    passports.

Unfortunately,  the people who were born  across  the

causeway  were not given a certificate of  stateless-

ness  by  their High Commissions and we  turned  them

away.  Eventually, they will come to feel  that  they

are  prisoners in Singapore and are unable to get out

even if they want to. Sir, it is easy to say that  we

want  them  to  go  away because  they  are  not  our

responsibility  but the responsibility  of  Malaysia.

But we should not forget that they have been here for

a number of years with no intention of going back and

yet are unable to go across the causeway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into these cases

which are numerous indeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the cases mentioned by the Members  who

have  spoken  before  me have  also  happened  in  my

constituency.  Male citizens were  unable  to  obtain

permission for their non-citizen wife to stay  perman

ently  in  Singapore. They were  also  asked  by  the

Immigration  Department  to speed  up  the  necessary

formalities so that their wife could leave  Singapore

as soon as possible. I do not know whether the aim of

this policy is, as with the aim of protection of  our

local  industries, to encourage our male citizens  to

marry   only  our  women  citizens.  In  our  present

society,  we believe in having love as the foundation

of  marriage.  Whether we like it or not,  they  have

already  become husbands and wives. It  is  therefore

unreasonable, from the humanitarian point of view, if

we  do  not  allow  a non-citizen  wife  to  stay  in

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



and  force her to separate from her husband  and  her

family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a well-known Chinese fairy tale of a

cowboy called Niu Lang and a spinner called Jze  Nyu.

The  audience shed tears of sympathy when that  fairy

tale  is shown on stage. This story is now being  re-

enacted with our own people acting as the cowboy  and

the  spinner as the case may be. I hope the  Minister

can  review  the present immigration policy  so  that

this tragic Chinese story will not be repeated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members seem to

think that I am the fly in the ointment in affairs of

the  heart!  I  would  like to  assure  them  that  I

encourage  freedom in affairs of the  heart  wherever

possible!  This  is  one  of  the  reasons  why   the

Registrar  of  Marriages does not show discrimination

whom  a person marries so long as he gives sufficient

notice  and  the  parties  concerned  have  lived  in

Singapore for more than 15 days. I do not see in what

way this has got anything to do with immigration.  It

is  a service which Singapore can render to join them

in  holy and legal wedlock so that they can live  hap

pily  ever after. I do not think there is any  tie-up

between  the Immigration Department and the  Registry

of Marriages. I do not think the Member for Serangoon

Gardens  would  like the Government to determine  who

should  marry whom and who should not marry whom.  We

give  complete freedom here provided the couple  have

lived here for more than 15 days. If they want to get

married,  the Registry will perform the service,  and

good  luck  to  them.  Therefore,  the  question   of

immigration does not come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also wants to know

the  rationale under which we decide that female non-

Singapore  citizens who are married to male  citizens

are  allowed  in, whereas male non-citizens  who  are

married  to women citizens are not allowed in.  I  do

not  know exactly what is the rationale, but I  would

say that, being an eastern country, we would like  to

feel  that  it  is the man who wears the  pants  and,

therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



the  woman takes the domicile of the man. The  Member

for  Bukit Panjang has given the legal interpretation

to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards admission of women non-citizens who are

married to Singapore citizens, the law provides  that

they can apply for entry into Singapore. Just to  let

Members know that we have not been heartless, I  will

give  the  figures  of applications  and  the  number

approved  and rejected. In 1967, 486 applications  of

this  nature  were approved and 134 were refused;  in

1968,  449  were approved and 187 were refused;  from

October to December 1967, 28 were approved and  three

were  refused;  January to November  1968,  668  were

approved and 161 were refused. Every case is  treated

on  its own merits, but the law covering applications

of  female non-citizens married to Singapore citizens

comes  under  the  Immigration Prohibition  of  Entry

Order, 1966. Those who are interested can read it  in

detail. Those female non-citizens who are married  to

Singapore  citizens and who are on a visit  pass  are

not  allowed  an  extension  of  stay  because  their

husbands are not in a position to support them or the

children  whom they will bring into this world  later

on.  That  is  the main reason why they  are  refused

admission, otherwise we will not interfere with their

matrimonial problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the refusal to issue restricted passports

to persons holding blue identity cards, we will issue

them   these   passports  if  they  can   produce   a

certificate of statelessness. But they cannot produce

this   certificate  of  statelessness  because  their

country of domicile is not willing to give them  this

certificate. Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> They will not give it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Therefore, their status is

doubtful  even in the minds of the country  of  their

birth  or  domicile,  and  by  issuing  them  with  a

restricted  passport we have to recognise  that  they

are   our  responsibility.  The  position  has   been

explained that, because of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



difficulties  we have to face following  the  British

military  withdrawal, we do not want to  create  more

trouble for ourselves in future by making it easy for

people to come and stay here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi complains that he is always

held up by the customs when he goes to the satay club

in Johore Bahru. I think it is not by the Immigration

Department at the checkpoint. I think that is not the

experience  of most people. Probably his face  showed

that  he  had  been doing more than eating  satay!  I

think this is an exception rather than the rule. Next

time,  if  he  will  just confine himself  to  eating

satay, he will probably get through faster.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The Minister has said that the alien wife

of  a  Singapore citizen will not be able to get  her

passport  renewed if he cannot maintain her  and  her

children.  How can the Minister or the Controller  of

Immigration be sure that the husband cannot  maintain

his  wife?  If the wife is willing to stay  with  her

husband,  he  will be able to maintain  her  and  the

children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not quarrelling

with  the legalistics of the matter if that, in fact,

is  the rationale behind the legal discrimination. If

our female citizen marries a non-citizen, she has  to

accept the fact that she follows the domicile of  her

husband.  That is quite correct. I think there  still

exists  a  moral obligation at least  to  inform  our

female  citizen that when she marries a  non-citizen,

he will not be entitled to reside in this country.  I

think  if this situation is made known to our  female

applicants,  it  will  correct the  wrong  impression

that,  as  they  are  citizens  of  Singapore,  their

husbands are entitled to reside with them, because  I

think this impression is very real.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.  We cannot get away with by saying that we have

a problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



on  our hands and that we do not want  to  have

additional problems. But, as I have said,  these  are

cases  of residents who are working here and who  are

still  here. If they were not born in the Federation,

if they were born in Thailand or India, they could go

to  their  respective Consulates  and  get  stateless

certificates and then they could get their  passports

here.  This discrimination is only for those born  in

the  Federation.  If they have been living  here  for

some  years and if they have permanent residence  and

jobs  here,  at  least some consideration  should  be

given  to  them so that they can go to the Federation

when  they  want to, especially in view of  the  good

relationship  between Singapore and  the  Federation.

Somebody has to look into their problems to see  that

they are given freedom of travel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am most sympathetic to that

appeal and I will look into the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is simple to make it widely known that

female  Singapore  citizens  who  marry  non-citizens

should follow the domiciles of their husbands. It can

be  made known from time to time. I think this debate

will  probably  highlight the fact that  locally-born

women  whose hearts are won by foreigners will,  most

likely,  have to make their homes in countries  other

than Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was raised, how are we to know whether

a  husband  can  support his foreign  wife?  In  some

instances  where we had allowed a wife to  come  into

Singapore, we found out a few months later  that  she

had been asking my colleague, the Minister for Social

Affairs,  for assistance! We also found out that  the

husband  was doing odd jobs and earning about  $80  a

month.  Ultimately my colleague had  to  support  the

family!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

the  Minister has replied to the specific problem  to

which  I  have referred, that of the widow who  is  a

Singapore  citizen and who is not able to  bring  her

children into Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, on humane grounds, if the

case  is  referred to me, I will have a further  look

into it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0902 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that the subject of "Passports" appears under

two subheads. Under subhead 2013, there is a vote  of

$75,000  for  Other Charges Annually  Recurrent,  and

under  subhead 3004 there is a vote of  $111,410  for

Other Charges Special Expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether he intends to issue

new passports under this subhead?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> There is no intention to issue new

passports  at  all.  This is  a  special  expenditure

because  the sum of money is used to employ temporary

staff  to  man the centres which issue the restricted

passports.  This  is a temporary measure  and  it  is

expected that the rush for restricted passports  will

be  over very soon and that this expenditure will not

be used at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> This vote should come under

"Personal Emoluments" instead of under "Passports".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Madam

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past one year, the Ministry of Culture

has  done  much  to promote cultural activities.  For

instance,  there  are more and more  films  of  local

plays  and dramas. Many educative films are shown  on

television. Although these films are supplied by  the

Ministry  of  Education, television comes  under  the

Ministry of Culture. So the credit should also go  to

the Ministry of Culture. Such TV programmes as "Youth

Forum"   and   "It's  Happening  in  Singapore"   are

beneficial to the people as a whole. There are  other

programmes,  such  as  forums by  students,  artists,

etc.,  which are of educational value. But there  are

also  some  T.V, and radio programmes which  are  not

"healthy". For instance, the radio programmes consist

of  too much pop music and odious songs such as,  "My

Dear  Ones",  "My  Sisters" and other  endearing  and

romantic   terms.   These   unhealthy   themes    are

deleterious to our youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that good and educative programmes are

conducive  to  nation  building  because   they   can

encourage  our people to build a better and  brighter

future.  On  the other hand, the narcotic and  erotic

type of programmes will have a contrary effect on the

people. I will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



quote  what  the  Minister  for  Culture  said  at  a

function of Nanyang University as reported by the Sin

Chew Jit Poh on 11th December, 1968:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our culture should be a patriotic culture. It

should  be  a dynamic force to enable the  people  to

have  a  strong sense of patriotism and to be devoted

to the country at all times.'



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think you will agree with me that this is a

very  correct  cultural policy. But the question  is,

how  are we going to promote this sort of culture  if

our  radio  and  T.V, are showing too much  unhealthy

programmes  which are romantic and erotic  and  which

have deleterious types of music? How are we to foster

a  patriotic  type of culture with these  programmes?

They  are not a dynamic force for our people. On  the

contrary,  they  have  an intoxicating  and  narcotic

effect  which will damage the morals of  our  people.

The people will be put to sleep and will not be awake

to the requirements of nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now 200,000 radio and television listeners.

The   Ministry   of   Culture  has   a   very   heavy

responsibility in promoting culture in the course  of

our   nation   building.  Many  of  our  youths   are

undergoing  military training. We  should  have  more

robust, healthy and rugged youths taking part in  our

nation  building. How are we going to make our  young

generation  a robust and rugged society if  they  are

being  shown the James Bond type of films, especially

films  which are erotic, peculiar and fantastic,  and

contain  violence, romance and sex? How are we  going

to cultivate and instil in them a sense of patriotism

and social consciousness?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the radio and television programmes

should  be changed. There should be more healthy  and

educational programmes. There should be better  types

of programmes which contain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



forums,  debates and talks. I do not  know  what  the

Minister for Culture has in view. I would like to ask

him  whether our T.V, is going to organise  and  show

films  on youth forums and organise radio forums  and

shows  which  will  enable our social  and  political

leaders  and  those in educational  circles  to  give

talks. These programmes would benefit our people.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as we know, radio and  television

are the media of communication between the Government

and the people. They are also forms of entertainment.

In addition, they are useful guides to our people. In

view  of  the fact that our country is in the process

of nation building, every citizen must strive towards

achieving this aim. Radio and television can play  an

important  role  in this respect.  They  can  put  on

programmes which contain plays and concerts which aim

at nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few Malay programmes on television.

Moreover, translations from non-Malay films  are  few

and  far between. The national language is encouraged

by  the Government. Every citizen should learn to use

it. It is, therefore, wise for films to be translated

into  the national language and increase the  showing

of  such  films  on  T.V. I hope  the  Ministry  will

consider  my  suggestions and improve the  radio  and

television programmes in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a notice of

amendment No. (2)*. I think I can take up my  subject

under  this  subhead and forgo moving  amendment  No. (2).



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (2) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1006.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of what I want to say will be underlining the

observations  of the Member for Sembawang.  Generally

speaking, Sir, I think the Department of Broadcasting

has met the leisure needs of the people in television

viewing. Human preferences are multitudinous  and  so

varied that I think it is impossible to satisfy every

viewer. But what appears to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



the  case  is  that  the Broadcasting  Department  is

pleasing  a  large number of people  with  programmes

like   crime   thrillers  and  associated  programmes

containing no small measure of violence. I think this

is  worrying.  It  becomes  extraordinarily  worrying

because  at the time when I was applying my  mind  to

this  problem, there was reported in our local  press

the  case of Mary and Nomar who were alleged to  have

strangled  a  five-year old in a county  in  England.

Then   in  one  of  our  local  cinemas,  the  Boston

Strangler  was  "let  loose".  All  this   was   also

reminiscent of the assault on a residence in  my  own

constituency in the style and tradition of The F.B.I.

series. I think this calls for some thinking  in  the

department.  I  wonder if there  is  any  sort  of  a

research  unit  in  the Department  .of  Broadcasting

which  is constantly applying its efforts to  try  to

satisfy  the great number of television viewers  with

programmes   much  more  congenial  and   much   less

frightening. I believe that if some effort is applied

in  this direction, it is possible to devise a  means

by which we can try to satisfy our television viewers

in a happier manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter which I wish to raise under this

subhead  is censorship of publications and  films.  I

think it is being carried out by this Ministry. In so

far  as  censorship of publications is  concerned,  I

would  like  to  know who constitutes  the  censoring

body.  What is the extent of layman participation  in

it? What is the proportion of laymen and professional

men  in the censoring body? Are there also laymen  in

the censoring body of film censorship?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to round off my observations, Sir, I come back

to   the   Broadcasting  Department.  I  think   this

Department should be aware that we have already  bulk

unemployment, and as time goes on it will increase in

size.  Whatever efforts have been undertaken by  this

medium  -  it  is a most powerful medium  indeed  -an

attempt  should be made to inculcate in our people  a

sense  of  positivism. This is going  to  be  a  tall

order.  I do not know how they are going to go  about

it.  If  this  medium can inculcate in our  people  a

sense of positivism instead of a sense



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



of negativism, a sense of confidence in their ability

to  look after their position in life, it might  help

to  make them more creative individually. They  would

adopt  a  brighter outlook towards life, and be  more

confident,  instead of reacting to  life  negatively.

The short outcome of it all is that it will invoke in

them  a very positivistic attitude. I certainly  hope

the  Broadcasting  Department  will  look  into  this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, much of the criticism levelled  at  the

Ministry  of  Culture  is aimed at  the  Broadcasting

Department. I think it would be useful to Members  if

I  were to give a brief description of the activities

which we are carrying on in the Broadcasting Division

of the Ministry of Culture. In fact, for the last six

months  most  of  our attention and energy  has  been

concentrated in reorganising this division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary task of the Broadcasting Division is to

introduce  dynamic  leadership so that  talents  both

from  within and from without can be fully  utilised.

This   calls   for   administrative  and   structural

reorganisation  and  the Broadcasting  Division  was,

therefore,  raised to the status of a Ministry,  with

its  own  Permanent Secretary and its own Ministerial

administrative machinery.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has enabled the division to act more quickly

and   effectively  in  the  past  six   months.   The

conversion of the department into a Ministry has been

completed  in a very short period of time.  With  the

new status, the division is able to plan and put into

execution a number of desirable projects as  well  as

modifying old ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the obvious projects was the extension of

both  radio and television broadcasting hours.  Radio

broadcasting  hours have increased by  59  hours  per

week  and television transmissions have been extended

by  some 12 hours per week. With the arrival  of  new

equipment  expected in the early part of  next  year,

television   transmission  hours  will   be   further

extended from the planned 34



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



hours  per week to over 110 hours a week. This figure

does not include some 60 hours a week for educational

television broadcasts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project was the successful series of youth

forums  which were mentioned just now by  the  Member

for  Sembawang. These programmes give our youth their

rightful  share  of opportunities  to  speak  on  and

participate  in matters concerning our  society.  The

programmes  themselves  were  enriched  by   audience

participation. In this way, we hope to try to  instil

in  our  programmes  the  so-called  healthy  content

required by our society. Audience participation is an

important ingredient in a programme and we are  going

to   have   more   programmes  with  this   kind   of

participation so as to make them lively and enjoyable

to all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised the question of

pop songs being broadcast over radio and T.V. This is

a  subject which has been brought up year after year.

I  begin to wonder whether he is raising this subject

in order to appear a moralist. Sometimes it is rather

difficult to define what you call low-class and high-

class  music. Of course, sometimes we have love songs

and  crazy music over radio and T.V. But not all love

songs are low class. I think some classical songs are

very  good but they are also love songs. It is rather

difficult for us to define. Furthermore, we  have  to

satisfy  people  of all walks of  life.  We  have  to

satisfy  the requirements of people of different  age

groups,  people  of  different  races  and  different

language  streams.  Since radio  and  T.V, are  mass

media, we have always aimed at trying to present  our

programmes to satisfy the majority of the  people.  I

think pop songs may sometimes be necessary because it

is  simple and easy to learn. To appreciate classical

music  requires  some training and  knowledge.  Since

radio and T.V, have appeal for the masses, we have to

take  the mean and it is rather difficult for  us  to

try to define whether a song is low class or not.  It

is a matter of personal taste.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think part of the question has been answered by

the Member for Serangoon Gardens when he says that it

is  not  possible  to satisfy every  viewer.  We  are

always trying to look for new formats, and I do agree

with  him  that  the  violent films  which  sometimes

appear  on  T.V, are very damaging  to  our  younger

generation.  But  the trouble here  is  that  we  are

dependent  on syndicated films to fill  up  the  long

hours of broadcast. Since it is expensive to make our

shows  and films, we have always taken in  a  lot  of

films imported from the West. Unfortunately, most  of

these films are mainly about violence, adventures  or

sex.  But we try to minimise their effect and  reduce

the  number of hours for films of this kind.  Another

way  is to try to go into our own production of films

in a big way. In the past, we have produced operas in

Teochew,  Hokkien  and Cantonese. I understand  these

shows   have   received   widespread   support    and

enthusiasm.  This  is only an attempt  to  solve  the

problem and we are also looking into other fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has also asked

whether   there   is  any  basis  in  censorship   of

publications.   The-censorship  of  publications   is

governed  by the Undesirable Publications  Ordinance.

The  Controller of Undesirable Publications has power

to  retain publications which he thinks are objection

able  in the public interest on political, social  or

moral  grounds. The Controller acts on the advice  of

an advisory committee. The committee comprises people

from outside the Ministry, including some Members  of

Parliament.  Censor-, ship of books is considered  on

the  merits of each case and there is no blanket rule

with regard to censorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards film censorship, there is, also a Film

Appeals  Committee  which  allow  appeals  from  film

distributors. The Chairman is the Speaker  of  Parlia

ment  and  the Committee meet once a week or  once  a

month to review appeals made by film importers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I

am  glad  to  hear  the  reply by  the  Minister  for

Culture.  I  feel that if he were to  listen  to  the

Member  for  Sembawang, life would be very  dull.  My

impression  is that the Member for Sembawang  appears

to  be  deprived  of  even one iota  of  romance.  At

present,  I  find that our radio and T.V, programmes

are  very, very dull and I think a little  bit  of  a

"pep-up" might do our population a lot of good. I  am

glad  the  Minister is not listening  to  puritanical

demands by some Members. Otherwise our population  of

two million will look like the Member for Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in normal life, the usual activities of love,

romance,  violence and perhaps even  murder  are  not

unusual. If our radio and T.V. programmes are  to  be

deprived  of  these, again I say life  will  be  very

dull.  Are we going to develop two million robots  in

this  country? I feel that if the Ministry of Culture

can  have  reasonable control over more  violent  and

perhaps  sexy types of programmes, then life will  be

all   right.  We  must  not  try  to  introduce  such

puritanical standards in our population just  because

of  a  small  section of the people. Our  people  are

intelligent and wise enough to see for themselves and

think for themselves what is right and what is wrong.

So  I  hope  the Minister for Culture will allow  our

population to enjoy our radio and T.V, programmes and

not to be subjected to a lot of brainwashing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that for Chinese shows and films

that  are  being  shown  nowadays  on  T.V.,  English

subtitles be given so that they will be of some  help

to persons like me because I cannot understand a word

of  what is going on and I have no chance of enjoying

such good films.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

it  seems  that my queries have not been answered  by

the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  do not mean to steal the limelight from the Member

for Sembawang on the question of culture. There is  a

lack of advertisements for locally-produced goods  on

television.  This  is  contrary to  the  Government's

policy   of  promoting  local  industries,   imposing

tariffs on imported goods, and encouraging our people

to  buy locally-made goods. There is still a lack  of

advertisements on locally-made goods; and because  of

this, the people may not have confidence in them. The

best means of publicising the policy to the people is

to   advertise  extensively  on  television.  At  the

moment, I should say such advertisements are very few

and  I  do not know whether the Minister has  any  explanation for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not rise to

speak  on  low-class music, pop songs or anything  of

that  sort. My complaint is about the low-class films

being  televised. The Minister for Culture  has  said

just  now that the Chinese operas have received  very

good  support.  There have been complaints  about  re

showing these films many times on television. Is  the

Minister aware of this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of censorship of books and

records,  is  the  Minister aware that  many  Chinese

literature books imported from Taiwan are allowed  to

be  sold  in  the  bookshops? The  literary  classics

published  in  China  are  bad,  but  what  is   more

surprising  is  this. Someone went to Hong  Kong  and

bought some books and records on the teaching of  the

Chinese  language, but these books  were  confiscated

because  they  praised Mao Tse-tung. Of  course,  the

censorship  board  could have  expunged  the  phrases

which praised Mao Tse-tung or anybody else, but if we

in  Singapore,  having a multi-racial society  and  a

multi-lingual  system of translation  in  Parliament,

want  to learn and speak a particular language  well,

we  are  certainly not going to have Chinese teaching

manuals from a college in London. Sir, if we want our

people to study



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



more  languages and be more fluent in  their  speech,

the censorship of these manuals should be relaxed and

they  should  be censored only when they  praise  any

heroes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister give an assurance that he will look

into  the  matter  so that everyone  of  us  will  be

happier in reading these books?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  say something different. This concerns  the

dresses  of  our  women.  The  mini-skirts  they  are

wearing  are too short. It seems to me that they  are

competing  with  one another to  see  who  wears  the

shortest  mini-skirts. The day might  come  when  the

mini-skirts  will  be so short  that  there  will  be

nothing left! The Minister for Culture must look into

this  because  our society is becoming  too  "progressive".  He  should think of a way to improve  women's

dresses so that our country looks civilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Sembawang need not have

any anxiety. He is the mover of the amendment and  he

will have the last word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that

the  Member for Joo Chiat has spoken what  is  in  my

mind  on  many of the things which I may not want  to

say  in  my capacity as a Minister. I entirely  agree

with  him  when he says that the Member for Sembawang

is  a bit "square". I am sure the people in Singapore

deserve   something   lively   and   different   from

regimented-production films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Teochew, Hokkien and Cantonese operas,

we  are  trying  to put sub-titles in them,  but  the

question  is, in what language should the  sub-titles

be,  because people who speak other dialects may  not

be  able to understand a Teochew opera. So usually we

put  Chinese  sub-titles  in  Teochew  and  Cantonese

operas. The television screen is a small one  and  if

you put in the Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



sub-titles,  it  is not possible to  accommodate  the

English sub-titles as well. Fortunately, most viewers

of  Chinese opera can understand the film  when  they

watch Hokkien operas because the song content is  not

excessive  and we can therefore put in  English  sub-

titles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru asked why radio and

television have not put on advertisements  for  local

products.  The Commercial Section of the Broadcasting

Division  has  approached all  kinds  of  people  for

advertisements  and  they have  not  overlooked  this

source  of  income  from the manufacturers  of  local

products.   But   the   trouble   with   our    local

manufacturers is that they have a captive market, an-

d  knowing  that  their  products  are  protected  by

tariffs, they are in a very advantageous position  to

compete with the imported products. They therefore do

not  bother  to advertise even though we  have  given

them  special discounts for putting up advertisements

over  the radio and on television. They will have  to

change their attitude because our population is  very

brand-conscious, and if they want to be successful in

selling  their products, they will have to resort  to

this mass medium to sell them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi asked why we have repeated

telecasting low-class films on television. I  do  not

know  what he means by "low-class" films. I think  he

has  in mind the Chinese films from Hong Kong.  There

is  an  acute  shortage of Chinese films.  The  films

industry is not happy that television should  compete

with  them  because it is taking away their audience.

They  have  therefore tried to control the supply  of

Chinese  films to television. I understand that  they

have  agreed not to supply films to television  which

are less than 10 years old. This is the reason why we

have  been  telecasting all these very old films.  We

have recently solved this problem by installing a new

35  m.m, film projector and we do not have to  depend

on  16  m.m, films the supply of which is  less  than

that  of  35 m.m, films. The film industry  has  also

agreed  to co-operate with us and good films are  now

available.  I hope we can get some very good  Chinese

films on television next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaint about the importation of

books from China and Taiwan, the Publications Section

of the Ministry of Culture deals with the importation

of  books and it does not allow into Singapore  books

which are politically objectionable. Of course, there

are  many good classical books produced in China. But

of late, because of the cultural revolution in China,

I  think  almost  every book that is published  there

contains  quotations  from The Thoughts  of  Chairman

Mao.  I do not think books of this kind should be  im

ported  into  Singapore. But if they are good  books,

the  importer  can appeal and we will look  into  the

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I have to reply to the charge made

by  the  Member  for  Ulu  Pandan  about  mini-skirts

because  my  Ministry  is not in  charge  of  women's

dresses.  Fortunately,  there  is  no  censorship  of

women's dresses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai asked why there is

such   a   small   number  of  Malay  programmes   on

television.  We have a system of allocating  transmis

sion  hours  to  the  various  language  streams.  To

refresh the Member's memory, the percentages  of  the

total  transmission hours are 20  per  cent  for  the

national  language,  35  per  cent  for  the  Chinese

stream, 10 per cent for the Tamil stream and  35  per

cent  for  the English stream. Previously, Television

Singapura used to show Egyptian and Hindustani  films

with Malay subtitles against the Malay quota. It  was

thought  that  the shortage of films  for  the  Malay

programmes  could  be  met  by  using  Egyptian   and

Hindustani  films.  But in the  last  few  months,  a

change has been made. We are now using English  films

with  sub-titles  in Malay to meet the  Malay  quota.

This has met



with   an   enthusiastic  response  from  the   Malay

audience.  They prefer Western films to Egyptian  and

Hindustani  films.  The  people  of  other   language

streams are slso able to enjoy these films.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  thank  you very much for letting me have the  last

word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with what the Minister has said. I

feel that my criticism of the Ministry of Culture  is

fair.  The  Minister has said that the same  problems

are  brought up here every year. But I have to  raise

them  if  they are not solved. I cannot be complacent

about problems that are allowed to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Minister will accept the

statement of the Member for J00 Chiat that he prefers

to  see  romantic and exciting films.  I  think  such

films are not in keeping with the Government's policy

of building a rugged society.

and  I quote from Hansard Vol. 25,  No.  12,

dated 19th December, 1966, col. 908:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the fact that the national language is popular in

the  City  State, where 75 per cent of the population

are  Chinese,  is enough to show that  at  least  the

Dewan Bahasa is doing its best to encourage the study

of the national language.'



<br><br>The Minister of State for Culture added:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are now considering expanding this organisation

into   a   Research  Institute  into  Languages   and

Culture.'



<br><br>It  looks  as  if  there will be  no  change  in  the

provision for the staff and the achievements  planned

for 1969. In fact, the national language campaign has

not  been  held this year although this  has  been  a

yearly  affair.  What is the extent of  the  progress

made by the Dewan

to  be the editor of the Dewan. But even if it is not

possible  to  expect the editor, together  with  the

development of the Malay language and culture, if you

turn to page 284 of the Estimates, under the O.C.A.R.

of  the Dewan Bahasa, you will find that most of  the

been  so  for  the last few years. Under the  present

standstill Budget arrangements, it is not possible to

ask  for  extra funds unless the project is  revenue-producing, and the Dewan, unfortunately, is not  such

a  project. It is clear that we cannot expect  anyone

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following the need to build a rugged society,

the  promotion  of sports in our Republic  has  never

been  so intensive as it is today. Since the creation

of  the  Sports  Division in the Ministry  of  Social

Affairs   in  1967,  sports  activities   have   been

organised and promoted on a national basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Ministers and even some Members of Parliament

have  shown  their keenness in sports  activities  by

taking  an  active part as presidents of sports  orga

nisations.   However,  I  note   with   regret   that

badminton, which is popular among our young citizens,

has  been  somewhat neglected by the  Government  and

civic  organisations.  There  has  so  far  been   no

organised effort to revive it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, therefore, seek information from the Minister

for  Social  Affairs as to whether a  plan  has  been

drawn  up  to train our young enthusiasts  to  become

potential players of international standard?  If  so,

how  many  trainees are there and how often  do  they

train?  Can  the Minister also inform the House  when

these trainees are expected to come out into the open

and compete in international tournaments in order  to

win back the coveted Thomas Cup?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Member for Mountbatten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that sports play a very important part

in  the building of a rugged society in our Republic.

Sports  activities make our youths physically strong,

tenacious  and  well disciplined. Therefore,  we  lay

great emphasis on the promotion of sports activities.

But  we  neglect to train the athletes who  represent

our country in international sports events. It is not

just  a  simple  matter to build  a  rugged  society.

Basically  the  problem lies in how to encourage  the

people to take an interest in sports.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, of course, we must have suitable playgrounds

for  them in which to train and compete. If  we  have

these two conditions, then we can call the people  to

participate  more  positively  in  sports.  In  other

countries, athletes compete in international  events,

and the gaining of national glory for the state is an

invaluable asset. But the important point with regard

to our national athletes is whether the Government is

making an effort to train them in order to show  that

it  is  encouraging an interest in sports,  and  also

whether  we  are  giving enough  attention  to  these

athletes  to show that the Government is appreciative

of  their efforts. We are trying to promote a  rugged

society,  but  I am afraid we are not paying  enough

attention  to these national athletes and  sportsmen.

We  all  know that it takes a long period of training

for  an  athlete or sportsman to reach  the  required

high standard when he can represent our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



national team. The training is very rigorous.  Herein

lies the problem. Should the Government encourage and

train  them  or  should  they  themselves  take   the

initiative  and train on their own? When I  refer  to

athletes,  I, of course, refer to those athletes  who

represent Singapore. Our athletes are left  to  their

own  initiative and devices to train themselves. They

do  not have the necessary equipment or apparatus for

their  training.  They do not also  have  sufficient

time. Most of them are employed. If you want to train

them  after they have returned from work, you  cannot

expect  much result from such training. How then  are

we going to raise their standards?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like the Minister to

take  note  of is that certain athletes do  not  even

have  a  proper  job. For example,  the  Volley  Ball

Association has three of its members who  have  given

up  their training because of the need to look for  a

job. They have recently taken on jobs as sailors  and

have left the country. This is a waste of talent  and

a  loss  to  our  country.  These  three  volley-ball

players  have  all  the necessary qualifications  and

capability to be trained as excellent athletes. I  am

not  suggesting that the state should feed and clothe

them.  It is beyond our means to do so. But  what  we

should do is to engage these athletes in the task  of

nation  building.  They can very well  become  sports

instructors  in  the  Ministry of  the  Interior  and

Defence.  They  have the necessary qualifications  to

become sports instructors. If they have the necessary

academic  qualifications, the Government should  give

them  better treatment. By doing so, the people  will

respond  and- take part in sports and other  athletic

events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to touch upon is the question

of  playing  fields and training grounds.  We  should

have  better training grounds and other training faci

lities.  I do not mean that we should have  an  ideal

training ground and build a grand sports complex.  In

any  case, we should at least build an indoor  sports

stadium with training facilities. Situated as we  are

in a tropical country -

concerned  that Madam Chan, who did not  speak  under

the  head  Ministry of Culture, should  not  miss  an

opportunity to speak under this head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for

reminding me, Mr Speaker. I would like to sum up  my

observations. I hope the Minister will pay  attention

to  the  need for an indoor sports stadium. It should

be  a  multipurpose stadium with training  facilities

for all kinds of sports.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the point raised

by  the Member for Mountbatten regarding badminton in

the  Republic, I am pleased to inform the House  that

Mr  Wong Peng Soon, four times All-England Badminton

Champion,  has been employed by the Government  since

January  this  year to select and  train  a  national

badminton squad to compete in the next Thomas Cup  in

1969.  He  has selected seven players to  be  in  the

squad  based  on their age, skill and performance  at

competitions.  These seven members  have  since  June

this  year  been  undergoing  serious  and  strenuous

training  five nights every week from  6.30  p.m. to 11.00 p.m.

This intensive training is to ensure  that

the squad is fully fit by the time it competes in the

next Thomas Cup series. The members of the squad  are

not  paid any allowances for their training. But  the

Sports Promotion Division has made arrangements  with

their  employers for the players to leave  office  at 3.30  p.m.

every day of the week to enable  them  to

practise. In addition, the players are provided  with

badminton  shoes, socks, beverages,  cod  liver  oil,

vitamins and refreshments. These are articles donated

by  commercial firms who are interested in  Singapore

making  an  impression in the next Thomas Cup  games.

Arrangements have also been made with the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



Education for the squad to be given exclusive use  of

the Victoria School gymnasium for their training.  To

see  that the squad is physically fit to undergo  the

training, regular checks are made on them by a  panel

of three doctors who have volunteered their services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wong has also recommended that the national badminton squad should, at the appropriate time, be sent abroad to take part in international matches to give them the necessary experience and match temperament so that they will be fully attuned when they take part in the next Thomas Cup series.

Arrangements are being made for them to go on a  tout

to   play  matches  in  Japan,  Cambodia,  Burma  and

Thailand in April or May next year, after which  they

will  be  ready to compete in the Australian zone  of

the Thomas Cup series in 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the point that was raised by the Member for Paya

Lebar,  I  would  like to inform the House  that  the

active  encouragement of sports and games as part  of

the policy of creating a physically rugged society in

the  Republic has resulted in numerous requests being

made  by  sports  organisations to  help  members  of

national  teams to enable them to keep up with  their

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Promotion Division has assisted sportsmen

in  one  way or another, such as obtaining unrecorded

leave from their employers, time-off for training an-

d  also free medical attention. For those members who

are  unemployed, arrangements have also been made  to

get  them suitable jobs. Since the beginning of  this

year,  jobs  have  been found for a  few  outstanding

athletes, basket-ball  players,  football   players,

badminton  players, cyclists and, I believe,  volley-

ball  players, too, in the private sector and in  the

statutory  bodies.  If the three volley-ball  players

are  still unemployed at the moment, I should be very

grateful  if the Member could forward their names  to

me and I will do my best to help them get employment.

Also with the active promotion of sports in the armed

forces,  it  is expected that some good sportsmen  in

the national teams may be recruited into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



the  police and military services. For instance, they

could be instructors, as the Member has said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the building of more closed stadiums

for games, such as volley-ball, table tennis, etc., I

am  glad to inform the Member that there is provision

in  the  National Sports Complex at Kallang  for  the

building of an indoor stadium where such games can be

staged.  It  may be air-conditioned.  This  is  being

looked  into  - if money is available.  Besides,  the

Member will be aware of the facilities that are  also

available in the halls of the numerous schools  built

in Singapore where such indoor games can be played.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I thank the Minister for the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr L.

P. Rodrigo -

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1171.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to speak on the Legal Aid Bureau

and put certain suggestions to the Minister. From the

name  of  this Bureau, I presume that its aim  is  to

render  legal aid to poor people who cannot otherwise

afford to obtain professiona1 legal advice. I do  not

know  how  many  cases have been dealt  with  by  the

Bureau  every year and I do not know how  many  have

been  solved.  I am of the view that this  Bureau  is

spending quite a lot of Government money but its work

is not satisfactory. It has come to my knowledge that

this Bureau



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



has  not been able to render legal aid to poor people

generally. On the contrary, it has been made  use  of

by  lawyers for their own administrative convenience.

Take  the instance of a lawyer who takes up the  case

of  a  client and he is not able to get the necessary

evidence.  If  this  evidence  is  deposited  in  the

Bureau, the client will be asked to go to the  Bureau

to  seek  legal  aid. The Bureau will say  that  they

cannot act on his behalf. But if he wants to get  cer

tain  documents or records, he will be  able  to  get

them from the Bureau and, having got them, he will go

back to the lawyer. This lawyer will then be able  to

make use of the documents on behalf of his client  in

court.  The client is not poor and yet it turns  out

the Legal Aid Bureau has rendered help to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But poor people who really need legal aid are not

given  aid  at all. I have come across  a  case  like

this.  In  my  constituency, there is a certain  area

where  Malays live. Previously this area was part  of

Queenstown  Constituency. But after the redelineation

of electoral boundaries, this area has come within my

constituency.  The Malays who live in this  area  are

subtenants  and the houses are owned by rich  people.

The rent is $30 for a partitioned house and there are

about  20  families living in every house. There  are

more than ten houses of this type.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, we have only three minutes

more  and if you want a reply from the Minister,  you

will have to stop.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, Sir, I

will cut it short. Not long ago, the Malays living in

this  area  received  notices to  quit  within  three

months.  If  they  did  not  quit,  their  water  and

electricity  supply would be cut. When I raised  this

matter  with  the  Legal  Aid Bureau,  the  officials

promised  to  help  them. However, after  nearly  two

months,  no  news was heard about this case.  I  made

several inquiries and yet no satisfactory answer  was

given,  with  the result that the landlord  has  been

able  to  persuade the Malays to move out  by  giving

each family only a small sum of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



money as compensation. These Malays have asked me  to

approach  the Housing Board to get alternative  accommodation for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that this Bureau is riot able to

help  the poor people who are really in need of legal

aid.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, to answer briefly the

questions raised by the Member for Delta. The  number

of  applications  dealt with by the  Bureau  for  the

years 1961 to 1st December this year averages 2,400 a

year. I do not have the figure for cases solved.  But

the  monies  recovered on behalf  of  the  applicants

range from $130,000 in 1961 to $371,000 in 1967. From

this,  Sir,  you can see that many of the cases  have

been solved. Whatever money has to be recovered,  has

been recovered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last point about Malays living in the Delta

area,  if the Member can give me more particulars,  I

will certainly attend to this case.

<br><br>7.11 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns children's centres and

creches.  The last time I raised a question  in  this

House  concerning extending the hours of  service  of

creches, the Minister for Social Affairs said that he

was  not prepared to do so. I would like to say  that

in  the  daytime  these creches are mainly  used  for

children  whose  mothers  are  working.  But  in  the

evening  the  women folk will not have  the  time  to

engage  in  community activities.  Because  of  their

financial  difficulties, they  cannot  engage  house-

maids  to  look after their children. And  when  the

husband  goes to work, the wife will have to stay  at

home  and look after the children. This may be  quite

unfair.  As  such, women are not able to go  out  and

take  part in community activities. Since the creches

are empty in the evening, it would be a good idea  if

we  could extend the hours of service of creches  so

that  mothers  can have more time  to  take  part  in

community  activities.  This will  not  endanger  the

relationship between the children and their mothers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we can employ more people if

the  hours  of service of creches are extended.  This

will  contribute  towards the solution  of  our  unemployment problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point concerns the instructors in these

creches.   As   far  as  I  know,  ever   since   the

establishment of children's centres and creches,  the

method of supervision and the equipment used in these

creches  have  not  been ideal. The instructors  have

been using English to deal with the children. Most of

the  reading material is mainly in English.  This  is

not  quite in harmony with our efforts to promote the

use of a second language.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These children will be deprived of the opportunity

to  familiarise  themselves with the second  language

and this may cause them some difficulties later on. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



hope  the Parliamentary Secretary will reply  to  the

questions I have raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is of the opinion that it is not

possible  to  extend  the hours  of  service  of  the

creches  because of some technical problems,  perhaps

he  may  consider whether the women's section of  the

community  centres can make use of  the  creches  for

working mothers in the evenings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  shall  speak  briefly  about   the

creches.  They  were only set up after  the  People's

Action Party came to power. Their establishment is in

line  with our policy of democratic socialism to look

after  the  poorer people, and those who are  working

can leave their children in the creches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two points to raise on this matter. Firstly,

the  creches  are  not widespread  because  they  are

situated in the urban areas only. I would like to ask

the  Parliamentary Secretary whether  the  Government

plans to build creches in the rural areas. There  are

many  women folk in the rural areas who go  to  work,

and their children lack their personal attention.  If

the  Government can build creches in the rural areas,

they will be helping the people because they can send

their children there when they go to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that I have received complaints

about  the  food  served in the  creches.  In  recent

years,  the  food has been reduced in quantity.  This

will  adversely affect the health of the children.  I

hope the Minister will look into this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I support the motion of the Member for Delta. In

certain  industrial areas such as .Jurong and Tanglin

Halt,  the women folk usually go to work. No  creches

have  been built there. I would suggest that  creches

be built there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the children in the creches should also

be taught various languages. The Member for Delta has

mentioned  that the medium of instruction  is  solely

English. In our efforts to promote multi-lingualism,

we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



instruct the children in other languages as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the suggestion made by

the  Member  for  Sembawang that  we  should  set  up

creches  in  the rural areas, because the rural  folk

are  financially worse off than those  in  the  urban

areas. Also they have more children. I feel there  is

a  need  to build creches for the children  of  these

people in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me thank the  Members

who have spoken on the creches. Thus, they have given

publicity  to  the availability of  creches  and  the

people  will know that they can leave their  children

in the creches when they go to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, we held a press conference during

which  we  mentioned the services  that  the  creches

could  provide. But many parents still  do  not  send

their  children to the creches when they go to  work.

Many of the creches are quite empty and some are  not

full  up.  So  when  Members raise  the  question  of

creches  in  this House, it will serve to inform  the

public of the services provided by the creches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have criticised the services provided by the

creches, for example, shortage of food, etc. I  would

like to assure Members that if their allegations  are

correct,  then we will take the necessary  action  to

improve the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to languages used at the creches, I agree

that  we  should also provide opportunities  for  the

children  to  learn other languages than English.  In

the  past, most of the officials in the creches  have

been  educated  in  English and so  we  have  to  use

English  as the medium of instruction. Since  Members

have expressed their views on this point, we will try

our  best to rectify the situation. But speaking from

the   administrative  point  of  view,  we  have   no

alternative  but to carry on using English,  but,  in

other  aspects,  we may use other languages  or  even

dialects.  In fact, many dialects are spoken  because

the children in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



creches come from various races an-d an Indian may be

able to speak Hokkien. During the youth festival,  we

were  able  to  see on television children  of  other

races performing Chinese traditional dances and  vice

versa.  Our  policy  in educating these  children  is

therefore  based  on  multi-lingualism  and   multi-racialism.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give some figures about the teachers

in   the   creches.   Of  the   10   assistant   lady

superintendents, five are educated in Chinese and two

are  educated in both Chinese and English. Of the  16

instructors in charge of the children's centres, nine

are  educated in both Chinese and English.  The  term

"Chinese"  also includes dialects such as  Cantonese,

Hainanese,  Hokkien, etc. Some of them  are  able  to

speak  Indian and Tamil. Of the 51 assistant  instruc

tors  working in the creches and children's  centres,

32  are educated in Chinese and seven are educated in

both Chinese and English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have sufficient books produced locally for

the children to read. It is regrettable that there is

a  shortage of locally-produced books for reading. As

long  as  the  contents of the books are healthy  and

educative to the children and not pernicious  to  our

policy  of patriotism an-d nationalism, they  can  be

used  in  the creches. It does not matter where  they

are produced. Books which provide lessons in singing,

-dancing  and  handicraft are useful to the  children

and  we have seen the works of these children in  the

various exhibitions held so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of quantity of food, the decision

rests  with  the experts. If they are of the  opinion

that  the quantity of food is insufficient, they will

look  into it. I think Members should not worry about

this  because almost all the children in the  creches

have  very fat and round faces. This shows that  they

are healthy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the suggestion that more creches

should be set up in the rural areas. The setting  up

of  creches in the industrial areas is logical.  Many

workers  in  the lower income group are  employed  in

industries. It is a good suggestion that they can put

their  children in creches while they go to  work  in

the  day-time. As I have said, creches have not  been

extensively used. But I will look into the matter  if

there is a greater need for creches in the rural  and

industrial areas.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The

Parliamentary Secretary has not answered one  of  the

points I have raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am sorry I

forgot to reply to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta said a few days ago that the

creches  should remain open in the evenings. In  many

socialist  countries  where the children  are  looked

after  by  the  state, a somewhat  cold  relationship

develops  between  the parents  and  their  children.

Therefore,  it is better that the creches  should  be

closed  in the evenings so that the children  can  go

home to their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta made a good suggestion that

some  members of the women's section of the community

centres   should   serve   in   the   creches.    But

consideration should be given to whether the  creches

are extensively used. If only seven or eight children

make  use  of a creche, there is no point in adopting

her suggestion. But I will consider her suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1102 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1151.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your leave, I would also like to range

over  my  next  amendment No.  (3) *  in  relation  to

subhead 1152 which comes under "Public Assistance Sec

tion". During last year's debate on the Estimates  in

Committee of Supply, I raised a certain point  and  I

was  told  that the matter could be referred  to  the

Minister  for  action. One year has now  elapsed  and

there is still no action yet. Therefore, I am raising

this  point again this year. I hope the Minister will

do  something in respect of the points I  am  raising

and  give  sympathetic consideration to the voice  of

the poor people.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (3) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1102 be reduced by $10 in rspect of subhead 1152.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, our people are self-respecting. It

is only when they have no other alternative that they

go  to  the  Public  Assistance  Section  for  public

assistance.  There are many kinds of  people  in  the

world. There are well-off people who shamelessly seek

public   assistance.  I  will,  therefore,  ask   the

Minister to reassess the situation so that the  names

of those who are not in need of public assistance can

be struck off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention the case of some recipients

of  public assistance. In my constituency, there  are

widows  with seven or eight children who are neglected  when their mothers go to work. When these mothers

are  unable  to  maintain their families,  they  seek

public assistance. If an applicant is suffering  from

tuberculosis or a disability, he gets more, otherwise

he  gets $40 a month. The expenditure of a family  of

eight  living in an attap house is smaller than  that

of  a similar family who are required to resettle  in

Housing  Board flats. Although the rent of a  Housing

Board  flat is only about $20 a month, such a  family

may  find it difficult to make ends meet as they have

to pay an additional $10 or $20 a month for water and  electricity. So some members of the household take

in  washing and earn about $10 or $15 a month. But if

the  inspectors of the Public Assistance Section find

out  that they are getting an additional income  from

other sources,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



the   amount  of  money  that  they  get  as   public

assistance will be cut the following month. When this

happens,  they  come sorrowfully  to  our  "meet-the-people  sessions" and the only thing that we  can  do

for them is to approach the Public Assistance Section

and  plead on their behalf. The difficulty of the pro

blem  lies  in  the  policy of the Public  Assistance

Section  which  stops paying public assistance  to  a

family  that  is  earning  an  additional  income.  I

personally think this is wrong because such  families

are  not getting sufficient public assistance. So  we

should  give them sympathetic consideration. But,  of

course,  if a recipient family is earning  more  than

$100 a month, their public assistance can be cut off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give sympathetic

consideration to this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we know that fleece is got from a sheep. So if we are

millionaires, we can say, "I will give you as much as

you want." But in the final analysis, the money comes

from the taxes paid by the people. Of course, we have

good  intentions, but we must face realities. We  all

know  that  the Minister for Finance has given  us  a

certain  sum of money. If we are going to give  money

to  anyone  who claims that he is in -dire  need,  we

will  not  be  able  to  fulfil  our  obligations.  I

remember on one occasion the Minister gave $10  to  a

person   at  a  "meet-the-people  session"  when   he

complained  that  he was in dire straits.  Very  soon

afterwards, many people came for similar requests.  I

sympathise  with what the Member for Delta  has  said

regarding the plight of the poor people, that because

of the inability of the Government to give sufficient

public  assistance some members of a family  have  to

take in washing to earn an additional income and that

this  may result in a cut in their public assistance.

The  Public Assistance Section is in charge of public

money.  Although we have to help the poor people,  at

times



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



they may not be satisfied with what they get. This is

a  fact of life. However, the officials in the Public

Assistance  Section  treat  all  cases  fairly.   The

Minister  once  asked the assessors and investigators

to  give instructions to them, because there had been

some incidents -

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Member has suggested that I should deal with this

matter  thoroughly. I cannot promise this.  If  there

are  cases where we can help, of course, we  will  be

glad  to  do so. If we cannot do it, then it is  just

impossible to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1103 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1103 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that there is a tremendous increase in

the  amount for this vote for the next financial year

as  compared  with the provision for  last  year.  As

explained  in  the  Memorandum on  the  Estimates  of

Revenue and Expenditure, the increase is due  to  the

payment  of  rental of all the fire hydrants  in  the

Republic to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



Public  Utilities Board. From now on theP.U.B, will

be responsible for the installation of new

hydrants and for the maintenance of existing ones as

well as for the cost of water supply to

these  fivehydrants. Sir, our Fire Brigade is known

to be among the best equipped -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> It is the best!

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Yes, it is the best equipped. It

is  the  most efficient Fire Brigade in this part  of

the  world.  Yet,  many people in  Singapore  do  not

appreciate its excellent and efficient service.  They

often blame it for not being able to control the  big

fires that broke out in certain slum areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, you will have to speed up a

little.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I wish to refute this

allegation. I contend that if it had not been for the

efficiency  of  the Fire Brigade, the  fires  in  the

squatter areas would have affected the adjacent built-up  and developed areas. It must be admitted  that

fire  fighting  in  certain slum areas  is  extremely

difficult  because  of  the  congestion  of  squatter

houses and the lack of fire fighting facilities, such

as  fire  hydrants. The recent fire at Bukit Ho  Swee

nearly  threatened  a  block of Housing  Board  flats

which were adjacent to the area under fire. The Fire

Brigade was able to check the fire from spreading  to

the  adjacent developed areas. Therefore, I  wish  to

pay a tribute to the Fire Brigade and its members for

their high efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with fire hydrants, may I ask -

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid we have reached

"guillotine"  time.  As  the Question  has  not  been

proposed, no question of withdrawal arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,650,160 for Head 1103 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1104 -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1104 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 1301.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak on the Industrial Manager of

Prison Industries. I have some suggestions to make on

this  subhead.  It  is  important  that  agricultural

knowledge  should  be imparted to  prisoners  serving

their sentences. Most of the prisoners' time is spent

in  acquiring  industrial know-how. This  is  a  good

policy  on the part of the Prison Department. We  can

train people in industrial know-how to cope with  our

industrialisation programme. However, although  these

prisoners  have  committed  offences,  we  hope  that

during  the time that they spend in prison they  will

acquire  certain knowledge and skills. Most of  these

prisoners  are  secret society members.  They  landed

themselves  in prison because they had no jobs.  They

were  forced  to  extort money from people  and  they

committed  other  crimes. In prison  they  should  be

given  an  opportunity to acquire  a  skill  in  some

trade.  I have a suggestion. As far as I know,  these

prisoners are now acquiring a knowledge of industrial

know-how.  They are learning only the  basic  skills.

Since  we  are going to spend so much money  on  this

item,  the  Prison  Department should  see  that  the

prisoners  are given proper training in the acquiring

of  technical  skills. The goods which  they  produce

should  also be put up for sale in shops outside  the

prison.  This  will encourage them  to  acquire  more

skill  and  knowledge and thereby earn  more  income.

They can make better use of their leisure time during

their  term  of imprisonment. They will thus  discard

their  bad habits and ways. This is a kind of reform.

It  is  not  necessary to mete out any punishment  in

order to reform them. Their leisure time can be taken

up with the acquiring of technical skill in trade and

industry.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, briefly, our

prisoners are being trained in various types of jobs.

We  have  gone  beyond  the original  concept  of  re

habilitating  them.  The prison industries  in  which

they   are  being  trained  today  provide  not  only

suitable vocations for their rehabilitation, but also

substantial revenue and savings to Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a few examples of the types of jobs they

are  doing  while  they are serving their  sentences.

They  are  trained in the following trades:  laundry,

wood-work  assembly and machine shop, cane  workshop,

tailoring   workshop,   printing   and   book-binding

workshop,  timber seasoning, foot-wear,  leather  and

upholstery  workshop,  metal workshop,  concrete  and

cement   workshop   and  other  miscellaneous   light

industries.  Some  of  the  articles  made  by  these

prisoners are supplied to Government departments  and

others   are   sold  to  the  public.  These   prison

industries  last year earned $701,000,  which  is  an

increase  of  $423,000 compared with the earnings  of

1956, which amounted to $278,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the Member for Delta that the prisoners

will  be  able  to  seek employment when  they  leave

prison   after  they  have  served  their  sentences,

because they will have been trained in some trades.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is now eight o'clock. Moment of

interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report

that   the  Committee  of  Supply  has  made  further

progress  on  the  Estimates of Expenditure  for  the

financial  year  1st January, 1969,  to  31st  March,

1970, and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.
