<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have to inform the House that the

Clerk  of  Parliament received a letter dated 24th July  2001

from  the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court stating  that

the  Court of Appeal has on 23rd July 2001 dismissed Mr  J  B

Jeyaretnam's  appeal  against the Order  of  Bankruptcy  made

against him on 19th January 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sought the advice of the Attorney-General

whether, in view of the decision of the Court of Appeal  that

the  appeal  be  dismissed, the seat of the  Non-Constituency

Member of Parliament has become vacant with effect from  23rd

July  2001 under Article 46(2)(e) of the Constitution of  the

Republic of Singapore.  The Attorney-General has on 24th July

2001 given his advice which reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I advise that the seat of Mr J B Jeyaretnam as a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament has become vacant by virtue

of Article 46(2)(e) of the Constitution."

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>FINANCE COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Wider role)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  he  will allow finance companies to assume  a  wider

role  if the result of bank mergers limits the access of  the

small and medium-sized enterprises to financial services.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, finance companies are already active lenders to

small  and medium enterprises (SMEs).  For the larger finance

companies,  a  significant portion of their total  loans  are

extended  to  SMEs.  MAS has also given well-managed  finance

companies  greater leeway to offer other services which  will

benefit  all their customers, including SMEs.  These  include

the  issuing of corporate purchasing cards, and the  granting

of  IPO  financing  and secured syndicated loans  subject  to

conditions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

MAS  consider  allowing finance companies to assume  a  wider

range  of  services such as corporate advisory and  financial

advisory  services, something which the banks are undertaking

at the moment but which they may not be inclined to extend to

small  and  medium  enterprises on account  of  the  lack  of

economy of scale in respect of these enterprises?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not

considered  this.  We will have to look at it very  carefully

because advisory services are different from lending.  One is

commercial  banking where you assess credit risk;  the  other

one is advisory service which is merchant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



banking where you have to judge the market and advise how  to

restructure  a deal in order to bring it to market  and  find

investors  who are willing to invest in it.   So  I  think  I

would be careful about that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in this House previously, I do not

believe that the banks will now neglect the SMEs because they

have  consolidated.  The SMEs are an important part of  their

customer base and they will want to keep them.

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE BUS OPERATORS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Operation of feeder bus services)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology  if  his  Ministry

will  consider allowing private bus operators or a consortium

of  such  operators  to operate intra new  towns  feeder  bus

services on a throughout-the-day basis.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Communications

and  Information Technology when his Ministry  will  complete

the  review  on introducing private bus operators to  further

improve bus services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have

your permission to take Question Nos. 2 and 3 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I stated in the House a

fortnight  ago, my Ministry and PTC are keeping an open  mind

on  the  issue  of  enhancing competition.  We  will  examine

whether  we  should allow private operators  to  operate  new

feeder  services  in  new  towns,  and  if  so,  under   what

circumstances  and conditions.  The study will  take  several

months,  and PTC will announce the outcome when the study  is

completed.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> May I ask the Minister

whether  the viewpoints of the commuters and the private  bus

operators will be solicited in his review?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we are in touch with the

private bus operators and we would definitely take the  views

of  the  public  into  consideration in the  context  of  the

overall framework of the public transport system.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Can I ask the Minister whether he foresees

there  would be more private bus operators in the scene?   In

short,  what I am asking the Minister is whether he  foresees

that  there would be additional bus operators coming  to  the

scene.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we will have to await the

outcome of the study.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD RETAILERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Termination of leases and change of use of shops)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development,  for the period 1998-2000, (a) how many  Housing

and  Development  Board (HDB) retailers  had  (i)  terminated

their leases; (ii) requested for change of use of their shops

and  were  approved;  and (b) how does  this  change  of  use

benefit residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB shop tenants can exit from the retail

trade  either  by terminating their tenancy with  HDB  or  by

assigning  their  tenancy  to  another  operator.    As   for

shopkeepers who own their HDB shops, they can exit  from  the

retail  trade  by  selling their shops in  the  open  market.

Every  year, about 5% of HDB shopkeepers exit from the retail

trade  through  one of these means.  Between 1998  and  2000,

there were about 800 terminations, 1,200 assignments and  500

resale cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB also allows shopkeepers to change the use of their

shops,  except  in cases where the conversion  is  likely  to

cause  disamenities to HDB residents.  Between 1998 and 2000,

HDB  gave approval for 600 shop tenants and lessees to change

the  use  of  their shops.  This figure suggests that  on  an

annual  basis, about 1% of HDB retailers change  the  use  of

their shops.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flexible change of use policy will enable HDB

shopkeepers to respond more swiftly to the changing needs  of

HDB  residents.   Over  time,  this  will  create  a  vibrant

commercial environment in HDB estates, which will result in a

wider  variety  of goods and services at competitive  prices.

This will definitely benefit HDB residents.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

whether  or  not HDB will allow the change of use  to  eating

houses, and also whether HDB will control the tenant  mix  of

the neighbourhood?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as far as changing of use to

eating  houses  is  concerned, as I have  said  earlier,  the

change  of  use  will only be allowed if it  does  not  cause

disamenity to residents.  In this particular case, HDB  feels

that  change  of  use  to an eating house  will  create  more

disturbance,  more  disamenity, more noise  nuisance  to  the

residents.   Therefore, they will not allow this.   But  they

will  allow change of use to snack shops and take-away  shops

which will deal with take-away food.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the second question is concerned, whether

HDB  will control the tenant mix, the answer is that  in  the

case  of  new  towns or new neighbourhood centres  where  the

tenant   mix  has  not  yet  settled,  where  the  commercial

environment has not yet settled, HDB will not allow a  change

in the tenant mix for the first three years.  But thereafter,

when  the  commercial environment has settled down, HDB  will

allow  freely  a  change of use, subject  of  course  to  the

conditions that were stated earlier.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD SHOPKEEPERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increase of rentals)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether  he  will  reconsider  the  increase  of

rentals for HDB shopkeepers in view of the plight of the  HDB

retailers and the present economic downturn.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the increase in HDB

shop  rentals  is part of an ongoing exercise since  1988  to

equalise  the rentals for similar shop premises so  that  all

shopkeepers  operate  on  a level-playing  field.   Over  the

years,  a disparity in rent has arisen because some HDB  shop

tenants  are old resettlement cases, paying highly subsidised

rates  while  other tenants have obtained their  premises  by

tender, paying market rents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To moderate the impact on tenants who have been paying

subsidised   rents,  HDB  staggered  the  rental  adjustments

towards  prevailing  market rate over four  renewals,  at  3-yearly  intervals,  in other words, over  a  12-year  period,

starting from 1988.  The implementation was also carried  out

in  phases.  Tenants who are renewing their tenancies for the

4th time this year were converted to the 3-year fixed tenancy

in 1989.  They had their tenancies renewed for the first time

in  1992  and the second time in 1995.  At each renewal,  the

rental increases were capped at 30% of existing rents.   When

the  tenancies were renewed for the third time in  1998,  the

rents   were  raised  to  75%  of  market  rate.   The  final

adjustments to market rents are taking place now, at the  4th

renewal  of their tenancies.  Some rents have been increased,

while others have been maintained or reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By moving all tenants gradually towards the appropriate

market rates, HDB ensures that all shopkeepers compete  on  a

level-playing  field.  This is only fair to all  shopkeepers.

However,   recognising   the   present   difficult   economic

conditions, HDB will be enhancing the rental rebates for  all

its  commercial and industrial tenants across-the-board.  The

rebates  will  provide some relief to all HDB  shop  tenants,

including  those  whose  rents  are  being  adjusted  upwards

towards market rate.  The details of HDB's rebates will be in

the  package of measures to be announced by the Minister  for

Trade and Industry in his Ministerial Statement shortly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to declare that I am a lessee of an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to pose three questions to the

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether the recent efforts to

assist  HDB  shop  retailers in their predicaments  would  be

defeated  by  the adjustments of HDB rentals  to  the  market

rates?   May  I ask whether the market rates that  are  being

used as benchmarks for the present rental adjustments reflect

the  prevailing economic climate?  And also may I ask whether

the  present method of assessing the market rates,  based  on

recent HDB lettings, is a fair practice?  Because it has been

known  that  many novice and enthusiastic new lessees  always

tender higher prices and be successful at such prices that do

not conform to the prevailing rentals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, let me take the last question

first which pertains to the method of assessing market rates.

What  are  the so-called market rates, are they  fair  market

rates   -   I  think  that  is the  thrust  of  the  Member's

question.

What  HDB  does is that it appoints a panel of  valuers,  and

these  are private sector valuers, these are not HDB valuers,

to  assess the market rates based on, first, the rentals that

have  been tendered in the area, but also taking into account

the  specific location of the shop, the micro location of the

shop,  the orientation of the shop, the traffic of the  shop,

the  size  of  the shop, and so on.  So in this respect,  the

fair  market  rate that HDB uses to adjust the rentals  is  a

result of professional judgement on the part of this panel of

valuers.  I think the Member would realise that valuation  is

not  an  exact  science, there is a judgement involved.   But

that judgement is exercised by professionals and is exercised

independent of HDB.  HDB will then take that value and use it

as a market benchmark rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if a tenant is not satisfied with that

rate?   He  has recourse to several avenues of  appeal.   The

first  avenue  of  appeal is HDB itself.  He  can  defer  the

signing  of the tenancy agreement pending an appeal  to  HDB.

HDB will then assess the merits of that appeal and decide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



accordingly.  If HDB's decision on that appeal is  still  not

satisfactory, the tenant has recourse to another avenue which

is  the  Chief Valuer himself.  The Chief Valuer is of course

the Government's valuer and his judgement can be taken as  an

independent   judgement,  independent  from  the   panel   of

professional valuers that was appointed by HDB.  So these are

the  various  avenues  of  appeal  if  the  tenants  are  not

satisfied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the first question which the Member asked,

which  is whether these adjustments contradict or run counter

to  the  package of measures.  First of all, let me reiterate

again  the purpose of this adjustment.  We need to, first  of

all, get the cost structure correct for HDB shops.  What do I

mean  by  this?  If, for example, you have two shops side  by

side,  one  paying  much lower rental than  the  other,  then

obviously it is going to be very difficult for competition to

be  fair because the cost for one shop is much lower than the

other.  And this was the situation when we had in many places

a lot of resettlement cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member will recall, resettlement cases were given

very, very highly subsidised rentals in the early days.   And

we  now  have a situation where we have got people coming  in

and  tendering  in  the open market.  And  we  have  a  third

situation where there are shops which are now being sold  and

the  new  landlords of these shops are now letting out  their

shop  premises.   We  have got all these different  types  of

shops  and the shop tenants in each of these shops are paying

different rentals.  Obviously, this is not going to make  for

a  very  fair  competitive environment in  the  neighbourhood

estate.   And this is reason why, in 1988, 12 years ago,  HDB

decided that it was time to gradually remove this anomaly and

disparity  in rent, so that everybody can start  off  on  the

same  basis, and that is the only way for the shopkeepers  to

compete on an equal basis and to decide whether they are able

to  do  that kind of business in that area or not.  And  that

exercise has been going on, as I indicated earlier,  for  the

last 12 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of those shops had their rentals adjusted. All of

them had their rentals

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



adjusted  upwards  in  the course of the  last  12  years  at

varying  rates of increase.  The last increase was  in  1998.

In  fact,  during  the  last crisis, at  the  third  renewal,

rentals  were increased, but up to 75%.  At that  time,  when

they  were renewed for the third time, tenants knew that,  at

the  next renewal, rentals would go up to market.  Of course,

since  1998, the prevailing market rents have also come down.

So  when  we  are talking about adjusting to market,  we  are

actually  not  adjusting the last 25%, but  we  are  actually

adjusting less than that in most cases.  There are some cases

where  the adjustments are slightly higher, but most  of  the

time,  the  adjustments  should be slightly  less.   And  the

purpose of all this is really to make sure the cost structure

is correct, that the operating environment is fair to all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having done that, we look at the situation at the moment

and  we  have  decided, after a review, that we  will  do  an

adjustment   across-the-board.   And   this   would   benefit

everybody,  not just those whose rentals have  been  adjusted

upwards, but also those rentals which have been maintained or

which  have been brought down to market.  So everybody  still

continues to operate on a level playing field.  And  I  think

this  is the best way to ensure that the shopkeepers are able

to  compete and compete fairly, and they are able to  make  a

considered decision whether the costs that they are incurring

allow them to do the kind of business they want to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package of measures that we have announced recently

complements  this in the sense that for those who  find  that

they  are  not able to continue to do business at these  fair

market rentals, there are various options open to them:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) They can sublet their shop. They are allowed to

sublet their shop, either half or, if they wish to, they  can

assign the whole shop to somebody else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) They can change their trade. If they feel that this

particular  business is not doing well, they  can  decide  to

change the trade to something else, or they can assign it  to

somebody else to change their trade.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) They can also decide that they may want to exit the

business   completely,  take  advantage  of   the   voluntary

retirement scheme (VRS) that I announced in Parliament during

the  last  Budget, take an ex-gratia payment of $48,000,  and

look for an alternative means of livelihood.  MOM has put  in

place  schemes to assist these shopkeepers who do  decide  to

take  the  VRS  to look for alternative jobs, or  to  go  for

upgrading  or retraining.  NTUC has also indicated that  they

are prepared to bring them into a franchise scheme.  So there

are  various alternatives if shopkeepers are not able to cope

with  the  rentals that have been set for them.  But  in  the

first place, I think we ought to make the rentals fair across-the-board  for  everybody, and then we decide  what  are  the

assistance  schemes that we can put in place if  somebody  is

not able to cope, and that is what HDB has done.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister did not answer my second

question  whether the market rates that have been used  as  a

benchmark  for  the  recent  rental  adjustment  reflect  the

present economic climate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The market rates are set on a regular

basis.  Every year, the market rates are set.  And looking at

the  trend of the market rates that I have seen,  it went  up

from 1995, it peaked around 1996/97 and it has started coming

down,  and today, the posted market rates are about 20% below

the peak which is similar to what I see in the private sector

market.   So  to that extent, I would say, yes,  the  present

current  market rates are reflective of the current  economic

conditions.   But that is on a general basis.  If  there  are

any  complaints about market rates not being fair, the Member

should bring them to my attention and I will look at it on  a

specific  basis.  Because as I said earlier, market rates  do

vary  from location to location and they do vary even  within

one  location,  from  floor  to  floor,  from  direction   to

direction, and so on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, those

who  have tendered or bought shop units would be aware of the

competition and of the rental paid by the competition.  Is it

therefore  necessary or even fair for the  HDB  to  interfere

with market forces and adjust upwards the competition cost?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the HDB's adjustment to market

policy  has been known.   As I said, it has been in existence

since  1988.  So I presume that those who have tendered would

also  be aware that HDB is actually undertaking this exercise

and that rentals will be adjusted gradually to market for its

competition.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether our

present  policy  jeopardises  struggling  HDB  retailers  who

cannot  afford higher rentals by forcing them out of business

and  depriving them of their livelihood?  Could the  Minister

consider  readjusting  our policy  to  better  cater  to  the

demands and needs of the day?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> That is precisely what we are doing, to

try and better cater to the demands and needs of the day.  If

the  shopkeeper  finds that he is unable  to  cope  with  the

rental  increases, as I said earlier, there are other avenues

for  him  to  continue to earn a living, including subletting

his shop, and having sublet his shop, taking that revenue  to

defray part of the cost of his shop, or assigning the shop to

somebody  else and still being able to earn some  income  or,

alternatively, exiting from the retail trade altogether.  But

to  subsidise and to continue to subsidise, as the Member  is

suggesting,  some of these shops in order  to  keep  them  in

business is, I think, not a correct approach for HDB to take.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have a question

on  the  valuation.   I would like to ask  the  Minister  how

regularly  the  valuation is done.   And  in  this  round  of

increases that we did, when was the valuation done and, also,

is  the valuation done on a collective basis, or is there  an

opportunity  to  value  every  shophouse  according  to   its

location, type of renovation that may have been done, type of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



trade  that  it has been doing, and that perhaps  will  be  a

better way of judging the value?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Rental reviews and valuation are done

on a regular basis.  It is being done now on an annual basis.

Reviews  on a location by location basis are done,  but  they

are  staggered.  There is a programme whereby rental  reviews

are  done on a locational basis.  In the review of the rents,

the  professional valuers will look at the general  location,

specific address of the shop, they look at the direction  and

what the tendered rents have been.  They do not just look  at

the  highest rental, they also look at the range of  tendered

rentals in order to make sure that there are no exceptionally

high  rentals,  as  the Member mentioned  just  now.   Is  it

possible that, in some cases, rentals are exceptionally  high

because somebody wants a shop very badly?  I am told that the

valuers also look at such exceptional circumstances, and then

they  finally come to a judgement as to what is a fair market

rental.  It is not unexpected that there is a dispute between

what  the tenant should pay, or what he is prepared  to  pay,

and what the HDB says he should pay.  When such disputes give

rise   to   appeals,  the  appeals  would  then  be  adjudged

accordingly.   Each  appeal is looked at  seriously,  and  if

there  is  any  cause for revision of that  rental  for  that

specific shop, it will be done.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister  whether the valuation also takes into  account

the  different types of business?  For example, I  understand

that  childcare  centres operated by private  operators  have

been subjected to rental increases also in HDB estates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am not familiar with the particular

example  that  the Member mentioned.  If he has  any  further

details, I will be happy to look into that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just wondering

whether  the  Minister's answer just now  that,  because  the

tenderer is aware that existing shopkeepers' rentals will  be

adjusted upwards, it would therefore create an infinite loop.

They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



would  be encouraged to tender higher and therefore,  in  the

longer  term, existing shopkeepers' rentals will have  to  be

increased to match market rates and new tenderers will tender

even higher.  I am just wondering whether there is a need  to

review this approach.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am not a HDB tenderer. I

presume that anybody who wants to tender for a HDB shop  must

look into all the factors involved, not just the fact that we

are  going  to  adjust rentals.  He must  also  look  at  the

business that he is in, the kind of traffic that is generated

by  that  shop,  and  a  myriad host of  many  other  things.

Whether this particular factor alone will give rise to tender

prices spiralling upwards, I really do not know.  The fact is

that  they  know that we are adjusting everything to  market,

they know that there is a certain market rental, and then  it

is up to them to decide how much they want to tender.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, would the Minister extend the voluntary

retirement  scheme  to all shopkeepers in the  older  housing

estates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, we have identified a number of

areas where we think the voluntary retirement scheme would be

of  immediate  interest, and these are mainly  in  the  older

housing  estates.   There  is  a pilot  voluntary  retirement

scheme  which has just been implemented, and we are  awaiting

the  response from that voluntary retirement scheme.  If  the

hon.  Member  would like to suggest any other  area  that  we

could  apply  that voluntary retirement scheme,  I  would  be

happy to consider.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether he will consider releasing  more  public

sector work to the private sector instead of giving the  work

directly   to  Government  corporatised  companies   as   the

construction  industry  has yet  to  recover  from  the  1997

economic crisis.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  asking  Question No. 6, I wish to declare that  I  am  an

architect in private practice.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Works Department (PWD) was

corporatised in 1999 as part of the Government's  efforts  to

progressively   devolve  its  non-policy  and  non-regulatory

functions  to  the  private sector.  This would  benefit  the

private sector in the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect the corporatisation, the Government granted

the  corporatised  PWD  a moratorium  period  of  five  years

starting  from  1st April 1999.  During this period,  PWDCorp

Pte  Ltd  is  to continue with architectural and  engineering

consultancy, project management, and construction supervision

for  the construction and engineering projects of Ministries.

This  is  to  ensure  a  smooth  transition  process  in  the

corporatisation.  However, projects of $20 million  or  below

are   opened   for  competition  among  the  private   sector

consultants.   The value of work assigned to  PWDCorp  during

the  moratorium period is not more than what was already with

the PWD before its corporatisation.  PWDCorp does not perform

any construction works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has in fact benefited as a result of

the PWD corporatisation.  Before its corporatisation, PWD was

handling  all Ministry projects.  Since corporatisation,  the

Government has directly awarded more than $450 million  worth

of  projects  each year to other private sector  consultants.

Nearly half of these are sizeable projects worth between  $12

million and $20 million in value each.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I believe the

Minister  of State mentioned $450 million worth of contracts.

Could  I  know how much this is as a percentage of the  works

given out by the Government?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I do not have the figures

with  me, but let me just do a mental calculation.  For  $450

million,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>



if you exclude the big projects, eg, reclamation and so on, I

would  say  maybe in the region of 10%-20%.   It  is  just  a

guess.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I appreciate the Minister of State

doing his back-of-envelope work.  10%-20%, if it excludes the

very large projects like reclamation, seems a little low,  if

I  may  say.  Is there any inclination to push it up  higher?

Is  the  private  sector  up to the job?   Historically,  the

Government has had reasons to doubt the private sector.   But

for  capacity  growth  in  this sector,  could  this  not  be

fostered?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, may I remind the hon.

Member  that PWD was formerly part of the Government and  all

the jobs were given to PWD.  This moratorium is basically  to

ensure a smooth transition.  PWD is now in the private sector

and, therefore, it has to compete with the private sector for

all  the  jobs, although there is a 5-year moratorium.   Once

the moratorium is over, they will have to compete on an equal

footing.  So, because it was only corporatised in 1999, I  am

sure, over time, the percentage and value will increase.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, since PWD is

now privatised and in the private sector, can the Minister of

State tell us how much private-sector work is PWD doing?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, this is a related

question.  If I know the exact figure, I would have been able

to give the percentage to the hon. Member.  However, now that

he  has  jogged  my memory, PWD is doing a lot of  Government

work, eg, schools, even the Terminal 3 design and so on,  but

the huge projects, eg, MRT excavation, all these are not done

by  PWD.   I  will have to check whether I am  right,  but  I

believe it is actually more than 10%-20%, probably even close

to  50%.  We are talking only of PWD, not Government, because

Mr  Tay asked about Government projects.  Government projects

include many other things.  If my memory serves me right,  it

is  probably about 50%.  In that case, PWD would handle about

$500-$600  million, and the private sector handles the  other

50%.

<div align="center"><b>(Assistance schemes for loss of jobs)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  there  are programmes and schemes in place  to  help

executives  and professionals who lose their jobs during  the

current economic downturn.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, my Ministry has focused many of our employment

assistance  and  training efforts at lower  skilled  workers.

There  are  good  reasons for doing  so.   According  to  our

statistics  and  information, lower skilled workers  are  not

only  more vulnerable to retrenchments, but also find it more

difficult  to  seek re-employment.  If we do not  help  these

workers  upgrade their skills, many of them could  also  face

the  prospect of long term structural unemployment even after

the economy and the labour market recover.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that we have forgotten about

executives and professionals.  They need help of a  different

kind.  We offer employment assistance to displaced executives

and  professionals  through  our  Career  Centre,  known   as

CareerLink@mom.   The centre provides information  on  labour

market  trends,  advice  on  job opportunities  and  training

opportunities, and employment assistance for the  unemployed.

It  helps all categories of job seekers, including executives

and  professionals,  as long as they are Singapore  citizens.

The  centre also works with organisations like the  Singapore

National   Employers  Federation  and  the  Singapore   Human

Resource   Institute  to  reach  out  to  professionals   and

executives should they require employment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



assistance.  Currently, 11% of the visitors to the centre are

diploma or degree holders.  And 23% of jobs in the CareerLink

job bank are for professionals, managers and executives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last month, my Ministry also revamped our

Employment Town website (http://www.employmenttown.gov.sg) so

as   to  provide  some  of  CareerLink's  services  over  the

Internet,  online.  The revamped Employment  Town  will  help

Internet-savvy executives and professionals in  their  search

for  jobs and learning opportunities, without them having  to

physically  visit  the career centre  at  my  Ministry.   The

Ministry's job bank is also available on Employment Town.  To

expand  the available job options, the website also  provides

links to other job banks, recruiters and employment agencies.

It  also  provides  information on  training  incentives  and

training providers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of retraining, executives and

professionals  are mostly degree and diploma holders  who  do

not  lack basic skills.  Our training programmes have  to  be

more  focused.  For example, my Ministry has worked with  the

Infocomm   Development  Authority  (IDA)  on  two   Strategic

Manpower Conversion Programmes (SMCP) to help executives  and

professionals  make  a  career  transition  to  the  Infocomm

sector.   This  programme,  which  was  launched  last  year,

provides  funding  support for employers  who  send  existing

employees or newly recruited staff for conversion training in

information technology.  The programme also has a Facilitator

Scheme  for  individuals who have not  been  able  to  secure

employment  yet  and  hence are not able  to  get  employers'

funding support.  Facilitators will assess the suitability of

these candidates and register them for the conversion course.

They will also help to place trainees with suitable employers

upon  completion of the course.  To date, some 250 mid-career

executives have benefited from the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the economic situation, my Ministry

hopes  to work with economic agencies to roll out the  scheme

in other sectors and to expand the training

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



numbers.  A total of $40 million has been set aside under the

Manpower  Development  Assistance  Scheme  (MDAS)  for   this

programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise, however, that the success of the

programme will depend ultimately on the expectations  of  the

mid-career trainees as well as employers' acceptance  of  the

concept of "mid-career conversion."  I would like to urge all

employers  to  support the concept and provide  opportunities

for  our mid-career executives and professionals to make such

a career transition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, given the economic and labour market

conditions, my Ministry recognises that there would  be  more

displacements   among  workers,  including   executives   and

professionals.   We  will work with our  partners  to  expand

existing programmes and introduce new programmes to help  our

workers in the months ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, it is very

heartening to hear the programmes that the Minister has  just

announced.  But in view of the commitment, in most cases very

heavy  commitment,  of  most mid-level executives,  I  wonder

whether  the  Minister would consider some form of  insurance

scheme with a view to perhaps legislating it, such as what is

being done in many European countries, the idea here being to

help  executives and professionals to tide over a  reasonable

period  of time in between jobs when they get laid off,  such

as in the current downturn.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> We are going to encounter such ups

and  downs  in  our economic growth from time  to  time.   We

should  not  deviate  from  some fundamental  positions  just

because we run into an occasional hiccup.  We have had such a

downturn  before:  in  the  mid-70s,  in  1985/86  and,  more

recently,  in  1998.   We  have not  introduced  unemployment

insurance,  if  that is the concept that the hon.  Member  is

suggesting, because we believe that that would just further

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



decrease   our   competitiveness.   Introducing  unemployment

insurance would be an additional cost factor for employers.

We  have always believed that our workers should save for the

rainy  day.   We help them to save through the CPF mechanism,

which  will  enable  them to meet their mortgage  commitments

besides  saving for old age.  Over and above  the  CPF,  many

workers  are  also  able to put aside additional  savings  of

their  own, particularly when we are talking about executives

and  professionals.  I would like to remind the  hon.  Member

that CPF contribution is capped at a ceiling of $6,000 of the

salary.    Income  above  $6,000  is  not  subject   to   CPF

contribution   at  all.   Therefore,  there   is   tremendous

opportunity for people in this category - the executives  and

professionals  earning  more  than  $6,000  -  to  put  aside

additional  savings  on their own so  that  they  are  better

prepared  for  any sudden ups and downs in  the  economy.   I

think   we   should  not,  just  because  of  this  downturn,

unscramble  some fundamental principles and launch  into  new

directions   which   may,  in  fact,  have   very   long-term

implications  and may well affect our overall competitiveness

in  the future and make it even more difficult for us to turn

the economy around.

<div align="center"><b>MIDDLE-AGED WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number employed after retraining)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

he  will  give  an  indication of the number  of  middle-aged

workers  aged 45 years who are able to find employment  after

having  gone through some form of training and retraining  to

upgrade themselves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the Skills Redevelopment

Programme  (SRP) is the Ministry's main programme to  enhance

the  skills  and employability of our lower skilled  workers.

Under  the Skills Redevelopment Programme, enhanced financial

incentives are provided for workers aged 40 and above.   This

is  to  encourage  employers  to  equip  older  workers  with

certifiable skills that will enhance their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



employability.   Individuals, including  unemployed  workers,

can benefit from the SRP incentives through the SRP Surrogate

Employer  Scheme run by NTUC and the self-help  groups.   The

SRP has shown encouraging results.  As of end June this year,

close  to  54,000 training places have been  achieved.   This

includes  about  8,300 individuals who had  enrolled  in  SRP

training  through  the Surrogate Employer Scheme.   There  is

good  representation  of  older workers.   Some  45%  of  SRP

trainees are aged 40 and above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked for an indication of the number of

middle-aged  workers  who  are  able  to  find   jobs   after

retraining.  My Ministry and the NTUC initiated a survey last

year.   About  75%  of  workers who  took  up  full-time  SRP

training  after  being retrenched were  able  to  secure  re-employment  within three to six months after their  training.

When  asked  if SRP training had equipped them with  relevant

skills  for  their new jobs, close to 60% agreed or  strongly

agreed that it had done so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendaki, one of our SRP's Surrogate Employers, conducted

a  similar survey recently among the retrenched workers  whom

they   had  sent  for  full-time  SRP  training.    All   the

respondents  received  job offers after  completing  the  SRP

courses. 70% of those who had undergone the programme were re-employed  within three months after training.  Close  to  80%

who were employed during the survey were also earning between

$1,000  and  $1,500  a month. Most importantly,  78%  of  all

respondents  said  that the SRP course  had  been  useful  in

helping them to gain employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to add that the SRP has not only

benefited retrenched workers or the unemployed.  It has  also

benefited  employers  and in-employment  trainees,  in  other

words,  workers  who  are  still employed  and  have  a  job.

According to the same survey commissioned by my Ministry  and

NTUC,  70%  of employers reported that workers who  underwent

the  SRP  training had become more productive. 75% of workers

who had undergone in-employment training indicated that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



they   were   more   confident  of   handling   greater   job

responsibilities and more complex tasks after the training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These results are an indication of the positive impact

of  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme training on enhancing

the  skills of our older and less educated workers.  With the

economic  downturn, we will intensify our efforts  to  deepen

and broaden the programme, so that those who are affected  by

the downturn will be able to benefit from the programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, will the Ministry

consider  actively helping these workers who  have  undergone

SRP  training?   I am speaking of the 30% who have  not  been

able  to  find  employment despite having  gone  through  SRP

training.   Essentially, can the Ministry set up a bureau  to

actively seek job placements for them upon completion of such

training  so  as  to achieve 100% employment upon  taking  up

training?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> My Ministry would certainly do that.

In  fact,  we are already doing so by helping people  through

our CareerLink@mom.   This would include helping SRP trainees

to   find  suitable  employment  upon  completion  of   their

training.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to know

whether we are on target to achieve the objective of training

100,000 workers in five years.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> If we can hit about 28,000-30,000

participants in the SRP programme for each year for the  next

two years, we should be able to hit our target of 100,000.

<div align="center"><b>OLDER WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Improvement of job prospects)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower,

besides  the  Skill  Redevelopment  Programme,  whether   the

Ministry  has  other plans to help older workers  to  improve

their job prospects.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, my Ministry is aware that older

workers  with lower skills face greater difficulties  seeking

re-employment.  Hence, our skill upgrading programmes,  as  I

explained  earlier  on, offer enhanced  support  and  special

incentives   to  the  older  workers.   Besides  the   Skills

Redevelopment   Programme,  we  have  the   National   Skills

Recognition System (NSRS) and other initiatives funded by the

Government to help older and less educated workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate skills upgrading for older workers who do

not  possess  formal  education, we introduced  the  National

Skills Recognition System in September last year.  This is an

industry-driven  framework to, firstly,  develop  and  review

standards  for job-specific skills and, secondly,  to  accord

recognition   for   standards   achieved   through   national

certification.  There is no entry educational requirement for

the National Skills Recognition System courses.  As a result,

older  workers without formal education can achieve certified

National   Skills  Recognition  System  standards  that   are

recognised  by the industry.  Industries where NSRS  training

has  been implemented include the hotel, marine, cleaning and

call centre industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also allocated resources to help older and lower

skilled  workers acquire critical enabling skills which  will

enhance  their employability.  We will also be introducing  a

new  programme  called  the  "People  for  Jobs"  Traineeship

Programme  to help older and lower skilled workers  make  the

transition to new economic sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry's statement on the

off-Budget   measures  will  have  more  to  say   on   these

programmes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, does the Ministry

have  any  plans  to  further  enhance  job  consultancy   or

employment assistance schemes for the older workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the answer is yes. We will look

at  every  possible  way  to provide better  job  assistance,

especially to the older workers.  As I have explained

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



at   the  last  Parliament  sitting,  we  are  even  offering

counselling services at our CareerLink@mom.  There are  group

sessions,   like   workshop  sessions,  or  even   one-to-one

counselling sessions for some of the older workers  who  need

special  assistance.  We already have a  mechanism  to  offer

them  this special counselling to help them to look  for  new

employment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether his Ministry is doing anything to  convince

employers  who  are  still  resentful  of  recruiting   older

workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, through our contacts with the

Singapore  National Employers Federation, we  are  constantly

promoting this message that employers should not rule out the

option of employing older or mid-career workers.  As you  can

see  from the survey results which I gave just now, in  fact,

employers   do  recognise  the  benefits  of  putting   their

employees  or  new recruits through the Skills  Redevelopment

Training   programmes.   Increasingly,  as  more   and   more

employers  recognise  the benefits of  such  skills  training

programmes  and that, in fact, an older worker  can  make  an

equally good contribution to the company's effort, I am  sure

there  will  be more opportunities opening up for  the  older

workers.  But it has got to be a two-way effort, that is, the

older workers have to make that extra effort to upgrade their

skills  so  that they can continue to make a contribution  to

help  the company to compete and, on the other hand, we  will

continue to promote the benefits of employing older workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister  if  he  knows what the  reasons  are  for  the

employers'  reluctance to employ older workers and  what  can

the  older workers do to change the perception that employers

may have of them of not being suitable for their work.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> There are many reasons why some

employers are reluctant to employ older workers.  One of  the

more  commonly  cited reasons is the lack of  skills  by  the

older  workers,  who  are less able to do  the  job  that  an

employer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



has  in the company.  This is an area that we can tackle  and

we  are  determined to tackle this through a wide variety  of

training programmes. But there are other more market  reasons

why some employers prefer a younger worker for a certain type

of  work.  In some cases, we also have older workers who  are

less  reluctant  to take on the job.  For instance,  we  have

employers in the food manufacturing industry crying  out  for

workers  and  they  are prepared to take older  workers,  but

older  workers are not prepared to take the job because  they

are  required to work on a 12-hour shift and to be  in  their

duty  stations for a fairly long period of time during  their

working  hours.  There are many reasons and we will  have  to

overcome  them over a period of time by constantly  educating

employers and, at the same time, upgrading the capability  of

our  older  workers so that they are in a better position  to

take on these jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, discrimination

against  older  workers  seems to be rather  widespread.   My

experience is also similar to the other MPs.  I have heard of

complaints of people who are 40 years old and above who  find

it  difficult  to get a job.  Sir, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister   whether   he  is  willing  to  legislate   against

discrimination against older workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, as I have explained earlier on,

it  is  not  a  question of discrimination  that  some  older

workers encounter greater difficulties getting a job, in  the

sense that employers have ruled them out purely on age alone.

There  may  be some companies that have done that,  in  which

case  obviously,  they are missing out  on  opportunities  to

recruit workers that can help them.  On the other hand, there

are many situations where the older workers are not given the

job  simply  because of a mismatch and this  mismatch,  as  I

explained  earlier, can happen from both point of view.   The

employer may have an expectation of a certain level of skills

which  the  older workers may not have, or the older  workers

may have certain expectations of the working environment that

the  employers are not able to provide.  So legislation  will

not cure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



this  problem.   I think we better stay with a more  flexible

labour market where we can allow market forces to operate and

employers  can recruit the people who can contribute  to  the

company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government, we will come in to help all those older

workers  who  are facing greater difficulties by giving  them

extra assistance to help them to acquire the skills that  are

needed  as  the economy is restructured, as jobs become  more

demanding  in  terms  of  the skills  content  and  technical

capabilities that are required.  In other words, we will  try

to make our older workers more employable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Would the Minister consider some

incentive  schemes  to encourage employers  to  employ  older

workers,  especially those who have picked up  some  form  of

skills?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, we have already done so in the

Skills Redevelopment Programme by paying to the employer  who

sends  an older worker above the age of 40 years for training

100%  of  his  training cost, instead of 80%, for  a  younger

worker.    We  are  also prepared to pay a  higher  level  of

absentee   payroll   subsidy  to  the   employers.    Further

enhancement  to the existing incentives will be announced  by

my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Industry.

<div align="center"><b>ACCOMMODATION OF FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Safety and minimum standards)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for National

Development,  in  light of the recent fire of  some  workers'

quarters  in  Jurong  which  killed  three  foreign  workers,

whether the Ministry has set out guidelines on the safety and

minimum  standards for the accommodation of  workers  in  the

various industries.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, temporary buildings intended

for  occupation,  including workers'  quarters,  have  to  be

erected in compliance with the various statutory safety and

health  requirements.  Under the Building Control  (Temporary

Building)  Regulations, such temporary buildings have  to  be

designed by a professional engineer and constructed under his

supervision  to  ensure structural safety.   The  Regulations

also   stipulate  requirements  on  structural  safety,  room

height, ventilation, staircase width and lightning protection

for  such  buildings.  In addition, the  Fire  Safety  Bureau

(FSB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs imposes requirements

to  ensure fire safety.  The Ministry of the Environment also

has requirements to ensure environmental health.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, can I ask the

Minister  whether he has any clue on how the recent spate  of

fires happened?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the Police and the Fire

Safety  Bureau are investigating.  So it is premature to  say

anything about this.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, could I ask the

Minister  of State to reveal the number of actions  that  has

been  taken  against employers who have provided  unsafe  and

unhygienic accommodation over the last one year?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, on average, we receive

about  30  complaints on unauthorised workers' quarters  each

month.   Currently, we have about 200 cases  on  hand.   They

have  either been served with enforcement notice  with  grace

period  granted or they are under surveillance.  In the  last

15 months, we have charged 15 cases in court.  Let me clarify

that   these   are  mostly  cases  that  involve  shophouses,

residential  apartments and even landed  housing  where  they

house these  workers illegally.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister of State,

in  view  of  the  prolonged recession  in  the  construction

industry, whether the Ministry will consider regularising the

operation  of  these workers' quarters,  so  that  they  will

continue  to  provide  low-cost  accommodation  for   foreign

workers?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, let me inform the Member

that  the Government allows workers' quarters to be built  on

construction sites, provided they get a professional engineer

or  a  QP  to  design,  plan  and to  do  all  the  necessary

calculations  and  supervision of the construction  of  these

workers'  quarters.   This  is one  area  where  construction

companies can minimise their cost.  The Government  has  also

allocated  sites  for  construction of workers'  dormitories.

All  these  measures  will perhaps  help  allay  the  concern

expressed by the Member.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> What about big pieces of unused

private land?  Are they allowed to provide such facilities?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, it depends on the location

of that piece of land.  URA has to take land use and also the

impact on the surroundings into consideration before planning

approval can be given.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister of State, in

the  light  of the fact that many of these fires  and  unsafe

incidents happened  at illegal workers' quarters, whether the

Ministry could work with the Ministry of Manpower to get  the

addresses, especially where these workers are housed, and see

whether  they are housed in proper quarters and whether  they

are housed in vacant land, so that the Ministry will have  an

idea  where these workers are actually staying, and  it  will

enhance enforcement action?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I will take up with the

Ministry  of Manpower and see whether the suggestion  can  be

adopted.  Let me also say that at the moment, the Ministry of

Manpower  requires employers to provide proper  accommodation

to  the  workers.   In fact, they have to  furnish  a  $5,000

security   bond.    And  if  they  fail  to  provide   proper

accommodation, the bond can be forfeited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his suggestion, I will ask the relevant Ministry

to look into it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, for enforcement purposes, would it

be possible for one single agency to look into hygiene, fire

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>



safety  and living condition standards?  I know that when  an

application  is made in the first instance, many  departments

are  involved.  But for enforcement purposes, can one  single

agency do the job to ensure that the standards are maintained

strictly?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, under the current

arrangement,  the different agencies enforce the  regulations

separately.  First of all, if we are talking about land  use,

the  land use approval must be given by URA.  And if  we  are

talking  about building plans, then BCA will have to approve,

and the normal procedure is to include fire safety and health

requirements

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member suggests that we have one single agency to

look  into the problem of providing accommodation to  foreign

workers.   I  think we can look into the feasibility  of  his

suggestion.  Maybe we can form a ZIP team to look  into  this

problem.

<div align="center"><b>TEACHER INTAKE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Quality and standard)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  efforts by his Ministry to increase  the  intake  of

teachers over a relatively short period of time have resulted

in  his  Ministry  compromising the quality and  standard  of

teaching staff in schools.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  recruitment of teachers has improved  in  the

last few years and I am glad to report to the House that  the

number recruited has increased.  There was a step increase in

recruitment  in  1996,  following a  major  revision  to  the

Education Scheme of Service. Recruitment increased  from  the

level of 1,000 per year prior to 1996, to an average of 1,950

from 1996 to 1998, approximately double.  During the economic

crisis  in 1999, my Ministry took the opportunity to increase

recruitment  resulting in an exceptionally  large  intake  of

3,325  trainee  teachers that year.  That  means   more  than

three  times what we have been recruiting per year  prior  to

1996.  The increased recruitment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



over  these  last  few  years has largely  been  due  to  the

improved scheme of service for the Education Service, and the

relative attractiveness of teaching compared to other careers

during the economic downturn.  Recruitment has settled at the

level  of around 2,250 per year in the last two years.   This

is  the level which my Ministry would be comfortable with  to

maintain  the staffing level of the teaching force  which  is

now about 24,000 strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has maintained the same criteria and

standards  for recruitment throughout this period.   We  have

continued to target our teacher recruitment at the  top  one-third   of  each  Primary  One  cohort,  which  will  include

graduates, school leavers with  good  `A' level results,  and

the  top  band  of  Polytechnic Diploma  graduates.   Besides

satisfying our shortlisting criteria, all applicants  to  the

Education  Service  are  interviewed by  a  panel  comprising

senior  educationists,  very often  senior  principals.   The

interview  panel  assesses  candidates  not  only  on   their

academic  qualifications alone but also on their interest  in

teaching,  and  personal and leadership qualities  that  will

enable  them  to  be good teachers.  While they  are  in  the

National Institute of Education undergoing training,  trainee

teachers  are  also assessed for their aptitude and  attitude

towards teaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to cite one statistic to show how the

new  teachers  that  we are recruiting are  better  prepared.

About  63%  of all new teachers recruited from 1996  to  2000

were  graduates or were enrolled into the National  Institute

of  Education  for degree programmes.  As  a  result  of  the

greater number of graduates recruited, the overall percentage

of  graduates in the teaching force has increased from  40.9%

in  1996  to  55.4% in 2000, and we expect the proportion  to

continue  to rise.   I would like to assure Mr Sin  that  the

Ministry  will  continue  to uphold  the  high  standards  in

recruiting good teachers for our schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, will the Minister be able to give

me  an indication of the number of complaints made by parents

against  the quality of teachers in schools over  the  years,

and  whether  this number has gone down or has  remained  the

same?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I am not able to give Mr Sin

statistics on this, because complaints can be defined in many

different ways.  So we do not keep statistics of this nature.

My  sense  is  that, yes, parents do take a greater  interest

today  in the education of their children, and they  do  come

into  contact  with the teachers more often to discuss  about

their children.  I think this is something positive and to be

welcomed, and I would encourage both parents and teachers  to

take  part  in  this  kind of discussion in  a  positive  and

constructive way for the benefit of students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say though that the young teachers are

doing very well.  I have met many young teachers in my visits

to  schools  and also to the National Institute of Education.

They  are  enthusiastic, energetic and able.  In fact,  their

senior  colleagues in schools are also impressed  with  them.

The  combination  of experience and youth  is  good  for  our

schools  and  our  students.   I  visited  a  primary  school

yesterday  and, in fact, one of the senior teachers  told  me

that I should go to Parliament and tell the Members here that

the  young teachers are good, so that the public do not  keep

beating  up on them.  I hope that this House, the public  and

parents  will join me in encouraging and cheering  our  young

<div align="center"><b>FULL-TIME NATIONAL SERVICEMEN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Hospital admissions and fatalities)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and Minister for Defence in the past 10 years, how many full-time  National  Servicemen per intake have been  admitted  to

hospital and what has been the number of fatalities.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr David T. E. Lim) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  over the past 10 years, on the  average,  one

death each year is attributable to training.  Another 2-3 are

non-training related, such as from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>



traffic  accidents.  MINDEF computerised its medical  records

in 1997.  Based on the computerised records for the past four

years,  there  were, on average, about 50 cases of  full-time

national servicemen admitted to hospitals each month.   These

admissions  were  for a variety of medical conditions.   Some

examples   are  sprains  and  fractures,  asthmatic  attacks,

chicken pox, surgical emergencies such as appendicitis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training is an integral part of military proficiency and

professionalism.  To be effective, training must be realistic

and challenging.  MINDEF and the SAF take a very serious view

of  training  safety.  We will not compromise  on  safety  in

meeting   training   requirements  and   achieving   training

standards.  However, despite our best efforts, there will  be

some residual risks in military training.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister of State

the procedure or standing order that the officer-in-charge is

required to follow when hospitalisation is required  or  when

death has occurred, in particular, the reporting to the next-of-kin or parents of the NSman?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I cannot give him the detailed

procedure.   If he would like the information, I can  provide

the  information  to  him.   We  do  take  this  matter  very

seriously  and very sensitively, in particular, the reporting

to  the  next-of-kin.   For  example,  we  will  not  release

information  to  the  media until the  next-of-kin  has  been

notified.   But  if  the  Member  requires  further  or  more

detailed information on that, then I will have to look up the

procedures.

<div align="center"><b>PIRACY ATTACKS IN STRAITS OF MALACCA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and  Information Technology  what  steps  are

being  taken  bilaterally or multilaterally  to  address  the

concerns of shipowners and crewmen regarding the increase  of

piracy  attacks  on vessels passing through  the  Straits  of

Malacca, bearing in mind the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>



significant maritime and commercial  interests of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as a maritime nation and a

responsible  member of the international maritime  community,

Singapore  takes  a  serious view against  piracy  and  armed

robbery  against  ships.   As the  major  sea-lanes  are  our

economic  arteries,  Singapore's trade will  be  affected  if

piracy  causes  ships  to  bypass our  main  shipping  lanes.

Piracy  also poses serious threats to life at sea  and  could

endanger navigational safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the coordinated efforts of various

Government agencies, we have been effective in addressing the

problem  of  armed robberies within our waters.  Since  1991,

there  has  not  been  a  single  case  of  sea  robbery   in

Singapore's  waters.   However, our territorial  waters  form

only  a  small  part  of  the main  shipping  lanes.   Piracy

incidents outside our waters could still pose a threat to our

international trading activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bilateral level, Singapore has been working

closely  with  Indonesia  to  address  the  problem  in   the

Singapore   Straits   that  straddles  both   Singapore   and

Indonesian  waters.   The law enforcement  agencies  of  both

countries  established  the  Indonesia-Singapore  Coordinated

Patrol  (ISCP) to curb sea robbery in the Singapore  Straits.

The ISCP efforts include the regular exchange of information,

effective operational channels of communication, as  well  as

cross border pursuits.  The ISCP was also held up at the 1999

International  Maritime Organisation  (IMO)  Piracy  Regional

Seminar  in Singapore as a possible model for other countries

to emulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore also supports multilateral efforts to combat

piracy  and  armed robbery against ships in the  region.   We

worked  with the Japanese to conclude the "Tokyo  Appeal  and

Model  Action  Plan" to strengthen counter measures  and  co-operation    among    coast    guard    agencies,    maritime

administrations  and  shipping  community  in  combating  the

problem in the region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also actively support the IMO's efforts in

formulating   cooperative  arrangements  among   neighbouring

countries  to  deal  with piracy and  sea  robberies  in  the

Malacca Straits and South China Sea region.  We assisted  the

IMO  in hosting and organising an anti-piracy seminar for the

Asian  region  in  February  1999 and  a  follow-up  regional

meeting  in  March  2001  aimed at  promoting  and  enhancing

regional cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shipping community has a part to play in the fight

against  piracy  and armed robbery.  MPA issues  Port  Marine

Circulars to the shipping community advising them on measures

to  reduce the risk of piracy and sea robbery attacks.   Such

measures include an anti-attack plan that covers the need for

enhanced  surveillance, detection equipment,  and  radio  and

alarm procedures in the event of an attack.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piracy and hijacking are transnational crimes that

require  the coordinated efforts of governments and  affected

parties.   A  useful instrument that establishes  the  ground

rules and legislative framework for co-operation among states

is the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Act at Sea,

or  more commonly known as the Rome Convention, which the IMO

has  urged member states to accede to.  Singapore has decided

to  accede  to the Rome Convention.  We will do so after  the

enactment of the necessary legislation.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Improvement of traffic flow)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology (a)  what  are  the

reasons  for  the  regular traffic  jams  along  the  Central

Expressway  between the Kampong Java tunnel and  Ang  Mo  Kio

Avenue  1 exit in the evening peak hours and between 9.30  pm

and  11  pm; and (b) what measures his Ministry will take  to

address  the problem, without resorting to evening electronic

road pricing charges.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Information  Technology   whether   the

Ministry

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



has  any  plans  to improve the traffic flow at  the  Central

Expressway before 2006 when the Kallang/Paya Lebar Expressway

is expected to be completed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your

permission to take Question Nos. 14 and 15 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Central  Expressway  (CTE)  is the  main  expressway  serving

residents  in the north (such as Ang Mo Kio and  Yishun)  and

the  northeast  (such  as Hougang and Sengkang).   Therefore,

many  vehicles use it to get to the city during  the  morning

peak  hours  and to return from the city during  the  evening

peak  hours  as well as in the late evenings.   This  is  the

reason for the traffic jams along it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) along the CTE spreads out

the  traffic flow to the city during the morning  peak  hours

and hence reduces congestion in the morning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve the traffic situation along the CTE, the Land

Transport   Authority  has  embarked  on  three  major   road

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the improvement to Upper Serangoon Road,

which  includes a second level viaduct between Upper Aljunied

Road  and Upper Paya Lebar Road and the extension of the road

to  Sengkang.  When completed in early 2002, Upper  Serangoon

Road  will  be  an attractive route to and from  Hougang  and

Sengkang and will help divert some of the vehicles away  from

CTE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the improvement to the CTE-Braddell Road

junction.   It will be completed by the end of 2002.   Today,

vehicles queue back from this junction into the CTE and  slow

down  traffic  along the expressway.  When this  three  level

interchange is completed, there will be a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>



faster clearance of the large number of vehicles exiting from

CTE to Braddell Road through the slip road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway

connecting the East Coast Parkway to the Tampines Expressway.

Construction  work will start soon and will be  completed  by

2006.  This expressway will serve the northeast of the island

and will divert more traffic particularly to/from Hougang and

Sengkang away from the CTE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North East MRT Line, now under construction, will

link  the north east sector (which includes Punggol, Sengkang

and  Hougang)  with the city.  It will provide  a  convenient

alternative  to driving and will relieve peak period  traffic

conditions along the CTE when completed by the end of 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these three road projects and the North East MRT

Line,  when completed, will each help to relieve the  traffic

congestion along the CTE.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the

Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary whether  the  Ministry  will

consider to further widen certain portions of the CTE  so  as

to  increase  the traffic flow and, at the same  time,  do  a

study  on  the exit points along the whole CTE to reduce  the

bottleneck situation?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, we do have a road

expansion  programme, but we have to study the CTE  carefully

because  the CTE is going through a very built-up  area.   So

the opportunities for us to expand will be very limited.  But

certainly  that  is an option that will be  studied  and,  in

fact, has been studied in some instances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the exits, LTA has studied them because

this  is  part of the whole process of trying to provide  the

alternative routes.  Hence, they studied traffic  exiting  at

Braddell  and  the  impact of Kallang-Paya Lebar  Expressway.

LTA   would study the exits very carefully in order  to  take

into account what sort of traffic volumes we are experiencing

and how the alternatives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>



will help to relieve the traffic volume along the CTE.

<div align="center"><b>CUSHIONING THE IMPACT OF THE DOWNTURN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Trade and Industry)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said in

Parliament  on 11th July, the global economy has deteriorated

much faster than anticipated.  Growth in the US, Japan and EU

has  slowed  sharply.  Strong growth during the  boom  years,

especially  in  the  US,  led  many  companies  to  ramp   up

production  capacity, expecting demand to  continue  growing.

When  demand slowed, partly because of the NASDAQ crash, they

were  caught  off-guard, forcing them to cut  production  and

reduce  cost.  The simultaneous downturns in the US,  the  EU

and Japan now feed negatively into each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global electronics downturn has worsened even more

dramatically in the last few months.  Worldwide semiconductor

sales  declined  by  24% in May 2001.   Global  semiconductor

sales  are expected to fall by 25-30% this year, down sharply

from  +37%  growth  last year.  The global DRAM  industry  is

expected  to plunge by an unprecedented 55% this  year,  down

from +37% last year.  The electronics industry is expected to

remain weak at least till the end of 2001.

.     Malaysia is also slowing down, compounding the problems

that  we face.  In  Indonesia, political uncertainty has made

economic recovery even more difficult but we hope that  under

President  Megawati's  leadership, the situation  there  will

improve.

<br><br><i>Singapore's Economic Performance</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have a worse alignment of the planets. As a

result  of  the  weaker external environment,  the  Singapore

economy   deteriorated  further  in   the   second   quarter.

Annualised quarter-on-quarter growth was -10.1% compared

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>



with  -10.9% in the first quarter.  On a year-on-year  basis,

Singapore's  economy slowed sharply to -0.8%  in  the  second

quarter  from  +4.6% and +11.0% growth in  the  previous  two

quarters.   The  slowdown was across all the  major  sectors,

particularly manufacturing where output fell by 11%  in  May,

due largely to the 20% plunge in the electronics industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our export performance has also worsened, in line with

weaker  export  markets.  Non-oil domestic  exports  fell  by

16.9% in June and 9.4% in the second quarter of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour market is also showing weakness.

Retrenchments  rose  in  the first  quarter,  reflecting  the

downturn  in  the  global electronics  cycle  and  weaker  US

growth.  We expect it to increase as companies start shedding

workers.   Several  MNCs like Maxtor and  Aiwa  have  already

announced  job  cuts.   Many have also  moved  to  a  shorter

workweek.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the sharp deterioration in economic

conditions, we have revised the 2001 growth forecast down  to

0.5-1.5 % this year.

<br><br><i>Measures to Cushion Impact of the Downturn</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite almost 10% growth last year, many businesses,

especially  the  smaller ones, have not  recovered  from  the

effects of the regional crisis in 1998.  We therefore left in

place  some  of the measures introduced in the last  package.

In this year's Budget, we have reduced corporate and property

tax  rates  to  help  companies, especially  SMEs.   To  help

households  and  workers,  the income  tax  rates  have  been

lowered.  In addition to CPF top-ups, the Government has also

granted  rebates  on personal taxes, service and  conservancy

charges  and  rentals.   A new "Utilities  Save"  scheme  was

introduced  to  help  households pay higher  electricity  and

water bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cushion the effects of the current downturn, the

Government has put together a package of additional  measures

which  I  will now announce.  They are classified into  three

categories: namely,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



measures  to accelerate the building of economic  and  social

infrastructure; cost-cutting measures to help companies;  and

measures  to  help  those retrenched and  to  promote  worker

retraining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further details will be given by the respective agencies

over the next few days.

<br><br><i>Economic and Social Infrastructure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the open nature of our economy, it is difficult to

stimulate  the economy by generating domestic demand  through

Government  pump-priming.  However, there are  some  projects

which  the  Government can bring forward.   Accelerating  the

building  of our economic and social infrastructure will  let

us  take advantage of low tender prices, and will enhance our

capabilities  over  the long-term.  Some  of  these  projects

include  the  development  of  Jurong  Island,  drainage  and

sewerage  works, road and commuter facilities, and  upgrading

of  IT  projects at polytechnics and universities.  In total,

bringing forward these projects will inject $204 million into

the  economy in this financial year and $512 million  in  the

next financial year.

<br><br><i>Cost-Cutting Measures</i>

<br><br><i>Labour Cost</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour cost is a key component of total business cost.

In  difficult times, adjusting wages is an important  way  to

save  jobs  and  prevent  companies from  going  under.   The

Government  and  the unions have therefore been  pushing  for

flexible  wages.  We have made good progress in  building  up

the variable wage component over the years, although there is

still  some  way  to  go.   So far, about  30%  of  unionised

companies  but  only  2.4%  of non-unionised  companies  have

implemented  a monthly variable component.  In  this  current

economic downturn, the variable component that we have  built

up  provides our first buffer.  It is far better to cut  back

on  bonuses  and  perks than to retrench  workers.  Companies

which are not doing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>



well  should  use  this  mechanism to  pay  smaller  variable

bonuses this year, in line with the NWC recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusting the CPF contribution rates is a measure of

last  resort and should never be done lightly.  In  the  1998

package,  the  Government cut the employers' CPF contribution

by 10 percentage points to help companies reduce costs and to

save  jobs.   It was progressively restored by six percentage

points  as the economy recovered in the last two years.   The

Government   would  like  to  restore  the   remaining   four

percentage  points  as soon as possible because  the  CPF  is

essentially  our  retirement savings plan.  Keeping  the  CPF

contribution rates below the 20% level for too long will mean

less savings for our old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, we would have restored a

further increment of employer CPF contributions at the end of

this year.  However, in the present difficult conditions, the

first  priority is to save jobs by helping companies to lower

costs.   The Government has therefore decided not to increase

the  employer CPF contribution rate at the end of this  year.

We  will  review  the situation again in the middle  of  next

year.   This gives certainty to the first half of  next  year

and  translates to a saving of $920 million for employers for

the first six months of next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some businessmen have suggested to MTI that the CPF

should  be  cut again.  We do not believe that such  a  major

move  is  justified at this stage.  However,  if  the  global

economy continues to deteriorate, we may have to consider all

possibilities.

<br><br><i>Foreign Worker Levy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold down business costs further, the Ministry of

Manpower will extend the current reduced foreign worker  levy

rates  for another year till June 2002.  This will  cost  the

Government revenue of $324 million.  Existing controls on the

intake of Work Permit holders remain unchanged to ensure that

employers  do  not  become over-reliant on  foreign  workers,

especially the lower skilled foreigners.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Property Tax Rebate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance

announced a cut in the property tax rate from 12% to 10%  for

all  commercial, industrial and residential properties.  That

reduction  was to take effect from 1st July this  year,  when

the  25%  property tax rebate for commercial  and  industrial

properties ended.  The Ministry of Finance has now decided to

extend  the  25%  property  tax  rebate  for  commercial  and

industrial properties for a year from 1st July this  year  to

30th  June  next year.  As the property tax has been  reduced

from  12%  to  10% on 1st July this year, the effective  rate

during  this  period would thus be 7.5%  as  compared  to  9%

before this.  This will cost the Government $257 million.

<br><br><i>Rental Rebate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, JTC and HDB withdrew part of the

rebates  given in the 1998 package of measures.  In  view  of

the  current downturn, we have decided to extend  the  rental

rebates  for  another year till end June  next  year  and  to

increase the quantum of rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC will grant an additional 10% rental rebate, giving

an  effective  rebate  of  up  to  20%.   HDB  will  give  an

additional  5% rebate on top of the existing 5% (and  another

rebate of up to 20% for those paying above market rates)  and

this will extend for a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, CAAS will offer a 15% basic rental rebate for

warehouse, office and concession space in the Airport  for  a

year  till  the  end of June next year.   It  will  also  not

increase the airport service charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB, JTC and CAAS will also pass on the savings from the

reduction  in the property tax rate to their tenants.   Other

landlords  are encouraged to similarly pass on the  reduction

in property taxes to their tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For market and hawker stallholders, the Ministry of the

Environment,  HDB and JTC will be giving a 10% rental  rebate

to  their  stallholders  who  are  paying  market  rent.   An

additional rental rebate of up to 20%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>

will  be  given if the rebated rent is still higher than  the

prevailing market rent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these rental rebates will take effect from 1st July

2001  for  a  year  and  they will cost the  Government  $272

million.

<br><br><i>Transport Cost</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To soften the impact on regional trade and travel, the

Maritime  and Port Authority of Singapore will give 20%  port

dues  concession  for container ships and commercial  harbour

craft.   This will save businesses $7 million for the  period

1st July this year to 30th June next year.

<br><br><i>Access to Finance</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies face greater difficulties gaining access

to capital for their businesses during this downturn as banks

become more cautious.  To help local companies, the Singapore

Productivity  and  Standards  Board  (PSB)  will  raise   the

Government's  risk  sharing of the Local  Enterprise  Finance

Scheme  (LEFS) from 50% to 70% for one year from  1st  August

2001.   In  anticipation  of the increased  demand,  we  will

increase  the  loan availability under LEFS by  $60  million.

PSB  is  also  working on a new programme  to  make  it  more

flexible for banks to lend to SMEs with varying credit  risks

by covering part of the risk through a loan insurance scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help medium-sized companies, the coverage of LEFS

will also be expanded to cover enterprises with at least  30%

local  equity,  with  fixed asset investment  of  up  to  $50

million and employment size of not more than 300 workers  for

service  companies.  This is significantly  higher  than  the

current  limit  of  $15  million  in  terms  of  fixed  asset

investment  and  200 workers for service companies.   A  loan

line  of  $60  million will be set aside  for  this  purpose.

Together  with the additional $60 million mentioned  earlier,

the total loan availability under LEFS will be raised by $120

million from $600 million now to $720 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional grants will also be set aside under the

Enhanced Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme (LETAS)

to  enhance  specific programmes which help  local  companies

strengthen their capital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>



structure,   trim  cost,  improve  cashflow  and   streamline

operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures are for a period of one year.

Besides  the  additional  loan line of  $120  million,  these

measures  are  expected to cost the Government an  additional

$10 million.

<br><br><i>Measures to Help the Unemployed and Promote Worker Retraining</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchments are expected to reach 20,000 this year.

Older  workers and less educated workers are more  vulnerable

to  retrenchment  in  a  downturn, and Members  raised  their

concern  in this House earlier on at Question Time.  Many  of

them  face  difficulty  getting  re-employed.   To  help  the

retrenched  workers, and particularly those in the vulnerable

groups,  the  Ministry  of Manpower (MOM)  is  expanding  its

employment assistance and training programmes in a major way.

<br><br><i>Increased Efforts in Job Matching</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of job matching, MOM currently operates a

career  centre.   The centre provides information  on  labour

market trends, advice on job and training opportunities,  and

employment assistance.  Because of the economic downturn, the

centre has served twice the number of users in recent months.

To  reach  out to even more workers, MOM will further  expand

the  centre's  services and increase  the  number  of  access

points  to these services.  It will work with NTUC, self-help

groups  and  other community organisations to make  available

similar services and information at their locations.  MOM has

also  put  in more services on the Internet and expanded  its

Employment Town website.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From next month, MOM will also be starting a series of

community  based job fairs to bring together job seekers  and

employers.  And it is targeting to organise an average of one

job fair per month for the rest of the year.

<br><br><i>`People For Jobs' Traineeship Programme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many retrenched workers will find that the jobs which

they  are  used to will no longer be available  in  Singapore

even  after the economy recovers.  This is especially so  for

older  and  less educated workers previously engaged  in  the

manufacturing sector.  To stay employed, some  of  them  will

have to switch to other industries, particularly those in the

services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making this change requires openness and flexibility on

the part of both workers and employers.  Workers will have to

make  some  adjustments and accept different job requirements

and  work  environments.  Employers on their part  should  be

more  prepared to hire such mid-career workers who  are  good

workers  but newcomers to the industry and to help ease  them

into their new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help older workers with low education make this

adjustment,  MOM  is  piloting a  new  programme  called  the

"People  for  Jobs" Traineeship Programme.  The programme  is

akin to an apprentice programme for mid-career workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the programme, MOM will provide financial support

of  up  to $3.80 per hour or $600 per month for three  months

for  companies which employ these retrenched workers, and who

agree to put in place a mentorship or traineeship arrangement

to  help  settle  in  these workers.  MOM has  found  several

employers  who  are  prepared  to  take  part  in  the  pilot

programme.   Together, they are able to  provide  immediately

400  places  in the services sector.  And these include  jobs

such as sales and retail assistants, room stewards, telephone

operators  and  housekeepers.   MOM  hopes  to  expand   this

programme  rapidly and to increase the number of  traineeship

places.

<br><br><i>Expansion of Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of skills training, MOM and NTUC operate the

SRP  to  help  lower  educated  workers  acquire  certifiable

skills.  Through the SRP, some 54,000 workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>



have   equipped  themselves  with  relevant  skills  to  stay

employable.   In  view  of the economic  downturn,  MOM  will

further  enhance the programme.  The list of approved courses

will  also be significantly expanded to benefit more  workers

and  employers.   And we hope to double  the  number  of  SRP

trainees this year from 20,000 to 40,000 workers.  This  will

cost  an additional $28 million.  And should there be greater

demand, MOM is ready to expand the programme further.

<br><br><i>Incentives for Employers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For workers sponsored by employers, SDF funds up to 80%

of  the  course fees incurred for workers less than 40  years

old.  For workers aged 40 and above, SDF funds up to 100%  of

the  course fees.  Currently, many employers sending  workers

for  SRP  training have to pay the full fees first and  claim

for reimbursement only after completion of the courses.  With

the  business  downturn,  many employers  may  not  be  in  a

position  to come up with the cash upfront.  MOM is therefore

working   out  an  arrangement  with  PSB  and  the  training

providers  so  that the employers only need to  pay  the  net

amount.  Details will be announced once they are finalized.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to course fee support, absentee payroll

support  is also provided to employers to encourage  them  to

send less skilled workers for training.  From 1st August this

year,  the  absentee payroll support will be  increased  from

$5.10  to  $5.40 per trainee hour for workers  less  than  40

years  old,  and  from $6.15 to $6.50 per  trainee  hour  for

workers  older  than  40  years.   We  hope  that  this  will

encourage more employers to send their workers for training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to NTUC, around 30,000 workers are already, or

will  be, on temporary layoff or shorter workweek.  We should

put  this  slack to good use.  Companies that are facing  low

demand  and  have consequently implemented shorter  workweeks

and  temporary  layoffs  should send their  workers  for  SRP

training.  And during this period of training,  workers  will

receive $3.80 per trainee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



hour  or $600 per month as training allowance.  Participating

companies,  which  might  otherwise  have  retrenched   their

workers, need not top up the training allowance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these measures, we hope to persuade employers to

use  the  business slowdown to upgrade the  skills  of  their

workers  rather than quickly resorting to layoffs.  By  doing

so,  they  will be more competitive and better prepared  when

the economy turns around.

<br><br><i>Help For Retrenched Workers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals on their own, including those who are

unemployed,  can  also  sign  up for  SRP  through  surrogate

employers like the self-help groups and NTUC.  The Government

helps  to  pay  for the course fees of these  workers,  while

these surrogate employers provide additional support for low-income earners and those who are unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, 8,000 workers benefited from SRP training

under the sponsorship of surrogate employers.  To enable  the

surrogate  employers to reach out to more workers,  SDF  will

increase  the  course fee support given to  them.   From  1st

August  this  year, SDF will increase its course fee  support

for  trainees aged 40 and above under the surrogate  employer

scheme from 80% to 100%.  In addition, for trainees below  40

years  old, the Ministry of Manpower will provide a  separate

grant  from the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to surrogate

employers to offset part of their cost.  These measures  will

help to encourage the self-help groups and NTUC to reach  out

to even more individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployed workers who go for SRP training will improve

their  short and long-term re-employment prospects,  but  may

have  financial difficulties during the training period.   To

help  them,  the  Government provides a  training  allowance.

From  1st  August  this  year, we will  raise  this  training

allowance from $3 per hour capped at $500 per month to  $3.80

per  hour capped at $600 per month, which is the same  amount

given to workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>



under employment who have taken time off for training.

<br><br><i>Enabling Skills for Less-Educated Workers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant number of workers still lack basic skills

that  are  increasingly required at the workplace.   Together

with  its  partners, the Ministry of Manpower has  introduced

two  programmes: the National IT Literacy Programme  and  the

community-based CREST programme to help these workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National IT Literacy Programme, jointly developed

with  IDA,  aims  to improve the employment prospect  of  all

Singaporeans  by  equipping  them  with  basic  computer  and

Internet  skills.  The Ministry of Manpower  will  invest  $8

million  for the first year and another $19 million over  the

next  two years to ensure that the training courses are  kept

affordable for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CREST programme, or Critical Enabling Skills

Training, introduced by PSB in November 1998, aims to provide

seven  cores skills, such as `Learning-to-Learn',  `Literacy'

and   `Problem  Solving  and  Creativity'  to   enhance   the

employability  of  an  individual  worker.   Presently,  only

workers  sponsored  by  employers are given  funding  support

through  SDF  for attending such training.  With effect  from

October this year, the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund  will

provide  funding  support through community self-help  groups

for individuals without employer support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These training and training support efforts will cost

about $40 million over the next year.  However, we should not

see  budget  here as a constraint.  We hope that  the  demand

will grow, and the Government is prepared to spend as much as

is  needed  to help more Singaporean workers stay employable.

The key is to help them stay employable.  The goal is easy to

define but hard to achieve.  We welcome more ideas on how our

workers can be better prepared for global competition.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic slowdown is also causing the retrenchment

of  executives and professionals.  As they have skills,  many

of  them will be able to find alternative employment,  albeit

at  lower salaries.  Despite the slowdown, the Government  is

continuing  to  recruit,  for example,  teachers  and  school

administrators  in  the  Ministry of  Education,  and  senior

officers to serve in many Ministries.  The Government  cannot

become  the employer of last resort, but it is on the lookout

for  good  people to strengthen the Ministries and  statutory

boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professionals will also benefit from EDB's Training and

Attachment  Programme.  EDB is stepping  up  its  efforts  to

build capabilities in research and development (R&D), product

and  market  development  through  this  programme  will   be

extended  to  training in local companies.   Companies  which

face constraints in providing training in-house can work with

our  research  institutes and research centres to  host  such

training,  fully funded by Government.  This  programme  will

help companies to continue training and building capabilities

at  a  time when they are under pressure to cut back on these

long-term activities.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting together this package, we are grateful for

the  suggestions made by many organisations and  individuals,

including   members   of   the   Committee   on   Singapore's

Competitiveness,  the Singapore Chinese Chamber  of  Commerce

and  Industry, the Singapore Confederation of Industries, the

Real  Estate  Developers' Association and the Feedback  Unit.

The  total cost impact of the measures announced in this off-Budget  package is estimated at $2.2 billion over  one  year.

This  is  equivalent to 1.4% of GDP.  Though not as large  as

the  package  announced at the end of 1998 during  the  Asian

financial crisis, it is a significant package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the US economy is currently at a virtual

standstill, there are some signs of improvement.   There  has

been  a  pickup in the leading index, and consumer confidence

has held firm in recent months.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan sounded a cautious note of

optimism  in  his  recent  testimony  to  the  US  House   of

Representatives.  Although he still saw greater risks on  the

downside,  he  also  saw  signs of a  bottoming  out  of  the

downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This package will help businesses cope with the crisis.

It will also help workers, especially older and less-educated

workers, to prepare themselves to retain their jobs  or  find

new  jobs.  And it will supplement the measures announced  in

the Budget in February, especially the corporate and personal

tax   reductions,  and  the  rebates  to  help   lower-income

households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must be realistic. No package of Government

spending  can neutralise the global downturn, the electronics

slump, or the regional problems which are the root causes  of

the slowdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will monitor closely the economic situation in the

coming months.  If the global situation worsens, we have  the

resources to do more, and will be ready to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as we navigate carefully through this difficult

period,  we  can  be  confident of Singapore's  future.   Our

medium  and long-term prospects are good, provided we do  not

make  major mistakes.  The Singapore economy is fundamentally

sound,  and  the  confidence of MNCs  and  investors  in  our

economy  remains  high.   For example,  even  though  foreign

investments   into   the  region  have  declined,   Singapore

continues  to  attract major investments from abroad.   Major

projects  announced recently include a 12-inch wafer  fab  by

Taiwan's  UMC, a state-of-the-art TFT Liquid Crystal  Display

plant  by Toshiba-Matsushita, a regional distribution  centre

by  Daimler-Chrysler, and a pharmaceutical research centre by

Eli  Lilly.  On the services side, leading B2B companies, eg,

E2open  and Converge, have set up their Asia-Pacific hubs  in

Singapore.  Autodesk, an established US software company, has

also  set  up  its  Asia-Pacific  headquarters  and  its  R&D

operations here.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing investment commitments in the first half

of this year totalled $5.9 billion, in terms of fixed assets,

which is about two-thirds the $9 billion target for the whole

of  this year.  So there is a reasonable chance that we  will

be  able to achieve our target of $9 billion this year.  When

realised,  these  commitments are expected to  generate  $4.3

billion of value added and create about 8,700 jobs.  Services

commitments  reached $800 million in terms of total  business

spending  in the first half of the year, and are expected  to

generate  $750  million in value added and  3,600  jobs  when

realised.   In  addition, our current  negotiations  on  Free

Trade   Agreements  with  major  economies  will   open   new

opportunities for our businesses and attract more  FDIs  into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the present slowdown is largely cyclical, we

must  press  on  with  the  restructuring  of  the  Singapore

economy.  Despite the dot.com crash, the New Economy  is  for

real  and  we  must  make use of IT and e-commerce  to  raise

productivity and add value.  The entry of China into the  WTO

will put pressure on wages all over the world, especially  at

the  lower  end.   Whether we like  it  or  not,  because  of

globalisation, we are competing with hundreds of millions  of

eager  and hungry Chinese and Indian workers for the  low-end

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore scramble up the value ladder quickly.

And,  to  do  this,  we must liberalise and rationalise  many

sectors  of  the economy, for example, in banking,  telecommu

nications,  and  power generation and supply.   As  companies

tighten  their belts, they should try not to put off  longer-term   improvement  plans.   They  should  build   up   their

capabilities  and reposition themselves for  the  turnaround.

Some  companies  will  not be able  to  do  this  because  of

financial difficulties.  For them, the cost-cutting  measures

will provide some help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers should take this opportunity to train and

upgrade so that we can switch quickly to new and better jobs.

The   Government  will  do  everything  possible  to  attract

investment, promote enterprise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>



development  and help our workers stay employable.   We  have

weathered  more serious economic crises before and,  provided

we respond cohesively and rationally, we have every reason to

be  confident of overcoming this downturn, and emerging  more

resilient and competitive than ever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to

distribute a summary [Annex: Cols. 1953-4 - Summary  of  Cost

Impact] of the cost-cutting measures to the House, please?



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2001/20010725/20010725-HA-0731953.htm">ANNEX - SUMMARY OF COST IMPACT</a><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Thank you. I will now take

questions  from  hon. Members seeking clarifications  on  the

measures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask

the Minister whether the Government has any plans to help the

private  sector  to explore new markets where  possible  and,

should   the  situation  deteriorate  further,  whether   the

Government would assure workers that employers will do  their

part  to  explore innovative ways to face the challenges  and

not   keep   calling  for  CPF  cuts  each  time  they   face

difficulties.  Could the Government take a stronger stand  in

future  towards  such  requests?  Would the  Government  also

consider  reviewing the employment pass policy, eg,  reducing

the number of employment pass for job areas which can be well

performed by Singaporeans?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during this

period,  we  should look for all the bright spots that  there

are  on  our  radar screen.  There is one major  bright  spot

which  needs repeated emphasis, ie, China.  China is expected

to  grow  at 7% over the next five years despite this  global

economic  downturn.  Those of us who have been to  China  are

able  to sense the organic growth, the self-sustaining growth

resulting  from the development of its own domestic  economy.

China will become

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>



very  big  and  the  earlier  we  size  up  the  threats  and

opportunities, the better we will be prepared for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would describe it as a kind of a juggernaut which we

see  coming  down  the road, still at first  gear,  lumbering

along,  but gradually picking up speed.  We can either  stand

in  front of the juggernaut and turn to cardboard or we study

it  carefully  and say, "Look, let us find a good  hand-hold,

get  our  skateboard ready, put on our Walkman, and  hitch  a

ride  when the juggernaut gathers speed."  And we can do this

because we have an inside track into China.  We have cultural

relations,  we have good political relations,  and  China  is

already our No. 1 investment destination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the viewpoint of the economic agencies, we are

now conducting a review to increase our presence in China  in

a  major  way.   Take tourism as an example.  Throughout  the

last  crisis,  tourism  growth from  China  increased  double

digits,  and  we  can  expect tourism growth  from  China  to

continue  increasing in the coming years.  As  each  province

opens up, many millions of Chinese will want to travel and we

must  capture our share of it.  There are many areas in which

China  will offer opportunities, including a reverse flow  of

investments into Southeast Asia.  I have been monitoring  the

investment  trends, and Chinese investment in  Singapore  has

been  rising steadily.  Still small, but a significant trend,

and we should build on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are other countries like India which

we  should  look at.  EDB will be increasing  the  number  of

overseas trade delegations and any opportunities that we  are

alerted to, we would disseminate to the business community as

quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked about what we can do to encourage employers

to  take  a more generous and liberal attitude towards  older

workers.   This is a major issue for us.  It is a  structural

problem  because  many  of  our baby-boomers  never  had  the

opportunity and they still have 20 to 30 years of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>



working  life  ahead of them and they are not well  educated.

Among them, there is widespread fear that if their number  is

called,  then  it  is very difficult for  them  to  find  re-employment.    It  is  widespread.   I  have,   in   my   own

constituency, grassroots leaders who are in this predicament.

I  have  received  letters  from others  who  complain  about

competition from foreign workers and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last weekend's Talking Point, Mr Heng Chee How, Mr

Stephen Lee and one of the workers retrenched, Mr Anwar, gave

a  very  moving  account of their experiences.   It  requires

attitudinal change on the part of all players in our economy.

Firstly, among our workers, retrain, at the minimum, learn e-mail.  Try, do not say, "Look, I am too old for it."  If  you

cannot  even  send e-mail and work the computer keyboard,  it

would  be  very difficult to be re-employed, and  it  is  not

difficult to learn.  The key here is a psychological  barrier

and  we must help them to overcome it.  We have a whole  slew

of  programmes which we announced earlier to help  those  who

are interested to upgrade themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of employers, Mr Stephen Lee told us that

there  is already a shift but we should accelerate the shift.

It  is  very important for us.  If you study McDonalds,  they

have  done  a  very good job and we should do a special  case

study  on  McDonalds.  Many of us are used,  when  we  go  to

McDonalds, to have aunties and uncles serve us, and that term

has  acquired a certain affectionate ring to it.   When  they

come  to wipe the tables or to collect our trays, people  try

to  minimise  their work.  So when they can, they  will  also

dispose of their disposables and stack the trays up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did McDonalds achieve this? Not by paying these

workers  very high wages - in fact, if they had to  pay  them

very  high wages, they would never have been employed in  the

first  place -  but by altering work design.  If you look  at

the  keyboard at McDonalds, it is very simple: one  fillet-o-fish, one big Mac, you press the button, it is done.  You  do

not require very much training and the workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>



wear  smart uniforms, they go for outings together, they  get

free meals, they become a little community.  If the employers

are prepared to make this investment in management, they will

find that this investment will more than pay for itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you another example. Robinsons, which is

well-known for their excellent service, they have  got  older

staff,  more  stable staff.  Many of our departmental  stores

get  into  a vicious circle where, to save costs,  they  hire

part-timers.  Part-timers are not committed because they  see

their  jobs only as part-time jobs.  So if you ask them about

a  product, they will say, "Can you please look at the  label

yourself?"   When  you go to Robinsons, they  work  a  system

where,  because  workers stay there  longer,  and  they  have

incentivised  on commissions as a whole floor,  they  have  a

vested  interest.   Every time they see a customer  come  in,

they have to ensure he stays as long as possible on the floor

and  not to leave the floor empty-handed.  Older workers  are

more  mature,  more  committed and more responsible  and  are

better for this.  For many jobs in the service sector, we  do

not  really require techno-geeks or those who have  got  very

good  physical  reflexes.  They can be put to better  use  in

many sectors.  The whole certification programme is, in fact,

to  help  them  to  do a better job and to provide  a  better

service.  Singaporeans are increasingly prepared to pay  more

for better services.  That is why they go to Starbucks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have been investing in this area, we have

made  progress.  All of us would have noticed how the quality

of  service of taxi-drivers and bus drivers in the  last  few

years  has  improved  dramatically.   It  did  not  come   by

accident.   It came because between NTUC, the taxi companies,

PSB  and  other agencies, they have been pushing it  year  by

year and so we have upgraded ourselves.  Let countries around

us  take the low-end risks but we move up.  There is no point

in  our  scolding  employers  or legislating  to  force  them

because this would only pile up their costs and some of  them

are already suffering. What we can do is, on the part

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



of all parties, help to nudge employers and workers towards a

different  configuration.   In this  way,  we  build  up  our

services  sector  and build up a greater capacity  to  absorb

older workers in our economy.  We need plenty of ideas and  I

would  welcome  anyone  with any idea  from  any  quarter  in

Singapore  to  raise  them, either to MTI  or  our  statutory

boards, or to PSB, NTUC or any agencies, or to raise them  up

in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked about employment pass holders. For

work permit holders, we have a dependency ratio which ensures

that   the  foreign  workers,  who  are  in  Singapore,  help

Singaporeans  find  employment.  In many factories  now,  the

third  shift is done by foreign workers.  Let us think  about

this.   Without  foreign workers anchoring the  third  shift,

there  is  no  first shift and second shift for  Singaporeans

because  no one is going to plonk a factory in Singapore  and

not  operate  it  24 hours a day.  Without large  numbers  of

foreign  workers  in  Singapore, many Singaporeans  would  be

without  jobs.  Of course, on the shop floor, in a particular

office,  there may be a certain friction in the  sense  that,

"Look, why am I laid off?  Why is he not laid off?  Why is my

job  given to someone from another country who is working for

less?"  I can understand this anguish among many Singaporeans

and  many of them have written to me.  But from the viewpoint

of  the economy, filling in the gaps in our economy allows us

to  operate  a  much more complex and sophisticated  economy,

giving us jobs which we could not otherwise have.  If we were

not a high-tech centre, and we can only be a high-tech centre

if  we  have  large  numbers  of scientists  and  researchers

working  here, many technical jobs would not be available  to

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that we have been relatively

liberal  on employment pass holders.  When we encouraged  Eli

Lilly to come here to set up an R&D centre for the biomedical

sciences,  they  were  afraid  that  when  they  come   here,

Singapore is a small city-state, the range of skills that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>



they  need  would not be available.  Why not go to  China  or

Europe where everything is available?  I said, "Do not worry.

You come here.  If you need to bring in workers and expertise

from other countries, we will help you."  And because of this

assurance, they come here.  And because they come here, there

will be good jobs for Singaporeans.  Yes, at the local level,

Singaporeans  are hurt and we must help them. But  the  macro

picture  is  extremely important.  The key is to ensure  that

investments  continue  to  flow  into  Singapore.   If   they

continue  to flow into Singapore, we are all right.   If  EDB

reports to me that the pipeline is running out, then  I  will

have to come back to this House quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, first of

all,  I  would  like  to  thank the Minister  for  Trade  and

Industry  for  announcing this set of measures  valued  at  a

total of $2.2 billion.  I would like to say that I find  this

set of measures very comprehensive although it was done in  a

short  period  of  time,  since his  announcement  about  the

measures earlier this month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister a few questions, Sir.

Singapore is said to be a very export-oriented economy.  Some

of  our detractors have said that Singapore is a very exposed

economy.   Now, with the downturn, including even the  United

States,  Japan and our regional neighbours, we  are  possibly

going  into  a  further downturn.  I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  that, although now we have a set of measures  worth

$2.2  billion,  in  the event of a further drastic  downturn,

would he be prepared to consider further off-Budget measures.

In  this downturn, as the Chinese saying goes, we should  wei

yu  chou  mou (????), which means to plan and build our  huts

before the rain comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the $2.2 billion measures are very meaningful, I

find  something  lacking in what the Minister  has  proposed.

Although  he  has  announced several  measures,  particularly

those  by  MOM to help workers in skills retraining,  what  I

would  like to ask the Minister is whether he could  be  more

generous in providing for capital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>



grants  for  companies  in the area of equity  human  capital

development.   This is the area where we can build  our  only

resource,  which is the human capital.  Therefore, could  the

Government consider giving more grants in helping  SMEs  when

they  want  to  embark on R&D programmes  involving,  as  the

Minister   has   stated,  information  technology,   software

development,  communications  and  other  areas  in  the  new

economy?   I  think  to  build up the human  capital  and  to

prepare ourselves for this new economy is very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also mentioned about the possibilities

of China.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Leong, could I ask you to confine

yourself to asking questions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Yes, Sir. Could I ask the Minister,

since he mentioned that China is a bright spot, what are  the

plans  that  his Ministry has in helping local  companies  to

strongly  link  up  with China, in particular,  in  terms  of

business missions and training missions?  How do we  link  up

with businesses in China so that we could at least latch onto

China,  which is a growth area, despite the downturn  in  the

other economies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, a point on CPF cuts. I am also pleased to

hear  the Minister mentioning about the holding back  of  the

restoration of the 4% CPF cut until a review in the middle of

next year.  This is very comforting for the local businesses.

I  also agree with the Minister that there is no need for any

drastic CPF cut now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Leong, may I remind you that for

Ministerial Statements, you can only ask questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I would like to ask the Minister, in

spite  of  the confidence that he has instilled by mentioning

that  there  will  be  no further cuts in  the  CPF  for  the

business sector, whether he is aware that there is a need for

more  cost-cutting measures for the business  sector  because

operating cost and business cost are, in fact, a major factor

in  retaining their competitiveness.  Could the  Minister  be

more generous again in looking at various

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>



Government  rates  and fees that can be  cut  so  that  these

businesses   will  be  able  to  enjoy  a  more   competitive

environment  because business cost is a factor  for  them  to

remain competitive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister about the

extension  of property tax rebate.  He did mention  about  an

extension   of   property  tax  rebate  for  commercial   and

industrial  properties.  My question is:  why is this  rebate

not also extended to the residential sector as well?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, inevitably, this package

will  be compared to the $10.5 billion package which  we  had

the  last time.  Let us go back to the $10.5 billion  package

and what it consisted of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $10.5 billion, $7.5 billion consisted of CPF and

NWC  deductions.   In  other  words,  most  of  that  package

consisted  of a deep wage cut across the board in  Singapore.

Do we need to do that this time round?  So far, the necessity

is  not  obvious. Whatever we do, we cannot give work to  the

wafer  fabs  or  to  the  disk-drive  factories  or  to   the

petrochemical  island,  or  to our pharmaceutical  companies.

The  reason why business is down is not because of high  wage

cost,  but  because the global market is  down.   If  we  cut

wages,  I  think that may not be a wise thing to do,  because

there is no need to.  In fact, the reason why we have to  cut

wages  so  deeply  the  last  time  round  was  because   the

currencies  around us depreciated by about 40-50% while  ours

depreciated by  only 15-20%.  So, suddenly, we had to face  a

margin  of  20-25% and therefore we took the  15%  wage  cut.

This  time  round, when you look at our relative unit  labour

cost,  it is still competitive.  So because there is no  need

to  do  a major wage cut this time round, the present package

should  be  sufficient.  But having said that, I should  also

say  that if things get worse in the future, then we may have

to  do  more and we will consider all possibilities.   I  can

understand the reluctance  by all of us, by the unionists, by

Singaporeans generally, to resort lightly to a CPF reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the exposure of Singapore to the global economy, what

is the alternative?  Ever since we became independent, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>



knew that our own domestic economy was too small.  If we rely

only  on the regional economy,  I think we will be much worse

off.  In fact, it was because we did not rely on the regional

economy in the last crisis that we went through it reasonably

well.   So  we  try  to  buffer  ourselves.   We  have  close

outriggers  which  are grounded in ASEAN.   We  have  further

outriggers  which  reach out to Japan,  Europe  and  America.

But,  unfortunately, when the flows everywhere are down, then

we  are  down.   It  cannot be helped.  Is this  a  criticism

against our economic strategy to globalise our economy?   Not

at  all.   In fact, globalisation is the best diversification

that we can have for our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong asked about what else we should do on China. I

mentioned earlier that we have good links with China which we

should  build  on.   Recently, the  Senior  Minister  was  in

Suzhou.   President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier  Li  Lanqing

were  there  for the ceremony to mark the conclusion  of  the

first phase and the opening of subsequent phases.  When I was

in  Shanghai for the APEC meeting, at a cocktail, one Chinese

Vice  Minister  came  up to me and said,  "You  know,  Suzhou

attracted more investments this year than Shanghai."  I could

not  believe  my  ears  -  Suzhou had more  investments  than

Shanghai!   Later on, when I went to Suzhou,  they  confirmed

it.   Think  about it.  All of us know about  Shanghai.   Few

people realise that Suzhou has done so well, and the flagship

of  Suzhou  is our industrial park.  So if you read  internal

Chinese  literature, Singapore's standing in  China  is  very

high.  Our passport is held in high regard.  We are known  to

be  trusted.  So we should build upon this.  The trouble  is,

because the situation in China is changing so fast, for  many

of us, in our minds, we have not pressed the "Refresh" button

on China.  And for China, you must press the "Refresh" button

every  six  months  to  make sure that you  have  an  updated

picture.  With the Olympic Games and with the opening of  the

western region, there will be many new possibilities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In MTI now, we are conducting a major review of our

China  policy,  and we are bringing in our  Ministries.   One

idea, which we are working seriously on, is this. We are  now

sending   many of our scholars to the West.  When  they  come

back,  we  will send them for a one-year bond-free attachment

to  China.  They will be fully paid, they do a job, they  get

attached  either to a company or an institute, improve  their

Mandarin,  know  what  China is like at the  basement  level,

build  up deep knowledge in MTI and all the statutory boards.

Then  after a few years, we have a few hundred such officers,

and  I  think we should extend it to the other Ministries  as

well,  we  will  build up a deep inside knowledge  of  China.

Then  whatever  happens there, we will know how  to  position

ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is a big market. I was talking to David Abel, my

counterpart in Myanmar.  When I was in Kunming, I ate turtles

which were imported from Myanmar.  He said, "Ah, turtles,  we

export  lots  to Yunnan."  But Yunnan has been  importing  so

many  snakes, especially the poisonous variety, from  Myanmar

that  the  rat problem in Myanmar is getting out of  control.

So  he told the Chinese, "Look, can you please slow down your

eating of Myanmar snakes?"  The Chinese market  will open all

kinds  of possibilities, and we must get into it early,  know

what  is  happening,  position ourselves,  make  use  of  the

strengths and the assets that we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked whether we will provide grants for

companies  to  upgrade human resources, R&D and  so  on.   In

fact, we are doing a lot  -  EDB, PSB, NSTB.  We have a whole

range which is available.  Recently, I announced on behalf of

NSTB a post-graduate programme,  $500 million for five years,

to  promote  post-graduate  training  so  that  we  have  the

knowledge workers to power the knowledge economy.  And if  Mr

Leong  has any particular ideas which are additional to  what

we already have, MTI will be very happy to hear of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have answered all his questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about property tax on residential

properties?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I am sorry. Let me read out

the  section to Members again.  This was carefully vetted  by

the  Finance Minister.  It says, "The MOF has now decided  to

extend  the  25%  property  tax  rebate  for  commercial  and

industrial properties for a year from 1st July this  year  to

30th  June  next year, . and the effective rate  during  this

period would thus be 7.5% as compared with 9% before this."

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister  whether his Ministry  might  have  under-estimated the severity of the recession facing us this  time.

Of course, if we look at Chairman Greenspan's estimate, he is

cautiously  optimistic.  But the US economy is  a  very  wide

economy,  unlike the Singapore economy which is really  based

on  IT  and high-tech.  If the Minister has studied the order

book versus built ratio, for many of the high-tech companies,

this  is  one of the worst recessions in their history.   And

when  I  was coming to Parliament today, I  heard on the  BBC

that ABB of Sweden has cut 8,000 workers.  This has just been

announced  and is based on this order-book-built  ratio.   My

wife  and I work for US multi-national companies and both  of

these companies have complete capital freeze for the next six

months.   This  means it is zero.  Both these big  US  multi-national  companies are not spending any dollars  on  capital

equipment.    I  think, to me, the recession  facing  us,  in

particular,  in  the  high-tech sector, is  quite  severe.  I

thought  perhaps  in the package announced by  the  Minister,

there  might be an under-estimation  of the severity  of  the

challenges facing us.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  assure  Dr  Wang  that we are not  making  light  of  the

economic situation at all.  In fact, Business Times two weeks

ago printed an analysis by Stephen Roach from Morgan Stanley.

He  is sometimes called the "Resident Bear" in the investment

community.  He wrote a carefully reasoned piece that in  fact

the  whole  world has already entered into a  recession.   Of

course, among private analysts, there is a range of views and

he represents one end of it.  We cannot be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>



sure.   We read Greenspan very carefully and he said that  he

is  beginning to see "the market structuring a bottom."  They

are  very carefully chosen words.  He is beginning to see the

market structuring a bottom.  In other words, he has not  yet

seen a bottom, but maybe there is a bottom forming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the National Economic Advisor, Larry

Lindsey,  said that the US economy is at a virtual standstill

but  with the tax cut and  the interest cut, next year  there

should  be growth.  Paul O'Neil, US Treasurer, declares  that

he  is  an  optimist, and next year it will be at  least  3%.

Among  Federal  Reserve Governors, they said US  growth  this

year  will be between 1.25% and 2%.  This means that for  the

second  half  they expect maybe 1-2% growth.   Therefore,  an

upturn  at the end of the year.  Of course, you may say  that

these being officials, they have got to err on the optimistic

side  in order not to talk down the market.  But, at the same

time, these are very serious people with access to reams  and

reams  of  comprehensive data.  So I do not think  we  should

lightly second guess them.  What we have done is this.  Look,

yes,  on the scale between optimism and pessimism, we are  on

the   pessimistic   side.   But  we  cannot   be   completely

pessimistic  at  this point in time.  If we use  up  all  our

ammunition  now, there will be little left  later.   So  hold

back the 155s, hold back the F16 strikes, but do all that  is

necessary,  given the situation now.  If we need to  do  more

later, if you are right in your gloomy prognostication,  then

we will do more.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister that in the light

that the manufacturing sector is employing a large number  of

manpower,  what  steps  are being  taken  to  deal  with  the

hollowing  out  effects of the manufacturing sector,  because

this  has long-term implications for our manpower deployment?

Second, I want to know that if the downturn gets worse,  what

plans  will be put in place to reduce the livelihood problems

of  workers  affected by prolonged unemployment.  Third,  why

can  we  not be more generous in our training allowance?   We

are  only giving $600 training allowance which is not  enough

to meet the meals and transport costs of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>



these workers.  It requires more than $3 a day to get to  the

training  places.  I am curious to know whether the  Ministry

could be a bit more generous in providing incentives to train

older workers.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, this problem of hollowing

out  is  a very serious one, and the challenge here is China.

In  Taiwan  now, from Taichung southwards, for the  last  six

months,  there  has  been disinvestment and  unemployment  is

climbing  rapidly.   The mood is grey.  Hordes  of  Taiwanese

companies  have  been shifting operations  to  the  mainland.

Years  ago,  George Perot talked about a great hissing  sound

because  of NAFTA.  I think Taiwan is hearing a great hissing

sound now from mainland China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We anticipated this. We have been telling our people

that  the  only way for us to earn high wages is to  keep  on

upgrading,  which  means going up the  value  chain,  product

design, value adding services, knowledge intensity, R&D, high-tech.  Two months ago, I went to Delphi.  Delphi is the  auto

electronic spinoff from General Motors.   They used  to  make

car  radios.  But after a while, they decided that car radios

were  not  a product they were good at, because we  were  too

expensive here in Singapore and there were tariff barriers to

surmount.   But  they have been thriving and  still  growing.

Making  what?   They  now make small electronic  sensors  for

motorcar air bags.  You may use this sensor only once  in  10

years  and  when you need it, it had better work.  Otherwise,

you  may  die.   So  when it comes to very high  value  added

products,  we are trusted, we are reliable, we  are  able  to

create  a system discipline.  They make the little electronic

components  that  are now in every spark  plug.   I  did  not

realise this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in engineering school years ago, for me, a

spark plug was just a physical device and if the gap was  too

big,  you just hammered it to the right gap, and it was okay.

Now you open the car, you cannot tinker with your carburetor,

your  spark  plug,  because they are all  electronic.   These

components for spark plugs, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>



carburetors, for air bags are high value added.  Delphi sells

to  auto companies all over the world, and their products are

shipped  by  air.  This is the only way for our manufacturing

to  go  where  we  weigh  value not  by  kilogrammes  but  by

knowledge  intensity  that  goes  into  every  little  piece.

Capacitors which are so small that they look like  grains  of

sand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You visit our wafer fab, each is a $2 billion

investment, does not occupy a lot of land, but the knowledge,

the  system  that is in it is fantastic, and you cannot  just

plonk it somewhere in the jungle and expect it to work.   You

need  people,  you  need  a certain discipline,  you  need  a

culture of learning, of upgrading and group effort.  So  this

is the way we are going to solve the hollowing out problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo also asked:</b> can we do more for the livelihood

of  the  unemployed?  We are beginning to  see  increases  in

unemployment.  It is not yet a serious problem.  If  we  need

to  provide  direct income support, should  the  retrenchment

situation  become much worse, I believe we will  do  so.   We

have  many  safety  nets in place at the national  level,  by

civic  organisations and grassroots organisations.   Children

will   always   be  looked  after.   There  are  scholarships

available, book grants available.  We make sure that there is

a  safety net should things get worse for everyone.  That  is

the  Government's commitment to the people of Singapore,  and

we have the resources to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should increase allowances, well, these

are  allowances and they are not a replacement for  salaries.

Our fear is while doing all these things, we must not provide

a  disguised dole.  Someone asked earlier whether  we  should

not  have an unemployment insurance for more educated workers

in  Singapore.  It starts with the best of intentions, but it

has   led  to  long-term  structural  unemployment  in   many

countries.   Because a point comes when it is not worth  your

while   to  work,  and  it  is  better  to  declare  yourself

unemployed  or under-employed and collect something.   So  we

are  very  mindful of that.  But if we have got  to  do  more

later, we will consider whether some adjustments can be made.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my question to the Minister is

on  the  issue  of reading of the economy,  as  Dr  Wang  has

brought up.  There seems to be at least a six-month,  if  not

longer,  lag  in the way that the Government is  reading  the

economy as compared to how the rest of the private sector  is

reading it, and this has been shown a number of times in  the

past  few  years.  In fact, it was just a month ago when  the

Minister  mentioned  that there was no  need  for  off-Budget

measures, and here we are - the off-Budget measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my question to the Minister is: are the leading

indicators that we are using to read the economy good  enough

this  time  round, given the rate at which  the  economy  has

dropped from +10% to -10%, which is a 20% swing?  So my  fear

is  that we may not be reading it well enough.  We also heard

the  Minister mentioning a recovery by the end of this  year,

and  I  think  this  is far from what many other  people  are

saying  about a recovery in the second half of next  year  or

even  the  end of next year.  So my fear is: are  we  through

these  measures administering the wrong medicine at the wrong

time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue on the China strategy, while I know

that  the Ministry is trying to derive a China strategy  that

may  be  a  long-term strategy, in my opinion, with impending

WTO, with Olympic games coming to China in 2008, in the short

term  there are tremendous opportunities, especially  in  the

infrastructure area.  Could we, maybe through a package  deal

of  investments between SMEs and GLCs, quickly make  our  way

into China to see whether we can tap on some of the near-term

opportunities that are available?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final question is that while we are worried about the

fire-fighting that is going on, about the drop in economy, we

should not lose sight of the long-term gains that we can  get

in a knowledge economy, and many of us have asked this before

but  we  have  not seen any contribution.  I am  asking  this

question  on  how  we  can help entrepreneurs  and  start-ups

survive, and even in a worse situation when all the financial

institutions, including the VCs whom the Government had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>



funded  in  the last few years, are being very  reluctant  to

actually  pump in any money into start-ups and  new  ventures

even  though  there  may  be ideas and  they  may  be  viable

companies.  So the idea of a lifeline fund, and I believe the

Minister knows what I am talking about.  I hope that while we

may  fire  fight, let us see whether we can do something  for

the long term through policies like encouraging start-ups and

entrepreneurs.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  thank  Mr  Inderjit  Singh for his helpful  comments  and

questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We construct a number of scenarios. One of them is the

one  which Stephen Roach proposed: It is as bleak and as dark

as  we  can  make  it.  Even if it comes  to  that,  we  will

survive,  and  we  will get out of it,  and  we  will  emerge

stronger.  But should some other scenarios eventuate, then it

is  important that in administering the medicine, we  do  not

overdo it, because there is a price to be paid when we  over-medicate.   It  is a question of balance.  And what  we  have

done  is, at this point in time, given the situation,  we  do

this  first.   If  we  do  not  have  to  do  more,  that  is

marvellous.  If we have to do more, we will do more.  That is

the  position that we are taking.  So there is no attempt  to

gloss over the current difficulties.  In fact, the assessment

is a very realistic one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, I spoke to the Mexican Economic Minister

who is on a one-day visit here.  He was quite worried.  He is

90% dependent on the US economy for exports, and one-third of

the  Mexican  GNP is derived from the US.  So  he  feels  the

chill  immediately.  We were exchanging notes and he said  he

was  going to the US after that and he had arranged a  series

of calls with economic agencies there in order to get a first-hand feel of the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important leading indicator is not the one that

we   construct  for  Singapore.   It  is  the  one  that   is

constructed for the US economy, and that leading indicator in

the last few months had tended a little upwards, which is why

we  are not sure whether that doomsday scenario will in  fact

eventuate.  We will wait and see.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>



hope  that our pessimism is unfounded.  But if it is founded,

then  we  will  do more.  That is the position  that  we  are

taking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On China, on the possibility of SMEs and GLCs working

together, we should encourage it but we should not force  it.

Every  time we have a trade delegation going to China, and  I

will  be  leading one to the western region  next  month,  we

bring   along  GLCs  and  SMEs  together,  including   Muslim

businessmen  this time, because some of them  will  find  the

Muslim market in China of interest to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to helping start-up companies, particularly in high-tech, with a lifeline, as I have explained to Mr Singh

earlier, we are doing it but not as a handout, and it will be

disastrous for our own reputation if we just hand  out  money

to  people  who  cannot  be saved.   But  if  they  are  good

investments,  we  are open to the possibilities.   We  remain

committed to TIF.  In fact, we will be increasing the quantum

of TIF.  We maintain our links to all the top venture capital

funds  in  Silicon Valley and other parts of the world.   And

our  commitment  to  the  promotion of  technopreneurship  in

Singapore is a long-term one, and the dot-com crash  has  not

reduced our enthusiasm for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

so  far  we  have been highlighting the IT and  manufacturing

downturn.  The building construction has been going through a

downturn  since  the  last  Asian crisis.   The  very  recent

recession  is more or less a final knockout blow.  Would  the

Minister  consider  accelerating some of the  infrastructural

projects  and  perhaps  some  of  the  Government's  building

programmes, so that at least they can provide a little bit of

smelling  salt to revive this poor chap who has been  knocked

out?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the real

estate  developers have been in communication  with  MTI.   I

have  met  a number of them personally to hear their concerns

and  their views of the real estate market in Singapore.   It

is a very important part of the domestic economy.  It is one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>



market  which  we  have some control over and  therefore  one

which  we should watch carefully the development of.  We  are

accelerating  infrastructural projects.  I  mentioned  Jurong

Island,   polytechnics  and  universities,  sewerage   works,

drainage,  roads, tunnels, and so on.  If we over-accelerate,

we  may end up doing things which are unnecessary and wasting

money.  Worse, we may do things  in a rush we should not have

done.   So  this  acceleration package which I  talked  about

earlier  is the best that we can do at this stage, given  the

amount of time that we have.  In the coming months, if  there

are  other  possibilities of bringing forward infrastructural

projects, we will certainly consider doing those things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the property market, it will find its own balance.

It  is not as if transactions have stopped.  But at the right

prices,  transactions continue.  And from time to  time,  you

hear  of  projects  which are reasonably priced  which  clear

reasonably  well.   So I listened to real  estate  developers

very carefully, but also know where they are coming from, and

from  MTI's  perspective, our responsibility is not  just  to

them but also to home buyers and to Singaporeans generally.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first, I would agree with the Minister's approach that  while

looking at the difficulties that are presently before us,  we

should not lose sight that the middle and long-term prospects

are  not bleak but relatively good.  And in preparing for it,

I  think  we should also look at some of the lessons that  we

have  learned from the last Asian currency crisis.   Most  of

the problems then had been with the CPF and wage cuts and  we

are  helping workers to adjust.  I am quite enlightened about

Government  still continuing with recruitment.  I would  like

to  ask  whether  the  Government  will  also  recruit  older

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the wage levels which we are

talking about, especially with the lower income workers.  You

can say that there will be pressures to bring wages down, but

there  is also a problem of having, as Singaporeans,  certain

living

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>



standards and our own cost of living to maintain, and  living

standards  have  been  down.  If we  allow  freely  the  wage

pressures  to  go  down, it would mean  lowering  our  living

standards which is not good for all Singaporeans.  Therefore,

how are we going to do that and build social cohesion?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other element is that during the economic crisis ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Thomas, are you making a speech?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> No, I am asking questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ask your questions now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> One is whether Government will

recruit;  two  is  how do we prevent wages for  lower  income

dropping too low such that they cannot maintain their  living

standards?   And  the third question is this.   In  the  last

economic  crisis, we heard about executives and  people  who,

instead of being retrenched, were terminated and they  had  a

lot of hardship because they lost their jobs and they had  no

retrenchment benefit, and there was some abuse of the system.

What would the Government do about that?  The other point  is

this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Thomas, can you be direct and ask your

question?  Because we have a lot of other Members waiting  to

ask their questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you have any more questions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> One more. The last one is on the

Singapore  dollar.  During this crisis we  have  a  weakening

Singapore dollar.  The CPF has already been cut.  How  do  we

protect the value of the CPF?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

employment  of  older workers, I assure Mr  Thomas  that  the

Government  will  not  be a laggard in  this  area.   On  the

importance  of social cohesion at a time like this,  I  think

many of us were very appreciative of NTUC's announcement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>



yesterday to lower prices for low income groups and  to  help

children of retrenched workers.  I think that package touched

a  lot  of people.  And, where we can, all of us, in our  own

way,  should  help.  In this way, the crisis  bonds  us  more

closely  together and grassroots here will  play  a  critical

role.   The  role played by the NTUC in the restructuring  of

Singapore economy is an enormously important one.  There  are

many things that we take for granted in Singapore which other

countries  cannot  do,  not because  they  do  not  have  the

knowledge, but because they face opposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, when a Japanese Minister visited us,

he  asked  to visit PSA, and he wants PSA to take a stake  in

one of the Japanese ports.  And he lamented that, when he was

a young man, Yokohama was one of the world's great ports, but

now  Singapore  and Hong Kong have surged  so  far  ahead  of

Yokohama.   He wants to turn things around.  He  cannot,  not

because  the Japanese do not have the knowledge, but  because

the unions block change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways to adjust to change. One, you put

friction,  slow it down so that the pain is  less.   But  the

result  is  when  the change comes, the  pain  will  be  much

greater.   Or  you say, "OK, these are the hot spots.   Let's

lubricate.   Let's be a bit more tolerant, send  workers  for

training, give allowances, help the unemployed."  That is our

way.   And we have been able to achieve this only because  in

many  of  the programmes which we announced earlier, we  have

been  able to work very closely with the NTUC.  So the  NTUC,

in  terms  of attracting investments to Singapore, is  really

one  of  our  most important weapons, and the  point  of  our

social  cohesion is a very important one.  And  if  there  is

abuse  by employers in the way they treat workers or retrench

workers,  I say, "We come down like a ton of bricks  on  them

because  there is a social contract."  These are  the  rules.

We  all work together because these rules apply to all of us.

If  you are not required to, then we bite our tongue and say,

"Yes,  that  is  your prerogative."  But if  you  breach  the

rules, then I say, "MOM will go after them."  And

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>



if we know of such cases, I say, "Let's blow the whistle."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the value of the Singapore dollar, we manage the

Singapore  dollar  in  order to preserve  the  value  of  the

currency.   We do not fool around with it in order  to  alter

wage level.  And that is the reason why we have been able  to

maintain the value of the CPF, and that is a policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the

Minister  questions  in  three  areas.   First,  the  overall

strategy.  I agree that globalisation is the only way to  go.

But  does the Minister think our economy is as robust  as  it

should be?   In 1998, we seemed to be one of the last one  to

enter  the recession and now we seem to be one of the  first.

Is that a misperception?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, pump priming. With these measures, will the

Government  be  in  deficit?   And  if  it  is  going  to  be

projecting a deficit, will it actually achieve one?  Because,

again,  in the past, we projected a deficit, but we  did  not

achieve it.  Perhaps, we under spent.  In respect of the pump

priming  of  infrastructure projects, I agree  it  is  not  a

question of quantum, but actually achieving it.  And in  this

respect,  the role of the PWD, which we talked about  earlier

in  this  House,  has  to  be  really  looked  at,  with  the

moratorium of five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is the Government's help for the

individuals.   Sir,  I would like to ask the  Minister  again

about the training allowance brought up by my colleague,  the

MP  for  Tanjong Pagar GRC Dr Vasoo.  If this is the training

allowance  for  programmes which we  believe   truly  provide

training,  why does the Minister believe that it might  be  a

"disguised dole" or is in danger of being so?  And if it is a

true  training  programme, why should our allowance  be  $600

which  is  not  a  living  wage?   And  in  connection   with

individuals again, the question of keeping enough savings  in

the CPF and keeping costs down low for the company to survive

is very real.  Can I then ask the Minister, if we do generate

budget surpluses, whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>



we anticipate a larger top-up in order to meet the shortfall?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much as I

would  like  to  answer many of Mr Simon Tay's  questions,  I

cannot  do so because they are really the prerogative of  the

Finance  Minister.   You know it is very easy  to  achieve  a

budget  deficit.  In most countries, they achieve it  without

difficulty.   And  I do not think we should  set  that  as  a

target at all.  If we need to spend on a particular programme

because we are in difficulty, if it improves our capacity, we

will do so, but not in order to spend money for its own sake.

I  think  that will be a disaster.  The reason  why  we  have

survived  previous crises and emerged stronger from  each  of

them  is  because  we have been disciplined,  and  we  should

continue to be so.  And if we do not make major mistakes this

time  round,  we will not emerge worse off.  I  think  it  is

important  not  to  lose  sight of  the  importance  of  that

disciplined response to problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether the allowance can become a

dole  and,  if it is not a dole, why can it not be increased.

But  one  shades off into the other.  And if you put yourself

into  the  mind  of the individual, beyond a point,  he  will

attend  any course because it pays him well.  So we have  got

to  be  mindful.  There is a trade-off.  There is an  optimal

point to be struck and we should strike it carefully, and not

blithely take the position that the more the better.  It need

not  be.   It can lead to a lot of other problems, maybe  not

for the individual himself, but for other people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not think the Minister

has   answered  my  questions  on  the  CPF  top-up  and  the

robustness of the economy.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> On direct income support, as I

said  earlier,  if we need to do more, because of  widespread

unemployment,  we  will  do so.   That  I  am  sure  will  be

announced either during the Budget or earlier or later if the

situation warrants it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the robustness of the economy, it is a big question.

Our  economy  is  quite diversified, both  in  terms  of  the

balance   between   services   and   manufacturing,    within

manufacturing  itself,  and in our  geographical  dependence.

Our  strategy has always been not to be completely  dependent

upon  one market or one country.  And that is one reason why,

when  negotiating  all these free trade agreements,  we  make

sure  that we have broadband economic connectivity  with  all

parts  of  the  world.  What is unfortunate is that  all  the

planets are now in the wrong alignment simultaneously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do a regression analysis of the Singapore economy

with the key variables, although the variables are connected,

these  three  variables stand out  -   the  US  economy,  the

semiconductor cycle, Malaysia and Indonesia.  The US  economy

is  down,  semiconductor is down, Malaysia and Indonesia  are

not  in the best position.  Maybe, and this is a prayer, with

the  opening  of  a new chapter in Indonesia under  President

Megawati, one planet has moved out of this misalignment.   We

had  a  meeting  in  MTI yesterday, we are  quietly  hopeful.

Indonesia is a major trading partner of Singapore.  It brings

opportunities to many little businessmen all over the island.

If  Indonesia can restore political stability, the rupiah, as

it  is,  makes  Indonesia highly competitive  even  vis-a-vis

China.  And if they can establish free trade zones in various

parts  of the archipelago and create conditions which  assure

businessmen of stability, I think they can take off.   And  I

was  cheered  that the US, the EU, Japan, the IMF,  have  all

come  up  with  strong  statements in  support  of  President

Megawati.   We would do our part, but we are small.   We  can

only  play  a catalytic role.  If the situation in  Indonesia

does improve, that is one bright spot for Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we will continue with more

questions  after  the tea break.  I suspend the  Sitting  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  a  question on the robustness of our economic strategy.

Sir, going by the retrenchment trends during the previous and

current  crises,  it  would  appear  that  the  manufacturing

sector,  particularly  electronics,  is  more  vulnerable  to

regional  cost  and  global demand  factors  than,  say,  the

services sector.  I would therefore like to ask the Minister,

firstly,  if  there  is  a need to revisit  the  strategy  of

building the economy on the twin pillars of manufacturing and

services,  and,  secondly,  what really  is  our  ability  to

diversify away from the huge reliance on electronics.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we continue

to  hold strongly the view that we must keep manufacturing as

an   important  part  of  our  economy  and  to   have   both

manufacturing and services as twin engines of our growth.  In

the  last  economic crisis, without manufacturing,  we  would

have  been in deep trouble.  This time round, both are  down.

Next  time round, it may be the other way.  So it is hard  to

say.    The   fact   that  we  have  both,  gives   us   more

diversification.  But, of course, the world is  changing,  IT

is  changing  the nature of industry.  Within  manufacturing,

within electronics itself, we have to diversify and move into

more knowledge-intensive activities the best way we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is one reason why we are making very major

investments in the bio-medical sciences.  It will  take  many

years before that sector bears fruit but, if we do not do the

work  now,  there will be no harvest later.  Our hope  is  to

make  that  the fourth pillar of manufacturing in  Singapore,

after electronics, engineering and petrochemicals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

whilst I agree with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>



approach   taken  by  the  Government,  especially   when   I

personally  think that the economy may well  recover  in  the

second  half  of next year, I would like to ask the  Minister

whether he could take steps to rectify the situation  on  the

ground, of which I am very deeply concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you could bear with me, I would like to use an

example to illustrate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you get directly to your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Yes, Sir. I will put what I want

to say in a question form, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would the Minister look at situations where, like

the  self-employed, because they need to renew their business

licences to continue their business, are not allowed to do so

because  they  have not contributed to the CPF  and,  because

they  are not allowed to do so, they are threatened with  the

cancellation  of  licences and, therefore,  their  livelihood

will be destroyed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he can look at

this  situation  as  well  as  right  across  all  Government

agencies,  bodies,  departments  and  ministries  where  such

regulations may be present to cause further hardship to those

already suffering financial hardship.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

genuine cases and we should handle them in a sympathetic way.

As  an  MP myself, I have received such cases and there  are,

among them, some really genuine ones which we should support.

So  I  will convey his particular request on the CPF  to  the

Ministry  of  Manpower  and, on the  more  general  point  of

reviewing  our  rules  and regulations,  to  make  them  more

business-friendly,  this  is  an  on-going   exercise.    And

whatever  views  or  problems that businessmen  face,  please

raise them either to me directly or to this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

downturn seems to have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>



caught  everybody by surprise.  Just only about three  months

ago,  we thought the economy was going to expand quite nicely

this  year.  The question I want to ask the Minister is:  how

is  it  that  our econometric model can be off  the  mark  so

quickly?  Is it a model that we can use, for example, to take

economic  decisions on what is going to happen  further  down

the road?  If not, are we just going to base our decisions on

US leading indicators, like Mexico?  In other words, how good

is our forecasting?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to ask the Minister is: despite

the   bright   spot  of  China  entering  the   World   Trade

Organisation,  there  is concern among the  business  circle,

those  I talk to, that getting the Olympic Games to be staged

in  Beijing  is  likely  to soak up  or  suck  in  a  lot  of

investments   away  from  Asia.   What  is   the   Minister's

assessment of this, Sir?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first

point  about the accuracy of econometric modelling, the model

is  only as good as we understand the world and we must  have

good  inputs.  Globalisation has reduced inventory cycles  so

that  when  there  is a shock in one part of  the  world,  it

transmits  very  quickly to other parts.  Old assumptions  no

longer  hold  true.  Last year, because of the Nasdaq  crash,

Christmas  sales  in the US were down.  By November/December,

it  was  felt  by  purchasers, it was felt by the  airfreight

companies.    By  January,  Federal  Express  cut   back   on

employment  because they saw the economy  turning  down.   In

Singapore,  we  had a wafer fab which still  had  full  order

books  in February and they rushed to complete it.  And  they

broke  a record from "Sand to Silicon in 16 months",  but  by

the  time they opened the fab, the order book had fallen out,

to their regret.  And this is because the transmission is now

almost  direct, that when orders are placed, they are  placed

not only with those who supply the items, the same orders are

sent  to the supplier's supplier's suppliers.  And the result

is inventory buffers have come down sharply and there is much

less  buffer in the economic system as a whole, which is  why

shocks get transmitted very quickly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>



The  good  thing is: if we can come down so quickly,  we  can

also   climb  up  quickly.   That  is  the  obverse  of  this

conclusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a problem. Last year, we kept on reviewing our

economic  forecast upwards;  this year, we kept on  reviewing

it  downwards.  I do not think we can do any better,  because

this is a global problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister has not responded to

my second point about China, on the Olympic Games.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

quite know enough about this to give a considered reply to Mr

Chng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of

the greatest problems SMEs are facing in this downturn is the

sudden  decline in orders and decline in revenue  and,  as  a

result,  some  SMEs are not able to get enough cash  flow  to

service  the  interest.  I wonder whether the Government  can

actually  do something to help these companies in  the  short

term  service  their  interest or  even  some  other  working

capital problems.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when times

get  more difficult, it is natural that interest rates go  up

for  higher-risk loans, and some companies face  difficulties

getting  financing  for working capital.  The  assessment  of

such  risks cannot be done by the Government, cannot be  done

by  PSB.   It  can  only  be done by banks  and  by  lenders.

Whether  or not we can tweak LEFS in such a way as to provide

some assistance is something that we can consider, but I need

to get my staff to study it more carefully before agreeing to

the proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

the  Minister  two questions.  The first is: the  package  is

silent  on  measures to help the unemployed or retrenched  to

service home mortgages, unlike the schemes available in 1998.

I  would  like  to know whether the Government has  plans  to

provide  such schemes in light of the fact that about  20,000

are expected to be retrenched this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is on the calibration of the

Government's response.  In 1998, the growth was 0.5% and  the

Government came out with a $10 billion package.  Even netting

off the CPF wage cut aspect, it was still about $2.5 billion.

This  time round, our forecast is 0.5% to 1.5%.  So  the  low

end  is in a similar range to 1998 and, as the Minister says,

it  is  structuring a bottom.  So we have not seen the bottom

yet.   The  package of $2.2 billion, in fact,  includes  some

carry-through measures from the last cycle.  So the  question

really  is:   why  is  the  Government  being  somewhat  more

restrained  this  time in its package when  compared  to  the

situation in 1998?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said

earlier,  the  retrenchment problem is still not  widespread.

There is widespread fear because of growing retrenchment, but

the  retrenchment itself is not yet widespread.  We can sense

this at our meet-the-people sessions - the number of hardship

cases  that  we  are  seeing.  If it does become  widespread,

which  means  that our darker scenario is the  more  accurate

one,  then we may need a package of income support for  those

who are in distress.  But we have not reached that point yet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my

second question on calibration of response.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I

answered that we have to calibrate our response to the actual

situation.   If  this  turns out to  be  a  relatively  short

downturn  and at the end of this year or early next year  the

global  economy turns up again, then these measures which  Mr

Iswaran talks about ought not to be necessary.  But if it  is

more prolonged, which is entirely possible, then we will have

to  do more.   And some of what we do will have to be in  the

form of direct income support to individuals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the area of

tourism,  which  I  think  can help  our  retail  sector,  my

question  is:   why  are we satisfied with just  double-digit

growth?   I  think there are a lot more Chinese tourists  out

there who are interested to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>



come to Singapore.  So what are the plans that are being  put

in  place  to  attract more of them to  come  here,  to  stay

longer, to spend more and also to buy more branded goods, eg,

jewellery, watches, etc?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether the Ministry has plans

to weed out those unscrupulous tour agents and shopkeepers.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Goh is

right  that  tourism  is  one sector  which  we  should  give

particular  promotion  to during this  period.   And  tourism

arrivals from China and India will put food on the table  for

many families in Singapore.  Therefore, this is an area which

we  should  try  to do more on.  It is likely that  Singapore

Tourism Board will open more offices in China to exploit  the

rapid  growth in Chinese tourism beyond China.  They  already

have  a  very  large domestic tourism, but as  each  province

builds  up  its  middle-class, the desire to travel  is  very

great,  and many of them like to come to Singapore.   And  we

should welcome them.  For historical reasons, because we were

afraid that some of these tourists may in fact turn out to be

illegal migrants, we have put all kinds of controls in  order

to  ensure  adequate safeguards.  We have  relaxed  some  two

years ago, and MTI is now taking the issue up to MHA again to

see   whether  we  can  relax  it  further,  to   make   visa

applications easier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about the consumption of Chinese tourists,

many of them come here on package tours which are very cheap.

Then,  when they come here, instead of being brought  to  see

cultural sites, they are brought to shop and they are made to

pay  high  prices because these are the only shops  they  are

brought  to.  We have been collecting statistics.   They  are

high spenders, especially in jewellery items.  On the Chinese

side,  they have been wanting us to help them weed out  these

zero-cost  package tours, which are really an abuse,  and  we

are  working with them but it is not quite easy, because that

is the way the market is operating.  If people want such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>



tours, they will get such tours, one way or the other.  It is

like going to Las Vegas.

<div align="center"><b>CUSHIONING THE IMPACT OF THE DOWNTURN</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, in summary, we support

what Mr Goh has proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, on the enhanced

Skills Redevelopment Programme whereby employers need to  pay

only  20%  of  course fees, may I know how  soon  can  it  be

implemented?   As  we  know,  many  companies  need  to  send

hundreds  of  their  workers for SRP training  but  they  are

facing  this  cashflow problem of paying 100% of  the  course

fees first.  In particular, a company which sends 200 workers

for  a $3,000 programme, it would cost them $600,000 and  the

claim from Government takes months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is whether the Minister will agree

with Mr Simon Tay's suggestion of keeping PWD Corporation out

of  public projects.  If so, the workers from PWD Corporation

will suffer and be retrenched.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, in reply to Mr Seng Han

Thong's first question, as quickly as possible, there will be

no  unnecessary  delay in working out  the  details  of  this

programme.   On PWD, our responsibility is not  only  to  the

industries.  It is also to those workers in PWD who work with

us faithfully for all these years.  So when we told them that

we were going

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>



to  privatise it, we owed them a responsibility and we had to

encourage  them  to  move  out from  a  permanent  Government

service into a private company.  To give them that assurance,

and  they have families to support, we told them, "All right,

five  years' moratorium."  I think we should stick to it  and

not because we are under pressure, cause a breach of faith in

the solemn undertaking which we gave them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to pose two questions to

the  Minister.   May  I ask whether the  HDB  rental  rebates

announced  earlier  would more than  offset  the  recent  HDB

rental hikes, or would the Minister consider reversing  these

HDB rental hikes to give an even better impact on these post-budget  measures?  Could I also ask the Minister  whether  he

would  give  more  incentives to  businesses,  factories  and

manufacturers to turn the downturn time to opportune time  by

helping   them  to  revamp  and  upgrade  to  improve   their

competitive edge and their productivity?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Dr Lily Neo had an

exchange with Minister Mah Bow Tan earlier on this particular

issue of rental rebates.  There are really two choices.   For

those  who  are  already below market rental, we  could  have

said,  "Look,  you do not qualify for the additional  rebates

because you are already below market rental." Or we say, "Let

us  separate the two aspects".  There is already a  long-term

policy  to bring them up to market rentals so that  shops  on

the  same row operate on a level playing field and,  on  that

basis,  we  give  them their rebates.  Or have  two  separate

classes of shops.  I agree with Minister Mah Bow Tan that the

one  we  have  proposed is the fairest.   As  to  whether  in

specific dollars and cents for particular shops, whether  the

net  result  is positive or negative, that question  I  would

have to refer to Minister Mah Bow Tan for response because  I

am  not  familiar with the exact details.  It probably varies

from shop to shop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other question about incentives to help our

shops upgrade and become more productive, as you know,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>



we  have many programmes under PSB to help them.  It  is  not

easy.   Very often, it depends on whether their own  children

are  prepared  to  take over those shops  and  to  have  them

upgraded.  For those whose children are not prepared to  join

their fathers' shops, then we have got a scheme to help  them

exit.  I believe each is given a grant of $48,000.  We cannot

avoid this restructuring.  Basically, we have too much retail

space in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in Bedok Reservoir, Sheng Siong opened a new

supermarket.   They  say, "Special sale - eight  cucumbers  - $0.30".   Everyone flocks there.  My residents are  all  very

happy. But all the neighbourhood shops are very unhappy.  Can

we  stop  it?   Is it good to stop it?  Even if there  is  no

Sheng  Siong,  there is Carrefour, there is  Walmart.   There

will be other chains operating, which will be able to sell at

lower  costs  because  they  have  got  better  supply  chain

management and they have got stronger purchasing power.   Our

job  is  to  facilitate adjustment, not to  add  friction  to

market adjustment.  That is the approach we are taking.   For

those  who  want to make the adjustment, we help them  in  as

many  ways as we can.  For those who want to exit, we try  to

make it as easy for them to exit as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, the "People for Jobs" Traineeship

Programme is a good programme to help workers who would  find

it  difficult to take up technical based courses.   Does  the

Government have any estimates of the number of people who can

be  considered as most vulnerable, people who would  find  it

very  difficult to move into technical lines?   What  is  our

target of training places for this programme?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I do not have the

detailed forecast.  The Ministry of Manpower would have them.

But  the  basic policy is clear that we will do  as  much  as

there  is  demand.  In other words, budget  would  not  be  a

constraint and if there are better ways to make the programme

work, we will do as much as possible. This is a big group  in

Singapore,  the baby-boomers, many of whom do not  even  have

more than six years of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>



education.  They will be in the system for another 20  to  30

years  and  our  fear  is  that many  of  them  would  become

demoralised  if they are not able to find gainful employment.

With  this economic downturn, there is widespread fear  among

them  that  if they are retrenched, it is very difficult  for

them  to get a job again.  We must find various ways to  help

them.   We have proposed some initial measures but our people

are  still  thinking about them.  The unions  and  employers'

associations  are also thinking of them.  As  and  when  good

ideas  come  forth, we will implement them.   But  the  basic

position  is to do as much as we need to do and budget  ought

not to be a constraint.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVICE COLLEGE BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service College is currently a department

under  the  Public Service Division, comprising the Institute

of  Public  Administration and Management, the  Institute  of

Policy  Development and the Civil Service  Consulting  Group.

The  College  is the key supplier of training and consultancy

services to the civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to fold in the Personnel Guidance

Unit,  another  department under the Public Service  Division

and  restructure  the combined entity into  a  new  statutory

board  under the Public Service Division to be known  as  the

Civil Service College.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Bill is to provide the legislative

framework for the formation of this new statutory board.  The

Government  places  great emphasis on the training  of  civil

servants.   Our target is to give every officer at least  100

hours  of  training  per year.  Public  sector  organisations

cannot deliver effective, high level of service unless public

servants  are  well-trained.  It is not only about  equipping

officers  with  work-based skills  to  better  perform  their

duties,   but   with  management  tools  for   organisational

development.   We also want to imbue in them the  appropriate

values and mindset as public servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's intense competition for talent, good people

consider  more  than pay and career prospects  when  deciding

whether  to  take  up a job. They also look for  avenues  for

further  training and personal development in the  course  of

their work.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



The  public  service will not be able to recruit  and  retain

good   officers   if  it  does  not  offer  them   meaningful

opportunities  to  be trained and developed  for  challenging

assignments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Civil Service College plays a key role in

training  civil  servants.   It offers  a  wide  spectrum  of

programmes.    There   are  courses  on  management   issues,

including  human resource management and employee performance

management,  and operational matters like use of  IT  in  the

public service, service quality, finance and accounting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other courses focus on leadership and policy

development.  The College also provides consultancy  services

on    public    sector    reform    initiatives,    promoting

organisational,   people  and  system   development   through

programmes  like  learning  organisation,  people   developer

standards, the ISO 9000 and the SQA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the frontiers of the knowledge economy are

constantly advancing and our operating environment is rapidly

changing.   Public officers have to keep their knowledge  and

skills  up to date to stay relevant and productive.  We  thus

have  to  continually improve existing programmes offered  by

the  College,  as well as to develop new programmes  to  meet

fresh  requirements.  We also have to pay  attention  to  the

delivery   of  training  programmes  and  the  organisational

structure  of the College.  Our aim is to make training  more

accessible  to public sector organisations and help  them  in

their organisational development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the background to the plan to convert the Civil

Service  College  into a self-funding statutory  board  under

PSD.    The   College's  activities,  such  as  new  training

programmes  and  consultancy projects,  typically  have  long

gestation periods.  The College has to bear the developmental

cost first and recoup them when the projects are completed or

the  new  programmes are rolled out.  Some of  the  College's

programmes  would  then  have application  beyond  the  civil

service.   As  a statutory board, the College can internalise

their  cost and revenues from its activities and so  maintain

more flexible control over its finances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of human resources, the demand

for  the  Civil  Service College's training  and  consultancy

services  is not constant over time.  The College  needs  the

flexibility  to  assemble  teams of  competent  trainers  and

consultants,  in  sync  with  its work  schedules,  including

employing  them  on  short-term basis for specific  projects.

The College will be able to do this much more effectively  as

a statutory board rather than as a Government department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Guidance Unit is presently not part of the

College.   It  provides  consultancy  services  and   applied

organisational   psychology.    It   helps   public    sector

organisations  select  new  recruits,  as  well  as   provide

programmes   for  organisational  diagnosis   and   personnel

development.  These are closely related to the Civil  Service

College's   broader   consultancy   services   on   promoting

organisational  excellence. Putting  the  Personnel  Guidance

Unit  together  with the College will enable the  College  to

provide an integrated range of services spanning assessments,

selection, training and organisational development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the main aspects of the Bill. The

board of the statutory board shall consist of a Chairman  and

5  to 15 other members, all of whom shall be appointed by the

Minister, as provided by clause 5.  The statutory board  will

take  on  the existing functions of the Civil Service College

and  Personnel  Guidance Unit.  The primary function  of  the

statutory  board  will  be  to provide  training  for  public

servants    and   contribute   to   the   public    service's

organisational  development efforts.  The functions,  objects

and duties of the statutory board are laid out in clause 13.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 18 to 29 are the financial provisions. The

statutory  board will be self-funded with its main source  of

funding being fees for the services it provides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of property, liabilities and employees are

provided  in  clauses 30 to 36.  All properties,  assets  and

liabilities  of  the  Civil  Service  College  and  Personnel

Guidance Unit departments will be transferred to the  College

upon its formation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



All  the  employees of the two departments,  apart  from  the

Administrative Officers,

will also be transferred to the statutory board at terms that

are  no  less favourable than those enjoyed by the  employees

before the transfer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions in the Bill are standard provisions

found in the Acts of other statutory boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has been continually restructuring

itself   to  stay  effective  and  relevant  in  a   changing

environment.  We have been spinning off statutory boards from

the  Ministry  to give them more autonomy and flexibility  in

their  operations.   We  have separated  the  regulatory  and

operating functions of some statutory boards, hiving off  and

corporatising  their  operating  functions  into  independent

companies and setting up regulatory agencies to supervise the

industries.   As  new  issues and areas emerge  which  demand

focused  attention,  we are also merging  existing  statutory

boards  and  setting up new ones.  The work of restructuring,

however,  is never finished.  The restructuring of the  Civil

Service  College,  as a statutory board, will  enable  it  to

better  focus on training and organisational development  for

the public service.  This will help us to further upgrade the

College   and  enhance  its  value  to  the  public  service.

Ultimately,  this  should  result in  better  trained  public

servants who will help to create a first-class public service

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, a lot is expected of the civil

service.   It  has  to continue to be efficient,  responsive,

innovative  and service oriented if it were to meet  the  new

demands  and  needs  of the public and  to  function  in  the

restructuring process of the Government organisations.  It is

especially  true  now  as  our society  is  undergoing  rapid

changes,  especially  in  the way  people  communicate.   The

Internet has made it possible for people to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>



give  feedback more directly.  It has also resulted in demand

for e-services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service College has a very important role in

training  civil  servants to meet this challenge,  especially

because  the Government aspires for the civil service  to  be

among  the best in the world.  Indeed, the quality  of  civil

servants  determines whether the public service  is  able  to

respond  to the new challenges and demands.  In this context,

I  would  like  to  ask how would the Civil  Service  College

respond  to  the challenge of civil service in  providing  e-services  to  the  public, ie, how the College  supports  the

civil  service in this challenge, and how the College  itself

is  responding to the challenge of e-services.  Secondly, how

would  the  College assist officers who are  moved  from  one

department  or Ministry to another so that they can  continue

to function efficiently?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the plan for the Civil Service College

laid out by the Deputy Prime Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I rise to support

the  incorporation of the Civil Service College as a separate

entity  to  allow it to be run autonomously, efficiently  and

effectively.   The Civil Service College, if run successfully

and  getting our civil servants to discharge their duties and

responsibilities diligently, will not only benefit the  civil

servants  but also the members of the public whom  the  civil

servants serve.  I see a lot of potential for the College  to

network with the industries and private sector organisations,

both  in  Singapore and overseas.  I am sure that the College

will be seeking out opportunities to benefit from opening  to

and  participation  from  the academia,  the  private  sector

companies and professional services firms.  As some MNCs will

become powerful and influential in the globalised world,  the

public  sector  officers need to understand  how  these  MNCs

work.  The civil service should also benchmark itself against

the best practices adopted by excellent globalised MNCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have an excellent public service. We have an

established  tradition  of  evolving  and  strengthening  the

performance standards of our civil servants.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>



have   sound  policies  and  effective  execution  by   civil

servants.   Of course, we have the odd occasion of  failures,

of  doing  things  less  well.  All  these  have  become  the

institutional  memory  and wealth knowledge  and  information

retained  in  our  public service.  The world  is  converging

towards  requiring  high standards of ethics  and  governance

from governments for its citizens.  There is a need for civil

servants and entrepreneurs, CEOs and professional managers to

understand  each  other.   The  College  can  facilitate  the

exchange   and  participation  in  each  other's   work   and

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has benefitted from the experience of many

established public service of developed countries.   We  have

learnt  from  them  and adapted in ways  that  work  best  in

Singapore.  Sir, I think it is now our turn to help the  less

developed  countries  to  improve  the  standard  of   public

servants for the benefit of the citizens of the world.  And I

hope  the  Civil  Service  College  will  provide  space  and

opportunities  for  the public sector employees  of  overseas

countries.  Like the Jamaican MP who is impressed with Senior

Minister  Lee  Kuan  Yew's  memoirs  in  how  Singapore   has

succeeded when many others had failed, and we also read  from

the  press report of Chinese bureaucrats who decided that  by

doing the Master in Public Administration is better than  the

MBA  because  it  is  more appropriate  to  their  work,  are

examples  of  the attitudes and actions taken by well-meaning

civil  servants if opportunities are made available for  them

to carve a career in the public service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As learning has become even more important in the

globalised and deregulated world and the active participation

of citizens on our civil society, I would urge the Government

to  continue  to provide the necessary funds and  support  in

ensuring that adequate resources are provided.  In the  fast-changing  world, civil servants also require to be adequately

trained and developed for their jobs.  As the iron rice  bowl

mentality of civil service is a thing of the past, the  well-trained civil servants can take comfort that they can make  a

career switch with ease, making

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>



use of their skills, knowledge and experience in their second

and subsequent careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I presume that the Civil Service College

will  train all levels of public servants from the lowest  to

the  highest  grades.   This is in  line  with  the  learning

culture which we wish to inculcate in Singapore.  The  nature

of  work  requires people working in teams.  It  requires  an

integrated and inter-disciplinary approach to problem solving

and innovation in the delivering of services to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with its new character and status, I have no doubt

that  the  College will become a world-class  institution  of

learning for Singapore's civil servants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would support the

establishment of the Civil Service College as an  institution

of  education  to improve the quality of our civil  servants.

This  College, I understand, is not new.  It was  already  in

existence  on  or about the time when the PAP took  power  in

1959  or thereabouts.  But I wonder why after nearly 40 years

the Government wants  to formalise its establishment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the formal establishment of such a

College, but I have some reservations.  A glaring anomaly  is

that  it  is supposed to be an institution of education,  but

turns  out  to be more a political institution.   It  is  not

formed  under  the jurisdiction of the Ministry of  Education

but   under  the  charge  of  the  Prime  Minister's  Office.

Politicians are made to be in charge of this College and  not

professional educators.  I think this is significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand to be corrected, Sir. I believe that it was

formed  in  the early days to educate civil servants  on  the

threat  of  Communism and dangerous left-wing elements  which

were  present  in  those early days.  But, today,  there  are

hardly such threats any more.  Communism in Russia and  China

has  collapsed for good.  Both these countries have abandoned

Communism as a doctrine and there is no fear of spread of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>



Communism  to other countries, including Singapore,  anymore.

If such is the case, then what is the thrust of the teachings

of the College these days?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well known for its efficiency. I certainly

have  no objections to the training of our civil servants  to

be  efficient, but I hope that the efficiency  of  our  civil

servants is neutral to all parties.  The civil servants  must

serve  the  whole population without any fear or favour,  and

not  to favour any political parties.  Sir, I would take this

opportunity to tell the civil servants in Singapore that  the

Opposition in Singapore is a loyal opposition.  We are  loyal

to  the Constitution and loyal to Singapore.  We are just  as

responsible  as the ruling party or any other Singaporean  in

regard  to nation building, and keeping Singapore a  peaceful

and prosperous place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying this because in my early days of

participating  in politics, my experience was that  when  the

Opposition  made an application to the HDB or to  the  Police

for  a  public  entertainment licence, we were  treated  with

suspicion  by  civil  servants.  Those applications  were  in

relation to a simple thing like holding a public dinner,  and

yet there was always a long delay.  There was always complete

silence  to our application.  And what we had to  do  was  to

send  constant  reminders and make  telephone  calls  to  the

authorities, but we got no answers.  Those applications, mind

you,  were not earth shattering applications.  They were just

simple procedural applications to hold a public dinner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience was that when I telephoned an officer, he

would  say, "Oh, your application has gone all the  way  up."

My  goodness,  can  you  believe  that?   It  was  a   simple

application, and the application went all the way up, and  no

answer  had come down yet.  That was why there was  a  delay.

Sir,  I  am  not exaggerating.  A simple application  of  the

Opposition  to hold a public dinner, and yet our  application

had  to  go all the way up to the top.  Any application  from

the Opposition appeared to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>



like a hot potato to the civil servants, and no one wanted to

make a decision on it.

With the formal establishment of the Civil Service College, I

hope that the right things can be taught in this College,  to

defuse  the  fear  and suspicion of the Opposition,  and  not

treat  us  as  if  we are like animals with horns  and  sharp

teeth.  I would like to remind the civil servants that we are

also  Singaporeans who treat Singapore as our home.  Our true

intention  is also to make Singapore a better place  to  live

in.   I  hope this message somehow can get into the teachings

of the Civil Service College.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I will

take  Mr Chiam's points first since they are fresh and  vivid

in our minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is mistaken. The Civil Service College has

nothing to do with the Political Study Centre.  The Political

Study  Centre is what the PAP Government set up in 1959  when

it  first  came  into  power in order to  educate  the  civil

servants  in the realities of Singapore's politics  and  what

the   communist  threat  was  and  what  the  nation-building

priorities  were.   That  was in  1959.   The  Civil  Service

College  is  the  successor of what used to be  called  CSSDI

(Civil Service Staff and Development Institute) which was  at

Heng  Mui  Keng  Terrace  at Pasir Panjang.   It  runs  staff

courses,  courses for middle management, courses  for  senior

management,  courses on governance, courses on  good  English

writing, courses on how to be a good civil servant, including

how to deal expeditiously with difficult hot potatoes!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSSDI had been there for many years. It was converted

into  a  Civil Service College about a decade ago and now  we

are going to convert this into a statutory board, so that  it

can  operate  more  flexibly and have more leeway  in  hiring

people  and  taking people on contract, in  doing  activities

beyond  the strict traditional mandate.  Because, as  Mr  Loh

Meng  See  says, the Civil Service College also has  to  have

links  with  what is happening in the outside  world,  to  be

benchmarked against best practices amongst the MNCs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the two are totally separate, and politics is not in

charge,  neither  are  politicians  in  charge.   These   are

professional  educational courses which need to  be  run  for

civil   servants  at  all  levels,  from  the  top  Permanent

Secretary potential, all the way down to the clerical officer

or  to the EO.  So it is a completely neutral outfit.  It has

nothing to do with the travails or the vicissitudes which the

Opposition gets into from time to time.  I have no doubt that

we  will  inform all civil servants that the Opposition  does

not  consist of animals with horns and sharp teeth, and  that

they   should  defuse  their  fear  and  suspicion   of   the

Opposition.  I will make a point of informing them this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked about e-services. E-services are indeed

an important public sector initiative because it is a way for

us  to improve our service, a way for us to get across to the

public  to provide our services, to get responses to  service

them better.  Therefore, the College provides a comprehensive

range  of  IT  programmes  to help  the  officers  to  become

comfortable  and  adept at IT in order to support  electronic

delivery  of  services.  In the management programmes,  there

are  also modules to prompt participants to consider  how  e-government  could be adopted to help respective organisations

improve  their internal processes and service delivery.   The

College  itself  is  also adopting infocomm  technologies  to

better  service  its  customers and has started  offering  e-learning services through its open academy.  So this  is  one

significant area for the College to focus on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The College also does assist officers who are moved from

one  department  or Ministry to another,  as  Mr  Hawazi  has

asked.   It offers skills programmes to help officers  to  be

trained  for  new  work requirements if  this  is  necessary.

Apart  from  the  skills  specific programmes,  it  also  has

developed mental programmes to help officers prepare for  and

cope with different transitions in life, including changes in

the work environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See asked about benchmarking against MNCs

and the private sector.  Most of our programmes are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



focused on the needs of the public service.  That is the main

mission  of  the Civil Service College.  But we do  recognise

that   some   of  these  programmes  offer  a  platform   for

interaction  among participants from the public  and  private

sectors  which enriches the learning environment and  exposes

participants to more valid initiatives and perspectives.   So

although the College's courses are geared towards the  public

sector,  some  of  these courses are open to  private  sector

participants,  except for a few in-house  courses  which  are

especially sensitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training for foreign civil services - indeed we do

provide  training  as  well  as consultancy.   In  fact,  the

College  frequently serves as a one-stop  contact  point  for

foreign  civil services on matters relating to public service

reforms  and initiatives because many foreign civil  services

are   interested  in  finding  out  more  about   Singapore's

corporate governance.  These interactions are valued  by  the

College.   They  provide opportunities for the  learning  and

sharing  of best practices in public administration and  they

strengthen  the  understanding  between  Singapore  and   the

foreign  civil  services.  We have had  amongst  other  civil

services, civil servants from Bhutan, Botswana, China, Macau,

Thailand  and Vietnam, to come to the College, and  they  use

the  services which are often specially tailored to the needs

of the respective civil services.  I think with the increased

operational  flexibility of a statutory  board,  the  College

will  be  better  placed to assemble teams  of  trainers  and

consultants quickly in response to these requests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Loh Meng See asked whether the courses cover

all levels of the civil service.  The answer is yes.  Because

training is relevant and important to all levels and  so  the

programmes  cater to all levels according to  their  learning

needs,  ranging  from management development  programmes  for

senior civil servants to office skills programmes for support

level  civil  servants.  It does not mean  the  College  does

every  single course.  For example, it does not offer  unique

vocational training like nursing or civil defence  which  the

professional organisations will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>



provide.    But  the  College  provides  the  broad  training

programmes for the whole range of the civil service, from the

bottom to the top.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>LAND TITLES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Land Titles Act to, firstly,

facilitate the conversion of land from the common law  system

to  the land titles system of registration; secondly, improve

the administration of the Act; and thirdly, clarify the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this Bill, we have consulted the relevant

Government departments dealing with land as well as  the  Law

Society of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight the main changes to the Act. I will,

first, discuss the amendments to facilitate the conversion of

the  remaining 2% of our lands from the old common law  deeds

system to the land titles system of registration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently two land registration systems in

Singapore   -   the  "old"  common  law  system   under   the

Registration  of  Deeds  Act  and  the  "new"   land   titles

registration  system under the Land Titles Act.   The  latter

provides  for  a  simpler  and clearer  land  register.   The

exercise  to  convert  all the lands in  Singapore  from  the

common  law  system  to the land titles  registration  system

started in 1996 and we aim to complete it by the end of  this

year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>



The  Registrar of Titles has converted about 9,200 land  lots

with   a  balance  of  about  2,500  lots.   Completing   the

conversion is hampered by certain technicalities in  the  law

which the following amendments will address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Bill will allow the Registrar to convert

leases  of about 3,000 flats which were registered under  the

common  law system during the 1950s and 60s.  This was before

the Land Titles (Strata) Act came into operation.  Currently,

it  is  not  possible  for  the  Registrar  to  initiate  the

conversion of these leases.  The amendments pave the way  for

this.  In addition, to facilitate the process, as one owner's

non-response can hold up the entire development's conversion,

the  amendments provide that the Registrar can advertise  the

notice of conversion in the local daily newspapers and send a

copy  of  the  notice  to the owner informing  him  that  the

conversion will take place after the expiry of 21  days  from

the  date  of  publication  of the notice.   Thereafter,  the

Registrar  will  simultaneously  convert  the  land  and  the

leasehold  title  for  all  the  flats  so  that  the  entire

development can be brought under the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Bill will enable the Registrar to convert land

of whatever tenure.  Currently, leases with an unexpired term

of  less than 10 years have been excluded as it was felt that

they  would  be  expiring soon.  However,  if  they  are  not

included in the conversion exercise, we will have to  operate

two systems in the meantime.  This does not make sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also allow the Registrar to issue a

certificate of title in the name of a deceased proprietor  to

prevent  conversions being held up for months or  even  years

because of delay in settling the estate matters.  Some of the

Australian  states  faced  with  this  problem  have  similar

provisions in their laws to deal with this issue.  However, I

wish  to assure Members that although a certificate of  title

will  be  created, it will remain in the Registrar's  custody

and  only released to the personal representatives after  the

deceased proprietor's estate has been settled.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also deals with common law private leases.

These  are  very  old leases created in the  1800s.   A  good

number  of them do not even state a date for the commencement

of  the  leases.   They  indicate  the  tenure  but  not  the

commencement  date, which is necessary for  the  issuance  of

titles upon conversion of the lands.  So, the Bill allows the

Registrar,  for  the  purposes of converting  the  lands,  to

assume that the lease commenced from the date of the lease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the other amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land converted from the common law system is held with a

caution  stating  that the title is subject  to  pre-existing

claims  or encumbrances.  This means that the State does  not

guarantee the title to be free from encumbrance and  a  buyer

of  qualified  title must still investigate the  pre-existing

common  law deeds, making the conveyance more expensive.   It

is  only  when  the  caution lapses that  the  title  becomes

indefeasible,  backed by a State guarantee.  Sir,  under  the

present law, a caution lapses only if there is a sale of  the

land  after title conversion.  The Bill will provide for  the

automatic  lapsing of cautions 10 years after  the  land  was

converted,  or  after 2 years from the commencement  of  this

amendment, whichever is later, even if there has been no sale

after title conversion.  This will result in more unqualified

titles,   which   benefits   the   public,   as   the   title

investigations  are  easier  and  therefore   cheaper.   This

amendment  will  reduce the number of qualified  titles  from

about  13% to about 7% after 2 years and completely eliminate

them after 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also now make it necessary for anyone

dealing  with  a  landowner to conduct  bankruptcy  searches.

They  can  no longer rely on the Land Titles Act to exonerate

them from notice of any bankruptcy proceedings affecting  the

landowner.  This is necessary as the Bankruptcy Act  provides

for  the  automatic vesting of a bankrupt's property  in  the

Official Assignee.  The land register therefore may not  show

that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>



bankrupt's  property is now vested in the Official  Assignee.

This  amendment  will  not make things onerous  for,  say,  a

prospective   purchaser,   because   in   practice,   lawyers

invariably   make   bankruptcy   searches   during   property

transactions.  These searches are easy to carry  out  as  the

Official  Assignee's records are computerised  and  available

for remote online search.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the amendment relating to

restrictive   covenants.   A  restrictive  covenant   is   an

agreement  made  by  one  landowner with  the  owner  of  the

neighbouring  land not to do certain acts or  things  on  his

land  such  that  it would adversely affect the  neighbouring

land, for example, not to build a block of flats on his land.

For   registered  lands  under  the  Land  Titles  Act,   the

restrictive covenant will last for 20 years from the date  of

its creation or notification on the land register.  It can be

extended for 10 years each time.  For lands registered  under

common law, a restrictive covenant can last forever unless it

is  released  by  the  owner  of  the  neighbouring  lots  or

extinguished by an order of court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the existing restrictive covenants created

at  common  law are obsolete as they have been superseded  by

planning  and  other  regulatory laws.   The  Bill  therefore

provides that restrictive covenants created at common law  in

respect  of  unregistered  land  may,  unless  extended,   be

extinguished automatically after the expiration of  20  years

from the date of its creation or the expiration of five years

from  the  date of notification on the land register  or  two

years  from  the  date of the commencement  of  this  amended

provision,  whichever  is the latest.   This  amendment  will

facilitate urban redevelopment of the land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Bill clarifies the position on unilateral

severance of joint tenancies.  In 1993, a new way to sever  a

joint   tenancy  was  introduced,  that  is,   severance   by

unilateral declaration.  A person who co-owns property  as  a

joint  tenant is able to sever the joint tenancy by a  simple

unilateral notice in writing.  At law,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>



severance  usually results in equal shares.  But  there  have

been  owners  claiming to unilaterally sever joint  tenancies

into  unequal shares.  The Registrar is not in a position  to

verify  the  truth of such claims.  Therefore, the  Bill  now

states  very  clearly that unilateral severance  of  a  joint

tenancy can only be in equal shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also clarifies that tenants-in-common can

convert  their  holdings  by way of a  declaration  to  joint

tenancy  only if they are tenants-in-common in equal  shares.

Co-owners  with  unequal shares who wish  to  hold  as  joint

tenants can do so by way of a transfer as there is in  effect

a  transfer of some of the interest of the co-owner with  the

larger share to the one with the lesser share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me deal with the definition of "land". The

current   definition   of   "land"   includes   airspace   or

subterranean  space which is held apart from the  surface  of

the earth.  This definition has posed problems because in the

new  mixed-use developments, the State is required  to  issue

titles   for   parcels  of  land  comprising   airspace   cum

subterranean  space.   One example of this  is  the  Sengkang

MRT/LRT  station which will be four storeys above ground  and

two levels underground.  To facilitate such developments, the

definition of "land" is amended to enable title to be  issued

for  a parcel of airspace cum subterranean space.  This  will

facilitate   the   creative  design  of  complex   integrated

developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will go a long way towards improving the

administration of land law in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>STATUTES (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS AND REPEAL) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is to effect a number of minor or

technical amendments to several Acts.

<br><br><i>Repeal of the Coin Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Coin Act. Clause 5 repeals the Coin Act.

The  Coin  Act regulates the import and export of coins.   It

was  enacted  way back in 1903 during the Straits  Settlement

days  to  prevent large inflows of coins that  threatened  to

displace  the circulation of Straits Settlement coins.   That

objective  obviously is no longer valid today.  Currency  now

flows  via electronic and other means.  It is highly unlikely

for  there to be a need to impose regulatory controls on  the

flow  of coins.  Even if such a need arises, this can be done

under other legislation, such as the Currency Act.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Interpretation Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clause 2 seeks to amend the Interpretation Act

by   replacing  the  Greenwich  Mean  Time  with  Coordinated

Universal  Time as the basis for defining Singapore  Standard

Time.   The  Greenwich  Mean Time is  based  on  astronomical

observations  and is no longer used for scientific  purposes.

The  Coordinated  Universal Time is the only  practical  time

scale  maintained and disseminated under the Metre Convention

and  is  recommended for use by international bodies such  as

the   International  Bureau  of  Weights  and  Measures   and

International  Telecommunication Union.  Many countries  have

converted  to the Coordinated Universal Time as  it  is  more

reliable, stable and accessible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, as a Member State of the Metre

Convention, should officially adopt the Coordinated Universal

Time.  The time difference between the two is a small

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>



fraction of a second which is insignificant to most users.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Charities Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, third, the Charities Act requires the trustee of an

organisation  which wishes to be conferred charitable  status

to  register  it  with  the Commissioner  of  Charities  with

supporting  documents.   In addition,  a  registered  charity

which  is  amending its trust deeds or any  other  registered

particulars, or is no longer in operation is also required to

inform  the  Commissioner of the change.  Failure  to  comply

constitutes an offence.  However, as the Act is silent on the

time   frame   for   compliance,   the   Commissioner   faces

difficulties in enforcing these requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to amend the Charities Act by formalising

the  operational  procedures adopted by the  Commissioner  of

Charities   since  1997.   Unless  an  extension  is   given,

registration  and provision of all relevant  information  and

documents will have to be completed within three months  from

the establishment or incorporation of the charity.  A charity

that has ceased to be a charity or has amended its trust deed

or   any  other  registered  particulars  should  notify  the

Commissioner within seven days of the change.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, under the Chemical Weapons Convention, Singapore

is  required  to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction  over

our  citizens  who  engage  in  activities  contravening  the

Convention.   Clause 4 amends the Act to make it  clear  that

the  Singapore Courts has jurisdiction to try such acts  done

or  omitted  to be done outside Singapore by any  citizen  of

Singapore.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Singapore Academy of Law Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 seeks to amend the Singapore Academy of Law

Act  to  allow  the  Academy to circulate  summary  financial

statements to its members.  On request of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>



any  member, the full financial statements will be  available

for inspection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 also provides for rules to be made so that the

Academy  need not circulate the summary financial  statements

to  certain specified classes of members, for example,  those

whose  membership  has been suspended.   This  has  not  been

finalised  yet,  but will be finalised  in  the  rules.   The

clause  also  provides for rules to prescribe the  conditions

under which these statements may be circulated as well as the

information to be contained in the statement.

<br><br><i>Amendment  to  the Intellectual Property Office of  Singapore Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, clause 11 amends the Third Schedule of the

Intellectual  Property Office of Singapore  Act  by  deleting

"65"  in item 3 from the Schedule.  The Third Schedule  lists

down offences in the Registered Designs Act, Trade Marks  Act

and Patents Act, the proceedings of which may be conducted by

an  officer duly authorised in writing by the Chief Executive

of  the  Intellectual  Property  Office  of  Singapore.   The

reference to section 65 of the Registered Designs Act  should

be  removed  as the section deals with falsification  of  the

Register,  which  is  a serious offence involving  fraud  and

dishonesty.  The equivalent provisions in the Trade Marks Act

and Patents Act were not included in the Schedule.

<br><br><i>Amendment  to  the NUS Act and Institute of  Southeast  Asian Studies Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends the National University of Singapore

Act  by replacing the words "Vice-Chancellor", "Deputy  Vice-Chancellor"  and "Bursar" with "President of the University",

"Deputy President of the University" and "the chief financial

officer of the University" respectively.  Consequent to  this

amendment,  clause  10  seeks  to  amend  the  Institute   of

Southeast  Asian  Studies Act by replacing  the  word  "Vice-Chancellor" with "President".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now briefly outline the rest of the

amendments which are in the nature of tidying up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Other Miscellaneous Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the restructuring and privatisation of Government

hospitals,  the references in a number of Acts to "Government

hospitals"  and  "health officers"  in  the  service  of  the

Government are obsolete.  Hence, consequential amendments are

proposed  to  the Infectious Diseases Act, the Motor-Vehicles

(Third-Party  Risks and Compensation) Act, the  Prisons  Act,

the   Private   Hospitals  and  Medical  Clinics   Act,   the

Termination  of Pregnancy Act and the Voluntary Sterilisation

Act to omit such references.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 106D of the Companies Act to

include  a  reference to "units" of shares and debentures  in

the  definition  of  "sophisticated  investor".   This  is  a

consequential  amendment  to  those  made  in  the  Companies

(Amendment)  Act 2000 which came into effect on 22nd  January

2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to reinstate the definition of the term

"construction  works" in the Employment  of  Foreign  Workers

Act.   Presently, this term is explained as having  the  same

meaning  as  the same term used in the Construction  Industry

Development Board ("CIDB") Act.  As the CIDB Act was repealed

in  1999, this amendment seeks to define "construction works"

as used in its entirety in the CIDB Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 2 of the Housing Developers

(Control and Licensing) Act by deleting the words "section  4

of"  from the definition of "housing developer" as a  banking

licence is no longer issued under section 4.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lastly, clause 16 amends section 18(d) of the

Registered  Designs Act by replacing the word "Gazette"  with

the  words "prescribed manner".  This will enable the  notice

of   registration  and  representation  of  a  design  to  be

published in the manner prescribed by rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a very short

clarification.   It  is  regrettable that,  in  NUS,  we  are

changing  the  title of "Vice-Chancellor" to "President".   I

accept  it  as part of moving with the time.  My question  is

whether  the  title "Chancellor" was defined in NUS  as  well

because my understanding is that, if I recall correctly,  the

President of the Republic is the Chancellor of the  NUS.   So

if  we change "Vice-Chancellor" to "President", "Deputy Vice-Chancellor" to "Deputy President", are we retaining the title

of  "Chancellor"?  And if we do, the new order  list  in  the

university with Chancellor and President, then it seems  that

we have got a mixture of two cultures.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, this is for the parent

Ministry,  Ministry  of  Education,  and  the  university  to

decide.  As the amendment only relates to Vice-Chancellor,  I

would  take  it  that  the  word "Chancellor"  remains.   The

amendment   is  for  operational  purposes.   I  think   most

universities  in  the  world  are  moving  towards  the  term

"President".   So  in  terms  of easy  recognition  and  easy

facilitation  of dialogue and other operational matters,  the

university deems it better to change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2001 seeks to give

legislative effect to the income tax changes that I announced

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>



this  year's  Budget  Statement.   I  have  also  taken   the

opportunity  to  incorporate seven other  amendments  to  the

Income Tax Act.

<br><br><i>Tax Changes Announced in the 2001 Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with the tax changes announced in the 2001

Budget Statement. They are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) To help us maintain our tax competitiveness and

lower  the  tax  burden of businesses, a  new  corporate  tax

regime  will be introduced from the Year of Assessment  2002.

There are two components to this:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a reduction of the corporate income tax rate by one

percentage point to 24.5%;  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a tax exemption scheme for companies whereby three-quarters of up to the first $10,000 of a company's chargeable

income, and one-half of up to the next $90,000 will be exempt

from corporate tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17, 23 and 25 to 30 amend the Act to provide for

these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) To reduce the tax burden of individuals, as well as

to reward individual effort and enterprise, individual income

tax  rates will be reduced by between two and five percentage

points.  Clause 31 amends the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Because of the good performance of the economy in

2000,  I had announced a one-off, across-the-board rebate  of

10%  on  individual income tax to share the  budget  surplus.

Clause 32 amends the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) To encourage businesses to make the best use of

technology,  a  tax write-down of allowances  over  a  5-year

period  has  been  granted  for certain  capital  expenditure

incurred  to  acquire approved intellectual property  rights.

Clause 15 amends the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) To encourage self-employed persons to save more for

their  retirement by voluntarily contributing more  to  their

CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>



accounts, I announced an increase in the tax exemption  limit

for  CPF  contributions made by the self-employed  such  that

self-employed  persons will basically receive  the  same  tax

benefits  from the CPF scheme as both employer  and  employee

combined.  This is currently 36% of their income, or $25,920,

whichever is lower.  Clauses 12 and 19 amend the Act for this

purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) To motivate employees to greater innovation and

enterprise,  a  new tax exemption scheme for  employee  stock

options,  the  Company  Stock Option scheme  was  introduced.

Clauses 10 and 11 amend the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) To encourage greater philanthropy, donations to

Institutions of a Public Character of shares that are  listed

on  the  SGX as well as unit trusts that are readily tradable

in  Singapore will be made tax deductible.  Clause 18  amends

the Act for this purpose.

<br><br><i>Tax Changes Not Announced in the 2001 Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now move on to tax changes not announced in the

<br><br>2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget Statement.

<br><br><i>Proceeds from the Disposal of Assets Held by Charities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Government grants tax exemption on the

income  of a charity if it spends at least 80% of its  income

and   donations   on  charitable  activities  in   Singapore.

Proceeds  from  the  disposal of  assets  are,  however,  not

subject  to the 80% spending rule.  To correct this  anomaly,

clause  11  amends  the  Act  to ensure  that  all  receipts,

including proceeds from the disposal of assets of a  charity,

will be subject to the 80% spending rule with effect from 1st

June 2001.

<br><br><i>Buyback of Preference shares</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment will make the tax treatment for buyback

of  preference shares the same as the existing tax  treatment

for the redemption of preference shares.  The company will be

regarded as distributing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



dividends  to  the  shareholders from  whom  the  shares  are

acquired,  but  the shareholder will not  get  a  tax  credit

attached  to the payment from the company.  Clauses  4  to  7

amend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br><i>Interest Income from POSBank</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the merger of POSBank and DBS Bank, the

Government  had announced that tax exemption on all  interest

income from POSBank savings deposits will continue until 31st

December  2001.  Tax exemption would apply only to the  first

$100,000 balance of each POSBank savings account-holder  from

1st  January 2002 to 31st December 2004.  Before the  merger,

interest  income received from POSBank savings  deposits  was

tax-exempt.  The phasing out of tax exemption was to give DBS

Bank  time  to  restructure POSBank's assets to yield  higher

returns,  so  that  it can offer POSBank  depositors  deposit

rates  that  are  comparable  with  those  offered  by  other

commercial banks.  Clause 8(c) amends the relevant section of

the Act for this purpose.

<br><br><i>Third Child Maternity Leave Payment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his National Day Rally Speech, the Prime Minister

announced that Third Child Maternity leave will allow working

mothers  to  take time off to bond with their  new-born  baby

without  suffering  a loss of wages.  Third  Child  Maternity

Leave  payments  will  be treated as earned  income  for  tax

purposes.  With the implementation of the baby bonus and paid

Third  Child Maternity Leave, the Government has also decided

that  the amount of further tax rebate granted in respect  of

third  and  fourth child born on or after 1st April  2001  be

subject  to  a  cap  of  $20,000  and  $40,000  respectively.

Clauses  3(b) and 24 amend the relevant sections of  the  Act

for this purpose.

<br><br><i>Singapore Exchange</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax Act has been amended last year to provide

for Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



Exchange  Derivatives Trading Limited, which  took  over  the

activities  of  the former SIMEX, to continue  to  enjoy  tax

exemption  until  2003.   Since October  last  year,  certain

functions  of the above company had been transferred  to  the

Singapore Exchange Derivatives Clearing Limited.  Clause 8(b)

amends the Act to provide for tax exemption on the prescribed

income derived by the Singapore Exchange Derivatives Clearing

Limited  from  the commencement of its business  up  to  31st

December  2003.  Additionally, the Act is amended to  provide

exemption  of  dividends  paid out  of  those  exempt  income

derived   by  the  Singapore  Exchange  Derivatives  Clearing

Limited, subject to certain conditions.  Clause 11 amends the

relevant section of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br><i>Annual Limits of General Provisions Made by Finance Companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the Government decided to temporarily suspend

the  annual  limits  of general provisions  made  by  finance

companies  for a period of two years.  As the two years  have

passed, clause 13 amends the relevant section of the  Act  to

reinstate these annual limits.

<br><br><i>The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last change pertains to the Supplementary

Retirement Scheme (SRS).  This scheme encourages Singaporeans

to  save  voluntarily  over and above their  CPF  savings  by

allowing a range of tax benefits.  The main tax benefits are:

contributions  to the SRS will be tax deductible,  investment

returns with the exception of dividends will accumulate  tax-free, and only 50% of the withdrawals from an SRS account  at

retirement will be taxable.  Clauses 2, 3, 7, 8(a), 14, 19 to

22 and 29 amend the Act for these purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I commend the Bill to the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like

to speak in support of this Income Tax (Amendment) Bill.  The

Bill

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>



seeks  to implement the numerous income tax changes announced

by  the  Government for the FY2001 Budget.  As most of  these

tax changes have been well debated in this House, I shall not

delve  into them.  However, the Bill also covers a new issue,

which  is  the  introduction of the Supplementary  Retirement

Scheme  (SRS).   As  this SRS has not been fully  debated  in

Parliament,  I  feel that it is worthwhile to  raise  certain

issues  concerning the SRS so that we can have a full  debate

on this matter.

<br><br><i>Matching Contribution from Employers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my first point concerning the

SRS  is that, overall, the objectives of the proposed SRS are

commendable.   Essentially, the SRS  is  meant  to  encourage

Singaporeans and residents to voluntarily contribute to their

own  retirement  fund,  over  and  above  the  mandatory  CPF

contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one negative impression of the SRS is that it

appears to cater to and is more favourable as a tax incentive

to the higher income group.  As we all know, about 70% of the

lower  income group of the population do not pay income  tax.

For the lower income group, the tax savings in absolute terms

are  smaller  and  less meaningful, compared  to  the  higher

income group.  But it is the lower income group that needs to

save for their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to assist the lower income group and encourage

them  to contribute more actively to the SRS is to allow  for

matching  contribution, also on a voluntary basis,  from  the

employers.  The employers' matching contribution can be up to

a  limit  of  1:1 basis, but it need not be set  as  a  fixed

matching   quantum  since  it  is  meant   as   a   voluntary

contribution  from  employers.   For  example,  the  matching

contribution can be just on a 1:2 basis, or at such a rate or

proportion as the employers feel appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the employers' matching formula

is  one of the reasons for the success of the equivalent  SRS

scheme in the US.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Equal Contribution Limits for Both Locals and Foreigners</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the scheme allows the contribution of

Singaporeans  and permanent residents of up to 15%  of  their

annual  income  or $10,800.   For foreigners,  the  limit  is

higher,  at  35% of their annual income or $25,200.   Sir,  I

find  this  discrepancy  in  the  contribution  rates  rather

strange.  In fact, I find it very hard to understand.  If the

intention of the Government is to encourage Singaporeans  and

PRs to save more for their old age, then we should allow them

a  higher limit.  In contrast, the foreigners do not need  to

remain in Singapore and, therefore, there is no reason for us

to   be  concerned  about  their  retirement  funding  needs.

Moreover, a higher limit for foreigners means that they enjoy

more tax benefits.  To be consistent, I would like to ask the

Minister  to  consider  whether the  contribution  limit  for

Singaporeans  and PRs can be increased to the same  level  as

for foreigners.

<br><br><i>Increase of Tax Exempt Limit to 100%</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the proposal is to limit the tax-exempt

portion  of SRS withdrawal to only 50%.  Again, I  find  this

ruling  rather  strange.  If the Government  is  sincere  and

truly  wants Singaporeans and PRs to save more for their  old

age,  then it would well be beneficial for the Government  to

allow  100%  of  their  SRS withdrawals to  enjoy  tax-exempt

status.   This  is the same tax-exempt basis for  normal  CPF

contributions.   So  why not be more  generous?   Why  be  so

stingy?  Why not allow SRS contributions to enjoy a full 100%

tax  exemption upon withdrawal?  If Singaporeans and PRs  can

voluntarily  save  for their old age, then they  will  become

less  of  a burden to the state.  Although I do not know  how

much  tax will be lost if we give 100% tax-exempt benefit,  I

firmly  believe that it is worthwhile to give such a  benefit

for Singaporeans and PRs.

<br><br><i>Extension of the 62-Year-Old Age Limit</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, the scheme restricts the contributor to

an  age  limit  of  62 years.  Many older  Singaporeans  have

enquired

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>



as   to  why  there  is  an  age  limit  of  62  years.   Why

discriminate  against  them?  If  Singaporeans  and  PRs  are

prepared  on their own to contribute to their SRS  beyond  62

years  old,  they should be encouraged to do so.  However,  I

understand  that the Minister and his Ministry are  concerned

with  the  risk of round-tripping, meaning that a contributor

pays  money into his SRS and then withdraws money immediately

at the same time, with tax benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can contain this problem by setting a moratorium

of,  say,  five years on all new SRS contributions after  age

62.   This way, the 5-year moratorium will ensure that  older

workers  can save for their old age and overcome the  problem

of round-tripping, as they can only withdraw their money five

years later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to reiterate that I find the SRS scheme

meaningful.  I am in full support of the scheme.  However, as

can  be seen from the points that I have raised above, I just

wish that the Government can be more generous in the benefits

and  conditions for the SRS scheme, so that more Singaporeans

and PRs can be encouraged to participate voluntarily.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Leong has made several

proposals for changes to the SRS scheme and I will respond to

them in turn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he says that the structure of the SRS scheme

seems  to favour the higher income persons.  I would like  to

assure   him  that  this  is  not  so.   I  think  Mr   Leong

misunderstands the intent of the SRS scheme.  Let me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, I have to stress that SRS is a

supplementary  savings scheme and not an enhancement  of  the

basic  CPF  scheme.   The  CPF  is  the  primary  scheme  for

retirement  savings.  At the long-term CPF contribution  rate

of   40%,   a  typical  Singaporean's  CPF  savings   provide

individuals  with a reasonable monthly retirement  income  in

addition  to a fully paid-up home of his own, all  paid  from

CPF savings plus additional monies for his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>



medical  needs.  However, the contributions towards  CPF  are

capped  at  a  salary  of $6,000 a month.   This  means  that

earnings  beyond  this amount will not enjoy tax-free  status

for savings under the basic CPF scheme.  Thus, the SRS scheme

has  been  set  up to allow those who wish to increase  their

retirement  savings  beyond what is  allowed  under  the  CPF

scheme to do so.  The SRS will allow them to supplement their

CPF  savings,  but on a tax-deferrable and not  a  tax-exempt

basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also suggests that employers should be allowed

to contribute to the SRS.  I do not think this will be a wise

proposal.   Singapore  already has an employee  and  employer

scheme in the CPF, totalling 40%.  Allowing employers to make

contributions to SRS would put further pressure  on  them  to

contribute  beyond  20% and thus raise their  business  cost.

SRS  is  structured as a voluntary scheme and any  individual

can  choose to place part of his earned income in SRS  up  to

the  prescribed  cap.   There  is,  therefore,  no  need  for

Government to dictate or encourage employers to pay  part  of

the wages in the form of SRS contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong is also concerned that the higher contribution

cap  allowed  for  foreigners in the SRS  would  be  seen  as

discriminatory  against Singaporeans.  He suggests  that  the

same  cap  be  applied  to both Singaporeans  and  foreigners

alike.   I  would  point  out  that  it  is  not  true   that

Singaporeans  are  treated less favourably.   Foreigners  are

allowed  a  higher percentage cap on their SRS  contributions

because  they  are not permitted to participate  in  the  CPF

scheme and therefore do not enjoy the tax benefits of the CPF

contributions.   Singaporeans and PRs who contribute  towards

both  CPF and SRS will, in fact, enjoy tax reliefs of  up  to

51%  of  their gross income, subject to a cap of  $6,000  per

month.  This is, therefore, more favourable than the 35%  SRS

tax relief, subject to the same cap, enjoyed by foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why foreigners are allowed to

participate in the SRS scheme was because when the CPF scheme

was removed from them, there was concern

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>



that the lack of a retirement scheme might discourage foreign

talents from working in Singapore.  The SRS was introduced to

offset  that change.  Mr Leong also suggests that  Government

should be more generous and allow SRS withdrawals to be fully

tax-exempt, instead of enjoying the tax benefit of about 50%.

I believe that our SRS provisions are already very generous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have allowed tax relief to SRS

contributions.  We also allow investment income,  except  for

dividends, to accumulate tax-free and subject only 50% of the

savings withdrawn from SRS to tax, even though in the  normal

tax  deferral  scheme, usually the entire  sum  withdrawn  is

fully  taxed.   The  50% tax concession  on  withdrawals  is,

therefore,  very attractive considering that a retiree's  tax

rate  is  likely to be lower than his normal terminal  salary

due to a reduction in his income after retirement.  A retiree

also  has  the option to spread out his withdrawals  over  10

years  after  retirement to further lower his tax  liability.

Allowing  SRS withdrawals to be fully tax-exempt  would  make

the  SRS  scheme a completely tax-exempt scheme like the  CPF

scheme.  This  would be too generous.  If it is allowed,  the

Government would indeed be seen to be favouring higher income

persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong believes that the age limit of 62 should not be

imposed  on participation in SRS.  He suggests that  the  age

cap be lifted.  The Government, in deciding the age limit for

participation in SRS, had to weigh the desire  of  those  who

want to withdraw their SRS savings as early as possible, with

the  accompanying  tax benefits, against those  who  want  to

contribute  to  the  SRS for as long as they  wish.   A  fair

solution  is,  therefore,  to  peg  the  age  limit  to   the

prevailing  statutory retirement age currently at  62.   This

means  that  beyond  62, the SRS account will  be  closed  to

contributions but the SRS savings will be freely withdrawable

without  penalty and would enjoy a concession of being  taxed

only on 50% of the sum withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the moratorium proposal as suggested by

Mr Leong would be a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>



satisfactory  solution.  The date on which  SRS  participants

can  start withdrawing their savings is also the date the new

contributions would stop.  Otherwise, as Mr Leong has  noted,

the  possibility of round tripping could arise.  I would like

to  point out that the age limit for participation in the SRS

would  rise  over time along with any rise in  the  statutory

retirement age in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to thank Mr Leong again for his

comments and ideas.  But as SRS has just been introduced,  we

will  monitor its progress and if improvements are  warranted

they would be introduced when appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].

<div align="center"><b>OFFICIAL SECRETS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Official Secrets Act (OSA) guards against

disclosure of official documents and information as this  can

be  detrimental to national and public interest.   It  is  in

line  with  this  objective that I am  presenting  this  Bill

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, increasingly, many governmental functions have been

devolved  to statutory bodies.  This ensures that the  public

sector   continues  to  remain  nimble  and   responsive   to

challenges of the future.  This also allows statutory  bodies

to  have greater flexibility to compete in the recruitment of

professional talent by tapping external expertise from either

local   or   overseas  organisations.    With   the   greater

flexibility,  statutory  bodies  will  better  harness  their

professional capabilities and concentrate on developing their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>



core  competencies, whilst the Ministries focus on  the  core

functions  of  policy planning and resource  allocation.  For

example,  MINDEF is better able to concentrate  on  the  core

Ministry   functions   of   policy  planning   and   resource

allocation,  while  the statutory body, Defence  Science  and

Technology   Agency   (DSTA)   focuses   on   providing   the

technological and engineering support to the Singapore  Armed

Forces.  Similarly, MTI is able to better focus on policy and

planning  in  maintaining Singapore's competitiveness,  while

the  statutory bodies, EDB and TDB, concentrate on increasing

foreign direct investments and trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this devolution of functions results in officers in

these statutory bodies having access to official information.

This  is  inevitable as the officers require this information

to  discharge their functions properly and effectively.   The

OSA  currently  only covers Ministries.  To ensure  that  the

provisions of the OSA continue to cover these officers, it is

necessary to extend the scope of the Act to include selective

statutory bodies.  Prior to conversion into a statutory body,

such  information would have been handled by the officers  as

Ministry  officials  and  therefore covered  under  the  OSA.

Hence,  what  this Bill essentially does is  to  restore  the

position to what it was before the formation of the statutory

bodies.   It  also extends coverage to new matters  that  the

designated  statutory bodies may cover.   There  is  thus  no

change  to  the  substantive scope of the  OSA's  provisions.

Currently,  some  of  these  selected  statutory  bodies  are

covered  by  the  statutory bodies and Government  companies'

Protection  of  Secrecy Act (PSA) but the  scope  of  PSA  is

narrower than the OSA.  This is not satisfactory in so far as

official  information vital to national security and national

interest  is  concerned.   Hence,  these  selected  statutory

bodies are now placed under the OSA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to amend the OSA by introducing a

Schedule   of  Organisations  comprising  selected  statutory

bodies and DSO National Laboratories to be protected

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>



under  the  OSA.   In  this way, the provisions  relating  to

wrongful  communication  of  information,  falsification   of

reports,   forgery,  personation  and  possession  of   false

documents  will apply to these organisations.  The  President

can amend this Schedule from time to time by notification  in

the Gazette.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MHA has consulted all the Ministries to identify

the  statutory bodies under their charge that handle official

information vital to national security or national  interest.

For  example,  the  Monetary Authority of  Singapore  handles

information  which can impact economic security and  contains

market   sensitivities.   CISCO  has   access   to   official

information relating to national safety and security such  as

the  protection of key installations.  Similarly,  the  other

listed   organisations   deal   with   official   information

pertaining  to  their  domain of work.   DSO,  whilst  not  a

statutory  body,  has  been included because  it  engages  in

sensitive  defence  research and  development  programmes  to

provide  cutting  edge technologies and capabilities  to  the

SAF.   It  therefore  requires a high  degree  of  access  to

critical   and  sensitive  information  relating   to   SAF's

developments and plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these amendments, we aim to ensure that

official  information continues to be properly protected  and

managed.  This can only be for Singapore's good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Mr Deputy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Road Traffic Act (RTA)

for the following broad purposes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To provide for the issuance of special purpose

licences  for  vehicles used in research and development  and

the test-bedding of new transport technologies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To revise outdated definitions and classifications,

update  and  improve procedures to facilitate administration;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To step up enforcement measures against errant

motorists  with  arrears in road tax, facilitate  enforcement

action  against  unlicensed  vehicles  and  to  provide   for

compulsory towing of stationary vehicles on expressways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the key provisions in the Bill

for the proposed amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 11(4A) of the RTA to empower the

Minister  to impose conditions in the grant of vehicular  tax

rebates  under  the Act.  The current provision  enables  the

Minister  to  prescribe a rebate on all or any  part  of  tax

payable for vehicles in accordance with their class, category

or description.  However, there is currently no express power

to impose conditions in the grant of such rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 11A of the RTA to allow for the

issue  of  supplementary licences for all motor vehicles  and

not  just  motorcars.  This will enable the  Vintage  Vehicle

Scheme  to  be administered under this section  of  the  Act.

Under  this  scheme, vintage vehicles, ie, those manufactured

before  1940,  are  exempted from the payment  of  additional

registration fee and COE, but they are restricted in usage to

28  days per calendar year.  Owners are required to pay a fee

for the supplementary licence when the vehicle is used on the

road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, vehicle owners are currently given a 14-day grace

period to renew their vehicle's road tax licence from date of

expiry.   Although no late penalty fee is levied during  this

period, a vehicle with an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



expired licence is prohibited from being used or kept on  any

road.   As  the compulsory insurance requirement  is  checked

only  at  the  point of road tax renewal, it is difficult  to

tell  whether vehicle owners who renew their road tax licence

late  actually  have the requisite insurance coverage  during

the grace period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From records, an average of about 30% of the road tax

renewals  are effected during this grace period.   To  reduce

the  number  of late renewals and the possibility  that  such

vehicles  may  be  driven without proper  insurance  coverage

during the grace period, it is proposed to abolish the 14-day

grace  period.   Such  a move is in the  interest  of  public

safety.   Clause 4 therefore allows for the imposition  of  a

late penalty fee if the motorist fails to renew his road  tax

licence upon expiry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 28 to empower the Registrar to

issue general licences in respect of all vehicles instead  of

only  motor  vehicles, and to suspend and  revoke  a  general

licence  in certain circumstances.  Clause 5 also aligns  the

general  licensing provisions with those under  the  proposed

section  28A  pertaining to special  purpose  licences.   For

Members'  information,  such general licences  are  currently

issued only to manufacturers, repairers and dealers of  motor

vehicles.   They are for temporary use on new and  unlicensed

vehicles  when they are driven on the roads to  be  sent  for

servicing  or  repairs  before they  are  registered  or  re-licensed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 30th May 2001, the Minister for Communications

and  Information Technology announced that the Land Transport

Authority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) were

working  on  a  scheme  to  encourage  companies  to  conduct

research and development in vehicle technologies here.  Under

this scheme, to be called the Transport Technology Innovation

and  Development Scheme (TIDES), new generation vehicles such

as   fuel-cell  and  hybrid  vehicles  can  be  brought  into

Singapore for test-bedding and research

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



and  development purposes.  Since exemptions to  Certificates

of  Entitlement  and  Additional  Registration  Fee  will  be

granted  to  vehicles under this scheme,  LTA  and  EDB  will

ensure  that only vehicles used for test-bedding and research

and  development  purposes will be granted  such  exemptions.

This scheme is not meant to support commercial operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that Singapore, with its excellent IT and

physical  infrastructure, will be regarded by  many  Original

Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) as an ideal location for test-bedding  and  development  of Intelligent  Transport  Systems

(ITS).   To  facilitate the implementation  of  this  scheme,

clause  6  of the Bill amends the Road Traffic Act  (RTA)  by

inserting   a  new  section  28A  to  permit  car   equipment

manufacturers  and  R&D institutions  to  apply  for  special

purpose licences for vehicles to be used for such purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicles under this scheme must meet all prevailing

vehicle  safety  and emission standards before  they  can  be

licensed.   Inspection requirements are imposed  before  they

can  be  used for testing on public roads.  This will  ensure

that  the vehicles meet Singapore's roadworthiness and safety

standards.   The amendments in clause 6 also require  special

purpose  licence  vehicles  to  possess  a  valid  policy  of

insurance during the period of licence in compliance with the

requirements under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks  and

Compensation) Act (Cap. 189).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, motorists in arrears of road tax are liable to be

charged  in Court for keeping or using a vehicle without  the

requisite   road   tax   vehicle  licence.    Under   current

provisions, the Court has powers to impose a fine  for  these

offences,  but  is  not empowered to make an  order  for  the

payment  of road tax arrears.  This results in many motorists

delaying  the  payment  of the arrears after  settling  their

court fines. Clause 8 therefore creates a new section 29A  to

empower  the  court  convicting any person  charged  with  an

offence  under section 15 or 29 to order such person  to  pay

any outstanding road

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



tax.  If the person defaults, the arrears can be recovered in

the same manner as the recovery of fines.  This new provision

is  in line with existing provisions in the Road Traffic Act,

which allow the Court to order convicted motorists to pay  up

any arrears of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) or Vehicle Entry

Permit (VEP) charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 repeals section 72 as it deals with an offence

already  covered by the Environmental Pollution  Control  Act

(Cap.  94A).  The Ministry of the Environment (ENV) has taken

over  enforcement against vehicles emitting  excessive  smoke

since  June 1999.  The offences for excessive smoke  emission

are  now  set  out  in  the Environmental  Pollution  Control

(Vehicular Emissions) Regulations 1999, which is administered

by ENV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, vehicle seizure powers under section 95 of the RTA

can  only  be  invoked  when there  is  a  person  using  the

offending  vehicle, or when there is reasonable  belief  that

the  vehicle  is  being used at the point of  seizure.   This

hampers  enforcement  action when  such  vehicles  are  found

parked or unattended on public roads.  Some of these vehicles

include   de-registered  or  unregistered  vehicles,  foreign

registered  vehicles without requisite licences, eg,  Vehicle

Entry Permit, or with outstanding ERP notices, vehicles  with

false  number plates and engine chassis discrepancy  detected

at  Inspection Centres and authorised scrap yards.  Clause 12

therefore amends section 95 to enable powers of seizure to be

exercised  even though the owner, driver or person in  charge

of the vehicle is not present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts section 100

to  relocate  the  classification and description  of  public

service  vehicles (PSVs) as the second schedule to  the  RTA,

which  is created by clause 19.  The schedule may be  amended

from  time to time by LTA by order published in the  Gazette.

With  rapid developments in the motor vehicle industry,  such

classifications  and  descriptions are  best  set  out  in  a

schedule,  which allows greater flexibility  to  make  timely

amendments as required.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 creates a new section 123A that will enable

LTA  to  remove  stationary vehicles  from  the  expressways.

Under  section  123  of the RTA, powers to remove  stationary

vehicles and to collect towing charges presently reside  only

with the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP).  Since 1998, as

an  interim measure, the DCP has authorised LTA to  tow  such

vehicles under the Expressway Monitoring and Advisory  System

(EMAS).    The   new  section  123A  will  empower   LTA   to

compulsorily  tow stationary vehicles found  on  expressways,

regardless  of whether the cause is a breakdown,  abandonment

or  the commission of an offence.  This will ensure that  any

obstruction  or  hazard  on  the expressway  can  be  removed

quickly.   Clause  14  further makes it an  offence  for  any

unauthorised  person to tow away any stationary vehicle  from

an  expressway tunnel.  This is to ensure safety for both the

towing operator and the other motorists using the tunnel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 16 inserts a new section 131A to

include   additional   modalities  for   serving   prescribed

documents.   This will facilitate the serving of notices  and

summonses.   It  replaces sections 131(3) and  (4)  that  are

deleted by clause 15.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill contains several amendments, the primary

objective  being to keep the legislation relevant to  support

new  developments  in technology and improve  procedures  for

better administration and more effective enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  clause  4 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill  removes

the  14-day grace period prior to the composition of the late

penalty  fee  for the renewal of road tax.  The 14-day  grace

period has been given for a long time for owners to renew the

road  tax  licence from the date of expiry.   There  are  all

kinds  of  reasons why an owner may not be able to renew  the

licence on time.  Why can the Minister not continue with  the

existing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



policy?  As the grace period has been granted for so long and

not to make things more difficult for the owners, why can  it

not be continued?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a vehicle with an expired road tax is driven

without  insurance  cover, it is  a  different  matter.   The

Government  should not make it less flexible than  it  is  at

present.   How many of such cases were there last  year  when

cars with expired road tax without insurance were involved in

accidents without insurance recourse?  How does the  granting

of  a  14-day grace period affect public safety on the roads?

Is  a  car  without a current road tax inherently less  safe?

Or,  by stretching the logic, does a car with a one year road

tax safer than a car with a six months road tax?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is on clause 8 which empowers the court

to  order  payment for road tax arrears in addition to  court

fines.  Under the present regulations, if a person is charged

in  court for using a vehicle without the required road  tax,

the  court has only powers to impose a fine for the  offence.

It  is  not  empowered to order for payment of road  tax.   I

should point out that the road tax due should not be taken as

arrears.    Or, if it were, it should only be considered  for

that  part  that was due up to the time when the  person  was

caught  driving without the road tax.  Technically, the  road

tax licence runs over a certain currency period.  I am not  a

lawyer  here.   The  professors of  law  in  this  House  may

clarify, but I plead for moderation in applying fines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is on clause 11 which repeals section 72

of the Road Traffic Act.  This matter is now being dealt with

under  the  Environmental Pollution Control Act.   I  am  not

sure.   Perhaps the Minister could clarify who is  now  going

after  all the excessive smoky vehicles  that we see  running

on  the roads.  In the days when it was not an offence making

a  phone  call  while driving on the road, I could  tell  the

Minister  that I had been one ever eager to make phone  calls

to  the  Police  on  these smoky vehicles when  I  saw  them.

Nowadays,  I just see them passing by.  And I must  say  that

the Police has been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>



very  efficient in the handling of such reports, at least  at

the  receptionist  end.  They always give me  the  impression

that  the culprits will be caught. I wonder, with this  shift

to  ENV,  how  would  the patrolling  of  these  vehicles  be

handled.  Does the ENV maintain a group of patrol vehicles on

the look out for these smoky vehicles on the roads?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill and  not

to answer the tough legal questions raised by the Chairman of

the GPC on Communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only have a couple of points to make regarding

clause  14 which inserts a new section 123A into the existing

legislation,  so  as to give the authority or  an  agent  the

power to tow vehicles away from expressways.  I am sure  that

everyone agrees with the policy to remove stationary vehicles

from   expressways.   Such  vehicles  pose  serious  hazards,

especially  where  the  road  shoulders  are  not  too  wide.

However, I seek clarification from the Minister about the new

provision  as set out in clause 14.  First, why  is  there  a

need  to  provide additionally for removal of  vehicles  from

expressways  when  the  original  provision  in  section  123

already  provides  for  removal  of  vehicles  generally   in

circumstances such as where the vehicles cause unnecessary or

unreasonable  obstruction to traffic or otherwise  causing  a

hazard?   It is quite easy in my view to include LTA officers

within this main section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the new section 123A, subsection (2), imposes

the duty on the authority or its agent to take the vehicle to

a parking place, that is, near to that part of the expressway

from which the vehicle is removed.  Why impose such a duty on

the  authority?  It can be inconvenient both to the authority

and  to the driver.  In any case, the provision seems  to  be

imprecise.   What does it mean to be "near"?  How  would  the

driver  know which parking place his car has been  towed  to?

To avoid doubt and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>



confusion,  would it be better to designate car  parks  where

the LTA or its agent would tow vehicles to?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a requirement that the owner would be

given  notice in writing of the removal and location  of  the

car.   If  a car owner of a stalled vehicle on the expressway

were   to  leave  the  vehicle  unattended  while  he  sought

assistance,  he might well return to find his car  no  longer

there.   What does he do?  Does he wait at home for a  notice

in  writing  to arrive at his doorstep?  How long would  that

take?   Would this not cause unnecessary anxiety?  The  first

sensible  response of any driver would be to  report  to  the

Police that the car is missing, presumed stolen.  Would  this

not  create  additional work unnecessarily for everyone,  for

the  authority, for the Police, for the owner of the vehicle?

Why  can there not be a simpler mechanism, say, a number  for

all  drivers  to call to find out whether the  car  has  been

towed away by the authority legally and, if so, where has  it

been towed to or whether it has been stolen?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is a special provision barring the towing

of vehicles from any, and I quote, "tunnel forming part of an

expressway" other than by the authority or its agent.   First

of  all,  how does one know whether a tunnel is  part  of  an

expressway or not?   And secondly, why should a car owner not

be  allowed to arrange for the towing away of his vehicle  if

that can be done in safe circumstances?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope some of these issues would be thoroughly

addressed as the implementation of this provision may be  the

source of confusion and frustration to the motoring public if

the  operational  issues are not sorted  out.   The  motoring

public should be properly informed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill  keeps

our legislation relevant to the support of the development in

land  transport technologies, and is in keeping with our  on-going efforts to improve procedures for better administration

and more effective enforcement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to comment on the proposed new

section  123A, subsection (9), which states that the  surplus

from the sale or disposal of the vehicle under subsection (8)

shall  be forfeited by the Government when it is not  claimed

by  the vehicle owner.  My suggestion is that the surplus  be

donated  to  charity,  as is the case  of  unclaimed  lottery

prizes.  This will send a clear signal to the public that the

primary intention of the Government is administrative, and it

is  an effective solution to the problem at hand.  It is  not

just that Government is after their money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would also avoid criticism that the Government has

actually  profited out of the convenience of  the  legislated

laws.  Members of the public who fail to collect the  sum  of

money  due  to them would be less unhappy with the Government

because the money has actually been turned over to charity as

provided  for under the law.  Should the Minister agree  that

the  unclaimed  surplus go to charity, then there  should  be

corresponding  amendments to section 123, subsection  (5)  of

the principal Act which also deals with a similar issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on the new subsection (8)

of section 123A.  It provides that if the Government wants to

sell  the  vehicle under subsection (2), it has to  give  one

month's  notice  in  the Government  Gazette.   On  this,  my

personal  view is that most of our people do not have  access

to  the  Government Gazette.  They do not read the Government

Gazette at all.  I propose that the authority should at least

notify  the  vehicle owners in writing of  its  intention  to

dispose  of or sell the vehicle to recover cost, and this  is

similar to that of subsection (4).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on a few issues relating to

the new section 131A.  I can appreciate that the proposed new

insertion  aims to provide the authority with  more  ways  to

serve  its  notices  and summonses on the  people  concerned.

However,  it  does  not adequately address  the  difficulties

arising from the service of these notices or summonses.   The

most  common complaint from the people on the ground is  that

they did not receive the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>



notices  or  summonses  in the first  instance  due  to  many

reasons, and as a result, they had to pay heavier penalties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of summonses sent through registered mail,

the  problem is that most of the time there is no one at home

and the intended recipient of the registered letter has to go

to  the  designated  post office to  collect  his  notice  or

summons,  and  they have to go during working hours.   If  he

drives, he has to find a parking lot, and if there are a  lot

of  people,  he has to queue up to just collect the  summons.

As a result, you have a very angry man there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in the case of the summons not

collected by the intended recipient, the authority will  have

to  send another registered letter or resort to other ways of

serving the summons on him.  To the best of my knowledge,  if

a  registered letter is not collected, the relevant authority

will summon him to court.  So most people feel that the whole

process   is  an  unnecessary   waste  of  time,  money   and

resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is in the court or at our meet-the-people

sessions,  much time is spent on ascertaining the reason  why

the defendants did not receive the summonses. Sometimes we do

not  know  who  is telling the truth and who  is  lying,  and

whether they have actually received the summonses or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can spell out clearly in the

law  the Government's stand on the issues relating to how the

notices or summonses should be served.  I propose that  under

section 131A, we should at least cover two key principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, all summonses, notices or orders deemed to be

duly served on the intended recipients by any of the channels

as provided for under the new section 131A shall be deemed to

be  duly served on the defendant concerned.  Secondly, it  is

the  responsibility  of the individual  to  ensure  that  all

official documents sent to the address registered by him with

the  National  Registration  Office  or  the  Land  Transport

Authority  are duly acknowledged.  In other words,  the  last

known

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



address shall suffice for the purpose of this section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will send a clear signal to the members of the

public  that unless it is for exceptional and valid  reasons,

they cannot claim that they have not received the notices  or

summonses,  and  use  this as an excuse for  not  paying  the

composition fine before the due date.  Then, the people  will

have  to  accept that the summonses have been duly served  on

them, and they have to pay the fines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that my above suggestions will be duly considered

by the Minister.  With that, I support the Amendment Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank

all the Members for their support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me answer the queries raised by the GPC

Chairman.  His first point is on why should we remove the 14-day  grace period.  He is right that the 14-day grace  period

was  given  a  long, long time ago, at a time  when  possibly

renewal  notice  was not sent, or it was sent  and  it  would

arrive  at the recipient's home very near the date of expiry.

But  nowadays  it is a different story.  Because  of  greater

efficiency,  motorists would receive the  renewal  notice  at

least  six  weeks  before the date of expiry.   So  there  is

really  no  good reason for them not to pay the road  tax  in

time.  Of course, there could be some reasons like if you are

overseas  for  more than a month or so.  If  there  are  good

reasons, LTA can consider waiving the penalty fee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more important point is that, if you look at the

trend, currently, as I mentioned in my speech, 30% of vehicle

owners  only  renew their road tax during  the  14-day  grace

period.   And we do not have record to show how many of  them

actually do not have insurance coverage because we only check

insurance  coverage at the point of renewal.   Therefore,  it

would  not  be  unreasonable to  expect  that  many  of  them

actually  are  driving their vehicles without insurance,  and

that is a very dangerous matter.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  it  is  prudent to minimise this  possibility  by

saying that they must renew their road tax before the date of

expiry.   That  would enable LTA to check whether  they  have

insurance coverage before the road tax is renewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his second point is about road tax arrears. Road

tax  is  payable for keeping or using a vehicle.  If a person

keeps  a  vehicle and refuses to pay the road tax  after  the

road  tax  has  expired, then he owes the  Government  money.

Therefore,  anything that he owes must be paid back,  because

it  is due to the State.  Currently, after a court case,  the

court fines him, he still owes LTA money, LTA will then  have

to go and recover the money by asking him to pay.  If he does

not  pay, we go to the court, take a court order to seize his

vehicle  and  then auction and sell it.   So  it  is  a  long

process.   That  is  why there are some people  who  actually

ignore this and they refuse to pay up the arrears even  after

the fine.  So with this amendment, the court can, at the time

when  the fine is imposed, also order the motorist to pay  up

the arrears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay's final point is about the enforcement of

pollution or smoke emission.  The enforcement is now  carried

out  by ENV officers.  So LTA no longer enforces this.  I was

told  that  ENV officers will take a different approach  from

the  LTA.   In the past, LTA officers actually patrolled  and

stopped vehicles and brought them for smoke testing.   But  I

was  told  that  ENV  now  would station  their  officers  at

strategic locations, use digital cameras to take pictures  of

vehicles  emitting  smoke  from  the  rear,  and  then   take

enforcement action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to Prof. Chin's questions. Firstly, he

asked  why did we need to have an additional section 123A  if

we  already  have  section  123.  Section  123  is  currently

administered by the Traffic Police.  So LTA has to go through

the  Deputy  Commissioner of Police for all  the  enforcement

actions.   Administratively, it is not a very efficient  way.

By  creating  section 123A, LTA would be  able,  on  its  own

accord,  to take enforcement action and deal direct with  the

motorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about section 123A(2), ie, taking the

vehicle  to  a parking place that is near to the  expressway,

why  did  we  impose such a duty and what was the meaning  of

"near".   The reason why we want to remove vehicles from  the

expressway  is  to  ensure that motorists on  the  expressway

would  not be endangered by stationary vehicles.  And how  do

we carry out this duty?  We carry out this duty by appointing

towing   agents.   The  towing  agents  have  to   meet   the

requirement by getting to the scene within 10 to 15  minutes.

So  they  cannot tow the vehicles too far away  because  then

they  may  not  be  able  to fulfil this  requirement.   Some

motorists  would  want  the  tow operator  to  tow  to  their

workshops,  or  other  car parks and this  would  affect  the

operation  of  the  towing operator.  As such,  the  proposal

stipulates that the tow operator would only need to tow to  a

place  nearby.   In  fact, in practice, LTA  would  designate

nearby  HDB and URA car parks for these vehicles to be  towed

to.  Sometimes, a motorist may make a request and say instead

of  this car park, why not tow to the next car park which  is

more convenient for him.  In this regard, LTA can be flexible

as  long  as  the  tow  operator  feels  that  it  would  not

compromise  on its stringent time requirement.  So  the  word

"near"  is  used  for  this purpose so  that  there  is  some

flexibility on where the car park should be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Chin made a very good point on what if a

motorist is not at the scene when the vehicle is towed  away,

and  what  could he do to find out what has happened  to  his

vehicle.  Yes, the Bill says that he will be given a  notice.

But  Prof. Chin is right that the notice would only come  one

or  two  days  later.  What he can do is  to  call  the  EMAS

hotline number at 3334111, as suggested by Prof. Chin.  I  am

sure a lot of motorists could see this number when they drive

along  the expressway.  LTA would publicise this number,  and

if  a  motorist finds that his vehicle is not there, this  is

the number to call.  In fact, this number is manned 24 hours.

Of  course, they can go to the police if they want,  but  the

police would also ask them to call the EMAS hotline number.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked how would one know whether or not a

tunnel is part of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>



expressway.    Currently,  the  CTE  tunnels  have   signages

delineating  the entrances of the tunnels to  give  motorists

advance  notice.  With this amendment coming into  operation,

these  tunnels,  as  part of the expressway,  would  also  be

gazetted and additional publicity would be given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question raised by Prof. Chin is whether, in a

tunnel, the motorist can arrange for his own tow truck to tow

away  the  vehicle.  Sir, motorists are allowed to use  their

own  towing  service on expressways, which are  not  tunnels,

provided  that the private towing service arrives before  the

EMAS   towing  service.   But  to  ensure  the   safety   and

convenience of the other motorists on the expressway,  it  is

important  that stalled vehicles are towed away quickly,  and

not  be left on the carriageway or shoulders.  Therefore,  if

the  EMAS  towing service arrives first, the stalled  vehicle

would be towed away by the EMAS towing service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to a tunnel, it is a very vulnerable

environment.   Because overseas experience has shown  that  a

small  accident  in a tunnel could lead to a  major  disaster

involving many casualties.  Hence, it is necessary  that  tow

operators are familiar with the tunnel regulations, entrances

and  exits.  They should also be equipped with first aid  and

fire  fighting skills, familiar with the location  of  tunnel

safety  equipment, the safety procedures  and  assist  in  an

emergency  evacuation.  LTA's appointed  towing  operator  is

fully  equipped  with  the set skills and  knowledge.   Other

towing operators may not be trained to operate safely in  the

CTE   tunnels.   In  addition,  the  appointed  towing   crew

comprises  two  operators, one would assist  to  recover  the

stalled  vehicle,  and  the other would  ensure  that  safety

procedures,  such as the use of safety cones,  are  observed.

This  would ensure maximum safety inside the tunnel.   Unlike

other  towing  companies,  they usually  have  only  one-man-operated tow crew.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to Mr Ong Ah Heng's questions. First, he

asked  why the unclaimed surplus money could not be given  to

charity  and  why  should  it go  to  the  Government.   Sir,

forfeiture of unclaimed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>



surplus  money  to  Government,  after  setting  off  against

outstanding  charges under section 123A, is  consistent  with

the  other  fiscal provisions in RTA.  These  provisions  are

correct  because we should not mix charity with the provision

of  unclaimed money going to the Government.  The  Government

would  have  its own programme and budget for  charity  work.

But this is unclaimed money and it should go to the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong asked whether, under section 123A(8),

publication  by Gazette before the vehicle is  auctioned,  we

should  also make it a requirement to notify the owner before

it  is  auctioned.  Let me say that this notification in  the

Gazette  is  a requirement before the vehicle is put  up  for

auction.  But, administratively, once the vehicle is towed to

a  parking place, the vehicle owner will be notified, and  if

he  does  not  collect the vehicle, he will  be  reminded  to

collect  the  vehicle.  In the end, when the vehicle  is  not

collected  at all, it will then be put in the Gazette  for  a

month  before it is auctioned.  Yes, administratively, I  can

ask  LTA to send another letter again to tell him that we are

going   to   auction   his   vehicle.    We   can   do   that

administratively, but it is not required to  be  put  in  the

law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Ong asked how we could make sure that people

would  not argue that they had not received the notifications

or  notices of summonses.  The amendment here is to  make  it

clear that,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>



by  using one of the means indicated in serving a notice,  it

is  deemed to have been served.  In fact, Mr Ong said that we

should make clear that this is so.  That is what we are doing

now,  that  is, by passing this law and publicising  it.   As

long  as  notices  are served by one of these  means,  it  is

deemed  to have been served and that it is the responsibility

of  the owner to comply with the requirement of the law.   We

cannot  force the owner to acknowledge whether or not he  has

received  the  notice.   What the law requires  is  that  the

Government  agency has served the notice and it is  therefore

up  to  the  individual or vehicle owner to comply  with  the

requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions and I

thank Members for their support.
