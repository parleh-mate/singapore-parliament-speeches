of Singapore, or MUIS, administers and regulates <em class="ph i">halal</em> certification
in Singapore. It issues individual <em class="ph i">halal</em> certificates to
a stall holder, food company or any other eating establishment that
complies with the terms and conditions of its <em class="ph i">halal</em> certification
system. In the case of a food court, only individual stalls are
issued with the <em class="ph i">halal</em> certificates. Hence, it is misleading
for a food court to claim that it has been <em class="ph i">halal</em>-certified. </p>

the integrity of the more than 2,700 <em class="ph i">halal</em> certificates issued.
Periodic and surprise inspections are conducted regularly to ensure
that the <em class="ph i">halal</em> certificate holders comply with the conditions.
In 2011, 7,000 such inspections were carried out. MUIS views any
breach of its <em class="ph i">halal</em> certification system seriously and investigates
all complaints by members of the public for any infringements of
conditions or misuse of its <em class="ph i">halal</em> certification mark. In
2011, 21 <em class="ph i">halal</em> certificate holders were found to be in breach. Of these,
14 had their certificates suspended while seven were issued with a

I thank the Minister for his reply. I am heartened to hear that
the amount of enforcement is quite significant. But there is a certain
perception among the community that MUIS does not go around to enforce
and check. Could the Minister inform us how we could enlighten the
community on how they could enforce their rights and, if possible,
contact MUIS? Also, how do we ensure the accountability on the part
of <em class="ph i">halal</em> food providers?</p>

Sir, on the integrity of the system, we take a three-pronged approach.
First of all, MUIS conducts both announced and unannounced visit
to the <em class="ph i">halal</em>-certified premises. More inspections will be
carried out for food establishments that were found to have not complied
with prescribed conditions and these, of course, are investigated
for infringements. As for those who are dealing with meat-based
products, we take a stricter view of such outlets and will be inspected
more often. MUIS also investigates every complaint that it receives.
So, the role of the public is also very important and we hope that
members of the public can continue to provide feedback to MUIS.
There are channels in which they can register their complaints either
through a phone call or an email on the MUIS' website.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4e515050-244c-4224-a07b-41fc0c3f0111">
                  <a name="id-5920d3c9-55bc-4e9e-b5b4-caf3710c57e8__id-4e515050-244c-4224-a07b-41fc0c3f0111"><!--a--></a>Finally, Sir, we expect
the certificate holders themselves will play their part by strictly
complying with all the conditions at all times and, more importantly,
to display their <em class="ph i">halal</em>-mark, which has been certified by
MUIS, timely. And if it needs to be renewed, we will keep them informed,
in fact, three months ahead of the next renewal. So, the system
is in place to ensure that there is timely renewal and information
regarding whether or not the premise is <em class="ph i">halal</em>-certified.
In terms of inspection, we will continue to step up especially the
unannounced inspection. Really, this is dependent upon the number of
people that we have on the ground. We have been working with some
other partners to ensure that we can step up our inspections across
the board.</p>

Mrs Chiam asks for the number of bankrupts who are sent for "debt
restructuring schemes". I take it that Mrs Chiam is referring to
the Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS) under Part 5A of the Bankruptcy
Act. The DRS was introduced in 2009 to allow debtors with regular
incomes and debts not exceeding $100,000, an opportunity to avoid
bankruptcy by paying off all or some of their debts through a repayment
plan. In 2010 and 2011, 274 debtors in total were placed on the
DRS. Of these, seven have completed the scheme while 29 fell out
of the scheme as they did not adhere to the repayment plan. The remaining
238 are still on the scheme. Sir, Mrs Chiam also asks for the number
of bankrupts who were discharged from bankruptcy in the past two
years. In 2010, 2,252 bankrupts were discharged from bankruptcy.
In 2011, the number was 1,391. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, the criteria
for the courts referring a case to DRS are set out in sections 65(7)
and 67(3) of the Bankruptcy Act. They are as follows: first, the
total debt involved in a bankruptcy application does not exceed
$100,000; second, the debtor is not an undischarged bankrupt and
has not been a bankrupt in the last five years; third, there is
no voluntary arrangement in respect of the debtor, either now or
within the last five years; fourth, the bankrupt is not already
in the DRS and has not been in the DRS in the last five years; and,
lastly, the debtor is not a sole proprietor or partner of a firm,
or a partner in a limited liability partnership. Upon referral to
DRS, the Official Assignee will make a more detailed assessment
on whether the referred debtor is suitable, and factors considered
include whether there are any other debts owed by the debtor, whether
the debtor earns a regular income and whether the debtor can propose
a viable repayment plan.</p>

Sir, over the next five years, our focus will be on increasing the
capacity of our public transport system, raising its service levels
and enhancing the overall commuting experience. This is key to addressing commuters'
current concerns and achieving our longer-term objective of encouraging
more Singaporeans to take public transport.</p>

heavily in our public transport system to increase its capacity
and coverage. The completion of the Downtown Line, North-South Line
Extension and Tuas West Extension will add another 51 kilometres
to our existing rail network. For existing rail lines, more new trains
will be put into service and the signalling system for the North-South
and East West Lines will be upgraded.</p>

these rail capacity improvements to be completed. In the meantime,
we will significantly ramp up bus capacity to relieve daily congestion
in public transport. The Government will partner the public transport
operators to add about 800 buses over the next five years, or a
20% increase. Details will be given during the Ministry of Transport's
(MOT's) Committee of Supply (COS) debate. We will also upgrade major
bus stops and implement more bus priority measures to improve service reliability.</p>

into MRT stations.</p>

will be significant progress in our efforts to make public transport
a choice mode, and deliver a commuter-centric and well-integrated
bus-rail network. Our strategies must serve us well even beyond
the next five years and, therefore, we will also review the Land
Transport Masterplan which was put out four years ago. Over the
next year or so, we will engage key stakeholders and invite ideas
from the public to develop an updated Masterplan to serve as our
roadmap for the next 10 to 15 years.</p>

May I ask two supplementary questions, Sir? One, what is the distribution

and what would be the basis of prioritisation? In particular, in
new towns like Punggol 21 where it is less well served than many other
more mature towns, what are the plans in terms of increasing both
the frequency as well as adding new routes to the new towns?</p>

reviewed every quarter – in February, May, August and November –
as well as during the June and December school holidays each year.
During these reviews, the ERP rates are adjusted based on the prevailing
traffic situation. An optimal speed range determined by a Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) study is used to guide the review. This speed range
is 45 to 65 km/h for expressways and 20 to 30 km/h for arterial
roads. When speeds exceed or fall below the optimal range, based
on measurements carried out by LTA over a two-week period once every
quarter, the ERP rates will be adjusted downwards or upwards respectively.</p>

ensure that traffic should be relatively congestion-free when we
have the ERP in place. However, traffic flow is dynamic. Accidents
and bad weather impact road conditions and, hence, driving speeds.
There is also some lag in adjusting the ERP charges as we only do
these measurements once every quarter.</p>

such that speeds are above the optimal range, LTA will bring down
the ERP charges at the next review. For example, the ERP rate for
the Central Expressway (CTE) gantry north of Braddell Road for the
period 7.00am to 7.30am was recently revised downwards. If this
happens repeatedly because traffic speeds are consistently above
the optimal threshold, it is possible that ERP charges will fall
to zero.</p>

by influencing motorists' driving behaviour. This is possible only
when motorists know the ERP rates in advance. With advance knowledge
of the ERP rates, motorists can then decide whether to travel as
planned, or take a different route, travel at a different time,
or change their mode of travel to public transport. They can also
decide to travel somewhere else or even cancel their trip completely.
Hence, we fix the ERP rates for a period of time until the next
cycle of review, so that motorists can make informed decisions about
their choice of travel time, route or mode.</p>

system, we provide timely information to motorists as much as possible. This
allows motorists wishing to avoid ERP to do so, for example, when
there is severe congestion caused by incidents on the road. If they
are already on the road, motorists will be alerted of incidents through
the Expressway Monitoring Advisory System (EMAS) Travel Information
Displays (TID) and LTA's
Traffic News on the radio. Motorists can also access real-time traffic
information before they begin their travel, via LTA's traffic.smart
on the One.Motoring website, and adjust their travel plans accordingly.</p>

I thank the Minister of State for her reply. She mentioned that
there was a lag in the adjustments of rates due to the quarterly
reviews and that information provided to motorists is as real-time
as it can get. Some time ago, there was talk about using a GPS-based
system which would provide dynamic real-time information both to
the agencies as well as the motorists. Is this currently being studied?
Will it be implemented in due course? The second supplementary question
is on the ERP. I am happy to hear that it could even be down to
zero-rated. Has there been any such experience in the past?</p>

I thank the Member for the questions. I believe that the system
the Member is referring to is ERP2. The development of the ERP2
project is still in its early stages. We awarded a tender to four
consortium groups last year to conduct a system evaluation test
for the next generation ERP system. The tests are still ongoing.
Because when we have a very built-up city and distances travelled
by motorists can be very short, we have to make sure that it can
be reliably used for the purposes of road pricing. The tests are
still ongoing and, even if the ERP2 system is technically feasible, it
is still some years before it is ready to be launched and implemented.
Once the technology is proven, we will study how we can use the
ERP2 system to influence motorists' driving behaviour more effectively.</p>

Sir, blood investigations are conducted for various purposes, ranging
from routine health assessments, monitoring of a chronic condition,
to the clinical management of an acutely ill person. The type and
frequency of blood investigations are determined based on clinical
needs after the assessment of the patient's conditions.</p>

of cases and specialisation in medicine, we need to ensure that
care is better coordinated between different clinical departments
and to avoid duplicated tests. Our healthcare institutions have
introduced measures, such as electronic medical records, to reduce
duplication of tests. As test results can be accessed online by
healthcare professionals involved in the care of the patient, blood
tests are often not repeated unless it is clinically required, such
as monitoring of platelet levels in dengue patients and monitoring
of white blood cell counts in a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy.</p>

by our hospitals to reduce duplication of tests is the iSMART blood orders
tracking system at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Specialist Outpatient
Clinics. This system allows
nurses to track the blood tests that have been ordered by different
clinical departments to enable the samples to be obtained at one
sitting and the results shared by the departments.</p>

decision to discharge a patient is made based on the patient's clinical conditions.
A patient requiring admission and blood cultures tend to be generally
quite ill and, hence, would usually stay in the hospital until results
are obtained to inform treatment decisions and until the patient's
conditions have improved. However, if the patient's condition improves
or the illness has been determined to be non-infectious in nature,
the medical team can discharge the patient earlier before the culture
results are finalised and the patient would be given a follow-up
appointment, as an outpatient for a review of his conditions as
well as the culture results.</p>

the Minister for his comprehensive answer. I have been told that
it is possible these days to use diagnostic kits with just a very
small sample of blood for a number of tests, instead of taking specific
blood samples for specific tests. Is that something that is also
being practised in our hospitals? If so, then it could really reduce
the number of times that a patient would be asked to give blood
for tests.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I
agree with the Member's general intention that we should minimise
the number of tests that are done on the patient unless they are
necessary. However, blood tests are such that they are usually for
specific objectives and purposes. When we take blood samples, they
are to be tested for specific results that we are looking for. Therefore,
it is unlikely for us to be able to draw blood from a patient for
a comprehensive test in anticipation of tests that would be needed
in future. Usually, the doctors or nurses in attendance will decide
the relevant tests that need to be done on the blood sample. So
we will draw the blood and it will be subject to the tests that
are prescribed by the doctors or nurses for the specific purpose
of treating the patient's diseases. If the patient is admitted subsequently
for a different episode, tests may have to be done again because
the illnesses or the problems that the patient has may be quite
different from the conditions before and, therefore, repeat tests
may be necessary so that we can determine the conditions of the
patient and are able to prescribe treatment more precisely. These
are clinical decisions that will be decided by the doctors and the
nurses on the ground based on the conditions of the patient. But
I do agree with the Member that we should continue to see how we
can minimise unnecessary tests or duplication of tests because tests
are inconvenient and sometimes can be painful to patients. So, our
objectives are in alignment.</p>

"A Carings Budget", "A thoughtful Budget" − these were some of the terms
used to describe Budget 2012. I have had several dialogues and discussions
in the last week with different business groups, residents and the
online community on their reactions to Budget 2012. The Government's
move in this Budget to pay attention to seniors, the disabled and
lower-income Singaporeans and their families is welcomed. However,
some feel that the Budget is not as inclusive as it did not address
segments that they feel need support, given the high cost of living.
These include the singles, the "sandwiched" class, the middle income,
including retirees and those who live in private property but are
not well off. Reactions to the measures to restructure our economy
and managing dependence on foreign workers and support for SMEs
were mixed. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-9843ce2d-2b38-40a9-8367-bafbf57d6ca8"><!--a--></a>The Deputy Prime Minister
and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in Budget 2012 outlined
the directions for the Government to embark to build an inclusive
society and a stronger Singapore. He outlined the principal focus
of Budget 2012 to be one of addressing Singapore's longer-term challenges
and building a better future for Singaporeans. The Deputy Prime
Minister announced a whole range of economic and social strategies
to achieve these goals centered around two key strategies: (1) Sustaining
economic growth; and (2) Building a fair and inclusive society.
Both these strategies are not easy to achieve but are critical for
the future of Singapore and Singaporeans. I am glad to see the directions
set out in this year's Budget.</p>

would like to touch on three areas: (1) challenges faced by companies
as they move to restructure their businesses; (2) our growing income
gap and how Budget 2012 sets out to address this; and (3) older
workers and the CPF reinstatement. </p>

operating in Singapore, both large and small, is the issue of rising business
cost. Labour, rental and energy costs have driven business costs
upwards quite significantly. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-68a79685-185f-4253-a5c1-c54129635e6c">

that there is a need to reduce the reliance on foreign workers.
With easy access to foreign workers, wages of Singaporeans, especially
the lower-skilled workers, tend to be depressed. There is also an
increasing burden stretching the limits of our infrastructure with
a growing workforce. However, there are worries of the shortage
of talent and the tight labour market in the short term which will
impact the ability of businesses to operate effectively and address
opportunities. This will result in increased costs to businesses
and lead to higher cost for consumers.</p>

of reduction in the Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRCs) and S Passes is
understood, companies, especially the SMEs, will have to adjust
and they will feel the pain in making the transition. So, while
the implementation of the changes to the DRC has been calibrated
to allow businesses hiring foreign talent time until June 2014 to
comply with the new DRCs, companies will not be able to bring in
new foreign workers beyond the new DRCs from 1 July this year. This
will mean that adjustments must be done now and businesses and their
plans will be impacted. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-101a4e50-612f-494b-8be7-22ca9876eb2b"><!--a--></a>In many industries where
jobs are taken up by foreign workers, these jobs are not necessarily
the jobs that Singaporeans want. Many have cited that culture plays
an important role in shaping the perception and desirability of
some of these jobs. Many have expressed concerns on whether companies
will be able to attract Singaporeans to do these jobs. In the ICPAS
pre-Budget roundtable that I participated in, panelists felt that
the current income and offerings in the service sector were less
than desirable and more must be done together with appropriate polices
to tackle these issues. To make a concerted effort and to accelerate
these efforts to attract locals to the sector, recommendation was
made to perhaps appoint a champion agency.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-384d5910-46e6-41d9-b763-40c07ade91d5"><!--a--></a>For some industries, for the higher skilled
jobs, the issue is whether Singapore is producing enough of the
right skilled resources in time to fill the higher end jobs created
as companies move up the value chain. In many business forums as
well as in feedback from our members in the Government Parliamentary
Committee (GPC) Resource Panel, who are from various industries,
both SMEs and MNCs, a common thread we hear is that many experience
difficulty in hiring higher skilled Singaporeans in their respective
areas. The concern is whether our educational system is providing
the relevant training that graduates and employers want. Is the
economy able to accept these graduates in jobs that align to their
skills as well as their expectations? A stronger economy for the
future will require a skilled labour force. Hence, the greater policy
concern going forward, especially as opportunities for pursuing
tertiary education are increased in Singapore, is the employment
of higher skilled Singaporeans and how they will meet the needs
of businesses. While businesses will need to invest to develop their
talent base as they restructure, there needs to be better collaboration
between industry and educational institutions in meeting future
skills needs of the various sectors. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dded3749-28ba-446d-8048-e03afac38c8e">
                  <a name="motion__id-dded3749-28ba-446d-8048-e03afac38c8e"><!--a--></a>Another point on foreign
talent that came up in the various dialogues was around Professionals, Managers
and Executives (PMEs) jobs and quality jobs for Singaporeans. Several
expressed concerns of being "crowded out" of these PME roles, given
the competition from foreign talent. While many agree that with
the pace of growth and the focus on upgrading industries, Singapore
must stay open to foreign talent. However, more needs to be done
to ensure skills transfer and development of local talent for these
roles and also a focus to reduce the heavy reliance on foreign talent.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-da862f64-c94a-429d-950d-1dbcb6edd4dc"><!--a--></a>To support SMEs to innovate
and increase productivity, especially in the light of the economic challenges
and the changes to the DRC, this year's Budget does have several
welcomed measures. These include the enhanced Productivity and Innovation
Credit (PIC) Cash Payout up to 60% of $100,000, enabling PIC payout
on a quarterly basis, the ability to use PIC for in-house training
without the need for certification, and the changes of qualification
for R&amp;D expenditures and software development, the One-Off Cash
grant, the Special Employment Credit, and a few other measures.
These will definitely prove useful and helpful for the companies,
especially SMEs, in addressing the cost of doing business and enabling
their growth. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-a57de551-69ae-4cdb-8dc3-e946e21d4d96"><!--a--></a>What is important, however,
is to ensure that access to these funds and support is simple so
that companies that most need it are able to access it, and enjoy
the reliefs and obtain the funds when they are needed. This is where
I feel improvements must be done. As it is often said, while the
policies and schemes are the right ones, the implementation and
execution are important to achieve the intended results.</p>

point with the PIC application process. Currently, there is quite
a lot of information on PIC to help companies. This is, however,
where the problem lies. There is a bit too much information for
most companies to handle and they will require time to understand
the vast amount of data available. Let me give an example. The PIC
guide, "<em class="ph i">Productivity and Innovation Credit revised in 15th July
2011</em>", is a 66-page guide. You will agree with me that you can
probably write a book with this. The FAQs guide, "<em class="ph i">FAQ for PIC
and cash grant</em>", is a 22-page document with 72 questions. The PIC
forms in the IRAS website are not too difficult to fill. The challenge
is in understanding the criteria which companies are required to
check, validate and get the appropriate approvals from the relevant agencies
against their other tax criteria. I think you get my drift now on
the need for simplification. While promising small companies can
and should tap the scheme, given their day-to-day operations and business
pressures, they do not have the capacity to navigate the complexity
of the application for the scheme. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-bcf22d31-6276-4140-a213-befb07ddb484"><!--a--></a>For companies to make the shift and to
restructure as well, it is more than just a matter of cost. What will
be required is also appropriate skills and expertise to enable the
change and to drive innovation. Many of these companies do not have
the relevant skills and expertise. Enhancing productivity requires companies
to focus on systems, processes and technology to innovate and improve
quality of products and services. It may be worthwhile to explore
a pool of expertise that can be made easily accessible and the aggregation
of demand would lower the cost to utilise them. Change management
and business process re-engineering is also required. </p>

to touch on the point of fair and inclusive growth. I would not
be discussing the details of the schemes announced, but I would
like specifically to talk about the point on the growing income
gap and how Budget 2012 has set out to address income inequality,
and the steps taken towards income, redistribution and preserving
opportunities for Singaporeans and ensuring social mobility. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4f7b71e5-eaf6-47ae-b142-1322b33e7a31">
                  <a name="motion__id-4f7b71e5-eaf6-47ae-b142-1322b33e7a31"><!--a--></a>Singapore, as we all know,
is small, is an open city and open to market forces. Like many other global
cities like Hong Kong, London, Seoul, New York, we face the same
challenge of the growing income gap. But I am glad to see the deliberate
steps and position taken by the Government to address this difficult
challenge of the growing income gap. As outlined by Deputy Prime
Minister Tharman in his Budget Statement, he said, and I quote,
"we cannot leave our social compact vulnerable to market forces.
We have to do all we can to contain inequality and to sustain social
mobility in each new generation. We are therefore making a determined,
multi-year effort to raise the prospects of success for lower income
families. We must also give our middle income families every opportunity
to achieve their aspirations in an evolving and often unpredictable
economic environment."</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-5955de47-d425-48e2-8a46-7cdefe6f0320"><!--a--></a>Education and jobs will
continue to be levers for all Singaporeans to achieve success. And
we must ensure that there are opportunities for all children and
workers to qualify for quality education, training and jobs. This
will need to be supported and sustained by Singapore's continued
income growth. </p>

in Budget 2012 is also to be targeted in our efforts. Although it
is not perfect, it will in some way ensure that we keep our efforts
for income distribution and preserve social mobility. As I have
said earlier, many have expressed that it is not as inclusive because
there may be groups that are less well-off that may need help, and
I think we need to be cognisant of this and ensure that they do get
the help that they need, but we need to ensure that Budget 2012
stays targeted so that the groups that need help do get it. I am
glad to see that the Budget while targeted in its approach, it does
attempt to broaden the reach of the schemes to include the lower
end of the middle-income group who may not be as well off. </p>

examples. The GST Voucher Scheme, which is based on income and the
annual value of homes, does include Singaporeans living in the lower
end private properties. The annual value criterion which is capped
at $20,000 covers about 15% of private properties. I would ask that
the Ministry consider the suggestion and feedback to refine the
Medisave component of the GST Voucher to include those 60-65 years
of age. Given the concerns of the rising cost of healthcare in our elderly,
many in this age group who are already out of the workforce may
not have sufficient provisions for their healthcare needs and require
help. </p>

GST and increase in subsidies for long-term care, including community hospitals,
nursing homes, day care and rehabilitation facilities and home-based
care packages will enable more in the middle income group to also
benefit. Those who previously did not receive any subsidy will now
be able to do so. MOF has also indicated that with these changes,
80% of elderly or two-thirds of Singaporean households will qualify
for these subsidies. This will indirectly help their family members
who are taking care of them and paying for their medical expenses. </p>

Singaporeans with disabilities are welcomed. The measures on early
intervention and education will benefit some 2,000 children, and
supporting employment will enable more Singaporeans with special
needs to participate. Adult care and subsidies for adult Singaporeans
with severe disabilities will also enable middle-income families
to offset about 50% of annual cost in attending Day Activity Centres
while lower-income families will benefit more. </p>

I have highlighted, show deliberate steps to redistribute income
and help Singaporeans cope with increasing costs while ensuring
financial viability and sustainability of the programmes. Many of
these measures are not one-off for the year and the Budget has put
schemes with specific funds set aside to ensure financial stability
and sustainability. For example, $3.6 billion has been put aside
for the GST Voucher Fund, $2.3 billion for the Special Employment
Credit and Top-up of $200 million for the Edusave Endowment Fund. </p>

of businesses of increasing cost of doing business with any increase
in labour cost, I must say that I am glad that finally, we are raising
the CPF contribution rates of older workers. CPF contribution rates
for older workers were lowered in the late 1980s and, again, in
the 1990s. The then seniority-based wage system discouraged employers
from hiring older workers as the seniority based system at the time
made the older worker more costly to hire than the younger worker. With
the focus on productivity and the flattening of the wage system
to one focused on performance, it is now only fair that older workers
are recognised and rewarded for the work that they do. I personally find
it hard to justify why any older worker is paid less just because
they are older. If they are able to do the work, they should be
rewarded for the same as any worker, young or old. On the recommendations for
the rise in the CPF contributions for older workers, I would also
encourage the Government to consider extending the CPF contribution
rates for those above 65 years who can and are working.</p>

on services rather than manufacturing. And, hence, productivity while
it still entails getting things done faster in a shorter time does
imply the need for experience and knowledge. So while an older worker
may be physically slower in some instances, it does not necessarily mean
that they are less effective than their younger counterparts. Let
me give you a very simple example. Take going into a store or going
into a restaurant as an example: the quality of the service you
receive from the service personnel really depends on their knowledge
of the products and services and their ability to understand and
match your needs and then to follow up and give you the products
and services you require. The ability to complete the transaction
in the shortest time and to provide you with a quality customer
experience need not mean that each step must be done in the shortest
time but rather the ability to complete it in the shortest time
accurately. With older workers better educated and having more experience,
their ability to provide good service and to understand customer
needs will be strong. Their ability to retrieve products, input
the service requirements or complete the order quickly can be assisted with
suitable technologies to check stocks or to scan products or to
use portable input devices to input service requirements. </p>

there still exist perceptions and sometimes biases that older workers
may not be productive as compared to the younger workers and it
will take time for such perceptions to change. While the CPF contribution
rates are increased, having the Special Employment Credit (SEC)
in place will encourage employers to continue to employ older workers
and keep them in demand in the employment market. Together with
schemes like PIC and the restructuring of work to leverage the use of
technology and automation to be less labour intensive and to improving
the work processes, all these will enable older workers and disabled
workers to be more effective and equally productive. </p>

a recent example that I was fortunate to come to learn about during
the course of my commercial work. This is about a company that restructured
their business processes and policies to address their business challenges to
enable their workforce to be more productive. This company is called
Eureka Call Centre Pte Ltd. Eureka Call Centre is a 30-seat Call
Centre. It was facing high staff turnover and was not able to run
its operations effectively. In 2008, it decided to embark on an
ambitious re-engineering project. Eureka decided that they would
run a Call Centre with call agents who were visually impaired. In
2009, they started with their pioneer batch of visually impaired
call agents. They currently have 16 persons with physical disabilities
(PWDs) and intend to recruit 12 to15 more every six months. They
benchmark themselves with Call Centres that have able Call Agents
and they set their KPIs at 10% higher than able Call Agents and
aims to have their Call Agents to be more productive. They have
been successful in achieving these goals. And their Call Agents
handle an average of 30% to 50% more calls than able Call Agents.
They are able to do an average of 16% higher talk time per hour. They
were able to achieve this by re-engineering of their work processes
and providing technology to enable the PWDs and the visually impaired
workers do their work effectively. The User-Interface was re-programmed:
they use technologies like hotkeys as shortcuts, voice synthesizers
for the totally blind, screen magnifiers and high contrast displays,
and real time monitoring for supervision, training and barging. </p>

competitively, they also realise that their needs to socialise and
have outings was really what they valued. Job security and continuity
were also important. They had the appropriate HR policies to align
to the needs of their staff and they were able to retain a highly
motivated staff as well. On that point, I would say that the Special
Employment Credit that is in place, 16% for employers who hire SPED
graduates, regardless of age, is definitely welcomed. I do ask if
the Minister could consider extending this to include the employment
of all disabled workers. </p>

consider refinement of the SEC for older workers to not be capped
at $4,000 a month? With a large proportion of our workforce who
are PMETs, this will encourage employers to hire older PMETs. Currently,
they are the more vulnerable group in our workforce when companies make
decisions to downsize or restructure their businesses or operations.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me to join this Budget debate.
This year's Budget Statement heralds significant changes in our
priorities as a nation. In the past decade, as one financial crisis
after another hit our shores, our focus had been on mitigating the
impact. Keeping and creating jobs were paramount. We had pulled
out all stops to bring in new investments. Our efforts had paid
off. Singapore has been topping international rankings, including
those by the World Bank, as the easiest place to do business for
the last few years. Investments have been propelling our economic
growth and wealth creation. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ada34a83-86d6-454f-ad80-e47d6310b861">
                  <a name="motion__id-ada34a83-86d6-454f-ad80-e47d6310b861"><!--a--></a>However, not all Singaporeans
could catch up and benefit from the changes in our job environment. Our
income gap has widened. It is appropriate that we now implement
measures to recalibrate. This new Budget seeks to build a more inclusive
society by redistributing some of the new wealth to the poor and needy,
elderly and disabled. In addition, to preserve the character of
Singapore society, the Government has decided to reduce our dependency
on foreign workers and slow down immigration, even though this may mean slower growth.
We must be prepared to pay more to attract Singaporeans to redesign
jobs in sectors where foreign workers make up a significant proportion
of the staff. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1309</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-57fe990a-08e9-47c9-b23f-09c71366862f">
                  <a name="motion__id-57fe990a-08e9-47c9-b23f-09c71366862f"><!--a--></a>We are well aware that
this move will result in higher costs in a few areas which will
ultimately hit our own wallets. Nonetheless, we can derive a sense
of comfort, assurance and pride from knowing that it is a fellow
Singaporean who had just fixed our laptop, took our order, cooked
our lunch, and drove us to work; it is a fellow Singaporean who
will be here with us for the long haul, not a transient worker;
it is a fellow Singaporean getting decent pay to support his parents
and children. This is what it means to be part of a nation tribe.
In a world of over seven billion people, just over three million
are Singaporeans. We are a very small tribe. Hence, all the more
we should look out for one another. It is no longer as important
to race ahead at all costs as to make the journey together as one
family, slowing down now and then to check on the weaker members
and ensure that they do not fall too far behind.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-110e9da3-aae2-4665-abe9-dd597c6d08bc"><!--a--></a>The measures to improve
the conditions for older workers in employment send a good signal
that while we should not expect to be paid more for seniority, we
should not discount a person just because he or she has more grey
hair or, for that matter, less hair. It is not what is on the head,
but in the head that is more important. However, I would like to
remind us that just because these measures and the push to reduce
dependency on foreign workers are announced together, we are not
expecting senior citizens to take on all the displaced jobs of foreigners.
Jobs will certainly need to be redesigned to increase productivity
and people's mindset need to change too to learn new skills and
venture into new careers.</p>

job and in making an honest living, but there will be jobs that
will be difficult to find enough Singaporeans to want to do and
I will be happy that fellow Singaporeans need not take on these
jobs and can find better ones. To me, these would include jobs of
the construction workers and cleaners. There will also be professions
that our local population will not be big enough to provide enough
people to meet an increasing demand. For instance, the healthcare
sector. I am glad that by 2020, the number of beds in acute hospitals
will be increased by 1,900 beds and in Community Hospitals, 1,800
beds. How many more doctors, nurses and allied healthcare workers
do we need? I support the move to improve conditions to attract
more people to join the healthcare sector, but given that our population
is not going to increase much further but ageing rapidly, how many
can we attract or displace from other sectors? How many can our
educational institutions train in time to meet the demand?</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-d43a1cca-29e1-4e7a-accd-bcc58fb0e0a8"><!--a--></a>I find that the reduction
in the Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRCs), although calibrated, when applied
across the whole manufacturing and services sectors, is too blunt
a tool. I urge the Government to look into the needs and characteristics
of specific industries and adjust the ratios accordingly. I am suggesting
that for a start, cleaning, construction and nursing sectors be
given more leeway to employ foreigners.</p>

of foreigners in Singapore, over the past week, I have had some
very direct responses from many Singaporeans regarding my comments

benefit of doubt to what the student said, and attempting to soothe
the hard feelings of some Singaporeans, I was accused of siding
with a foreigner and not standing up for fellow Singaporeans. It
was never my intention to undermine Singaporeans but to those whose
feelings my words have hurt, I am sorry. I reflected myself and
this is my learning: I do not think that we can just treat all the negative
sentiments against foreigners as noise and expect that people would
just learn or have to be rational. </p>

to uproot themselves), give them scholarships and money to cover
their expenses, so that they will uproot and come to Singapore,

schools €¦ The excuse the government gives is that these people need
to catch up on English. However, this gives the foreigners an unfair
advantage over Singaporeans because they are 1 to 2 years ahead
of the Singaporean kids in their standard, in terms of maturity,
knowledge, intelligence €¦ They end up getting better results than
Singapore kids. Many eventually get scholarships in post-secondary
education as well in university education, at the expense of Singaporeans.
The government has not been fair to Singaporeans at all. Double
standards exist in favour of foreigners. Singaporean commoners do
not get scholarships, but foreigners with such an unfair advantage,
have scholarships thrown at them €¦ It is time for the Singapore
government to put its citizens first €¦ How can Singaporeans be treated

very harsh words and phrases but I believe I have not paraphrased
out of context. I do not know how many Singaporeans feel this way
even though I know not all the points raised are factual, but suffice
to say, there are such feelings among Singaporeans that the Government sometimes
seems to place more emphasis on foreigners or prospective Singaporeans.
When I was studying for my "A" levels, I was sent to an ASEAN scholar
class. About a third of my classmates from Malaysia and Brunei joined
us during the June holidays of our first year. They used to study
the various subjects in their home country in Malay and had to catch
up with the rest of us not only in the language adjustment, but
also six months of curriculum. I was impressed with their diligence
and many did well eventually. Some have settled down in Singapore
and have given our country our new sons and daughters. </p>

the number and proportion of foreign students have increased. And
because we only want to attract quality students, many of them competed
against Singaporeans in examinations, competitions, sports, arts
and scholarships. Unfortunately, there will always be black sheep
in every community, any misbehaviour is easily amplified and this
tarnishes the reputation of foreigners.</p>

is also evident outside the schools. We used to have expatriates
working and living in Singapore, and sometimes they tend to socialise
within specific communities and spaces. Now, it is a good thing
that foreigners are living in HDB flats, taking public transport
and eating at hawker centres. They are better assimilated in the
Singapore society. When I was living in London, I believed there
were more of us foreigners in central London than the local British,
but they lived in the outskirts or other smaller cities, towns,
or villages where the population there is more or less homogeneous.
However, Singapore does not have the luxury of space, and whether
we are in Jurong, Queenstown or Tampines, we squeeze with more or
less the same people queuing up for buses and taxis, or rushing
to get into the MRT trains. We have to understand that when it is
a daily experience of having to fight for places or space, people
are naturally tested for their patience and emotions may run high. People
felt squeezed out in their own homeland, not only for seats in the
train or for vacancy in the school, or university, or for resale
flat.</p>

like to highlight an interesting phenomenon in Singapore. Most of
our new immigrants or foreigners working, living and studying in
Singapore are from China. Most would expect that since the majority
of Singaporeans are Chinese, there will be a natural fit. However,
among the Chinese, we would be able to identify a different language,
accent or slang in the way we speak. Hence, we might even be more
conscious of the differences among us. I believe it could be a similar
situation within
the Indian community. As a non-Indian, I cannot differentiate between
Tamil, Hindi or any Indian dialects, but I believe some Singaporean
Indians would be able to tell from a glance whether someone is from
northern India or southern India. Therefore, there is a certain
dynamic within seemingly identical ethnic groups and sometimes,
this leads to tension. </p>

to be xenophobic given that the world is getting smaller and that
talents are global, including Singaporean talents. NBA star Jeremy
Lin must be the most newly-famous American now. Through his hard
work and talent, he is a shooting star in the basketball arena and
an inspiration for many, not only Chinese worldwide, but the world
too, including Americans of all races. I am sure when his parents
migrated from Taiwan to the United States, they would have struggled settling
down in a foreign land. Even when Jeremy grew up in an American
environment, he had suffered prejudices and I read that he has been
called names like "wonton soup" and "sweet and sour pork". If he
had not persevered, he probably would have become a volleyball or
a table tennis player. If we care too much about what people call
us, we will find it difficult to be more than a stereotype or an inaccurate
label. Let us be confident and quietly proud of ourselves of who
we are.</p>

as this Budget has set the broad direction to develop Singapore
as an inclusive society, we must be mindful of what may tear us
apart. I have learnt that no matter what my intentions may be, I
need to be mindful and be more sensitive of what people might read
into certain words. Likewise, in our policies and the way we implement
our policies, we must be mindful of how people may perceive them.
We need to communicate more and engage better. If a policy was not
well received, let us try different ways to create a dialogue and
explain our thinking. But we must always remain open to change a
policy when necessary. We may want to persist in our argument that
it is for the long-term interest, but we need also to demonstrate
immediate benefits. We should not win a battle to lose the war, but
we should aim to sort out any dispute before escalating to a confrontation.
With that, Mr Speaker, I support the Budget.</p>

                  </span>:
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir, I see Budget 2012 as a response to new
economic, social and political realities facing Singapore. The Government
should be congratulated for taking these changes into account, and
with Budget 2012, we are better placed to address concerns of many
Singaporeans, particularly those in the lower income brackets. I
wish to focus my current comments, and those that I intend to make
during the Committee of Supply debates, on this latter group of
Singaporeans – those from the lower income and less skilled groups.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-196c4a28-c604-44ad-8607-125623aabb99">
                  <a name="motion__id-196c4a28-c604-44ad-8607-125623aabb99"><!--a--></a>This new, inclusive approach
of the Government in budgeting is a positive move. By allocating
more funds to help the elderly, the needy and the less able, the
Government is acknowledging that some groups of Singaporeans need
special attention. I hope that in our upcoming debate, we will continue
with this approach, and allocate the Government's budget to address
current and immediate concerns of less fortunate Singaporeans. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-82c2f810-ffc5-43e1-a0c6-5f274b0a68a1">
                  <a name="motion__id-82c2f810-ffc5-43e1-a0c6-5f274b0a68a1"><!--a--></a>To start with, Sir, I
am deeply concerned with the plight of older and less skilled workers.
I accept the Government's argument that the best and the most sustainable
way to raise incomes is by improving productivity. And this comes
through upskilling and use of technology and even processes. This approach
is well and fine for many workers, but perhaps not so applicable
to those in the lowest rungs of our workforce. Let me give you an
example. Recently, I was approached by an elderly man, in his late
50s, approaching 60s. He works as a cleaner in a small company.
To his credit, he said that he had heard a news report that his
income could go up if he could improve his productivity. Then he
asked me how he
could go about improving his productivity. Honestly, it is not an
easy answer. Because while I could tell him to attend a course to
upgrade himself, or learn to use the cleaning machines, I knew that his
company, which is a small one, was not going to send him for many
courses, or buy many machines. For him, there would be a difficult
way up. At close to 60 years of age, he struggles and is unlikely
to learn a new trade. Realistically, he is unlikely to find a new
job, even in more progressive cleaning companies. So, the Government's
call for workers to improve productivity was irrelevant to him.
This is not an uncommon view among workers in the services sectors
like cleaning, health care, F&amp;B, retail, etc. To these workers,
in these sectors, it is all good and well to throw a big word like
productivity at them, but they still struggle to come to terms on
how it will really make an impact in the way they work, the salary
that they earn and the career progression that they may have.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-d07e3a87-7ce2-4908-aa0d-50ed8d2674d1"><!--a--></a>Sir, this is just one
example – workers in many small companies in Singapore may be in
the same situation – and my point is that at the macro level, it
is reasonable to talk about improving productivity as a way of improving
incomes. But at the micro level, we must have a more meaningful
discussion about how individual workers can hope to raise their
incomes, so that they too can benefit from the results of Singapore's
progress. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8634a9b5-38fc-42c2-b130-0e0d3df2cd3d">
                  <a name="motion__id-8634a9b5-38fc-42c2-b130-0e0d3df2cd3d"><!--a--></a>I believe that we have
not fully recognised the plight of the low-income workers and particularly
so, the plight of older and less skilled workers. I urge the Government
to place some emphasis, using the power of whole of Government,
to look at how we can improve the lives of this group. While I am
sure that they appreciate the rebates, the vouchers, and so on,
that the Government offers from time to time, I think that there
is a need for a closer examination of where each dollar of a low-wage
worker earns goes to. A question that I would like to ask is: how
much of the earnings of the low-wage worker go to paying direct
and indirect government-related taxes, fees, charges and the like?
If we do have some sense of the reality, we could consider options
that are more effective in helping them cope with the challenges
that they faced. Like, what scope exists to reduce these charges,
for example? My logic is that a low-wage worker's standard of living
can be improved not only by increasing his income, but also by reducing
the cost of his living. I believe that now is the most opportune
time to look at this issue because, in fact, our Minister for Manpower
is also the Minister of Finance!</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-31659539-3982-4a9a-962e-299f03fbba5f">
                  <a name="motion__id-31659539-3982-4a9a-962e-299f03fbba5f"><!--a--></a>Sir, I accept that the
issue of housing for low-income workers is a complex one too. I
have previously suggested that the HDB look at managing the sale
of 3-room and smaller flats differently – totally different from
the way we do it now, so that poorer households can buy or rent
homes at an affordable price. Today, I would like to suggest even
more bolder and radical ideas to the Government. One idea is for
HDB to consider selling homes on shorter leases – say 50 years or
60 years lease, for example – for Singaporeans with lower incomes
and limited financial resources. HDB can put further restrictions like
recovery of subsidies on sales and buy them back at a cost-plus
basis. This can remove speculation of 3-room or smaller flats, and
revert the HDB to its original mission of housing a nation. If we
make enough effort, I am confident that we can think of a scheme
to reduce the start-up burden on low-income families and even young
families, and they can be assured of a roof over their heads at
a reasonable price. This would be another way to reduce the burden
of cost on low-income workers and also for young Singaporeans.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5c1a2ace-d74c-4dcc-b00f-3107d25c26a5">
                  <a name="motion__id-5c1a2ace-d74c-4dcc-b00f-3107d25c26a5"><!--a--></a>Next, Sir, beyond the
low-income workers, I also wish to focus and discuss on workers
in general, and whether our education and training system is preparing
our students for the work life. We know that Singapore's brand and
reputation on education is well-known far and wide. Our schools
and tertiary institutions are ranked among the best in the world,
so I think it is only reasonable to expect that our young people,
having attended these schools, should be highly productive. Yet,
when we talk to our businesses, this does not seem to be the case.
They find school leavers to be book smart, but not street smart.
They seem to know how to behave in a classroom, but not in a workplace.
And they seem to lack a hunger to excel and are demanding in their
expectation. I am not sure what the cause of this apparent gap is.
Is it because we teach what is not exactly relevant to what the
businesses want? Or is it because we teach theoretical principles, but not
how these will be relevant in the workplace? Or does the issue lie
with the students – after being told to study hard, work so hard
that they can get comfortable jobs, they think that getting a degree
means that they have arrived. Perhaps, it is true that they have
arrived, but they need to accept that they have only arrived at
the start of the next phase of their lives – where they can only
achieve their aspirations through continued hard work!</p>

must consider is the difficulties that some of our workers face
in retirement. Sir, we have received much feedback about the elderly
in my housing estates who are very concerned about their retirement
and employability in their old age. I was, in fact, very encouraged
when the Government, in the past few years, was discussing ways
to improve the returns of the CPF balances. It is good that the
Government has decided to grant a higher interest rate for the first
$60,000 of the CPF balances. But I am asking if there is a possibility
for us to do more and give more whenever gains are good. We are
aware of the magic of compound interest. For example, if you have
$1,000 balance in your CPF account, at an interest rate of 2.5%,
over 30 years, it will give you $2,098. But we know that if this interest
can be better, the gains can be much more. Now, imagine if you are
able to achieve an appropriate interest rate that is viable and
also sustainable, this would mean that our retiring workers can look
forward to more resources at retirement and little more comfort,
after helping Singapore grow and prosper. It would also mean that
they would be less reliant on the Government for their needs in
later part of their life. It may be opportune time for us to relook
at the interest rates of CPF accounts of Singaporean workers for
their long term benefits. It is also timely, Sir, I think for us,
as a whole of Government, to see how we can maximise the contributions
of all in our workforce. Sir, allow me now to speak in Malay.</p>

for Government as a whole to look at how we can use the potential
and abilities of Singaporean workers so that we can maximise the
economic contributions of all our workers. This means that each
Ministry and Government institution will have to work together to
educate our students and inculcate a deep sense of social spirit
so that they have a continuous desire to excel, work hard to attain
a higher standard, possess the desire to learn on the job, and,
hopefully, when they have done well, they will continue give back
to society and the less fortunate.</p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>I think we must
elevate our Budget discussions, sweep the slate clean and think
from the overall macro perspective of how we can improve the lives
of Singaporeans. While making routine cuts to address the issues
of particular segments of our community has its place, we should
spend more energy looking at how the Government's Budget is allocated.
For example, if buying one less jet fighter means we can help hundreds
of poor families take a step out of the poverty trap, is it worth
the sacrifice to our national defence? Or if we build one less national
park, but can help hundreds of poor students learn some work-life
skills, is it worth the sacrifice? This is just my layman way of
thinking, but I think we in Parliament have a duty to examine our
Budget allocation, and assure ourselves that, overall, we are doing
justice to all Singaporeans.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, clearly, this year's Budget has managed to address the needs of
Singaporeans who were most affected by the Government's past economic
growth strategies, especially the older aged workers and the lower
and middle income groups. Where previously they were most affected
by stagnant or slow wage growth, they are now assured of some form
of a safety net to help take care of their needs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-36dab7f7-d691-4899-bf6e-fd47baa966f4">
                  <a name="motion__id-36dab7f7-d691-4899-bf6e-fd47baa966f4"><!--a--></a>In healthcare, for example,
I welcome the additional spending tabled in this year's Budget.
Singapore spends far less on healthcare as a percentage of GDP when
compared internationally. According to the World Health Organization's
data, Singapore's total spending on health was only 3.3 % of GDP,
lower than most developed economies such as US, UK, Japan and Korea,
who spend between 6.5% and 15.2% in the case of US, and also lower
than developing countries like China, India, Malaysia and Thailand, who
spend about 4.1% of their GDP on healthcare. In fact, Singapore's
spending on healthcare is only about half of the global median of
6.1%. So, the additional spending this year is a welcome move.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-452f62f8-9462-481a-9f66-f9802e1473d0">
                  <a name="motion__id-452f62f8-9462-481a-9f66-f9802e1473d0"><!--a--></a>The GST Vouchers that
the Government extended in this year's Budget were another good
initiative. Previously, the Government would extend one-off GST
credits but it still did not remove the anxieties among low-income
Singaporeans as it was always viewed as a temporary scheme. So,
the GST Vouchers, as a permanent assistance will provide more assurances
and give many a peace of mind that they will get help regularly. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-34908713-c8c1-43f5-b256-2c7c733605c8">

has realised that the widening income gaps will not go away anytime soon
and therefore the increase in spending for basic things like education,
healthcare, housing and transportation. However, while I am happy
that the Government sees that it needs to play a bigger role in
helping Singaporeans, we should not adopt a western style welfare
system for obvious reasons, as we can see from what is happening
in Europe today. </p>

a more permanent way of improving the wages of Singaporeans so that
they can still be better off despite shouldering some of the high
costs that we see here in Singapore. Inevitably, we may have to
move to some form of a Government-supported minimum wage system
in the initial years, as I mentioned before, to be taken over by
Productivity Improvement.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-34af169f-03d5-42ef-80bf-1a56b5ae3817">
                  <a name="motion__id-34af169f-03d5-42ef-80bf-1a56b5ae3817"><!--a--></a>I am not suggesting minimum
wage fully on the burden of employers, because they are already facing
high costs, but to be shared by the Government. What I am suggesting
is that we should start thinking about a wage that is reasonable,
for the Government to support in the short term. This will give employers
time to restructure in the long term and they can only do that by
productivity improvements. This will shift the future cost of the
minimum wage to companies as the Government cannot be seen to be
supporting this forever. If the company fails to restructure in
five years, for example, then it should realise that it may not
be able to compete in Singapore in the future and will slowly fade
out. This higher salary will also be one way to help our employers
manage a tightened labour market as the Government reduces the intake
of foreign workers as it will help attract the Singaporeans who
are not currently working due to low salaries to re-enter the labour
force. We should no longer accept low wages for our workers, like
the $600 that our Singaporean cleaners earn. It is just not fair
to them.</p>

in society that need help, similarly our SMEs are badly affected
by the double whammy of rapid costs increases and a tight labour
market due to the Government's restructuring efforts. SMEs should
therefore need more help and the Budget could have done more and
to be a more inclusive one for them. </p>

creating a productivity-led growth is not wrong but once again the Government
is adopting an "instant tree" mentality of expecting everyone to
make progress overnight. Business
models take time to change with productivity improvements taking
a longer time to set in and therefore the Government should be more
realistic at the pace of change of the economic restructuring as
in the short and medium term, we will be penalising our SMEs with
higher labour costs. </p>

was too liberal with our foreign worker policies, opened the gates
for too many foreign workers to come in and now when we realised
the economic and social problems have been created, we are taking
the other extreme and completely turning off the tap. This is not
the right thing as companies need time to adjust to a tightening
labour market. According to the team of economists from the Lee
Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, if Singapore were to achieve a
moderate economic growth for this decade, there needs to be about
a 1.5% employment growth even if we meet our productivity targets.
Singaporeans alone will not be able to meet this job growth rate
and therefore, at least in the medium term, companies here will
have to turn to foreigners to supplement this. Hence, turning off
the tap too drastically now will kill off the much needed labour
supply for our companies and to grow our economy in the near term. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-f9ea4ef5-03dc-4aff-b84b-28ed02cce2b9"><!--a--></a>One area which is a huge
concern for companies is the cost of renting or owning industrial
or commercial space. The cause of this can be traced to a policy
shift by JTC. Traditionally, JTC was very firm in its industrial
land policy being only available to companies here for designated
uses and at subsidised rates. In recent times however, JTC has offered
their industrial land to REITs and other private developers, and
these are now being redeveloped into strata-titled industrial units
which are rented to non-industrial tenants for higher yields, and
as we read from the papers recently, these are rented out for child
care centres and even religious organisations. I recently spoke
to some SME owners, who are tenants of a JTC development in Toa
Payoh, which is now operated by a leading private property firm.
Some of the tenants are now negotiating a lease renewal with the
landlord and face a substantially higher rent at about 40% increase
from what they were paying earlier. In a recent <em class="ph i">Business Times</em> report
on the same issue, it showed that some SME owners were quoted as
paying as much as 56% higher rent when they renewed their leases.</p>

industrial policy gone wrong. We should never allow industrial land
to be used by investors. Now what has happened is that genuine companies
who need the industrial land have to pay way beyond what it should
be and therefore cannot survive as they cannot compete with similar economies
such as Taiwan, Korea or Malaysia. </p>

policy and go back to being a direct industrial landlord. The current
JTC policy has created a major impact at the bottom lines of companies.
In fact, JTC should practise a differentiated land pricing policy
because pegging industrial land to market rates in Singapore is
not realistic and we should in fact be comparing what similar companies
in our competing economies are paying and pricing industrial land
based on that – so that our companies can compete effectively with these
economies. </p>

this year's Budget failed to address the shorter term problems faced
by companies especially in the area of high business costs. Although
the Budget included a one-off SME cash grant, capped at $5,000,
this is insufficient to help SMEs, especially those have been in
operation for some time. The Budget should have instead considered
offering a tax rebate pegged against a proportion of a company's
income so that this is more reflective of the size of the company.
But there is a lot more that the Government can do in addressing
the cost issue. </p>

implemented in the Budget to boost productivity may be sufficient
but, in reality, many of the smaller companies may have trouble
implementing them. They may not have the resources to focus on productivity
for now as they are fire-fighting with the high costs and so the
Budget should have
looked at helping them in the short term with this cost problem.
As such, many smaller companies may not even benefit from the productivity
schemes as they may not qualify for them at this stage.</p>

promotion, I have bigger worries. The issues of high business costs and
the availability and price of foreign labour may actually affect
the number of start-ups that we see in Singapore. Moreover, for
start-ups, the productivity related incentives do not mean much
as they will not have a significant top line revenues and they will
not benefit from the many productivity schemes that are pegged at
pegged incentives. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3cbb4f87-4155-41fc-9bc3-040aaa230085">
                  <a name="motion__id-3cbb4f87-4155-41fc-9bc3-040aaa230085"><!--a--></a>So, the question we must
ask is why did cost in Singapore rise so rapidly, beyond the rate
of growth of incomes of Singaporeans and beyond the rate of growth
of company profits? This can be attributed to the market driven
pricing approach taken by the Government and its agencies. The Government
has, many a time, been quick to increase the various charges, allowing
costs to escalate, immediately upon a recovery of an economic recession.
Each time this happens, we bring the cost base higher without an opportunity
for cost reductions. This has led costs to unrealistically increase
faster and more than profit and income growth of Singaporeans. If
fact, in the 2008 recession for example, the worst was in the property
market where we continued to see real estate prices increase despite
the recession and this was because of our liberal policies on capital
inflows. There are many foreigners who invested in Singapore. While
the Government should not interfere in the private market except
to curb speculation, it could have done a lot in the HDB market
had it not pursued market driven pricing. Also market driven pricing has
created huge cost burdens and will potentially edge out many of
our SMEs because of squeezed margins. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2ba1af1f-25cd-4e41-be46-7dd77e4a0862">
                  <a name="motion__id-2ba1af1f-25cd-4e41-be46-7dd77e4a0862"><!--a--></a>While the Government has
kept corporate taxes relatively low, and this is a good thing, there
are other high overheads that companies here face that add to their
high operational costs and erode their profits. There are many hidden
taxes – GST is one, high levies for foreign workers, a series of
duties and taxes on utilities, transportation costs such as COEs
and ERP charges and many others that add to escalating business
costs. Similarly, Singaporeans are left with little disposable income
as they pay for higher HDB prices and also their share of higher
taxes and levies. The Government should review all of these to see
which could be removed or adjusted because these built-in taxes
and high operational costs cream off the profits for our SMEs and
lower the disposable income of Singaporeans. As suggested by Prof
Tan Khee Giap and his team in an article in <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> dated
4 January this year, "this approach of re-pricing Government services
may lead to lower revenues or bigger subsidies for statutory boards,
ministries and Government-linked companies. But it will also translate
into higher income and employment for Singaporeans". What I am suggesting
is that the Government does a thorough cost reduction review exercise.
We must re-calibrate our policies to minimise upfront costs for
companies and Singaporeans and let them earn better incomes. If
done correctly, the Government may offset lower revenues by spending
less on special transfers for social safety nets. We need to do
more in the beginning and not at the end of the process by giving
transfers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0ae8bac7-53e6-4178-98d1-c2e725df0004">
                  <a name="motion__id-0ae8bac7-53e6-4178-98d1-c2e725df0004"><!--a--></a>In conclusion, everyone
has a role to play to build an inclusive society and the Government,
too, has a big role to play. Budget 2012 shows that the Government
continues to recognise that, as we continue to grow rapidly, more
Singaporeans are finding difficulty in keeping up. The Government
therefore has to spend more to strengthen the Safety Nets to help
reduce the stresses that Singaporeans face.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-1a738a04-7190-4a98-9411-0e67de371f36"><!--a--></a>I would like to conclude
that the strategy to restructure is not a bad one and that is one
that would benefit Singapore and Singaporeans in the long run. However,
the time horizon that the Government has provided for this restructuring
to occur needs to be reviewed. We need to have a slower start but
can accelerate later. For now, we should focus on short-term cost
issues and allow companies to survive first. When we talk about
restructuring the economy, we will also have to restructure the
way the Government contributes to cost. If we are not careful at
the pace of restructuring of the economy, we may end up hurting the future
potential of our economy as we reverse many of the good things that
we have been doing, as recommended by the Economic Review Committee
in 2002. My fear is that once again the Government may be inducing
a significant squeeze out of SMEs who are the biggest employers
in Singapore today. And if we are not careful, the day that MNCs
start to move out in large numbers, we will see a vacuum and a hollowing
out of our economy without a strong base of home grown companies to
take over. For the long-term view of Singapore, this is also not
good and will undermine our restructuring efforts. If we want to
restructure, to have a maximum effect, we need to work with our SMEs
together on this journey. Sir, on the whole, I support the Budget. </p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, we must ensure growth for all, not the favoured
few. We do not need blind economic growth, we need compassionate
growth. For a long time, the People's Action Party Government drove
growth without paying sufficient attention to the adverse effects
of increasing income inequality, especially affecting our poor,
elderly and disabled. In this Budget, the Finance Minister course
corrected to ensure that our poor, elderly and disabled are not
stuck in isolated pockets of poverty in our island of prosperity.
The Workers' Party believes we can do more to ensure greater cohesiveness
as a nation. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4609ea19-fa74-4b47-b0ed-cca1f928551c">
                  <a name="motion__id-4609ea19-fa74-4b47-b0ed-cca1f928551c"><!--a--></a>First, empowering our
poor. For the poor, the Budget takes a right step in emphasising
the importance of social mobility. Our income inequality has grown
rapidly. The rich have more resources to get ahead, which endangers
social mobility. If not addressed, there will be "two Singapores":
one for the mobile and rich, and the other for the immobile and
poor.</p>

allow the formation of a permanent underclass. I am sure all in
this House are affected when hardworking Singaporeans in rental
housing share how they are struggling to pay bills, their spouses
are in prison, and believing that their child attaining a polytechnic
diploma or university degree is a pipe dream. Sadly, I have met
many of these mothers.</p>

poor, all of us have to play a role. The Finance Minister is right
by imploring us to bring back respect for our waiters, cooks, chambermaids,
crane operators, construction tradesmen and factory operators. These
are hardworking Singaporeans forming the bedrock of our economy, allowing
many others to work in higher income jobs.</p>

owners is to lower cost, and hiring low-cost foreign workers is

citizens. Our elderly built the Singapore we have the privilege

them with a dignified life. The Special Employment Credit and raising
CPF rates are encouraging steps for older workers. However, affordable healthcare
is at the top of the minds for our seniors, especially those in
the lower to middle income groups.
This Budget acknowledges that affordable long-term care is the Government's
responsibility, but we must do more.</p>

Inderjit Singh, shared data of how our total expenditure on healthcare
as a percentage of GDP was far lower than international standards.
More importantly, we note that the Government or public expenditure
on healthcare is also far lower than international standards. Our Government
expenditure on healthcare is about 1.6% of GDP, nearly four times
lower than the 6.1% global average, based on World Health Organization's
data 2009. In addition, the Singapore Government's contribution
to the total healthcare expenditure has reportedly fallen from 51%
in 1995 to 41% in 2009. This is much lower than over 60% in many
other middle and high income countries.</p>

is rightly catching up by doubling yearly healthcare expenditure
from $4 billion to $8 billion over the next five years. However,
this may work out to an end point of 2-plus per cent of GDP after
five years, which is still much lower than the 6% global average. </p>

focus in addressing the unaffordability of intermediate and long-term care.
We know that Medisave, MediShield and Medifund provide only limited
coverage for long-term care which involves recurring expenses over
an extended period of time. Unfortunately, the Government had taken
the back seat and pushed voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs)
and commercial providers to take the lead in providing long-term
care. </p>

to raise charity dollars to subsidise bills of patients so that
their families could afford care. Affected family members have been
under financial strain due to substantial monthly nursing home bills.
Some resorted to placing their elderly family members in institutions
at Johor Bahru. This situation is untenable. We must do more. We
must ensure that the long-term care subsidies factor in medical
inflation. Towers Watson, a professional service firm, found that
Singapore experienced 8.4% medical cost inflation in 2011, higher
than national inflation and wage growth. The higher growth of medical
inflation is a worldwide trend. </p>

we can leverage on social risk-pooling to meet the high costs of
long term-care. For a start, how can Eldershield insurance be expanded
to help foot the cost of step-down care? </p>

payout provides minimal coverage for long-term care needs. Viable insurance
for long-term care will require higher premiums that may not be
affordable for the less well-off. The Government should study how
having better insurance coverage could help foot the cost of long-term
care, and help Singaporeans pay or co-pay the higher premiums which
will be needed. </p>

the need for family responsibility in our approach towards healthcare financing.
I agree that family must be the first line of support, but many
of us will not agree that all the children must deplete their Medisave
accounts to pay for their elderly parents' medical bills before
the Government intervenes. Given the longer life spans now, it has
been noted that having a 60-year old withdraw his Medisave savings
to pay the bill of an 85-year old parent is a reality in Singapore.
Is this sustainable? This may, in fact, entrench intergenerational
poverty, which would be more costly to society in the long run. </p>

disabled. Our nation's cohesiveness is also reflected in how we
care for the less fortunate, especially the disabled. We must help
to integrate the three out of 100 Singaporeans who are affected
by disabilities. Besides financial measures, can we do more to etch
into the national consciousness that the disabled are one of us,
with their hopes and dreams? Can we teach children from a young
age that the disabled are part and parcel of our society? For example,
how far do our school textbooks and children's TV programmes include
disabled characters? Dare we consider incorporating disability as one
of the admission factors for our institutions of higher learning,
to recognise the more difficult circumstance disabled Singaporeans
have to overcome? </p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
I welcome the measures announced by the Finance Minister to build
an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore. I would like to make
three recommendations for the Ministry's consideration: first, to intensify
efforts to help more Singaporeans get a job; second, to quicken
pace of our strategy to achieve a deep-skilled Singaporean workforce;
and third, to develop a self-reliant Singapore population. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-524b7e0d-33bd-484c-84aa-cfc1adda3ef7">
                  <a name="motion__id-524b7e0d-33bd-484c-84aa-cfc1adda3ef7"><!--a--></a>On intensifying efforts
to help more Singaporeans get a job, I would like to see more segments
of Singaporeans being able to find employment more quickly, specifically
older workers, back-to-work women and ex-offenders. Today, the unemployment
rate for Singaporeans is 3%. Over in the United States and Europe,
they are struggling with unemployment rates of 8% to 10%. So, have
we done well in comparison? On the one hand, the answer is yes.
On the other hand, while I am glad that the Finance Minister has
announced plans to enhance the existing Special Employment Credits
(SEC) scheme, I believe we can do more. In an interview with Channel
NewsAsia some weeks back, I called for more to be done through the
SEC scheme for older workers, back-to-work women, ex-offenders and
those with disabilities. What the Finance Minister has announced
was far beyond my expectations. It was an aggressive move and companies
should take advantage of the new enhanced scheme. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c6168f46-f4f4-4734-8a69-91a572fe2385">
                  <a name="motion__id-c6168f46-f4f4-4734-8a69-91a572fe2385"><!--a--></a>The scheme is now expanded
to include more older workers – those who are 50 years and above
– and the quantum raised to cover workers earning up to $4,000,
and the duration extended till 2016. It is also extended to employers
who hire Singaporeans who graduate from Special Education schools.
I hope the Ministry can consider extending similar help to back-to-work
women and ex-offenders.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e9dd87bc-4842-433b-b5c2-d0760586b889">
                  <a name="motion__id-e9dd87bc-4842-433b-b5c2-d0760586b889"><!--a--></a>Many women who stopped
work to take care of their families would like to go back to work.
The employment rate for women aged 25 years to 54 years old rose
from 71.7% in 2010 to 73% last year. Apart from providing childcare
support and flexi-work arrangements, we can certainly do more to
help back-to-work women return to the workforce. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d537040b-da4a-468b-ade2-944faa5d430c">
                  <a name="motion__id-d537040b-da4a-468b-ade2-944faa5d430c"><!--a--></a>The second group of workers
is ex-offenders. A recent report released by the Singapore Prison Service
in February indicated that the number of inmates who secured jobs
before release rose by 35%. This figure is encouraging. I find it
heartening to see more employers creating opportunities to help
ex-offenders re-integrate back into society. I would like to propose
that the same SEC scheme be extended to employers who hire back-to-work
women or ex-offenders. Companies can receive SEC for up to one year
if the new hires are back-to-work women or ex-offenders. Of course,
the scheme needs only to cover
those who are 50 years old and below. With this revision, we can
tap on our latent pool of back-to-work women and ex-offenders to
cover any shortfall in foreign workers that we currently need.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-1eca9402-5f72-44c5-b63e-951d0fb624fb"><!--a--></a>The second recommendation
is to quicken the pace of our strategy to achieve a deep-skilled Singaporean
workforce. During the last economic downturn, we had Skills Programme
for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR). Not only were companies able
to cut costs and save jobs; more importantly, many workers were
better trained. In this year's Budget, the Ministry has continued
to strongly support training. SMEs who upgrade their workers for
courses certified by WDA and academic CET programmes will receive
90% course fee subsidy. Absentee payroll cap will be increased from
$4.50 to $7.50 per hour. But, more significantly, self-employed
individuals will also get to enjoy similar training benefits. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-e4dbdc56-b0f9-43e2-866b-2a98934a2f77"><!--a--></a>I would like to draw Members'
attention to an article dated 3 February 2012 in <em class="ph i">MyP</em>
                  <em class="ph i">aper</em>.
Let me read. The title says: "Not enough Singaporeans to fill specialised
jobs". The article noted that foreigners are favoured over Singaporeans
for some jobs, because our local workforce lacks the skill sets
and expertise needed in areas such as environmental engineering,
energy solutions, shipping and logistics. What does this imply?
Does it mean that the WDA programmes are ineffective? Is it because
we are not spending enough to train Singaporeans? Or is it because
our Institutes of Higher Learning, such as ITE, polytechnics and
universities, are not able to train Singaporeans in these areas? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f1f73d62-f19a-452d-8008-8fb17b54ac6c">
                  <a name="motion__id-f1f73d62-f19a-452d-8008-8fb17b54ac6c"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer
is obviously no. For example, I am heartened to hear that MOE will
start the Singapore Industry Scholarship to develop future Singaporean
leaders with deep knowledge in various sectors such as engineering,
energy and tourism. While I am happy that many undergraduates will
stand to benefit from this scheme, there are many more adults looking
for a job or thinking of making a career switch, who will need similar
assistance to acquire such deep skills. In addition, from what I
observed on the ground, there are many companies which still regard
manpower and training needs as an "afterthought". What do I mean
by that? Let me share an analogy in Chinese to illustrate my point: <em class="ph i">yi
nian zhi ji mo ruo shu gu, shi nian zhi ji mo ruo shu mu, bai nian
zhi ji mo ruo shu. </em>In English, it means this: it might take
one year to grow rice; it might take 10 years to plant trees; but
it will take a lifetime to invest in education and training of our
people.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-1166331a-6570-4791-ab3f-24227964eed0"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, the 2012
Budget is a plan for the future, to help Singapore be stronger and
more competitive. Suppose a company decides to invest here − this
is a planned decision for the future; land has to be identified;
infrastructure built; material and machinery costs calculated; and
manpower needs to be considered. Such planning is not done in the
midst of construction. Everything is thought through even before
a decision is made to invest here. Manpower and training needs should
not be an "afterthought". If we have known ahead that a company
is investing in Singapore and that time is needed to conduct specialised
skills training, companies should work with economic agencies, MOM,
WDA, MOE, ITEs/Polytechnics, unions, etc, at a very early stage.
MOE's announcement to groom Singaporeans from young is one step
in the right direction. But we need to go beyond the academic route.
We also need to be aggressive in our Continuing Education and Training
(CET) route. We need to understand what the manpower needs and skill
sets required, develop the course curriculum and train Singaporeans,
and give our locals who are looking for new opportunities to be
trained to enter this new trade. This way, we can gear up our local
workforce to cater to the company's needs ahead of time. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-764946b9-a218-49cd-8d3c-bc21b2768354">
                  <a name="motion__id-764946b9-a218-49cd-8d3c-bc21b2768354"><!--a--></a>Let me share an example
of how planning ahead pays off for a company. Rolls-Royce's new
facility at Aerospace Park was officially opened by the Prime Minister
just a couple of months back. I visited the place more than a year
ago. Even before their building was completed, the company had talks
with e2i, NTUC, the union and WDA to identify skill sets and the
type of workers needed for their new facility. Together, we placed
over 80 Singaporeans on an apprenticeship scheme to work for Rolls-Royce.
Many are ITE graduates. Today, they have access to join a top-notch
company, enjoy good pay, have good career prospects and have acquired
specialised skills. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-45862ba9-ee4a-4b3f-a12e-9a6042fd97fb"><!--a--></a>Through this, we are building a Singaporean
core group who will have access to work in industries which offer
good paying jobs. This behaviour is what all companies should adopt.
More importantly, Government agencies overseeing different sectors
should develop a comprehensive manpower strategy that will involve
all stakeholders, one that allows us to build our own future-ready
workforce comprising a core group of Singaporeans who are highly
skilled.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db91116a-ba91-4994-af15-0d6c04fe886b">
                  <a name="motion__id-db91116a-ba91-4994-af15-0d6c04fe886b"><!--a--></a>My third recommendation
is about developing a self-reliant Singapore population. I applaud
the Government for the measures announced to enhance our existing
social safety net. We have an even stronger support for the poor
and low-income families now. There is also a special focus to prevent
a permanent underclass from forming through the education route
to enhance the social mobility of children who come from low-income
families. Can we do more to encourage more of these families to break
out and stay out of the social safety net? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7663dff6-8480-4675-8445-d3c03567ecde">
                  <a name="motion__id-7663dff6-8480-4675-8445-d3c03567ecde"><!--a--></a>I received feedback on
the ground from social workers and others that the strength of our
current social assistance and our compassion may have some unintended
consequences. Let me try to illustrate. Some low-income families
are concerned that if they earn higher income and as a result exceed
the income criteria for social assistance, they stand therefore
to lose out on a lot of subsidies. As such, many may choose not
to earn higher income, preferring to stay under the radar. This
may result in a disincentive to exit from the social support scheme.
Many may even lose the drive to do better and earn more as they
feel that their income increase may not be able to make up for what
they lose out in subsidies. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9ebb4c11-20a3-430c-8be5-ac65f20c9944">
                  <a name="motion__id-9ebb4c11-20a3-430c-8be5-ac65f20c9944"><!--a--></a>So, on the one hand, while
I welcome the new initiatives announced by the Government to top
up our funds for social safety nets, our enhanced efforts to increase
the mobility of children from low-income families, and our desire
to hire more social workers to help them, I would like the Government to
consider a complementary approach. May I propose that we reward
those who have upgraded their skills, worked hard, improved their
income and successfully moved out from the social safety net? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e9761f51-00c0-4c80-bc67-d6f44ddf73d9">
                  <a name="motion__id-e9761f51-00c0-4c80-bc67-d6f44ddf73d9"><!--a--></a>Perhaps we can consider
two options to incentivise them to do better. One is to either hand
out the same subsidies they were receiving previously for another
year while considering giving them a lump-sum incentive. This is
for those who were previously receiving social assistance but have
decided to work hard and earn a higher income, therefore exceeding
the income criteria for social assistance. This will send a very
clear message to them that the Government wants to develop a self-reliant
population whereby individuals will be encouraged to continue to
work hard to improve their lives and the lives of their families. </p>

important that we intensify our efforts to help more Singaporeans
get a job so that more segments of those who want a job can do so
quickly. It is also important that we quicken the pace of our strategy
to achieve a deep-skilled Singaporean workforce so that we have
a Singaporean core team to spearhead competitiveness in different
sectors. Lastly, it is important that we encourage Singaporeans
to stay motivated and continuously strive for improvement so that

I support the Budget. </p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to participate in
this debate. As a trade unionist, I am concerned about the issues
pertaining to our workers, in particular, the low income and the
elderly. These are the groups that I feel are most affected by the economic
changes as well as the widening of the income gap. Sir, if we do
not address these issues well, the gap between the haves and the
have-nots will continue to widen, causing tremendous social frictions which would ultimately
impact our overall economic performance and growth. I am glad that
this year's Budget has addressed some of these issues to build an
inclusive society and a stronger Singapore.</p>

and the Department of Statistics, in its report in October last
year, stated that the nominal monthly income of those at the 20th
percentile rose from $1,200 in 2001 to $1,400 in 2010. Adjusted
for inflation, this worked out to a real growth rate of about 0.3%
per annum. With the high cost of living in Singapore, one wonders:
how can our low-wage workers survive? I was told by many that, as
a result, they have to turn to the casinos. I have noted some progress
since but, in my view, we have a lot to do to grow productivity
and to sustain real wage increase of 30% over a 10-year period to
improve the standard of living for Singaporeans. This is a very
challenging task.</p>

recent improvement by the 14 Town Councils, who stepped up to help
our cleaners to bring their wages up from $750 to $1,000. This is
commendable. However, there are many other cleaners out there who
are not employed by the town councils. They are earning about $600
a month but are similarly looking for a breakthrough in their wages.
The same also applies to our security officers, who have to work
long hours to earn a basic median monthly wage of $600. And after
clocking many hours of overtime, they are then able to earn a gross
monthly wage of $1,300. This is also the case for our bus drivers. </p>

drivers' plight to illustrate this point. The life of the bus drivers
can start as early as 4.00 in the morning. They will have to arrive
at the bus depot by 5.00 am. They then check the bus thoroughly to
ensure it is in tip-top condition and start the bus service at 5.30
am. They have their 20 to 35 minutes' break for meals at around
9.30 am. But if the bus arrives late – on the ground they call it
"<em class="ph i">lambat</em>" – they may only have 10 minutes for their meal and
toilet break. And they will continue to drive with two or three
short breaks of seven to eight minutes in the interchange. They
usually finish their work at around 3.00 pm with a couple of hours
of overtime. Working overtime daily is a norm for bus drivers to
supplement their monthly basic wage ranging from $1,375 to $1,700.
This helps them to make ends meet and it is also compounded by the
shortage of bus drivers. Encountering difficult commuters is also
common. A slip of the tongue, momentary loss of cool, means getting
a complaint letter and, at the end of the day, bonus or increment
can get cut. Exceed the slow speed at the junction of the interchange
and, again, you can get fined.</p>

find this a tough job. Unless we address the well-being of bus drivers,

members in the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) look to
the Government to help their companies to explore ways to increase
productivity and to help to keep cost low so as to channel the savings
to workers in the form of better wages and benefits. The bus drivers on
the ground have fed back previously to the Government to look into
other ways of helping the PTOs to reduce their costs of operation
for public transport which, I understand, include ERP cost of some
$30 million per year and high rental cost of depots, and they hope
that these savings can be shared with the drivers and contribute
to improving their wages.</p>

need to be your partner. I would like to call upon the various Government agencies to live up

citizens, even with the enactment of the re-employment law in January
this year. As it is, many in their 50s are increasingly finding
it difficult to be employed. I am heartened that the Minister for
Finance has put in place a Special Employment Credit which will
soon take place. The Government would need to continue to proactively
encourage and engage employers to help overcome this bias and, if
necessary, to look into other incentives to encourage their employment.
Having a job would help the dignity of the elderly and also to lighten
the cost of their welfare and healthcare systems. </p>

Government has responded positively to the call by NTUC and the
then Vice President of NTUC, Mr Cyrille Tan, to review the CPF contribution
rate for older workers. Sir, on the CPF issues, I am concerned about
workers not having sufficient savings in their CPF accounts to retire with
financial independence. I would like to make reference to the 1984
Report of the Committee on the Problems of the Aged by the late
Minister for Health, Mr Howe Yoon Chong. The Report mentioned the Government's
ultimate goal of raising the rate of CPF contribution to a maximum
of 50% of an employee's salary and the CPF withdrawal age to be
further raised to 65 years in later years. I believe the proposal
was mooted with the objective of enabling workers to accumulate
sufficient funds in their CPF accounts for retirement. I also noted
that back then, the price of an HDB flat was much lower as of today.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-437bf8e4-8ec2-4bd0-a4c7-73386085d4b5"><!--a--></a>During the Singapore Perspectives
2012 Forum organised by the Institute of Policy Studies on 16 January,
a professor shared on retirement adequacy measured by income replacement
ratio, which is the proportion of the working income that one has
at retirement. He shared that the current CPF contribution of 36%
is not sufficient for retirement, and he suggested maybe 42% will
be more sustainable, and this is on assumption if there is no withdrawal
of CPF for housing. Sir, this again seems to suggest the inadequacy
of the CPF savings to support the retirement needs of our workers.
CPF contribution had been cut three times from 25% to 10% in 1986,
20% to 10% in 1999 and 16% to 13% in 2003. However, the restoration
from 10% to 20% and 13% to 16% both took eight years to restore.
This excludes the further CPF cuts for workers age 50 years and
above. </p>

of how much Singaporean workers have sacrificed in their CPF savings,
I take the case of a 30-year-old worker who earned S$1,000 per month
in 1985 and the employer contribution rate then was 25%. If this
25% contribution had not been cut, the worker would have accumulated
an additional of more than S$30,000 in his account by 2011, that
is, 26 years later. This is excluding interests and wage increments.
If he or she earned S$3,000 per month in 1985, the sacrifice would
be more than S$90,000.</p>

for various reasons. Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, it is to acknowledge
the sacrifice of our enlightened workers way back in 1986 and many
of them are the elderly of today. Because of their sacrifice, because
of their understanding, because they were discerning, they did not
take to the street, they did not go on strike because they were
enlightened. We progress as a nation to where we are today. Sir,
the $30,000 would have meant a lot to our low-wage workers. Secondly,
I would like the Government to review and look into a long-term
plan to determine a reasonable CPF rate for our people, including
the young ones, so that when their turns come for them to retire,
they would have a nest egg to retire gracefully with dignity. Lastly,
I would like to appeal to our Government, please no more CPF cuts.
I therefore urge the Government not to implement a one-size-fits-all
policy should there be a need to cut CPF. </p>

Budget does not come across as being pro-business. Instead, the Government
is stepping up the necessary reform in the labour market. But what

not only look after your own parents, but also take a further step
to look after other people's parents; you not only take care of
your own children, but also take care of other people's children.
The country is like a big family, everyone should help each other,
care for each other and respect each other. Nobody should be neglected
just because he is vulnerable. We should look after our elderly
so that they live well and live long. If we can do that, the whole
society will be more loving and more inclusive. This will strengthen
people's sense of belonging to our nation and society.</p>

probably be remembered as one where it is less business friendly;
one where we bite the bullet, take the pain and press on with the
restructuring of our economy. Even with a number of enhancements
to the assistance schemes available for the SMEs and the many other
helping hands to improve productivity, this year's Budget is still
seen as harsh to many of the businesses. The SMEs will be directly
impacted by the further tightening of foreign labour. Some enterprises
will experience severe margins compression as a result and some
may no longer be viable. Others may choose to relocate elsewhere
or exit the business altogether.</p>

that came out when I spoke to some of the business people is that
many actually do buy in and are in unison with the Government on
the need to reduce our over dependence on foreign workers and to
uplift productivity. But that is about all in terms of a meeting
of minds. Beyond that, the Government and businesses are miles apart
as to how fast and how much we could tighten up foreign labour.
It is between a cold turkey treatment, or gradualist approach, or
somewhere in between.</p>

restructuring is to keep the foreign workforce at a socially acceptable
level. The ESC referred to this level as about one-third of the
total workforce. So, we are still talking about a one-third leverage
in manpower. With tighter foreign labour inflows, the Government hopes
that companies would either look to improve productivity or hire
more Singaporeans or both. The social intent here is that as companies
pay up to attract Singaporeans to the job, it would help grow our median
wages. We all want a socially sustainable and inclusive way to grow
our economy where at the end of the day, more citizens will benefit
from the growth.</p>

ride to get there and there are significant risks that we have to
contend with. So, what are the risks and what could go wrong? First,
there is the obvious risk of an unsustainable rise in business costs.
We are hearing this loud and clear from the businesses. Raising
the foreign worker levy will directly increase labour costs. Tightening
the DRC will also compel companies to pay up to hire local workers
and hence would also add to the manpower costs. In an almost full
employment situation that we are now in, local hiring may well be
a zero sum game. The most probable occurrence would be the unhealthy
practice of staff poaching from each other which would just push
wages up sharply to an unsustainable level. The cumulative increase
in levy announced so far is expected to increase wage cost by 20%
to 25%, according to some studies. Escalating business costs would
impact companies' bottom line if productivity improvements are not
able to make up for the cost increases. The concern here is whether
this would lead to a repeat of a 1985-style recession.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-37784701-0461-4bf9-9054-98bf55cd5dea">
                  <a name="motion__id-37784701-0461-4bf9-9054-98bf55cd5dea"><!--a--></a>Back in 1980s, as part
of "wage correction", the NWC recommended three consecutive rounds
of aggressive wage hikes. This resulted in a severe loss of international
competitiveness. At that time, the wage reform actually benefited
Singaporeans more directly because it was a straight wage increase
for the workers. In our current situation, the restructuring is
done by way of tightening foreign labour dependency ratio and higher
levy. One of the causes cited in the 1986 Economic Committee Report
to review the economy then stated that the loss of competitiveness
due to high costs of doing business in Singapore as one of the internal
factors for the recession. So we have to be mindful during this adjustment
phase not to allow non-wage operating costs to rise beyond control
as costs are usually more sticky on the downside.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bb12ef75-91ff-4c8e-bd9a-a32150499d47">
                  <a name="motion__id-bb12ef75-91ff-4c8e-bd9a-a32150499d47"><!--a--></a>Secondly, the inflation
risks, as well expressed by many economists. It is unavoidable that
some of the businesses will pass on the increased costs to consumers,
especially those in the domestic services sector. Given the significant
cost impact from increased wages and levy, prices will head north.
Whether it is the cleaning contractor, delivery, building maintenance,
restaurant, and so on, these will likely cost more. In the midst
of all these adjustments, we may be facing a sharp oil shock arising
from the Middle East geo-political tension. So, we cannot take our
eyes off inflation.</p>

risk of hollowing out within our economy. The expected rising costs
and higher inflation coupled with tight labour supply will no doubt
reduce our attractiveness as a business and investment destination.
We can expect more relocations and reduction in direct investments.
Even without these foreign labour tightening measures, there is
always the fear of industry hollowing out due to our small domestic
market and the lack of a dynamic hinterland. Of course, economies
remain viable on the premise of comparative advantages. Companies
that are more labour-intensive will naturally relocate to locations
with abundance of cheap labour.</p>

strategy that we are pursuing, where we do not want all the labour-intensive
part of the business to be done here, while keeping the nerve-centre
activities in Singapore. This is actually part of our game plan
to internationalise our economy and what the role of IE Singapore is
playing. The setting up of a cross-border project finance institution
and the development of Iskandar region at Johor would also complement
our strategy. However, if the cost pressures and tight labour supply
hit every aspect of the economy with no corresponding improvements
in productivity or local labour
participation, we could see an exodus or downsizing of companies,
and this may include losing some of our strategic capabilities which
we hope to retain and grow. </p>

long-term unemployment. Restructuring the economy often results
in major permanent changes in the employment market. Some jobs may
become obsolete while new skills sets would be in demand. Countries
with across-the-board high wages tend to experience higher structural unemployment.
We only need to look at some of the developed economies, whether
it is in Australia, UK or Europe. The new economic landscape may
mean requiring even more social spending as there will be greater
need for a stronger social safety net to deal with higher unemployment.</p>

these risks not because I am against restructuring. We all know
that not moving forward or to stay put is not an option. As a small
island state and a very open economy, our economic development is
akin to riding a bicycle. If we stay still, we will topple. And
the only way to remain standing is to keep pedalling on and to keep
riding ahead. Leveraging on foreign workers to grow has its limits;
not just physical and social constraints but there are also sound
economic arguments why we should reduce our dependence on foreign
workers. We want to continually elevate ourselves to be amongst
the most productive and the most technological advanced country
in the world. Having an abundance of foreign workers would not get
us there. In any case, foreign labour will not always stay cheap.
We must be prepared for the eventuality where foreign workers will
cost more due to economic progress in those countries where the
workers come from. And, increasingly, we are also seeing more jurisdictions
adopting minimum wages. China, in particular, is currently facing
a significant upward wage correction as well and we are only just
seeing the beginning.</p>

mitigate these risks that I have just highlighted?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ad6f9447-b221-4fbc-898e-b2ea62cadc44">
                  <a name="motion__id-ad6f9447-b221-4fbc-898e-b2ea62cadc44"><!--a--></a>Well, if labour costs
have to move up, we just have to hold all other costs down, at least
for now. One of the most important costs we need to restrain is,
of course, the cost of land which Mr Inderjit Singh has also mentioned.
According to URA data for the year 2011, as a whole, prices of multiple-user
factory space increased sharply by 27.1% while rentals increased
by 16.2%. And this is after steep increases of 23.7% in prices and
11.7% in rentals in 2010.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8c9c2a73-230f-471f-9d94-df8ffdcc6d02">
                  <a name="motion__id-8c9c2a73-230f-471f-9d94-df8ffdcc6d02"><!--a--></a>If land costs continue
to rise at such a rate, our international competitiveness would
be eroded even without this round of labour cost increase. Even
at the heartlands industrial workshops, where many of the small
businesses operate, they are experiencing higher lease renewal costs
and sharp rental increases. Just like hawker centres, these industrial
workshops offer to businesses no-frills, practical and budgeted workspace
to operate. And these businesses, in turn, offer low-cost services
and small job repairs to residents living in the neighbourhoods.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8d99e31d-e64a-41c2-a8dc-93aabdf4bc2f">
                  <a name="motion__id-8d99e31d-e64a-41c2-a8dc-93aabdf4bc2f"><!--a--></a>So, here, JTC and the
other agencies must continue to play the role of keeping our industrial
land affordable to sustain our competitiveness. JTC should not be
too eager to mark its industrial land bank to market as the cost
ramifications are very serious to the industries and the businesses.
The Government's hand in managing this in providing public goods
is still very much still needed as we want an environment of stable
land cost for the industries. We cannot exert an upward cost correction
for both labour and land at the same time. This would be value destruction
and we would soon lose many of our key economic capabilities to
the competing economies in the region.</p>

concern that we need to manage is the strength of our Singapore
dollar. The strong Singapore dollar has always been one of our policy
tools to manage imported inflation. While the local importer has
been the major beneficiary of this policy, it is the exporter that
is bearing the brunt of the strong currency. With higher wages to
come, our local labour cost will look even more expensive in foreign currency terms
when the Singapore dollar strengthens. A continually strengthening
Singapore dollar will depress the top line revenue of our exporters.
Singapore is a price taker and exporters cannot set a higher price
at the global marketplace.</p>

to offset both the escalating wages and stronger Singapore dollar
at the same time would be asking too much from the exporters. The
export sector is a crucial engine of growth. It brings about the
much needed foreign exchange. We should not lose these capabilities.
Sir, I am not saying that we depreciate our Singapore dollar to
improve our export competitiveness. What will be helpful to exporters
in this environment of rising costs is to maintain a stable exchange
rate policy so that companies do not have to pay a further premium
for the exchange rate volatilities.</p>

final analysis, the Ministry of Manpower must still retain the flexibility
in some sectors where it is clearly very difficult or impossible
to find Singapore workers to replace. This could either be due to
the lack of such skills sets or where wage increase would not lead
to higher labour participation. A case in point is the construction
industry and the cleaning industry, where it will be impossible
to fill up these job openings with Singaporeans.</p>

I want to salute Deputy Prime Minister Tharman for setting a very aggressive
timeframe − a 10-year timeline and target. To grow our real median
wages by 30% in 10 years is a very ambitious target and it is not
an easy task to do. So, I respect him for taking on this very challenging
cause, and I hope Singaporeans will appreciate what he is trying
to do. We all know the risks. In the next 10 years, we can expect
many known and unknown shocks that may come our way. We should not
pursue this stretch target at all costs. While we want to ride our
bicycle forward, we should still watch out for the potholes and
do some refinements along the way. And one indicator that we should
watch very closely is the unemployment rate.</p>

marks a distinct shift in our social policy. We meant what we said
about being inclusive. It would, of course, come with added financial
responsibility. The cost of social spending can only increase in
the years to come with our ageing population. We need to grow our
economy to generate the financial resources to fund even more social
programmes in the future. And we still need to continue growing
our reserves so that the NIR contribution can grow beyond the $7.91
billion the Government received last year to fund the Budget.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8b9e79ad-87fd-4259-886b-91c6f641d7df">
                  <a name="motion__id-8b9e79ad-87fd-4259-886b-91c6f641d7df"><!--a--></a>Our reserves remain our
most important strategic resource and our long-term financial security.
The recent second bailout for Greece cost the EU and IMF 130 billion
euro or S$218 billion. This is in addition to the earlier bailouts
of Euro 110 billion in 2010. And this may not be the last time that
Greece will stretch their hand out for money and there is still
this risk of default. So it gives us a sense of the magnitude that
if we mismanage our finances and run out of savings, that will be
our fate. And, here, we cannot look to EU for a bailout. We can
only count on our own savings to bail ourselves out, which is why
I want to caution that when we measure the outcomes or the adequacy
of our healthcare, we should not look at the amount of money we
spend. In fact, that is just too simplistic. In US, for example,
social security, Medicare, MediAid − just three items − account
for about half of the US government's non-interest spending. So,
to measure our healthcare adequacy and outcomes just by its spending
will be too simplistic. </p>

Minister's two-hour long Budget Statement, one of the lines in his
speech stands out and warms my heart. He said, "Let's help our seniors
live long and live well." These words reminded us that, at the end
of the day, governing is all about people's lives and living well.
Clearly, Budget
2012 will strengthen our social compact and will make Singapore
even stronger. Sir, I support the Budget.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, the mission of this Budget is to, I quote, "build an
inclusive society and a stronger Singapore". The Budget proposes
to build an inclusive society by social policies designed to help
the elderly, Singaporeans with disabilities and lower-income families. The
Budget proposes to build a stronger Singapore by economic policies
designed to sustain growth through higher productivity and reduce
our dependence on foreign workers. The Budget proposes to build
a stronger Singapore by economic policies designed to sustain growth
through higher productivity and reduce our dependence on foreign
workers. We are glad that the Government has heeded the call of many
Singaporeans for more inclusive growth. That is our long held belief.
And as the hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim said, we believe we can do more.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-681a0a67-e71b-46ec-815e-9efd0c1fbcef">
                  <a name="motion__id-681a0a67-e71b-46ec-815e-9efd0c1fbcef"><!--a--></a>The elderly, the disabled
and the poor in need of social security should not be seen primarily
as social problems or "challenges", as the Budget puts it. These
challenges are, in fact, opportunities to invest in our human capital
for great social returns. We need to change our mindset. Investing
in our elderly, the disabled, the poor and other needy Singaporeans
will reward society with the economic, social and cultural contributions
they will be able to make with assistance. It will also enable us
to be more inclusive, which is the basis for community and social
cohesion.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-98d0e6cd-976e-4815-ba4f-f8590c1929f7">

outlays only as spending to be minimised over the short term, but
also as investments to be optimised for our long-term benefit. We
should seek out such investment opportunities to realise social
returns in different areas of social policy, not just social security,
but public housing, healthcare, education, and infrastructure and
the environment. We should actively, systematically and strategically
seek them out, much as we do in the case of opportunities for economic returns,
for example, with agencies such as EDB, A*STAR and SPRING. We should
seek to unlock not only economic value with our investments but
also social and cultural value that would make for an inclusive
society and a stronger Singapore.</p>

are a repository of social and cultural capital to be treasured
and tapped on to enrich each passing generation. With some investments
that keep them close to their homes, we can leverage the elders'
longstanding ties in mature neighbourhoods to teach our children
traditional wisdoms and values, and stories and lessons about our
communities. Similarly, Singaporeans with disabilities and other
needy Singaporeans, when the locked-in value of their human capital
is released with more investment, they reward society with their
enabled contributions as well as such intangibles as compassion
and empathy. This argues for investing in social safety nets that
keep up with the costs of living. We want to see all Singaporeans
run a good race in a globalised and competitive world. When some
of us trip and fall behind, we should help them get back up and
stay in the game for a stronger Singapore. </p>

and upgrade to an economy that is more productive in order to raise
real wages, we need to depend less on foreign workers. The Budget
recommends that we reduce the Dependency Ratio Ceilings for businesses
in manufacturing and services and reduce man-year entitlement quota
for those in construction. How effective will the proposed measures
be in reducing our dependence on foreign workers? The population
of foreign workers grew rapidly at 7.5% each year over the last
two years. Growth for our resident workforce is under half of that.
The proportion of foreign workers had already breached the Government's
one-third target set in 2010, and was over 35% last year. Given
the size of the
task, a multi-year plan is needed to manage effectively our foreign
worker dependency and allow our businesses time to adjust. Let us
do more for them.</p>

Ministry's current segmentation of industries for dependency ratio ceilings
to ensure more targeted foreign manpower policies. As other Members
have pointed out today, the Ministry of Manpower's current framework
of segmenting the economy into broad sectors – manufacturing, services
and construction with exceptions for marine and process – is a blunt
tool. For example, in the services sector, the dependency ratio
ceiling is the same for food and beverage (F&amp;B), social services
and also for finance and other industries. Could we look into the
possibility of having different industry clusters for setting dependency
ratio ceilings? One cluster could comprise industries that have
high productivity and generate good jobs for Singaporeans, for example,
finance, aerospace, biomedical and professional services. For these
industries, we may have more stringent foreign manpower policies
so that foreign workers complement and not substitute Singaporeans.
We could even include lower end employment passes in the calculation
of the dependency ratios as these are jobs that young Singaporean
graduates would find attractive.</p>

comprise industries that contribute to meeting Singapore's social
needs and would have a significant impact if higher labour costs
were passed on to the consumers. They could include social services,
public healthcare and construction for public infrastructure. For
these industries, we may need less stringent foreign manpower policies
to keep costs low. Other clusters could be based on the industries
different prospects for productivity gains. </p>

previously argued that quotas for different sectors are not workable
and would constrain businesses' flexibility to get the necessary
manpower to expand. But remember – while we do not have different
quotas targeted at different service sectors, for example, that
does not mean we do not have quotas. We still have a dependency
ratio ceiling that applies to all industries in the services sector.
We believe we can do more to help our businesses in the different
sectors adapt to permanent but different realities of a tight labour
market in their respective industries. By working with them on the different
targets and roadmaps of reducing the dependency ratio ceilings,
we are not asking, in the Deputy Prime Minister's words, for "a
group of bureaucrats to decide which industry is more deserving",
but we are asking for the Government to work more closely with the
different stakeholders in the different industries, get their input,
rally their support and render them assistance. The same way the
Government is working, for example, with stakeholders to set productivity
targets and roadmaps for 16 different industry sectors.</p>

of this Parliament, I cited the United Nations' inaugural Human Development
Report in 1990, which declared "people are the real wealth of a
nation. As it happened, 1990 saw the tail end of our first national
productivity campaign. The mascot of the campaign was a bee by the
name of "Teamy", and his song is deeply, deeply imprinted in our
cultural memory: "Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest". However,
in more recent years, reliance on cheap foreign labour has coincided
with the decline in our productivity growth. We are in the midst
of the third productivity campaign following Teamy and Productivity
Action 21. Today, we have "Way to Go, Singapore!" with a sectoral
approach to productivity growth in 16 sectors with their own targets
and roadmaps. Our national productivity campaigns must go deeper
to achieve sustainable productivity growth. Ultimately, we need
to invest in the human capital of our workers for growth. We should
start now and engage in long-term sustainable investment in our
people. We need to invest more in education in schools, in training
our workers for the job so that they can do the job better and do
a better job at it, and in empowering our workers on the job, so
that they can make the job better.</p>

in other aspects of a Singaporean's life and that of her family,
social security, public housing, healthcare, education and infrastructure
and the environment, so that she becomes a more productive worker.
In conclusion, Sir, let us go back to fundamentals. We need to put Singaporean workers
back in the game before they can raise their game. To invest in
Singaporeans is to invest in the future of Singapore. It has been
said so many times and for so long that the only resource Singapore
has is ourselves, that our most important capital is our human capital.
Inclusive growth must be built on the growth of our human capital.</p>

Sir, I thank Mr Chen for his speech. As a matter of principle, there is
so much I agree with what he has said. I think we need to invest
in the vulnerable groups, the poor, the disabled. Listening to both
his speech and Ms Sylvia Lim's – there have been many proposals
for additional spending. The one question I have is: what does Workers'
Party intend to do on the revenue side? Is it planning to raise
taxes or eat into reserves to pay for all these additional programmes?
Because I think the objectives are noble. I am just wondering how
he balances it out.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated
Member)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for
this opportunity to speak on the Budget Debate. This coming financial
year's Budget addresses some of Singaporeans' key concerns as Singapore
undergoes transformational changes by making a significant calibrated
shift in the Budget's focus. The Budget represents a re-calibration,
a necessary right-sizing of the social compact.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0773b24b-833e-456b-a1a6-419aaa324c7f">
                  <a name="motion__id-0773b24b-833e-456b-a1a6-419aaa324c7f"><!--a--></a>This Budget signals an
assertive return to the fundamental of shared and inclusive economic
growth as the cornerstone for a revitalised social compact. It underlines
the move away from "equal sharing" to one of "equitable distribution"
as the fundamental basis of sharing our nation's wealth. This shift
is at least a decade in the making. To be sure, equity has been
a growing "accent" in previous Budgets since 2002.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bab197aa-940e-4ac0-88e6-67b649af488b">
                  <a name="motion__id-bab197aa-940e-4ac0-88e6-67b649af488b"><!--a--></a>But, going forward, equity
must be the unequivocal "language" of future Budgets. Equitable distribution
and sharing must form the foundational stone of our Budget. Those
more in need will receive more while those who pay the most taxes
do not get as much. It is timely that the focus of the Budget is
squarely on older Singaporeans, Singaporeans with disabilities,
and lower income Singaporeans. This commitment towards preventing
a permanent underclass from forming is necessary. The reality is
that economic globalisation and our economic policies have not resulted
in every Singaporean being able to benefit from them. In fact, there
is a considerable segment of Singaporeans who have found the economic
transformation and restructuring disconcerting as they have not
been able to take
advantage of it. This group feels displaced by the rapid economic
changes and feels that the nation's prosperity seems to have passed
them by.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1332</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a1c2efc8-b4af-47ec-8ca9-9ffb36c926e2">
                  <a name="motion__id-a1c2efc8-b4af-47ec-8ca9-9ffb36c926e2"><!--a--></a>Sir, the abiding imperative
to renew Singaporeans' confidence in the commitment to shared economic
growth is crucial if the ongoing plans to restructure the economy
are to have the buy-in from Singaporeans. The social and economic
dimensions of the Budget complement each other. Our society will
be all the poorer if we do not pay equal attention to both. Economic
growth is necessary to sustain the evolving social compact as our
nation grapples with competing, and perhaps even conflicting, needs and
interests. Sir, let me now list what I thought are some of the noteworthy
features of Budget 2012. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-77645e99-eed5-4411-a5b0-8a651c221d1e">
                  <a name="motion__id-77645e99-eed5-4411-a5b0-8a651c221d1e"><!--a--></a>First, there is a greater
willingness to look beyond the 12-month fiscal year through multi-year spending
commitments. This funding model benefits, for example, the Special
Employment Credit, which is aimed at encouraging employers to plan
ahead and hire older workers. I hope that future Budgets will have
more spending commitments beyond 12-month fiscal year, especially
in areas where multi-year funding is vital to ensure continuity
and sustainability of those programmes. We should not let the financial
year's duration limit our commitment to plan beyond the next 12
months. For many of the issues we are grappling with today, such
as income inequality, dysfunctional families, expanding the public
transport network, we should not be strait-jacketed by a 12-month
timeframe.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e0280aeb-7f7c-4938-925f-acf13a33783f">
                  <a name="motion__id-e0280aeb-7f7c-4938-925f-acf13a33783f"><!--a--></a>Second, I applaud the
relatively comprehensive package of helping Singaporeans with special
needs through strengthening early intervention and education, to
supporting their being in gainful employment, and to the provision
of better adult care. This support given to Singaporeans with disabilities
is, I believe, unprecedented. They have often been at the periphery
of the Budget and our society but there is now a concerted move
to help them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section hcSection hcSpeech" id="id-81eb0e0c-ca6e-4ca9-9f65-49133c02a54f">
               <a name="motion__id-81eb0e0c-ca6e-4ca9-9f65-49133c02a54f"><!--a--></a>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6aff64b9-d153-4248-9ca1-7409df9a1e34">
                  <a name="motion__id-6aff64b9-d153-4248-9ca1-7409df9a1e34"><!--a--></a>The third noteworthy feature
is that the support for low-income Singaporeans has progressed to embrace
non-income support. The plan for more social workers and other professionals
to help lower income families underlines the need for a holistic
approach to helping them break out of the poverty cycle and become
resilient. I hope we can make a serious effort to make non-income
support a central feature of our ecosystem of care and caring. This
House would be more than familiar with the gross limitations of
what income transfers can do. In 2011, Government transfers constituted
a massive 43.8% of the annual household income from work per household
member for HDB 1- and 2-room resident households. This is an increase
over the figure of 43.3% in 2010 and 41.4% in 2009. These transfers
help in the short term but to help families become self-reliant
and confident about the future, the need for psycho-social, holistic
help, and principled-based case intervention are necessary if Government transfers
are not to become a crutch for the disadvantaged among us.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-525ca876-a055-4226-8888-29a5b4f7c061">
                  <a name="motion__id-525ca876-a055-4226-8888-29a5b4f7c061"><!--a--></a>Fourth, with the introduction
of the GST Voucher, the Government has acknowledged, albeit indirectly
and somewhat reluctantly, that the GST is a regressive tax since
lower income households pay a larger share of their income to the
GST than wealthier households do. Given that the GST Voucher will
operate as a permanent system of offsets, does it suggest that an
increase in the GST is likely to be sooner rather than later?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1ab14095-cec6-4e7c-be1c-7eb728b58416">
                  <a name="motion__id-1ab14095-cec6-4e7c-be1c-7eb728b58416"><!--a--></a>Much as there is a tendency
to see less well-off Singaporeans as the primary beneficiaries,
it bears noting that we are all better-off as a society when it
engenders resilience, hope, and confidence in the future, regardless
of one's socio-economic status. Furthermore, how we, as a society,
care for the disadvantaged, give voice to the voiceless, and help
the downtrodden among us reflects on our heart-ware, and the quality
of our nation-building. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ca4387f7-0218-44b1-b641-b08b19121923">
                  <a name="motion__id-ca4387f7-0218-44b1-b641-b08b19121923"><!--a--></a>Sir, it would be a pipe-dream
for any Budget to remove the inequalities in our society. Nonetheless, the
Budget must contribute towards a less unequal society. I submit
that the Budget must represent the essence of our social compact.
Our social compact must retain its inclusiveness, legitimacy and effectiveness. The
growing income gap raises the real concern of the imminent development
of "two Singapores". As the growing income gap is a reality that
will persist into the foreseeable future, what will prevent this
state of "two Singapores" is to ensure true social mobility and
to provide adequate social safety nets that encourage risk-taking
while not sapping the work ethic so carefully nurtured in the management
of Singapore's success. Indeed, social mobility, and its promise
of economic opportunity and success, has served as a powerful engine
of economic growth and a source of social cohesion. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1333</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-29d60d06-7ca5-4020-b3ac-0584dc9fa5dc">
                  <a name="motion__id-29d60d06-7ca5-4020-b3ac-0584dc9fa5dc"><!--a--></a>Sir, the sustenance of
our social compact requires a multi-stakeholder approach. Governments
alone cannot maintain social compacts. A key challenge as we incur
more social spending in the medium to long term is whether those
who bear the tax burden would appreciate the significance and shoulder
the responsibility of the better-off helping the less well-off.
If so, we have a sustainable social compact that will not only be
a deep resource of Singaporeans' bond with the State but it will
also nourish the affective ties between fellow Singaporeans. The
Budget is a social compact that must be a common enterprise for the
common good. If not, then we will have "two Singapores" forming,
and such a divided country will undermine the hopes and aspirations
of all Singaporeans.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3b516424-d208-4a55-8141-897d612fb36a">
                  <a name="motion__id-3b516424-d208-4a55-8141-897d612fb36a"><!--a--></a>Sir, I hope this House
will affirm the need to view the Budget as a tangible manifestation
of our evolving social compact. To be sure, the Budget is about
sharing our wealth, and Budget 2012 is a "social Budget" that puts
the disadvantaged and elderly Singaporeans at the forefront. The
Budget is a very powerful tool, an influential driver of social
engineering to mould social attitudes and mindsets, and influence
socio-economic behaviour. However, I do not think we have effectively
harnessed that to good effect. Instead, in recent years, the Budget
has all too often emphasised the "goodies" it contains which Singaporeans
have now grown to expect as an entitlement. I note that the Finance
Ministry's Budget website provides a calculator tool for households
and businesses to estimate the total amount that they can receive
from the Budget. However, the larger and more important messages
intended by the various policies and measures are drowned out by
the "noise" of calculating and comparing one's budgetary "gains"
and "losses". This cultivation of "what's-in-it-for-me" mindset
may unwittingly lull Singaporeans into sacrificing long-term benefits
for short-term gains.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8e736a67-14bd-44a2-9e2f-daf51547d570">
                  <a name="motion__id-8e736a67-14bd-44a2-9e2f-daf51547d570"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Government has
been criticised severely in the past for being tight-fisted. There
are now concerns of whether the pendulum has swung to the other
extreme. Even as the Budget shifts our focus towards expanded social
safety nets to help the less well-off Singaporeans, there is a concern
of whether we might be unwittingly planting the seeds of a welfare
state. I doubt so. The fact that the concerns are raised suggests
that we are mindful of the dependency syndrome. It is perhaps inevitable
and necessary, given the differential impact that our economic policies
have on different groups of Singaporeans, that Singapore has become
more welfare-oriented in recent years. However, if being less tight-fisted
on principled grounds to help Singapore remain inclusive and a land
of opportunity, without undermining the spirit of self-reliance,
then, why not? Besides, rising inequality results in declining equality
of opportunities, and runs the risk of political backlash and social
instability. Both could undermine the economic dynamism and social
cohesion that form the bedrock of our success.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5deb10a4-ff84-42db-b43c-9b6c6a12bbd8">
                  <a name="motion__id-5deb10a4-ff84-42db-b43c-9b6c6a12bbd8"><!--a--></a>But I also detect, through
my association with the voluntary welfare sector, the nascent signs
of an easy reliance on the Government. What is more important now
is to inculcate the desirable values, norms and attitudes even as
we roll out more support. Our Budget and the assistance it offers
to less privileged Singaporeans must not result in their having
a crutch mentality. For those who are able-bodied, the combination
of assistance and government transfers must reinforce the dignity
of work. The message of re-skilling, skills upgrading, and lifelong
learning must strike a chord with Singaporeans.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1334</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-ebc3836f-61d0-4ec2-89a5-dc2127708c38"><!--a--></a>In addition, I hope that as a society
we will keep a lookout for children from disadvantaged homes. In
this regard, education – especially pre-school education – becomes
critical in ensuring children from such homes are not unnecessarily
disadvantaged by the fates and fortunes of their parents. It goes towards
helping children from such homes have equal access to the equal
opportunities that the Singaporean system has prided itself of.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-98e6a6a8-dc2f-4683-890b-1a5871f929ce">
                  <a name="motion__id-98e6a6a8-dc2f-4683-890b-1a5871f929ce"><!--a--></a>Sir, even as the Budget
seeks to provide a leg-up for the bottom 20th percentile of Singaporeans,
we should be mindful of those in the so-called sandwiched middle
class who do not get as many benefits as the lower-income group.
They too experience middle-class anxiety. My view is that in the
past decade, the Government has focussed more on the threat to jobs
that the bottom 20% customarily face as their jobs get off-shored,
out-sourced or simply become unavailable. However, we should pay
just as much attention to the threat to wages that the sandwiched
middle-class Singaporean faces. This group of workers still have
their jobs but their wages are stagnant relative to the rising costs
of living and tax burdens.</p>

is the need for the business community to play a larger role in
tackling some of the challenges in our society. Contrary to the
talk among businesses, the economy did not, in my view, take a back
seat in Budget 2012. For too long, the corporate sector has perhaps
benefited from the fiscal largesse dispensed due to the Government's
anxiety to grow the economy and our desire for material well-being.
Against a backdrop of a growing income gap, I would urge the business
community to see the Budget in a different light. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ba4eaca8-ca2d-45bb-a97c-f3006686cc56">
                  <a name="motion__id-ba4eaca8-ca2d-45bb-a97c-f3006686cc56"><!--a--></a>Sir, it appears that the
business community equates a social Budget as a Budget that is not
pro-business. In fact, given the economic transformation and ongoing
restructuring, the Budget needs to secure the buy-in of Singaporeans.
So, a social Budget is inherently pro-business. The Budget is our social
compact and the business community is a key stakeholder. Singapore's
Budgets cannot be seen as a zero-sum game where if more is devoted
to social spending, that there is then less for the economy. Strong
economic growth and a cohesive society are not and need not be mutually
exclusive. Businesses can do more and should do more in areas like
employability of older Singaporeans, tackling the various forms
of workplace discrimination, and promoting work-life balance. The
need for businesses to step up and play their role in the development
of a resilient society is necessary. It is vital for them to do
so if the tripartite framework that has served us well is to be
sustained and enhanced in tandem with a changing world. In real
terms, a cohesive society means that in times of economic uncertainty,
the Government and businesses can muster the requisite political
will, support, and flexibility in tackling the challenges of the
day. This has been amply demonstrated in the past. </p>

Budget's measures to reduce the Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRCs)
have not gone down well with the small and medium enterprises. The
global economic landscape is changing rapidly. For too long, we
have become too dependent on perspiration through cheap labour inputs,
rather than inspiration and innovation to achieve economic growth.
We urgently need to put emphasis on productivity and innovation.
And our SMEs must rise to the challenge to take Singapore's economy
to new heights and to reduce our reliance on multinational corporations
and Government-linked companies. The SMEs are an untapped engine
of growth. They need to be nurtured but certainly not molly-coddled.
Sir, I urge the business community to see the Budget from a societal
perspective. Adding value to society's stakeholders will ultimately
benefit shareholders and business owners.</p>

2012 will not eliminate inequalities in our society. Instead, the
Budget will have to tackle resolutely the widening income gap while
ensuring that Singapore's economic dynamism is continuously enhanced.
Yet, it is this economic dynamism that has caused the income gap
and the middle-income squeeze. I suppose Singapore has no choice
in this regard – we have to take the downsides, even as we benefit
from globalisation. The Budget aspires towards a more balanced approach
towards growth and equity even as fiscal rectitude remains a cardinal
principle in our budgetary
policy. Not only does the Budget attempt to strengthen our social
safety nets but its wider coverage promotes inclusiveness to meet
the challenges of the day such as income inequality and the perceived
decline in social mobility. Much as we tend to see the Budget in
terms of what is in it for us, the Budget must also support the
social compact that will keep Singapore society cohesive, stable,
and confident of the future. </p>

and emphasis of Budget 2012. It makes a concerted effort to recognise
that not all Singaporeans have benefited equitably from Singapore's
economic progress in the last two decades. I hope we will build
on the inroads, catalyse mindset changes, and take a refreshing
look at how the Budget is a barometer for the type of society we
aspire to be. This will help Singapore and Singaporeans meet the

Sir, widely acclaimed as the "Budget with a Heart", this year's
Budget delights the three targeted vulnerable groups – the elderly,
the disabled and the low-income earners. It honours Government's
promise to ensure that these groups, too, have a part in Singapore's
progress and will not be left behind.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8f78b9cd-33e3-45b0-8982-947be53c6f07">

Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who feel the stress from further
tightening of foreign labour inflow, there was much approval and
respect for this Budget that takes care of the more vulnerable.
So, kudos to Deputy Prime Minister and his team. Sir, I have five
observations and five recommendations for Budget 2012.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c8e3d052-ced3-49ff-af9a-2eb57e43db17">
                  <a name="motion__id-c8e3d052-ced3-49ff-af9a-2eb57e43db17"><!--a--></a>Observation One. Budget
2012 is a sobering reminder of the inevitable outcomes of Singapore's efforts
to survive in an open global economy. Our survival strategy comes
at a price of (a) higher cost of living, and (b) wider income gaps
between the highly skilled, the globally mobile wage earners and their
lower-skilled fellow citizens. Both consequences – higher costs
and growing income gaps - are unlikely to disappear. And Budget
2012 signifies that transfers such as the GST Voucher Scheme are
a key way to redistribute incomes and are here to stay. That the
GST Voucher Scheme is made a permanent feature of Singapore's social
safety net marks the crossing of a psychological chasm, conquering
the ruling party's wariness and reluctance to guarantee payouts
that run the risk of an entitlement mentality.</p>

2012's comprehensive measures for the elderly also recognise the
need for a more aggressive Total Solution to support Singapore's
rapidly ageing population – in employment, healthcare options and
costs, retirement financial planning and housing. </p>

2012 confirms that despite being a country with one of the lowest
birth rates in the world, the Government or the Deputy Prime Minister
has decided that further financial incentives will not yield more
babies and other more effective solutions will have to be deployed.</p>

2012 underpins a strong belief that for political, social and economic reasons,
the increasing dependence on foreign workers is not tenable and
the Government will face head-on the resistance of SMEs which form
99% of the total number of enterprises in Singapore; and, last but
not least, Budget 2012 has answered the cry from a small segment,
about 3% of Singapore's population – the persons with special needs
or more commonly known as persons with disability. </p>

the recently submitted Enabling MasterPlan for the Disabled to Government,
Budget 2012 responded to the call from this community to be seen,
to be heard and to be treated as valued and equal members of the

potential of persons with disabilities at key stages of their lives
– at education, employment and adult living. </p>

Special Employment Credit (SEC) permanent for the elderly and the disabled.
Sir, while I am extremely grateful for the SEC for the elderly and
disabled, I believe there is merit to consider making this feature
of the social safety net permanent. This will go a long way to reflect the
value that society places on these vulnerable members; to encourage
them to work where they can instead of collecting welfare; and to
develop a reliable alternative to the foreign workforce. It will
also assure employers that the incentive will be available not just
for a short term and incentivise them to employ people who are elderly
or disabled. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6748ad76-5750-4d52-a371-443c7714e4dc">
                  <a name="motion__id-6748ad76-5750-4d52-a371-443c7714e4dc"><!--a--></a>Recommendation Two. Expand
the Special Employment Credit to cover more persons with disabilities
(PWDs). The Budget provides for Special Employment Credits only
for graduates from VWO-run Special Education (SPED) schools. While
I appreciate the confidence that the Government places on these
20 SPED Schools, I wish to remind the Government again that there
are many persons with disabilities out there in Singapore who did
not attend or graduate from SPED Schools. They are either from mainstream
schools, or are home-schooled, they stopped schooling or never been
to school. Their potential or current employers should not be deprived
of the SEC incentives for employing them.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8fa52f50-a3b6-4d81-b339-a057574b1fca">

I received various SMS confirmations from many VWOs representing
the hearing-impaired, the visually-impaired, the physically disabled,
those with muscular dystrophy and autism, and they confirmed there
are at least a few hundred of them out there who are not special
school graduates. Many of them are able to work if they are provided
the training and support and if there are willing employers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e90f4f14-59e0-4f23-a408-d4c8c0c50e90">

of coverage to include this group of non-SPED graduands is the same
call that I made when the Special Needs Savings Scheme was introduced
earlier this year which similarly excluded them. I, therefore, ask
the Government to expand the Special Employment Credit to cover persons
with disabilities who did not graduate from special schools.</p>

increasing social expenditures are ultimately going to be funded.
The hon Member, Mr Vikram Nair, mentioned that. I had spoken earlier
that Budget 2012 is a sobering reminder that widening income gaps
are here to stay and the Government is acknowledging that the gap
has to be addressed through transfers to the lower income group. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1337</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cf94409e-6323-4a50-a5cd-2c4308f33290">
                  <a name="motion__id-cf94409e-6323-4a50-a5cd-2c4308f33290"><!--a--></a>I would like to propose two ideas to fund
the increasing social service expenditures. One, through personal
income taxes payable by higher income wage earners; and, two, through
budget re-allocation, in particular from defence. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-74eb43c6-270c-4a56-a808-c9381b3ba882">
                  <a name="motion__id-74eb43c6-270c-4a56-a808-c9381b3ba882"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Singapore personal
taxation system is progressive and levies taxes according to one's income.
Hence, an individual with high income will pay more in taxes than
an individual with a lower income. A good progressive tax system
ensures income redistribution but, at the same time, also has to ensure
that high-income taxpayers are not demotivated from taking on higher
paying jobs or, worse, emigrate to more tax-friendly countries. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c727479f-6757-4c81-8736-8fc1735c160e">
                  <a name="motion__id-c727479f-6757-4c81-8736-8fc1735c160e"><!--a--></a>Although our traditional
fiscal strategy is to keep Singapore's corporate and personal income
tax rates low to compete with the likes of Hong Kong, there is merit
to consider strengthening the progressive nature of the personal
income tax system. The highest income tax rate for anyone earning
a taxable income of over S$320,000, today in Singapore, is 20%.
This is way below the tax payable rate of 30% to 50% by higher-income
earners in countries such as the Nordic countries, Australia, New Zealand,
China and the US. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3bffeb69-0966-49e8-a0a4-c0e554411c85">
                  <a name="motion__id-3bffeb69-0966-49e8-a0a4-c0e554411c85"><!--a--></a>Singapore is reputed to
have the highest proportion of millionaires in the world. Perhaps
those who are most blessed can be persuaded to bear more responsibility
for the society in which they live. I ask the Government to review
the personal taxation system and consider having Singapore's top
income earners who have benefited from Singapore's solid infrastructure,
growth policies and public goods to bear some of the responsibility
of funding the transfers to the poor and needy in society. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9397cd8e-9fa1-4f77-89c8-bd3573ee913f">
                  <a name="motion__id-9397cd8e-9fa1-4f77-89c8-bd3573ee913f"><!--a--></a>Recommendation Four. Review
budget allocation, in particular defence. Another suggestion I would like
to propose to help fund future social needs is to review the traditional
way the Budget is allocated. Sir, defence traditionally consumes
the highest proportion of total Government expenditure each year. This
year's allocation, for instance, represents close to 25% of total
budget and even sees an increase of 4.3% from last year – about
$12 billion, I believe.</p>

the security of our small nation-state is critical and defence is
not an expenditure to be dispensed with easily, I urge the Government
to study the optimal resources Singapore should expend on defence
versus other new and pressing social needs. The study should consider
the changing nature of warfare the defence team has to wage, from
traditional to cyber wars and terrorism; and balance it with the
upcoming and costly social needs of a maturing Singapore. </p>

establish an agency to focus and nurture local small and medium enterprises.
Sir, Budget 2012, whilst popular with many Singaporeans, I understand,
received a cool response from some 150,000 SMEs who are concerned
with the further restriction on foreign labour inflow. These SMEs
employ more than 50% of the workforce in Singapore. And the wellness
of this critical group of companies is important to our country.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bf4bd019-e74a-4038-b106-0378293306aa">
                  <a name="motion__id-bf4bd019-e74a-4038-b106-0378293306aa"><!--a--></a>In a full employment market,
many SMEs continue to face difficulties trying to find local employees needed
to support their business growth. Besides labour constraints, the
key challenges they face are high costs especially in rentals and
material costs as a result of higher oil prices, for example.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e43a683c-3651-436f-a6fd-e95fcc30043e">
                  <a name="motion__id-e43a683c-3651-436f-a6fd-e95fcc30043e"><!--a--></a>According to a very positive
SME owner I surveyed last night, the leap would require more than
the writing of cheques by the Government. Many SMEs aspire to innovate
and make the leap from being an SME to a big multinational. Who
would not want that? But many of them also know that the Government
is very serious about its economic committee strategies and SMEs
who do not make the change or the cut will have to exit from Singapore.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1338</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d1dae2d5-87e4-42c4-9a81-6b1d19762289">
                  <a name="motion__id-d1dae2d5-87e4-42c4-9a81-6b1d19762289"><!--a--></a>However, transformation through productivity
and innovation is easier said than done. Not through one-time process
re-engineering or one-time grants, but through building a culture
of productivity and innovation which, from my experience, takes
at least two to three years to build, if well done. Sending employees
to training when the organisation is fighting operational fires
due to a shortage of workers seems counter-productive. Training
that is not reinforced by workplace practices – by the bosses –
is also similarly counter-productive.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7fc64c0f-2dda-4e69-929a-ad97004b16e0">
                  <a name="motion__id-7fc64c0f-2dda-4e69-929a-ad97004b16e0"><!--a--></a>Despite SPRING's efforts,
many SME owners are still unsure about what grants there are, who
to apply to and how to apply for the numerous grants. If the full
suite of financial schemes and incentives that the Government is
providing does not yield the take-up rate and the desired outcome,
then, surely, the root causes have not yet been completely addressed.
Sir, unless we address these root causes on the ground, it is likely
that the Government's well-intended schemes will not bear enough
fruit and many entrepreneurs will leave the scene. </p>

full-employment labour market and the difficulty of trying to build
a culture of productivity and innovation, I urge the Government
to be more empathetic to the SMEs in approving Work Pass applications
for proven foreign employees who are working in, one, industries
which traditionally do not hold certificates or where jobs do not
come with certificates; and two, industries in which jobs are not
easily filled or shunned by locals such as in cleaning, healthcare,
F&amp;B and public housing construction, amongst others. I would
also ask the Government to be more empathetic in approving PR and
citizenship applications to skilled foreign employees who have served
in Singapore for many years and who have raised families in Singapore; </p>

up and staffing of a Special SME Unit with corporate turnaround
leaders and experts in various disciplines that can be deployed
to nurture and transform high-potential SMEs to play in bigger leagues;

2012 is not only a Budget with a heart that targets the three most vulnerable
segments of Singapore's population. It is also a Budget from a head
that knows that unless it takes the unpopular step of managing the
otherwise unstoppable escalation of the foreign workforce, the DNA
of Singapore will change for the worse. But the hands of execution
play an important part too. The quality of execution and the readiness
to finetune the policies when needed will determine, finally, the Budget's
success. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and his team and the
Prime Minister for this well-crafted Budget. Sir, I support the
Budget.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, thank you for letting me participate in the debate.
I share most of the sentiments expressed by fellow Members on the
Budget. It stands apart from Budgets of the past. One aspect I note
is that the Budget did not attempt to give something to everyone. In
times of economic uncertainty, our spending must be focused to meet
national objectives. It makes less sense to give <em class="ph i">hong baos</em> to
everyone, whether they need it or not. One more dollar which goes
to someone who needs it less, means a dollar less for someone who
needs it more. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c812423c-0c28-4c9a-8eb9-84018b5a578d">
                  <a name="motion__id-c812423c-0c28-4c9a-8eb9-84018b5a578d"><!--a--></a>I also support the Budget
because it strikes a balance between encouraging Singaporeans to
succeed through their own efforts, yet recognising that you have
to do more to level up society, and help those in need. Because
that is the hallmark of any inclusive society − or tribe as Mr Baey
calls it − every citizen instilled with the unshakeable belief that
the well-being of their fellow Singaporeans is important to them
and a fundamental part of our national mission. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a6a98dfa-8ca3-47e6-b4f4-2d623218fcfa">
                  <a name="motion__id-a6a98dfa-8ca3-47e6-b4f4-2d623218fcfa"><!--a--></a>There is, however, a temptation
in such debates to focus on areas which the Government could do more
or has not addressed. Anyone can, without much effort, think of
something we can spend more money on or areas they want the Government
to pay more attention to. We all want to be as inclusive as possible
but our resources are not unlimited. It should not be how much we
spend but really the outcomes we achieved. Mr Inderjit Singh and
Ms Sylvia Lim both talked about increasing healthcare spending,
and that is a good example. In the US, for example, US spends 18%
of their GDP on healthcare. And this compares to about 9%-10% of
European countries. But the outcomes in European countries on healthcare
are much better – longer longevity, life spans, healthcare outcomes,
infant mortality. So it is not about how much we spend but the outcomes
we achieved. The real challenge is about getting our spending priorities
right, and to be smart about how we spend, where we spend, why we
spend, so that we can make a real difference to the lives of as
many Singaporeans as possible on a balanced Budget. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f941c57f-6450-40b2-8346-d02b88835fd4">
                  <a name="motion__id-f941c57f-6450-40b2-8346-d02b88835fd4"><!--a--></a>One of the key concerns
all Singaporeans have is, of course, growing old and the challenges
that it will bring − lack of employment opportunities, rising cost
of living, healthcare and housing. It affects not just the older
generation, but the younger generation as well, as they know that
they have or will have the responsibility of looking after their
parents, of making sure that they lead comfortable lives. And they
know that they will too grow old one day. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-afffae4e-6276-43f8-a0ea-04fb7a10ee42">
                  <a name="motion__id-afffae4e-6276-43f8-a0ea-04fb7a10ee42"><!--a--></a>I therefore applaud the
many measures in the Budget which are targeted at helping the elderly.
It has been said many times that ours is an ageing society, and
the challenges we face today are only going to grow with time. I
accept that it is impossible for the Government to address all these
challenges in a single term, never mind a single Budget. These are
measures which have to be rolled out, modified and sharpened over
time. But it is important that we put in place the building blocks
of our plan to meet an ageing society as soon as possible. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2d4d4e86-c58b-480a-9aff-af0d8a55956a">
                  <a name="motion__id-2d4d4e86-c58b-480a-9aff-af0d8a55956a"><!--a--></a>In this regard, I would
like to touch on three specific areas which I hope the Government
will look into to help our elderly citizens, and then end by making
a broader point.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-abe2128d-a496-4f2d-82ca-eab629583a3b">
                  <a name="motion__id-abe2128d-a496-4f2d-82ca-eab629583a3b"><!--a--></a>First, the enhanced Lease
Buy-back Scheme and the Silver Bonus Payment to encourage the elderly to
purchase studio apartments. I support them because they are an improvement
to what we have now. This was an issue I spoke extensively about
during the debate on the President's Address − the weaknesses of
the current Lease Buy-back Scheme and why it will not help the elderly.
But I hear the improvements still would not address certain fundamental
difficulties.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5540f732-9784-4c04-9bd1-4a1d33b8300c">
                  <a name="motion__id-5540f732-9784-4c04-9bd1-4a1d33b8300c"><!--a--></a>The situation we have
now is that many elderly are asset rich but cash poor. They live
in flats which are fully paid up, and worth many times what they
paid for them. But as the Finance Minister said, they do not have much in
their CPF or the bank, as they worked in times when wages were low.
Retirement planning was not a luxury many of them could afford.
Some, for one reason or another, cannot turn to their families for
help. That will be a growing problem as most Singaporeans do not
marry or have fewer children. The only sensible solution is to help
them monetise their homes, and address that imbalance between cash
and property. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1340</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-79173866-1ab6-4c90-be7d-5b5113de166e">
                  <a name="motion__id-79173866-1ab6-4c90-be7d-5b5113de166e"><!--a--></a>Selling and moving to
a studio apartment is the neatest way to do this. A new house, a
fresh 30-year lease, cash surplus which should get you by comfortably
for your remaining years. But Studio Apartments are currently not
easy to come by. And even if we build more, it may be difficult
for the elderly to sell off their current homes, break ties they
have developed over the years, and start all over again in a strange
environment. A recent <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> article published interviews
with a number of elderly, who expressed those very concerns. Do
we really want them to move? This cannot be good for their well
being. We want them to grow old among friends and people they know,
people who will look after them. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3b67af66-12b7-4242-b625-f70f6edb85ca">
                  <a name="motion__id-3b67af66-12b7-4242-b625-f70f6edb85ca"><!--a--></a>To allow the elderly to
continue living in their current homes, we introduced Lease Buy-backs
a few years ago. But it proved very unpopular, with very low take-up
rate. For the reasons I gave in my earlier speech, I can understand
why. It only applies to 2- and 3-room flats. The monthly payments
are low. There are also a number of disadvantages. The payments
are based on the present day value of the flats as determined by
the HDB, which means that the owner does not benefit from any rises
in property prices. He, in fact, suffers inflation. And once he
signs on, he cannot get out. So, he can no longer sell his flat
or bequeath it. And when he passes on, the flat is taken back by
the HDB and the remaining value cashed out and given to his beneficiaries.
The new changes will increase the amount of payout, both upfront
and monthly. But I suspect the other disadvantages I have outlined
will not make the enhanced scheme much more popular. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-682779b1-2fdd-4bba-a49d-0a517ac7f822">
                  <a name="motion__id-682779b1-2fdd-4bba-a49d-0a517ac7f822"><!--a--></a>I, therefore, urge the
Government to come up with further options or choices to help older Singaporeans
unlock the value of their HDB flats, which will not only allow them
to stay where they are, but allow greater flexibility than the current
Lease Buy-back Scheme. At the debate on the President's Address,
I suggested a scheme which will allow Singaporeans to sell back
portions of their lease to HDB. A 70-year-old couple does not need
a 50- or 60-year lease. If they can sell part of their lease back
to HDB, and for the proceeds to be given part in cash and part paid
into CPF, that would give them a decent sum to meet immediate needs,
such as the costs of an operation or other medical needs, as well
as daily expenses. Only a portion of their lease will be valued
at current prices, which means that they will still benefit from
future property price increases and the effects of inflation are
reduced. They will continue to have the option to sell the flat
and buy a studio apartment, when one becomes available. Or they
can leave the flat behind for loved ones. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0d84e7c5-2148-4f69-846d-76d0604cc8e2">
                  <a name="motion__id-0d84e7c5-2148-4f69-846d-76d0604cc8e2"><!--a--></a>Sir, the second aspect:
private property owners. There were two notable changes in the assistance given
in this Budget. First, unlike in the past, no or little distinction
is made in the benefits given to those living in different HDB types.
This is welcome, as we know from the ground that the size of a person's flat
is not an accurate proxy of his financial needs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-911e8b7c-79dc-479d-ab55-5aefa81faef4">
                  <a name="motion__id-911e8b7c-79dc-479d-ab55-5aefa81faef4"><!--a--></a>The second is that owners
of smaller private properties, about 15% of the market, will enjoy
benefits as well. I can understand why we make distinctions for
private homes. Those who live in larger private homes are generally
considered wealthier, and they certainly have more options. But
there are a good number of them owned by elderly retirees who purchased
their homes when they were considerably cheaper, and who are now
in the same boat − small bank and small CPF balances. Some may argue
that if they need cash, they can sell their homes and downgrade
quite comfortably. I think that is easier said than done. Again,
it is a solution which forces them, in their golden years, to move
away from their homes, their friends and places they are familiar
with. They have another challenge, which is this. Because of the
significant rise in private property prices in recent years, many
of them have seen a substantial
increase in the annual value of their homes, and therefore the property
tax they pay. But the rise in annual values does not help them as
they derive no income from their homes and the increased tax they
pay is a further draw on their cash reserves. Would the Government
therefore consider a lower concessionary property tax for elderly,
retired couples? It would, of course, not apply if they have other investment
properties or income. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1341</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d7a86fe8-9a87-4303-894b-9e69af80cf57">
                  <a name="motion__id-d7a86fe8-9a87-4303-894b-9e69af80cf57"><!--a--></a>The third specified issue
deals with improving infrastructure to help the elderly become more mobile.
One example of this is an old chestnut – lifts for overhead bridges.
This has been brought up a few times in this House. The Land Transport
Authority (LTA), I understand, is building lifts for bridges at
transportation nodes, but it numbers about six. For an elderly person,
the inability to climb the stairs of an overhead bridge means, in
some instances, taking long detours just to cross a road. That presents them
with even more difficulties as walking itself is a struggle for
many. Hence, the temptation to jaywalk, putting life and limb at
risk.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db4841dc-f878-45b3-a787-c9411059abb5">
                  <a name="motion__id-db4841dc-f878-45b3-a787-c9411059abb5"><!--a--></a>There are 484 overhead
bridges in Singapore, but there will be no need to upgrade all of
them. Some already have, or are able to have, ramps; others are
near enough to signalised crossings for the elderly to use; others
do not see much use. I urge the Government to start a pilot project
to install selected overhead bridges with lifts, and assess the
impact. </p>
            </div>

                  <a name="motion__id-45de8117-1602-4fb6-9693-5bab1f1ebbaf"><!--a--></a>I know this will be expensive,
but I believe it will be worth the price to help the elderly be
more mobile and independent. Over time, more of us will need it
as our own knees give way and legs go weak. The HDB is currently
implementing a programme to install lifts for multi-storey car parks.
Is that really a more worthy cause? The Lift Upgrading Programme
has released many elderly people from the prisons of their own homes.
We have made our public housing estates, buildings and places of
interest barrier free. The road represents the final barrier, and
I hope the Government will help the elderly cross it. </p>

and broader point. The Budget initiatives for the elderly are intended
to enable an elderly person to live safely and in comfort, and when
ill, to encourage him to recuperate at home, with his family and
loved ones around him, and this makes sense. We must, therefore,
build more Studio Apartments, nursing homes and Eldercare Centres
near where we live, so that the elderly can have access to amenities
such as markets, parks, and bus-stops. The Government wants to build
more of these facilities – but where are we going to put them? The
answer is obvious. We need to build them within existing housing
estates. That will enable our elderly to live within the community.
It will also enable them to be more independent, since they will
be living near the amenities they obviously need. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-af1d0506-07ae-4f04-8f5d-5a7b2c39568b">
                  <a name="motion__id-af1d0506-07ae-4f04-8f5d-5a7b2c39568b"><!--a--></a>The problem is that some
of us do not want such facilities near our homes. There has been
much discussion in the media about residents in Woodlands and Toh
Yi Drive opposing the building of Eldercare Centres and studio flats.
These are treated as isolated incidents to be resolved at the local
level, but they are not. Is there any doubt that there will be similar
reactions if these facilities were proposed in other estates? There
are too many similar examples. A couple of years ago, residents
of one constituency even objected to building rental flats in their
estate. The Government is in an impossible situation, as I see it:

facilities for the elderly have to be built. They have worked hard
all their lives. In their sunset years, they ought to occupy a special

how many such elderly facilities it intends to build around Singapore

be located or will be located. This should be shared with Singaporeans,
so that the matter is not dealt with on an <em class="ph i">ad hoc</em> basis, but
the issue is treated as being in everyone's backyard. When we sell
BTO flats, we should indicate what amenities may be located within
the precinct so that all purchasers will know what the future plans are
and no one will be taken by surprise. We also need to review the
design of our flats. We should have fewer stand-alone studio apartment
blocks, and more elderly apartments distributed within the block,
so that parents and children can live separately but close together.
Many elderly I have spoken to would prefer this model. They too
find it depressing to live in a block occupied entirely by the elderly.
We should ask them what they want. So, we need a national plan which
meets national objectives and, more importantly, we need Singaporeans
to get behind the plan and support the Government.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's
Office (Mr Heng Chee How)</strong>
                  </span>: Thank you, Mr Speaker,
for allowing me to join this Budget Debate. To me, the most important
message of this Budget is about preparing Singapore for the future.
This future is one where we expect significant challenges: more
physical constraints being felt – of our land, of water, of air
space, of transport capacity; of a more aged population; also a
population that will have ever higher expectations and sometimes
less willingness to give and take, and I think the hon. Mr Hri Kumar
has just very eloquently illustrated that in respect of the building
of elderly facilities and I agree wholeheartedly with him. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e3ac10ce-5fe7-4122-9467-7c998f4ef7d4">
                  <a name="motion__id-e3ac10ce-5fe7-4122-9467-7c998f4ef7d4"><!--a--></a>But this future is also
one that holds much promise: the promise of a stronger Singapore
core workforce; a country capable of sustained, reliable Whole-of-Government,
Whole-of-Society responses to problems and possibilities, a people
that sees seeking the greater good and the common good as important
as advancing self-interest. For today, I just wish to focus on the
importance of building the Singapore core workforce.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-063afa9e-96b3-4b33-b47d-62906c6b7d4d">
                  <a name="motion__id-063afa9e-96b3-4b33-b47d-62906c6b7d4d"><!--a--></a>I recently travelled to
the Chinese city of Chongqing. At the Singapore airport, I popped
by the book store and I saw and picked up a copy of the March issue
of the <em class="ph i">Harvard Business Review</em>. I did that because what was
on the front cover attracted me. The title says "Special Report:
Reinventing America – why the world needs the US to bounce back;
and Stop blaming China and India for America's economic problems".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-11080f6e-abe6-4e2e-a82f-e8f2c58cacc8">
                  <a name="motion__id-11080f6e-abe6-4e2e-a82f-e8f2c58cacc8"><!--a--></a>Inside the magazine, article
after article, author after author, cried out for action to move
the American economy and the American workforce back on track. One
article has the title "A Jobs Compact for America's Future", which
called for productive dialogue among their tripartite partners, and
for renewed badly needed investments in the reading and math education
for its young and for strengthening the capabilities of the American
workforce. Another article entitled "A Warning Sign for Global Companies"
sounded the alert that America needed to do more to attract and
retain MNCs on its soil if it wants the jobs and the technological
lead that such companies produce and bring. A third article called
"Fixing What's Wrong with US Politics" lamented how the urge for
one-upmanship in American politics has resulted in dysfunction and
malaise, and the loss of long-term focus.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-caa1e620-4a60-442a-84db-04c1fefd9060">
                  <a name="motion__id-caa1e620-4a60-442a-84db-04c1fefd9060"><!--a--></a>I said to myself: if this
is how the Americans are coming around to seeing their situation
and are agreeing on what they need to do to forge ahead, and if
they have that will then they will indeed forge ahead! As it stands,
American productivity is already higher than ours. So, where would
Singapore's position be in that scenario, competing with such a
revitalised giant that is bent on getting even better? </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1343</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bc6c74d3-93e8-440c-b7b7-c7a754d47819">
                  <a name="motion__id-bc6c74d3-93e8-440c-b7b7-c7a754d47819"><!--a--></a>And so, then I flew off
and landed in Chongqing around noon, and after a quick lunch, headed
for a dialogue with some city officials. We were briefed by several
officials in the areas of overall economic development, trade, finance
and manpower development for this mega-city of 32 million people.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b91f7146-dcb9-45df-9252-03478e8dbe0e">
                  <a name="motion__id-b91f7146-dcb9-45df-9252-03478e8dbe0e"><!--a--></a>The officials relished,
in fact they gushed, in their descriptions of how fast their city
has developed in the last decade, and especially in the past several
years. They highlighted their ambitions and their plans for rapid
urbanisation, industrialisation and internationalisation – and how
successful they had been in taking investments and jobs from the
big cities out there on the east coast of the country, and how a
growing list of big name companies are converging and clustering
into Chongqing, lured by promises of cheap land, cheap utilities,
cheap logistics, cheap financing, cheap manpower.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-34d3ab1d-424c-477a-9803-6507ac0d4f21">
                  <a name="motion__id-34d3ab1d-424c-477a-9803-6507ac0d4f21"><!--a--></a>But one thing really struck
me – and that was that the officials spoke of how they have systematically sourced
cheaper manpower first from the city, then its suburbs, then from
the countryside and then surrounding towns and surrounding provinces.
Why did they do that? They did that to lower manpower costs by bringing
in cheaper manpower than what they could find in the city itself.
And they were proud that that strategy had given them that pricing
advantage over the coastal cities, and had persuaded some companies
to relocate away from the coast inland into Chongqing. That strategy
sounded very familiar indeed. And I asked myself: can we outdo the
Chinese cities in such manpower sourcing? Can we do that now, or
in the medium term, or in the long run? And if we cannot, then what
would become of our economy?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8eb3c4be-a722-432d-8423-999f16c8de07">
                  <a name="motion__id-8eb3c4be-a722-432d-8423-999f16c8de07"><!--a--></a>And then to my amazement,
the Chongqing officials went on and they said that they also knew
that this "cheap sourcing" – those are not their words, "cheap sourcing"
are my words – this way of sourcing for cheaper manpower, this strategy
was not sustainable, in their view, in the long term, even for them in
China because they saw what happened to the coastal cities as development
picked up speed. First, cheaper locations will emerge and will always
look increasingly attractive. So, if today you can take it from
Shanghai, tomorrow somebody will take it from Chongqing. So they
knew that. Second, as the surrounding areas develop, the residents
in those areas would be able to find decent work without venturing
further afield. It would then become more and more difficult to
amass cheap manpower that way and they have to foster competitiveness
differently for the medium to long term. And for this reason, they
are aiming to use the cheap factor strategy to buy time to develop
into higher value production and services, so that they would not
be caught in the lurch eventually.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d831d1a4-d15a-4405-9e9f-3f59acb18c59">
                  <a name="motion__id-d831d1a4-d15a-4405-9e9f-3f59acb18c59"><!--a--></a>I told myself: Singapore
had better watch it and get our act together fast. For many years,
we have fuelled our growth through growing the size of our workforce
both internally and then by introducing external manpower to supplement.
And this has successfully brought us to where we are today. To go further,
we have to pick our approach wisely. We have to judge whether relying
on an ever expanding inflow of external supplemental manpower will
secure our competitiveness now and in the long term. And what makes
us think that the economic development that will occur in the home
countries of our foreign labour sources would not naturally reduce
the need and the desire of their populations from wanting to leave
home and work abroad? And if that happens, and if we are still bound
to a model that critically depends on the free and abundant availability
of external manpower, then would we not be exposing ourselves to
unacceptable risks? And even if that does not happen, would we not
at least be slowing the pace of innovation and transformation simply
because the painkiller was there for us to take for the moment?</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1344</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-75943826-1e21-4636-9848-95ac9d4690dc">
                  <a name="motion__id-75943826-1e21-4636-9848-95ac9d4690dc"><!--a--></a>Sir, the experiences of America and China
in the past and their strategies for the present and future are
important sign posts for us. Those ahead of us are recommitting
to strengthening their core attractiveness, competitiveness and
innovation in order to stay ahead. Those behind are milking all
the advantages of their natural resource endowments to steal a march
on the others, while simultaneously retooling for progress and success
in a more resource-scarce future. Singapore must not spin our wheels and
live in the past. Our methods must change in the light of these
realities, and climb. And we must climb the productivity and innovation
ladder as quickly as we can, while time and opportunity permit. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-75bc1119-1b7e-4a06-9125-63d3e1572fe6">
                  <a name="motion__id-75bc1119-1b7e-4a06-9125-63d3e1572fe6"><!--a--></a>In this regard, I have
seven ideas to suggest for consideration.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-63d617b9-c38d-486a-a87d-67dca59f2cf7">
                  <a name="motion__id-63d617b9-c38d-486a-a87d-67dca59f2cf7"><!--a--></a>First, as this transformation
will impact the whole economy and, understandably, SMEs would be amongst
the most impacted, there must be positive outreach to them, and
not just a passive array of schemes for them to come forward to
tap. We have heard from hon Members that, every day, SMEs are fire-fighting.
They have limited capabilities. They are too busy. They have many
limitations. A positive outreach towards them is absolutely necessary
to begin and sustain this transformation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8b23df85-ac9b-4f2e-8437-e6d26b9a7d89">
                  <a name="motion__id-8b23df85-ac9b-4f2e-8437-e6d26b9a7d89"><!--a--></a>Second, close monitoring
of job displacements so that help can be extended early and in a
targeted manner. Again, we heard from Members that we have to bite
the bullet. It may be painful. Some may have to close shop; some
may have to go elsewhere. There may be workers from them that would
have to lose their jobs, and then what happens? And if we want to
keep that pain to the minimum, if we want to help as many of such
displaced workers as possible, then we need to know where these
things are happening, where the retrenchments are taking place,
where the shutdowns are taking place so that we can direct our attention
and our help in a prompt, timely and effective manner. So, the monitoring
is important.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-58c95d60-7ee9-475e-8ae8-79a37c58f8dc">
                  <a name="motion__id-58c95d60-7ee9-475e-8ae8-79a37c58f8dc"><!--a--></a>Third, not only monitor
but what do you do when you find such a worker? Therefore, job banking must
be stepped up. As more businesses are impacted and their workers
have to move to new jobs, job banking and job matching will become
a critical success factor. We have traditionally thought of job matching,
job banking in a context of an economic recession – cyclical. But
now we are attempting a transformation of the economy, so we must
also expect displacement to take place. Therefore, we also have
to strengthen our capabilities in this area and deploy them to good
effect.</p>
            </div>

                  <a name="motion__id-c18426b1-7756-4c47-8b97-440ab0efba1c"><!--a--></a>Fourth, outreach must
be done in different languages and not only in English, to take
into account the reality facing many SMEs. In other words, many
of the bosses of SMEs may not be fluent or effective in their English
and, therefore, our help schemes must be business-centric so that
they can then be worker-centric.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f3b29302-4f78-44d8-ab89-4a5cf61f6917">

of labour supply to labour demand through re-employment, through
back-to-work women workers and the upgrading of jobs, technology
and the image of SME jobs must be stepped up, so that companies
can have a viable alternative to external manpower sources. So,
not only to tighten the tap of foreign workers coming in but also
to address where do they find the workers that they need. There
are internal sources that we can further unleash and we must do
that and help to make that connection. The better we do so, the
less the pain for everyone. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-42d9f870-27a0-4abc-b0b5-9e74d2af2373">
                  <a name="motion__id-42d9f870-27a0-4abc-b0b5-9e74d2af2373"><!--a--></a>Sixth, wage levels must
be monitored to give an ongoing sense of how the transformation
is actually impacting the outcome for workers at all levels. That
is, on the positive side, as we transform and as the value-add goes
up, we want to see that translated into better wages, better livelihoods
for our workers. And we cannot assume that that would naturally
take place. We have to monitor and make adjustments, if necessary,
to ensure that that takes place. </p>

a national level award be created to recognise and motivate companies,
big and small, for their effective and genuine efforts and initiatives
to create and nurture a Singaporean core workforce. Mr Speaker, Sir, we must put
away any wishful thinking and hunker down to search for new and
smarter ways to use our manpower, and to sharpen the capabilities
of our manpower. We must build our Singaporean core before it is
too late. I support the Budget. </p>

Sir, with this Budget, the Government has belatedly and accurately recognised
how serious the problem with our over reliance on cheap foreign

provided Singapore with an unsustainable economic model, a phenomenon
that is akin to the use of performance-enhancement drugs in sports. </p>

is our end goal. Sustainable economic growth that brings about prosperity of
Singaporeans across the spectrum should be the ultimate and key
measure of our economic performance. To enhance productivity in
our industries, we have to think out of the box for more creative solutions,
especially during this tough economic year. Here, it is important
to highlight that the business environment must be conducive for
SMEs to grow alongside MNCs that are brought in. </p>

labour cost, cost of businesses and factory or warehouse rent that
plague local businesses have been raised. The Government should
address these issues that compromise the entrepreneurial abilities
of our Singaporean businesses. Nonetheless, the Singapore People's

enhanced schemes catering to the elderly, those with disabilities

where no Singaporean is left behind. </p>

a more focused set of tools for aged needy Singaporeans. Increasing
CPF contribution when one reaches 50 years of age may be too late.

Increasing CPF contribution only at the age of 50 makes little policy
or financial sense, especially at a time of their life when their
salaries may actually start to dip. Working Singaporeans younger
than the age of 50 could be given incentives to start accumulating
funds in their Supplementary Retirement Scheme accounts, to enjoy
practical benefits from tax savings. </p>

us not forget about the situation of CPF for older women. Compared
to their counterparts in developed countries in the West, the labour
participation of Singaporean women tends to fall much earlier in
the course of their lifespan. And since the economic development
of Singapore was achieved within a shorter and at a later point
of time in history than most developed countries, it also means
that older Singaporean women today are less likely than their counterparts
to have gone to university. This has crucial implications for late-life
employment. All these point to the problem of income inadequacy
for older women, especially when they are physically unable to work. They
have longer life expectancies than men, but the assumption of our
CPF policies is still that men are the main breadwinners in these
families, and that CPF payouts for older women largely assume that
they depend on their husbands – if they are even married in the
first place.</p>

women today may also face these concerns when they grow old. We
still hear many complaints of wrongful dismissal of women from work
when they are pregnant. This may be more an issue of employment
practices, but CPF policy is integral here too. In developed countries
like Sweden, for instance, women can get pension credits when they
are on maternity leave, in recognition of their role as caregivers.
This calls for a substantial re-think of the CPF model, to build
a better social safety net for older women. </p>

for retirees. I would like to ask whether the Minister for Health
would consider allowing Medisave to make payments for rider supplements
to co-insurance and deductions, and whether he would increase the
withdrawal limit of $800 per policy year to pay for private Medisave-approved
Integrated Shield Plans, for policy-holders aged between 60 and
80 years. This group of people, who are mostly retired, need to
use their insurance policies to the fullest, in the event of a major illness,
for which treatment can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars
in medical bills. This is often an amount that cannot be adequately
covered by MediShield schemes. Topping up requires a few hundred
dollars, and most of these retirees are cash-poor. The irony is
that they may have a lot of money in their Medisave account, but
cannot make use of them to top up or upgrade due to the withdrawal
limit of $800. Currently, only Singaporeans who are 80 and above
could use the maximum of $1,100 per policy year which, frankly,
is quite ridiculous – not everyone can live beyond 80 years of age. </p>

to a long-term concern. Medical fees have increased over time. The

their increase can be covered by the Medisave provisions and subsidies
available. </p>

the productivity and efficiency of our healthcare industry should
be increased, in line with the general thrust of this Budget. Here

will have to further divide the demand for beds into two levels
– hospitalisation and recovery needs. Between the detection and
surgery phase, the patient will have to stay in the hospital. After
surgery, patients can stay in recovery beds that will require less
intensive medical investments. Recovery beds can be housed in facilities
adjacent to hospitals. </p>

We were initially glad to hear that the Government will be improving
bus services by paying for 550 new buses and funding $1.1 billion
through the Bus Services Enhancement Fund. But on deeper consideration,
we think all this masks a fundamental question. SBS Transit and SMRT
are privatised companies that together enjoy a virtual monopoly
over bus services in Singapore. Why is the Government using taxpayers'
money to fund these two profit-making private companies to run their
monopoly? These companies have been reaping huge profits for the
past few years. SMRT's revenue for the financial year ending 2011
was $969.7 million. SBS Transit's revenue for the same period was
$751.1 million. Are they not able to fund purchases of new buses
and improve their operations with the profit made?</p>

towards SMRT comes from the fact that these profits were made on
the back of transport infrastructure assets that were funded by
the taxpayer, such as MRT tracks and roads. Yet these profits do
not go back to the public purse. The costs have been socialised,
but the profits have been privatised. </p>

for Transport to end the monopoly of the two bus companies. Taxpayers' money
should not be used for what is in effect unfair subsidisation for
these privatised corporations. Consequently, allow other private
bus companies to be set up to serve public bus routes. This will
also alleviate overcrowding in our transport networks. There could
also be a Government-run bus company set up to enter the fray. This
is a good way to force the existing bus companies to operate more
efficiently in a true market situation, and not to rely on Government
funding whenever they are incapable of getting their act together. </p>

incentives received by global MNCs – namely, through grants, tax
relief, foreign worker quotas – with the level of incentives received
by SMEs, so I will be asking for these data to be released in the House
in the course of this year. </p>

my hope is that the Government will not waver in its goal to build
a more inclusive society in successive Budgets. Let us continue
further in this trajectory. In my speech, I have shown that what
the Singapore People's Party's desire for Singapore is not the kind
of excessive welfare-state system that will snowball to a situation
of spending beyond our means. Rather, we are putting forward logical
and fair policy recommendations that a developed, advanced country
like ours should naturally strive towards. We also hope that the
Government will not always demean other countries when raising examples
of the so-called "slippery slope to an excessive welfare-state model". Instead,
let us focus on building a fair society that values inclusivity
as well as hard work. Thank you, Mr Speaker. I support the Budget,
and I thank the Finance Minister, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and his
team for preparing Budget 2012 for an inclusive society and a stronger
Singapore.</p>

President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry,
and the Managing Director of Pacific International Lines (Pte) Ltd.
This year's Budget is an inclusive, compassionate and pro-people
Budget, focused on looking after the elderly, lower-income and people
with disabilities. We feel deeply moved and encouraged by this.
The latest Budget emphasises the Government's determination to promote
economic growth and increase productivity. Minister Tharman also
pointed out that this year's Budget is a Budget for the future,
the focus being to address Singapore's long-term challenges, and
not to provide a counter-cyclic boost. Today, I would like to reflect
some problems that are being faced by our businesses using three
main points: human resource, an environment for SMEs' survival,
and an inter-Ministry co-ordinating agency.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f1ec4889-d09c-4e6e-bce7-4774abfe58b1">

this is what we call a "Move that Affects Everything". One of the
focal points of this year's Budget is on the manpower resource policy:
reducing the dependence on foreign workers, recruiting older workers,
and improving productivity. Overall, we see the social benefit of
this move. As the number of foreign workers is reduced, employers
will naturally find all means to recruit local workers, including
home-makers and part-time workers. However, not all jobs could be
taken up by older workers or part-time workers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a4376304-e1a4-47f9-ba2d-1850e9e26813">
                  <a name="motion__id-a4376304-e1a4-47f9-ba2d-1850e9e26813"><!--a--></a>A week ago, the General
Affairs Council Member of the Singapore Canvas, Chairs &amp; Tables
Hire Service Association shared their predicament with me. Their
members are involved in building tentages for all kinds of occasions,
including weddings, wakes, night markets and all kinds of celebratory
events. The working hours are very long and the work is physically
demanding. The busiest periods are on weekends and public holidays.
Hence, it is extremely difficult to get local workers for this industry. Currently,
as the Government will be reducing the Dependency Ratio Ceiling
for S pass workers, there will be an even greater tussle for local
workers, especially young workers who are willing to undertake such
manual labour. Employers are concerned that further down the road,
they would not find workers to fulfil their orders for the National
Day and the Chinese seventh month events. The Singapore Canvas, Chairs
&amp; Tables Hire Service Association hopes that given these special
circumstances, those workers belonging to this trade could be grouped
under the construction sector, and prevent the reduction in foreign
workers from making a large impact on local customs and culture.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1349</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-139584bc-2811-4a24-b07b-54911a2bfc53">
                  <a name="motion__id-139584bc-2811-4a24-b07b-54911a2bfc53"><!--a--></a>Another major area requiring attention
would be the training of older workers. One of our Chamber's members
in the manufacturing sector had begun to encourage its older workers
to attend training courses some three years ago. However, some older
workers were more reluctant to attend the training, even when courses
are arranged during working hours, and all fees are sponsored by
the company. The company had no choice but to make some rearrangements
and let the older workers undertake less physically demanding work.
In the end, the older workers felt that this was an insult to them
and did not cooperate. Thus, when the Government has decided to
reduce the dependency on foreign workers, the training of older
employees must be supported by a tripartite effort involving employees,
employers and the Government.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a1aed254-d142-4886-bf3b-ae9d6e8f8257">

in implementing the tightening in foreign worker policy, the Government
could exercise greater flexibility by considering the circumstances
of each industry.</p>

of survival. SMEs are the most affected by this year's Budget. Although
industrial restructuring is inevitable, we should try to mnimise
the impact on social cohesion, and allow some breathing space for
traditional industries that are still very welcome. Economic development
is unstoppable, but once social cohesion is gone, it would be very
difficult to get it reinstated.</p>

in a Mediacorp Channel 8 programme called "Tuesday Report", there
was a report on Nam Hin Noodles Manufacturer run by Mr Pei Guang
Nan. Mr Pei continues to produce different types and flavours of
noodles according to his customers' requirements. Some street hawkers have
moved into food courts but continue to use noodles made from Mr
Pei's shop, enabling patrons to enjoy disappearing street flavours.
Mr Pei's noodle shop at Balestier Road uses machines to produce noodles
and is a family-run business. Although it is a small outfit, its
products are very popular. After decades in the business, he has
become fast friends with many of his clients. Mr Pei worries that
if the Government wants to widen the road, he would have to move.
In the current rental market, he fears not being able to find a
suitable location to continue with his business, because he would
face many constraints in applying for licences in a new location.</p>

small companies plying traditional trades like that of Nam Hin Noodles Manufacturer,
which, besides providing good food and employment opportunities,
also work hard at preserving traditional food culture. I hope that
the Government's policy-making Ministries would view things from
a long-term perspective, and endeavour to build Singapore into a
diverse and vibrant metropolis. Besides the MNCs and large enterprises,
we hope that the Government would spare a thought for the SMEs,
inclusive of those in traditional trades, so that they could have
a chance at survival. Literally speaking, SMEs should be given the
chance to drink soup while large enterprises are consuming the entrÃ©e.
SMEs' existence would not only provide employment opportunities.
More importantly, they have a part to play in creating a more vibrant
society, offering more alternatives, and increasing social cohesion.</p>

rentals and increasing business costs. As with previous Budgets,
the Government would roll out some welcome policies in response
to the needs of the private sector, for example, providing the SME
Cash Grant, and helping our enterprises to restructure their operations
via the Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme (PIC). Such policies
are beneficial to many local enterprises. However, the problems
faced by SMEs are the results of such policy changes. For example, JTC
flatted factories were originally built to serve the needs of SMEs
since 1968, but after divestment in 2008, rentals have continued
to rise. The property companies are not in the wrong. Once they
are privatised, they would have to show profits to be accountable
to their shareholders. But some consequences need to be borne by
the society as a whole. Could the Government provide alternatives for the SMEs and start-up
companies? Apart from renting from large property companies, I recommend that
the Government could provide properties, not driven by commercial
gain, to serve as incubating centres, to support local start-ups
and SMEs. </p>

to rise rapidly, and this has proven to be detrimental for some
trades. From the beginning of last year, many bookstores, including
large international and local bookstores, have folded due to the
rental problem. Those which are still in business are languishing.
Following the closure of Borders, the Harris bookstore belonging
to the Popular chain and Page One have also just shut down. Page
One's 24 overseas outlets are doing very well, but its main bookstore
in Singapore has terminated operations. Another small niche bookstore,
BooksActualy, had to move three times because of the rental problem,
and managed to find a good spot in Tiong Bahru. However, because
this little enclave has become a popular area for shops and eateries,
the landlord also intends to increase rents.</p>

where culture and literary knowledge can be transmitted. In the
large malls in Singapore, there is very little differentiation in
retail mix. Eateries and clothing shops, arcades are becoming more
common, while it is almost impossible to find any shops to feed
the mind and the soul. This is not a healthy sign. In January, the
Sunbeam Theatre, the only privately-owned Cantonese opera house
in Hong Kong, announced its imminent closure due to rental problems,
and attracted widespread public attention. Eventually, the theatre
was preserved owing to public support and appeal. While Hong Kong
is well-known for being very commercialised, it has bent over backwards
to preserve such a cultural landmark. Could Singapore also consider
the long-term interests of its people by providing such a subsidy
for these more genteel and culturally-significant trades? Besides
providing Government subsidy, the community could also work together
and prevent Singapore from becoming a society which pursues economic
gain to the detriment of its cultural and gracious identity.</p>

cooperation, solving difficulties of enterprises. More often than
not, a Government policy could involve many different Ministries.
At such time, there should be a lead agency to push through the
implementation. For example, the National Productivity and Continuing
Education Council led by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and
the SME Committee led by Minister of State Teo Ser Luck are both
good examples. The various problems faced by our enterprises would
involve the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade and Industry,
Ministry of Manpower, and many others. Hence, I do hope that there
could be one over-arching agency to facilitate the coordination.</p>

requiring a coordinating agency to take the helm. Recently, some
local transport operators are getting very apprehensive. They are
worried about manpower and space for their operations. For the first
time, the Government will be helping public transport operators
to buy new buses to relieve daily congestion in public transport.
But those who will benefit are the listed companies which have already
increased bus fares eight times from July 2002 to October 2011,
and revenues have increased annually. This year, the Government
will be setting aside $1.1 billion to fund the purchase of 800 buses,
and this is certainly not a small amount. We hope that the bus fares
will not continue to rise. The main concern for school bus companies
and private bus operators is that 800 new buses would require more
than 1,000 bus drivers. Where are these qualified drivers going
to come from? If public buses need manpower, and they are unable
to recruit foreign workers, then the school bus companies and private
bus companies would face an even more challenging task in getting
the drivers they need. Moreover, these companies stand to lose not
only their qualified drivers to the public bus operators, but face
a double whammy of recruiting fewer foreign workers. </p>

for a ministerial dialogue, and invited 14 trade association members
to take part. They hoped that the Government could open up some
parking space for the benefit of the private bus operators. A representative
from the Express Bus Agencies Association said that the express bus
terminal at Beach Road was far too small, and therefore unable to
accommodate the requirements of passengers. Currently, the related
Ministry had installed surveillance cameras at the Golden Mile Complex express bus
stand to control the parking of buses there. The express bus drivers
had been fined heavily. One fine is $70, and with more of such fines,
the companies' costs will go up. Participants at the dialogue suggested
that the Government allocate an area in Geylang Lorong 1 near the
People's Association for an express bus terminal, to resolve the
overcrowding at the express bus stops and the fines for express
bus drivers. Manpower shortage, the lack of a place to operate,
increasing fines – these are all problems which concern three Ministries,
namely the Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Transport, and the
Ministry of National Development. The companies in question are
still waiting for an appropriate solution.</p>

described, local enterprises, particularly the SMEs, will face a
great deal of difficulties in the period of restructuring. If Singapore's
business costs continue to increase, it is more challenging for
the ultimate survival of SMEs, I fear that there will not only be
fewer people willing to become entrepreneurs, but that the number
of SMEs will also be reduced. If some trades vanish, workers would
also face structural unemployment, and this would create a new social
problem. From the businessman's viewpoint, whilst we hope to receive
Government assistance, we should also continually improve the business
model, raise productivity, treat workers well, and respect the contribution
of the employees.</p>

bosses nowadays are heavily burdened by these pressures as they
need to address high business costs, manpower shortage, and striking
a good balance with employing foreign workers. While the employers
try to cultivate their employees' sense of belonging, they should
try their best to restructure the business model to achieve productivity.
This is the responsibility of the bosses, and indeed not only to
their workers but to the community and the nation at large.</p>

of the last few decades, the successful restructuring of Singapore's
economy has always relied on the close cooperation of the tripartite
efforts among employees, employers and the Government. I sincerely
hope that as we pursue the objective of increasing our productivity,
and restructuring the labour force, we should stand united in the
true spirit of tripartism to meet these challenges head-on.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">The Senior Minister of State for Information,
Communications and the Arts and the Environment and Water Resources
(Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak
in support of this Budget. Many of us here are familiar with house
visits. We visit our constituents, from house to house, checking
on their state of affair. Very often, we are greeted by a woman
at the door. Typically, we greet each other and ask, "How are you?"
For most of them, we get the standard reply, "I am fine." "<em class="ph i">Ho
bo</em>?" "<em class="ph i">Ho</em>!" After conducting house visits for several
years, I have learnt not to take the reply for granted. I would
look for non-verbal clues from the resident. Does she look at ease?
Is she in good physical and mental health? Is her household reasonably
furnished and maintained?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cf04d9ee-7384-463f-b966-a21300c8cd60">
                  <a name="motion__id-cf04d9ee-7384-463f-b966-a21300c8cd60"><!--a--></a>After these few years
of doing house visits, there are several faces that had left a deep
imprint in my mind. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ba9ed2d7-abb3-4ee3-9bd1-1b59303ec3ef">
                  <a name="motion__id-ba9ed2d7-abb3-4ee3-9bd1-1b59303ec3ef"><!--a--></a>The first, a young woman,
not much older than a child herself, with a young child in tow.
With a maturity far exceeding her age, she tells you of her desire
to recover from her mistake in life choices made when she was younger.
Having dropped out of school prematurely, she can only take on low-skilled
jobs and, therefore, low-paying jobs. She is a tenant in the flat,
paying a substantial part of her income as rent, as her father was not
prepared to accommodate her. Her mother and siblings help from time
to time but she relies largely on her pride to take life one day
at a time. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1352</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-da225176-1652-4beb-8fcd-27adb97db258">
                  <a name="motion__id-da225176-1652-4beb-8fcd-27adb97db258"><!--a--></a>The second face belongs
to a woman in her 40s, timid and tentative. She tried to appear
strong in front of her visitors but her sense of insecurity and
unease was palpable. Her husband was retrenched recently and the
family financial situation has been affected. She has not worked
for many years. Her sister has been helping out but, determined
not to rely on her for much longer, she wants to support her two
daughters who are studying in the polytechnic and secondary school.
She is looking for a job that is near her home and allows her to
get back early in the evening to cook for her children. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-25767195-1c86-4970-8a4e-a2515fe075a8">

belongs to a woman in her 50s. She is single, staying with her mother.
Being the unmarried child, she assumes the caregiver role for her
elderly mother who needs regular medical care. Her mother is ageing
and increasingly unwilling to get out of the house for fear of falling.
She has to assume most of the household chores, cook for the two
of them, and accompany her mother to her medical appointments which
are getting more frequent and complex, with multiple specialists
in multiple hospitals. Her face showed her fatigue and her worry.
Her worry is not just one of short-term nature. Her worry is also
for herself 20 years from now − who will look after her like she
has done for her mother? With very little savings left for herself
after her late father's medical expenses and her mother's expenses,
she has very little left in her Medisave and her savings. Who will
pay for her medical and retirement needs when she needs them most?</p>

This Budget focuses on the need for an inclusive growth that leaves
no one behind. This Budget signifies the Government's seriousness
in following through the Prime Minister's vision for a better home
and an inclusive society for Singapore. This year's Budget will
help the women that I have just described. Allow me to explain.</p>

Budget made specific mention about helping companies attract local
workers and doing more to tap the latent pool of local manpower
which is still available, including the homemakers. The Minister
recognised that attracting these Singaporeans require a few changes.
Jobs will have to be re-designed with the worker in mind. These
jobs will also have to pay enough for the workers to join the company
and stay with the company. In addition, companies will need to put
in place more flexible working hours, shift system and work arrangements,
including working from home. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-83c93049-2762-4cd2-8b14-a8f50037f793">

to companies which do not now have the administrative capabilities
to manage a more complex HR and payroll function. The Budget recognises
these challenges. It has put forward SME Cash Grants and Productivity
and Innovation Credit as schemes to help companies restructure.
I hope that the schemes will be accessible to the SMEs and there
will be help from the Government agencies to improve the HR capabilities
across employers, across the entire system, including those in the
people sector.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-de106170-d797-4ee3-be22-febdb3448ca7">
                  <a name="motion__id-de106170-d797-4ee3-be22-febdb3448ca7"><!--a--></a>Single mothers will benefit
from these changes in particular. Since they have to shoulder both
work and family responsibilities on their own, many need a workplace
that provides flexible work arrangements while bringing home a regular
income. </p>

with young children, their children will need affordable childcare service.
Childcare support was enhanced in 2011 with the income ceiling raised
from $1,800 to $3,500 per month. This Budget will provide further
financial support for children from less well-off families. Baby
Bonus, however, remained inaccessible to single mothers. As I was
told by one single mother just last night, "Baby Bonus should be
for the education and healthcare of the baby, and not to reward
the parents for getting married". A child-centric policy will help
to level the starting point for her child. </p>

makes it more attractive for homemakers to return to work, their
concerns will be the need for a conducive care environment for their
children after school, and supporting their children's development
needs outside school. The best way to allay these fears and help
women return to work is to support the after-school care system
and to provide more opportunities for affordable enrichment programmes.
This Budget has proposed raising the income criteria for subsidies
and financial assistance for pre-school centres, MOE schools and
student care centres. While we encourage families to find employment
to improve their family income, families sometimes find their financial
assistance reduced as the mother returns to work. The move to raise
qualifying household income criteria will cushion the impact and
reduce the disincentive for the homemaker to return to work.</p>

continue to support social mobility. Some children require additional
help with their school work; some would like to excel in areas where
they have special talents, be it language, arts, sports, etc; and,
in one case, an opportunity to participate in an overseas project.
A resident of mine, young Mursyidah was selected to be part of her
school's Community Outreach Programme in Sabah for her leadership
qualities, demonstration of good values and effort towards environment
conservation. The total cost of the trip was $750. MOE's Internationalisation
Fund paid for $500, $200 could be withdrawn from Edusave account
and the student would pay $50 in cash. In Mursyidah's case, the school
tapped on the Opportunity Fund to pay for the trip, thus fulfilling
the dream of this young girl. </p>

a fair chance to reach their goals. The top-up to the Edusave Endowment Fund,
ComCare Endowment Fund and the disbursement to the self-help groups
and the CCC ComCare Fund will provide the financial resources needed
to enable the system, the parents, the community, the children,
as a whole to support our children. Self-help group CDAC, for example,
has been providing enrichment programmes in science, art and music
for the children from low-income families. Single mothers and their
children, in particular, will benefit from such community help. </p>

for the elderly, the Budget to enhance the healthcare sector and
additional subsidy for the healthcare of the elderly is welcomed
by many. The significant increase in subsidy for nursing homecare,

women have a longer life expectancy than men. At age of 65 years,

alone, as more remained unmarried, divorced or out-lived their spouses. The

package to support the elderly. It will benefit especially elderly
women who do not have a safety net to fall back on. The increased
healthcare subsidies and top-up to their Medisave accounts may not
completely remove their financial burden. But with the enhancement
in our social policies, such as a top-up to Medifund, it provides
them with some assurance that they will not be left in the lurch
when illness strikes. The GST Voucher comprising cash, Medisave

that the help will be permanently there and they can be assured
that the Government and the society will give them the necessary

mother would be pleased to know that she will get more financial support
for the childcare arrangement of her child, more training opportunities
and, therefore, better career options for herself. She will still
have to cope with high rental as housing options remain limited for
her. Baby Bonus continued to be inaccessible. The mother of two
teenage girls will have a better chance of getting a job that meets
her needs, more financial help in GST Voucher, and better financial and
social support for her family, including better education and more
opportunities for her children. The single older woman will be pleased
with the additional options of home-based care and domestic foreign
helper for her elderly mother so that she can continue working and
build up her retirement savings. She will also get additional financial
help in the form of Medisave Top-up and GST voucher for her mother

that while this Budget has introduced many changes – permanent GST Vouchers,
per capita income criteria, subsidy for home-based care, and so
on – some basic principles remained unchanged. This Budget put in
place a more robust framework to redistribute income so that the
lower income segments of the society benefit more. But it goes beyond
redistribution. It is about helping people to help themselves, achieving
self-reliance in the long run. Childcare for the single mom so that
she can work and training opportunities for better paid jobs over
time; improved employability and more flexible work arrangements
for the middle-aged mother and opportunities for her teenage children
to better their lives through education; support to care for her
elderly mother so that the older single woman can remain gainfully
employed with peace of mind. Give them a leg-up, so that they can get
back on their feet and be self-reliant again. </p>

the other important tenet of our social policies. It would be better
for the single mother to stay with her family and for the elderly
women to continue to be cared for at home with her other children
chipping in to support her. These basic tenets are important distinctions
between Singapore and other developed countries – that we, as families,
assume the primary responsibility of caring for ourselves; that
we retain a strong work ethic and desire to be self-reliant. Women
in Singapore believe in these principles. They take pride in themselves,
want to live independent lives, and take good care of their family.
They will be reassured knowing that the Government and the society
will provide support if and when they are unable to cope with life's
demands on their own. I believe this Budget will bring smiles to
their faces. With this, I support the Budget.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to be part
of this debate. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the Government is
softening its stance on welfarism and is taking the right steps
in strengthening our social safety nets. We may not be a welfare
state in the Western sense of the term, but we should certainly
be a state concerned with the welfare of the people, especially
those left behind when Singapore was transformed into a global city
in the past decade. I am also glad that the Government acknowledges
that our social compact cannot be left exposed to market forces.
In my speech today, I would like to raise three issues to help us
push ourselves further in the right direction. The three issues
are: one, empowering our social worker and other professionals in the
social service sector; two, reaching out to the vulnerable; three,
adopting a holistic approach to forging an inclusive society.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1355</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ed7359cc-9cba-4c48-890f-4b7da53a87af">
                  <a name="motion__id-ed7359cc-9cba-4c48-890f-4b7da53a87af"><!--a--></a>First point: empowering
our social workers and other professionals in social service sector.
Sir, to help the vulnerable, we need to empower those who are actually
holding up the social safety nets to catch them. Social workers
and other helping professionals, such as counsellors, are in the
frontline of forging the inclusive society and they have to be empowered
to do it. We have long treated social workers like fire-fighters
squelching bush fires and told them to thrive on the passion to
serve. We need to change our model. Passion is good and well, but
social workers need to be recognised as talents deserving fair compensation,
social respect, and optimal workloads.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-20d26d6f-c7a5-421e-9189-4c1d1e7272ad">
                  <a name="motion__id-20d26d6f-c7a5-421e-9189-4c1d1e7272ad"><!--a--></a>The starting salary of
helping professionals, particularly social workers, is not sending
the right message that social work is a vocation deserving of high
social respect. This will undermine the Government's announced efforts
to groom more social workers. According to the National Council
of Social Services, the expected starting salary of social workers
ranges from $2,550 to $2,750. In comparison, the starting salary
range of a degree-holding teacher begins above the social worker
starting salary range, at $2,770, and tops off at $3,250 for an
Honours degree. This is almost 20% above an Honours degree-holding
social worker's pay. Social workers are more like teachers in nature.
Social workers help the vulnerable pick up valuable life skills
and attitudes so that they can help realise their own potential
human capital. Hence, the wages of both social workers and teachers
should be comparable.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-84cfd58a-8d24-49e8-b7f8-75ed170474aa">
                  <a name="motion__id-84cfd58a-8d24-49e8-b7f8-75ed170474aa"><!--a--></a>I recognise that the Government
has been raising recommended social worker salaries and rolling out
professionalisation measures in the past few years. However, we
need to move faster and more decisively, just as the Government
did when the teaching vocation came under threat in the late 1990s. We
should make social worker compensation equivalent to teacher compensation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7857639c-bbd2-4a53-8040-39c06c8d2404">
                  <a name="motion__id-7857639c-bbd2-4a53-8040-39c06c8d2404"><!--a--></a>There is also a structural
issue here for the social services. Unlike the centralised education
system, the social services are made up of a large voluntary sector.
Social workers who work in the frontline voluntary welfare organisations
do not enjoy the leverage of Government salary compensation, only recommended
salaries. Faced with better pay and opportunities elsewhere, social
workers have to make a painful decision to leave the frontline and
more sadly their passions, for better jobs to serve their own family
needs. I would like to propose that our Government consider funding
a Connect Plan that teachers now enjoy to retain social workers.
As the Ministry of Education puts it, "dedication should never go poorly
rewarded".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4c3fdb81-b90a-44df-8c80-aaacc2ebd775">
                  <a name="motion__id-4c3fdb81-b90a-44df-8c80-aaacc2ebd775"><!--a--></a>It is good that the Government
aims to reduce the caseloads of social workers from 50 to 40. This
is not different from reducing class sizes for more effective teaching.
We should aim to reduce caseloads further, not only by grooming
more social workers, but also reviewing the workload of social workers. We
need to reduce spurious administrative work so that social workers
can focus on their main task of helping the vulnerable.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-275c62d8-1e6f-460c-851d-878758da119b">
                  <a name="motion__id-275c62d8-1e6f-460c-851d-878758da119b"><!--a--></a>Point two: reaching out
to the vulnerable. Sir, I am concerned with the high application
rejection rate for our ComCare programmes, which the Ministry of
Community Development, Youth and Sports kindly provided in answer
to my Parliamentary Questions a couple of weeks ago. The rejection
rate for the Work Support Programme has stayed above 40% in the
last five years, while the ComCare Transitions Scheme has seen figures
hovering around 30%. For the Work Support Programme, only about
a third of the rejected applicants were ineligible because they
had sufficient income or other resources. The rest were rejected
for other reasons, including not giving sufficient information for assessment,
could not be contacted, or not agreeing to the terms of assistance.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1356</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-01493683-ab6d-4fb7-9f31-bd4c83a78783">
                  <a name="motion__id-01493683-ab6d-4fb7-9f31-bd4c83a78783"><!--a--></a>The vulnerable are usually less educated,
less confident and, therefore, more introverted than average Singaporeans.
I have encountered constituents in need who have approached me during
MPS are often worried about the application process and I have to
write letters supporting them so that they can feel more confident
in approaching ComCare officers. We need to make them feel safer
about applying, less anxious that it would be a demeaning exercise,
where a rejection could be devastating to their already low confidence.
I propose that the Government considers reviewing the ComCare application
process to make it more applicant-centric.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4200e905-2084-4758-98b7-28939c1afebc">
                  <a name="motion__id-4200e905-2084-4758-98b7-28939c1afebc"><!--a--></a>We are a face-saving Asian
society after all and most of us would not admit to being needy
and asking for help unless there is a real felt need. Perhaps, it
may be better for CDC to err on the side of benevolence rather than
on the side of caution in our effort to build an inclusive society.
There is scope for improving on the rejection rate. We are glad
to see that the rejection rate for the Public Assistance Scheme
has dropped from about 40% from 2007-2009 to 18% in 2011. Let us
try to do the same for the other ComCare schemes.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-443d0534-f673-490d-9b13-d1b8b29fd699">
                  <a name="motion__id-443d0534-f673-490d-9b13-d1b8b29fd699"><!--a--></a>It is unfortunate that
only 6% of CDC investigative officers are social work trained, as
the officers have to make judgement-calls that require the aptitude
of trained social workers. Officers should at least be trained and
supervised by social workers to know how to evaluate the needs of
the vulnerable with compassion. We should give applicants the benefit
of the doubt when making the judgement on whether they are really
in need.</p>

approach. Sir, we are glad that the Government now shares with us
the desire to foster an inclusive and strong society. However, to
achieve this, we cannot just seek to tackle the challenges at the
symptomatic level. We must adopt a holistic approach. Families are
the foundation of a nation. Strengthening of the social safety net
is a reactive approach waiting to catch those who are falling, which
no doubt is necessary. We need to reduce the falling in the first
place. We should seek to eliminate vulnerability by building strong,
cohesive families. Building a strong family should be a coordinated
inter-Ministry effort to create family-centric housing and education
policies and a working environment conducive to quality family life.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-62908fde-777d-4ed9-8828-7f304a381d6e">
                  <a name="motion__id-62908fde-777d-4ed9-8828-7f304a381d6e"><!--a--></a>Our top-most concern should
be work-life balance. A recent survey by Ernst and Young shows that the
top motivation at the workplace for local employees is not compensation
but work-life balance. The average hours worked per week has remained
practically the same from 1990 to 2010, fluctuating between 46 and
47 hours. In South Korea, the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development) country with the longest working hours, due to
a concerted effort by the government to encourage more family time,
the work hours have declined in a decade from over 48 hours a week
to 42 hours a week in 2010. The average hours worked per week for
all OECD countries was 34 hours in 2010. The National Family Council
reported that 63% of fathers surveyed reported work responsibilities
as the biggest challenge to spending more time with their kids.
We are an anomaly among developed countries for working such long
hours. The current productivity drive should take this into account
and push for more productive shorter working hours rather than unproductive
long hours.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-51fb8124-7d69-4b60-91fb-ea9138e276c3">
                  <a name="motion__id-51fb8124-7d69-4b60-91fb-ea9138e276c3"><!--a--></a>Beyond work-life balance,
we should be thinking harder about work-life integration. Work and family
life do not necessarily have to be trade-offs pitted against each
other. Improved internet communications technology and the growth
of the knowledge and service economy means that flexible work arrangements
are now more possible than ever. This is something that our current
productivity drive can also look into encouraging.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-27eefebb-105a-401d-865c-49e698be9a7d"><!--a--></a>For families with older
children, we should encourage greater and deeper parental involvement
in the social life of schools. Current parental involvement in education
focuses on homework and so-called "enrichment" programmes that are
really disguised assessment and tuition lessons. This is not healthy. We
need to get parents involved in a deeper engagement with the social,
cultural and broad-based educational
life of the schools, rather than being narrowly focused on academic
achievement. Already, almost all mainstream schools have a parent
support group or parent-teacher association (PTA). But parents remain
adjunct to the education process and are often seen as the trouble-shooting
help for teachers. A PTA charter to further integrate parents and
empower parents and teachers to work together for holistic childhood
education and social development could be studied by both MCYS and
MOE and implemented.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-97e34695-8dcf-4505-a73b-a08c8c5b8309"><!--a--></a>Last but not least, we
need to figure the elderly centrally in the fostering of strong
families. The elderly are crucial social and cultural legacy levers,
so they need to be supported to spend time with the younger generation,
who need to inherit the intangible but invaluable social and cultural
wealth from the elderly in order to maintain our society's moral
compass. We must be careful that the silver housing policy does
not diminish the transmission of social and cultural values. Already,
the proportion of younger married couples who prefer to live with
or near their parents has dropped from 73% in 2003 to 53% in 2008,
in just five years. Given the recent spate of not-in-my-backyard
protests against eldercare housing or facilities in HDB neighbourhoods,
we need to do a mindset change in both Government policy and outreach
to make the elderly seen as positive contributors to neighbourhood
life rather than to be a social problem. A more consultative urban
planning process is called for, so that the HDB or other Government
agencies could encourage the goodwill of neighbourhood communities
towards the elderly and facilitate the integration of the elderly
in these communities. In conclusion, Sir, I believe that a more empowered
social service sector, a more effective outreach to the vulnerable
and a holistic approach towards more family-centric policies will
be able to steer Singapore towards a more inclusive society and
a stronger Singapore.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful for being allowed to join this debate.
Allow me to start by making a few comments about economy and I will
move on to healthcare finance. It seems that most places one looks
these days, governments are ringing the bells for austerity, believing
that the asceticism this brings to their fiscal conduct will somehow
save their beleaguered economies. Not unreasonably, many have questioned
the wisdom of such an approach, pointing out that such unbridled
belt tightening may have very huge social and economic costs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d8cab9e1-9e44-469c-a16c-1fcf7509273f">
                  <a name="motion__id-d8cab9e1-9e44-469c-a16c-1fcf7509273f"><!--a--></a>Because this Government
has acted prudently and decisively when it needed to, and because
we as a people have remained resolute and united when it mattered,
we are in the enviable position of not having to decide on what
benefits to cut or which services to curtail, but rather on how
best we can best increase these benefits and these services to our
people. I cannot think of any better guiding aim than those stated
as the premise for this year's Budget – to build an inclusive society,
and a stronger Singapore.</p>

this Budget, however, and I think we all know where the austerity
lies. I had a lot of feedback about this and I am sure other Members
also have the same. This is based on our future dependence on foreign
workers. There will certainly be pain in this but this is tough
love, and I fully support this Government's bold moves in addressing
this unhealthy reliance. Just to take analogy from my own work as
a doctor. I often warn my patients, healthy or otherwise, to avoid
over-reliance on crutches and braces and other walking assistive
devices when they do not need them. The initial period after they
leave these aids behind is difficult but with the proper guidance,
the patient recovers rapidly afterwards and grows from strength
to strength. Contrast this to the patient who clings on to these crutches and this
patient will surely, slowly deteriorate over time to the point at
which any form of mobility becomes excruciating. And so we must
act decisively to rehabilitate ourselves from this dependence on
foreign labour, while our social and economic muscles are still
healthy and able to.</p>

House have also mentioned that a large part of this adjustment will
involve us Singaporeans accepting that goods and services may, in
the future, become of less of cheap and good but more of fairly
priced and good. I am sure that we as a country will not deny paying
a fair wage to our fellow Singaporeans who are doing all the services
that are necessary to us, whether it is looking after our sick,
cooking our meals, bringing food to our tables or driving our buses. </p>

that will face our economy over the next few years. As a developed economy,
our economic expansion will slow to a more sedate pace. This will
temper inflation and hopefully this will also temper income inequality.
But it will also have the negative effects of reining in salaries,
payroll and also Government's spending in the future. Even as we
try to increase the salaries of those on the lower rungs of the
income ladder, and try to encourage more women and the elderly to remain
engaged and active in our workforce, the changing complexion of
today's economy will make these efforts ever more challenging. Jobs
are becoming more and more specialised, and employment parameters
are becoming more fragmented and more fluid. There might be fewer
opportunities for full-time employment as more jobs could become
part-time or contract-based. This will surely impact on how we structure
our lives and prepare for our old age. </p>

which is based mainly on manufacturing or service, the market capitalisation
of any given company correlated well with its size in terms of the
number you could employ. But this may no longer be the case. If
we look at a recent example, Facebook, which is poised to become
one of the world's largest companies in terms of market capitalisation,
but in terms of the employees that it can take in and the number
of jobs it creates, it will be pretty small by Fortune 500 standards.
So, in the new economy, we can expect that successful businesses
in general may not create as many jobs as businesses of the old
economy did, and headcounts are shrinking in the higher value segments.
In fact, in many companies, a sure-fire way of raising the stock
price is to trim the headcount. As payrolls shrink, employers will
look increasingly for not just competent but exceptional employees, and
this would be terrifying if they all shared Mark Zuckerberg's view,
co-founder of the afore-mentioned Facebook, that such an exceptional
employee would "not just be a little better than a good employee
but it will be someone who is 100 times better". We have to be mindful
of these changes as we prepare for the future.</p>

gloom and austerity for SMEs and I welcome, as many do, the beefed-up measures
to support businesses, particularly SMEs, to achieve productivity
growth. These are bold and substantive initiatives, and they must
be followed through, if are to achieve our stated aims of achieving a
30% increase in needed incomes over the next 10 years. This initiative,
I am sure, will help these businesses to cope better with business
cost and labour concerns, amidst an increasingly competitive business
environment. But what I also hope that this Government will continue
to do is to monitor what extent gains in productivity are translated
into real wage growth for the workers. One major dissatisfaction
with capitalism nowadays is the perception that when companies do
well, particularly when this has been achieved on the backs of improvements
in worker productivity, these gains have not been more equitably
distributed or shared amongst the employees. The assessment of businesses
which have received Government grants, in particular, should continue
to involve close scrutiny of how much their employees' salaries
have risen in relation to how well the company has done, and should
be an important criterion in approving further grants.</p>

efficiency wages are really and, in fact, paid-out where they are
due. There is another final cautionary note and that is to say that,
in mature economies, despite all our emphasis on productivity, the
relationship between productivity growth and wage growth becomes
a little bit less linear,
and it becomes a little bit less predictable. In today's new knowledge-based
economy, the focus is shifting increasingly to innovation as a driver
of growth. Innovation is what is increasingly carrying the premium,
rather than pure productivity gains alone. It is certainly far more
difficult to spur innovation rather than productivity. But this
challenge can be met, as small countries like Israel, for instance,
have shown to some degree, by earning itself the moniker of the
"Start-Up Nation".</p>

our economy for the future, these are clear and present challenges

about, and continues to invest and to support research and development
in all sectors of our economy. We need to continue building on this
Budget and further refine the clear and comprehensive roadmap that
we have on how we want our economy to develop over the next 10 and
15 years.</p>

now on a topic which many have already touched on, and that is the
defence of social mobility in our society. I think we all agree
that, above all else, social mobility should be defended at all
costs. Everyone should be able to feel that he or she should have
an opportunity to improve his or her lot; the loss of this expectation
is a cardinal sign of a society in despair and a nation in decline.
We are doing a tremendous amount to ensure that all Singaporeans
have access to education, housing, healthcare, employment, and this
Budget continues this theme. But, certainly, we can and we all agree
that we will do even more. We must fight against the perception
that there are too many barriers at various stages of individual
development, both in schools and in the workplace. We must fight
against social stratification. It is a setback that the phenomenon
of working from the mailroom to the boardroom is becoming less and
less a phenomenon but I suppose that comes with maturing of the
economy.</p>

and moves by the Ministry of Education to relook at the school admission
process, particularly for primary schools, and also by the Faculty
of Law which has said that it would review its admission process
to encourage greater diversity while still adhering to the principles of
meritocracy. Social mobility is well and good, and we do well to
trumpet it but, finally, I would say that even though this is a
good Budget and it has done a lot to support the vulnerable segments
of our society, we may need to relook, sooner rather than later,
at the most vulnerable segments of our population. By this, I mean
those who are on the Public Assistance (PA) Scheme. Despite what
we do, we will have a segment of the population who desperately
needs help and, given that inflation and cost of living is going
up, the amount of quantum given to this group of residents or citizens,
who by definition are unable to work, should be reviewed.</p>

and Medifund are most useful for major illnesses and hospitalisation
expenses. However, they do have their limitations when it comes
to outpatient treatment. The Ministry of Health has, in recent months,
unveiled sweeping and welcome changes in outpatient and intermediate

in this Budget. </p>

chronic illnesses in specialist outpatient clinics remains relatively unsupported,
and long-term follow-up by paediatric, cardiology and cancer specialists
presents a significant financial burden to many patients. This problem,
indeed, has become a very heavy burden to many families. I believe
that the problem should be addressed by a two-prong approach. The
first is to develop the primary care sector so that, as far as possible,
chronic conditions may be managed by our GPs and polyclinics rather than by specialists,
and this would also reduce the load at our hospitals. The second
is to develop an insurance-based or managed care system for specialist
outpatient care, and this may be an extension of existing insurance
schemes.</p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Back to English,
Sir. My final point pertains to a complex issue. Again, several
hon Members have already brought this up. This pertains to the level
and quality of healthcare that is extended to Singaporeans and,
in particular, to our seniors, and this is a very pressing issue.
If you visit us in Queenstown, you actually get an idea of how Singapore's
population will look like in 2030, when about one in five of us
will be above 65 years of age and the question here is not just
about how long we live or whether we are free of illness, but also
how well we live, and I wish to put on record here a comment and
again another request from some of my residents that they wish me
to put on record their thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister and his
team and the Government to, and I quote, "to help the growing number
of older Singaporeans live comfortably".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0cbb48c0-4d73-4ba5-a8b6-b04e67cae336">
                  <a name="motion__id-0cbb48c0-4d73-4ba5-a8b6-b04e67cae336"><!--a--></a>Medical progress can sometimes
be breathtaking and the quality of healthcare does not always mean that
it is correlated to how much we spend. The hon Member Mr Liang Eng
Hwa and a few other Members have debated a bit on healthcare spending.
We do welcome the announcement that healthcare spending will increase
gradually over the years to $8 billion. This is a welcome move.
But on the back of this, we as a country and a society will have
to decide what level of healthcare and to what extent healthcare
would be considered humane and acceptable to everyone in the population.
We are not just talking about basic healthcare in our country, and
when we are comparing affordability across different healthcare
systems, it is very important for us not just to look at costs and
coverage at base value but to really scrutinise the type of healthcare
and the quality of the healthcare that is delivered.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f32d211b-164f-4b51-9cee-176db8a59303">
                  <a name="motion__id-f32d211b-164f-4b51-9cee-176db8a59303"><!--a--></a> When we talk about medical
progress, there are many choices that have to be made. Let us say
you have a pill that is able to treat hypertension and is as effective
as another pill, but you only have to take this pill once a day
or maybe even once a month, whereas the other pill you have to take
four times a day. Now, the first pill, which is more convenient,
costs four to five times that of the other pill. The question then
remains who has to pay for this increase in cost. Is it up to society
and the taxpayers, or should the patient himself have to pay?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4d82aaa2-279e-4770-98c3-0868cd1f911c">
                  <a name="motion__id-4d82aaa2-279e-4770-98c3-0868cd1f911c"><!--a--></a> Then there are other
treatments. In my line of work, an elderly lady would come and see
a doctor, let us say, with some arthritis in the knees and this
lady wants to go dancing or she wants to go to the market by herself
without using a walking stick. Twenty years ago, when I was a medical
student, the correct answer would be to restrict her activities,
make do with a walking stick and just stay at home and knit or watch
the TV. Nowadays, that is still a viable proposition but our elders
want to stay more active. Many of them may opt for a knee replacement
which is, of course, a far more expensive proposition.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-72b0d73b-4cc4-478e-bee0-bb4440180471">
                  <a name="motion__id-72b0d73b-4cc4-478e-bee0-bb4440180471"><!--a--></a> These are not life-threatening
illnesses but they hark back to the root of what we feel is quality healthcare
and the quality of the way in which we grow old. These are difficult
questions that we have to answer and we have not even touched on
end-of-life issues which are even more emotive and require a lot
more deliberation on our part. But certainly, we, as a society,
will have to over the years come to an agreement on what all of
these things mean to us and how much value we place on all these
things. We certainly have to consider all these in terms of their
costs and benefits. And these deliberations should be tempered by
a very, very large dose of humanity.</p>

this to be a Budget that builds on the strong foundations laid by
previous Budgets and supports many of the issues raised during the
Debate last year on the President's Address to this House. It is,
indeed, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said, about "opportunity,
improving ourselves, compassion". It is a pro-Singaporean and it
is a pro-Singapore Budget. With this, I support the Budget.</p>

package is targeted at the elderly, those with disabilities and
low-income families. This is in line with the egalitarian ideals
prescribed in the Confucian Classic Book of Rites ("<em class="ph i">Li Ji</em>"),

applaud the move to raise the CPF contribution rates of older workers,
and provision of a Special Employment Credit to encourage employers
to employ older workers. These measures took care of older workers
and, at the same time, encouraged employers to employ older workers.
In addition, earned income tax relief for the elderly has also doubled.
I hope that in the near future, the concept of a "retirement age"
will eventually disappear from Singapore's labour market. Employers
will then judge workers based on their ability and not their age.
In this way, Singaporeans who wish to remain in their jobs can continue
to work as long as they are able to. However, even then, the CPF
Board should avoid extending the CPF withdrawal age further. After
all, repeated changes may disrupt the retirement plans of CPF members.</p>

will provide an additional option for the elderly to monetise their
HDB flats for retirement, as those who downgrade to 3-room or smaller

have more money for retirement.</p>

implement a series of caring schemes to enhance affordability of healthcare.
These include increasing the budget for healthcare in the next five
years, from $4 billion annually to $8 billion; increasing hospital
beds to 3,700 and doubling the capacity for long-term care; increasing
healthcare subsidies; providing a monthly grant of $120 for families
employing foreign domestic workers to take care of their elderly
family members; providing households who install safety features
at home for their elderly, with a grant of around $2,000; and waiving
the GST for long-term care. With the adjustments in subsidies for
long-term care, for families within the same income group, the subsidies
for home-based care and community-based care will be higher than
subsidies for nursing homes. These measures will help tremendously
in encouraging families to allow their elderly family members to
age in place.</p>

from the measures is the Ong family in my constituency. They live

while their mother of the same age is immobile. Both their sons
are single and their income is not high, totaling to $2,500. The
couple has a daughter who is staying home after having undergone
a surgery recently. A domestic helper is helping her to take care

email to me previously, requested that I suggest to the Government
to waive the GST for long-term care. Before his mother passed away,
the cost of long-term care and medical treatment for her was a huge
expense, and a heavy financial burden on the family. The GST on
long-term care is
a double whammy. In future, this new measure will benefit many families.
I hope that healthcare institutions providing long-term care will
co-operate and not seize the opportunity to raise charges.</p>

"ageing before becoming rich", the Hong Kong population is also

that they can age gracefully in their retirement years. As mentioned
above, the Government measures have taken into consideration the
various needs of the elderly, and have provided companies and families
with more subsidies. Whether it is with regard to allowing the elderly

crave most for certainty of property prices and medical costs.</p>

a HDB flat will be their only property asset and home. To see the
rate at which HDB flat prices are rising strikes panic into the
hearts of many young and upgrading families. Certainly, the cooling
measures in recent months by the Ministry of National Development
have helped to ease their anxiety. However, many voiced concerns
that they may not be able to keep up with the mortgage payments
should one or more breadwinners lose their jobs in the uncertain
globalised market. Currently, the BTO prices are set at about five
years of newlywed first timers' annual income. This is not an unreasonable
price range but I would like to appeal for the Government to consider
building more affordable basic flats and 2-room and 3-room flats
with shorter leases, such as 30 years and 60 years, to offer more
options for singles and smaller families from lower income and even
middle income groups. Such options will enable them to better manage
and control costs for themselves. Having more basic flats without
the bells and whistles would encourage more Singaporeans to spend
within their means and set aside more cash and CPF savings for their
retirement instead having a higher portion of it locked into their
property.</p>

among the younger couples to buy the biggest flat beyond what they
can afford worrying. It is far better to buy one well within their
means and upgrade when they have more savings later. Even with our
economy so healthy and at almost full employment, 2,090 residents
were retrenched in the second and third quarters of 2011. Of these,
1,290 were PMETs.</p>

small flats, especially in mature estates, will enable the elderly
to live near their children and promote family bonding. There is
a small group of low-income Singaporeans who do not have any property
asset at all. They are either still waiting for HDB rental flats
or are renting from the open market as they have missed the qualifying
criteria. They are struggling with the higher rentals and I hope
the Government would look into measures to assist them. Generally,
the higher cost of living – higher utility bills, as a result of
oil price rises, transport costs and food costs – is pushing them
into financial hardship and debts. It is more and more of a struggle
for them to make ends meet. </p>

who want better control over rising property prices, many business
owners are also in difficulty with rising property rentals. In view
of the many additional costs that our SMEs have to bear, due to
the recent policy changes for foreign workers, would the Government
consider stabilising the rentals of commercial and industrial properties
through JTC and HDB? In my view, JTC and HDB should be playing this
primary role in maintaining affordable rental in these properties
so as to support and nurture our SMEs.</p>

can cause hardship to a family is medical cost. It does not take
a major illness to cause hardship. A few illnesses in the family
may easily knock a family's budgeting off course. In addition, not
all are covered by insurance, including MediShield, and even those who
are or may have particular diseases and afflictions which are not
covered by the policy they have signed up for. Presently, we have
managed medical costs through our polyclinics and Government hospitals.
However, many residents tell me that queues and the wait can be
long. Although the implementation of the Community Health Assist
Scheme will help to alleviate the situation, I hope the Ministry
will consider taking further action to increase the recruitment
and retention of medical professionals and personnel in the public
sector.</p>

would like to speak on jobs for Singaporeans. SMEs understand that
we have to reduce our dependency on foreign workers. They understand
that they have to increase productivity. In fact, foreign workers
from Malaysia and China are beginning to choose to not come to Singapore
as they have opportunities in their home countries. However, many
companies are still at a loss as to where they should get help to
recruit local workers and to increase productivity. The other area
to improve upon is the execution and the delivery of the many schemes
to help SMEs. They know that there are many schemes available but
find it confusing to navigate and apply for. We should standardise
and simplify the process to assist them.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b99ea2d1-01f7-43fc-9855-25ef6eea05dc">
                  <a name="motion__id-b99ea2d1-01f7-43fc-9855-25ef6eea05dc"><!--a--></a>On one hand, it is a happy
problem – full employment, lots of job orders but shortage of workers.
On this situation, new business opportunities arise, for example,
they are centralising dishwashing services. For coffee shops and
hotels who cannot find workers to wash their utensils and crockery,
they now have a solution. When bigger companies cannot find the
labour to execute their projects, they outsource to smaller companies.
We benefit from the new business opportunities. On the other hand,
they can really do with some help with recruitment. Would the Government
consider setting up a centralised agency to help companies with
labour shortage to match-make with those local workers? Yes, there
is a job directory on WDA's website which listed both public and
private sector job portals. However, this is only accessible to
the educated and computer-savvy. Many workers do not have the ability
or skill to take advantage of and utilise this facility. It would
be desirable if we have a bricks-and-mortar department with staff
to assist Singaporean workers match up with the local companies
with labour shortage. Such an arrangement would be particularly
beneficial for workers in lowest wage groups, including cleaners. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8d8d33e5-7403-4c38-a429-e33475dde051">
                  <a name="motion__id-8d8d33e5-7403-4c38-a429-e33475dde051"><!--a--></a>I was appalled to find
out from a <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> report on Sunday that only 27 public
sector agencies make accreditation a criterion when they select
cleaning companies. Considering that we have 14 Ministries, 65 Statutory
Boards and nine Organs of State, the public sector has the potential
to make a real impact to bring up the cleaning sector and set higher
standards for productivity – standards of delivery and treatment
of workers. I strongly urge the Government to take a resolute step
to make accreditation mandatory – only cleaning companies which
have accreditation are to be used. The Government must look into
and monitor the work conditions and treatment of the workers very
closely. Even better, all cleaning workers should be unionised.
I suppose the union would like it. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-28606e59-6cea-4c0c-a987-c91f466fabbb">
                  <a name="motion__id-28606e59-6cea-4c0c-a987-c91f466fabbb"><!--a--></a>It is highly regrettable
that, in recent years, due to outsourcing, the same cleaner is subject
to lower and lower wages and benefits and contract progress due
to stiff competition among cleaning companies. In the past, cleaners
in the public sector were considered part of the Government service
and enjoyed the accompanying employment benefits. This illustrates
that outsourcing is not quite the panacea to higher specialisation
and efficiency. In addition, there are externalities, the side effects
from outsourcing which are not borne by the supplier nor the consumer.
They are borne by the very worker who delivered the service. Every
dollar saved is at their expense, the weakest and the most vulnerable
member of our society, trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty.
That is not right. It is time for us to make the necessary changes to restore
the balance, ensure fair treatment and decent pay for decent work.
With that, I support the Budget.</p>

(Nee Soon)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing
me to speak during this debate. Essentially, I feel that Budget
2012 is a continuation of our national psyche of instilling attributes
of inclusiveness, hard work, resilience, skills upgrading and saving
for the long run as part of the Singapore spirit that will bring
our nation's ability to adapt and respond to future challenges and
opportunities. Much has been debated about the Budget by other Members
of the House. Kindly allow me to add my perspective to this debate.
Firstly, in Malay.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8447a294-8cd4-4f42-931b-8bf26f011e37">

Parliament, I have seen how our Government have put forward a series
of progressive and inclusive Budgets catering to the various segments
of Singaporeans.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9172cca1-4ca1-4743-8ddb-e5ffcab0d432">
                  <a name="motion__id-9172cca1-4ca1-4743-8ddb-e5ffcab0d432"><!--a--></a>Therefore, I am puzzled
by the statements of Members of the Workers' Party like the hon
Mr Chen Show Mao and Mr Faisal Manap, who questioned this issue
of inclusiveness. Coincidentally, I have made a detailed study on
this issue while preparing this speech. If we study the previous
Budgets closely, we will discover that there are many elements of
inclusiveness in them. And if we google the words "inclusive" and
"Singapore Government", we will find many results, that is, around
30 million results. So the answer is clear and obvious.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-37f66464-dd74-4d3d-8bca-2d13075d2eab">
                  <a name="motion__id-37f66464-dd74-4d3d-8bca-2d13075d2eab"><!--a--></a>These Budgets have been
forward-looking, with the sole intent of laying the groundwork for Singaporeans
to compete, meet the challenges and reap the opportunities of the
ever-changing and evolving economic landscape. The Budgets, through
the years, have been instrumental in improving the overall competitiveness
and resilience of the people. This ensures that no Singaporean is
left behind. </p>

ensures that all Singaporeans, regardless of race and religion,
young and old, and all backgrounds, benefit from the Budget. With
the Government attuned to the different segments that have different
needs, I am glad that this year's Budget, like the ones in the past,
will open up more room for us to receive benefits from the various
schemes for people from all backgrounds, including our Malay community.</p>

Budget's mission includes those who are still in school, looking
for jobs or upgrading themselves, and the elderly to continue working.
It is based on the concept of taking a positive view so that the
quality of life of Singaporeans and their families is comfortable.</p>

it provides the opportunities for the Malays to realise their desires
and dreams to improve themselves to a higher level so that they
have a better future. The schemes presented in this Budget, especially
the Special Employment Credit scheme, together with the Elderly
&amp; Disability Grants, support older and disabled Singaporeans.
Apart from providing opportunities for this segment of the population,
this Budget provides a long term commitment as well as builds an
inclusive society. </p>

Credit scheme application over the next five years, in particular,
will encourage companies to manage costs and engage older Singaporean
workers. For these workers, it will provide them an opportunity
to build their retirement nest and stay employed. These initiatives,
together with other measures like the available training programmes,
will provide more opportunities for Singaporeans to work and rise
up in their career. </p>

despite the successes of Malay students and increasing efforts of
the community to ensure every child receives quality education,
this Budget would further ensure that students would not be left

pre-school subsidy, review of the MOE Financial Assistance Schemes

I would give an example of a company called Camel Nuts. This is
an example of how they have increased productivity through innovation,
technology and mindset development. Sir, I have received feedback
that the Government should do more to help the SMEs to increase
their productivity as many companies felt that the tightening of
foreign worker quotas would open up more difficulties for businesses
at a time of global economic uncertainty. With careful planning,
dynamic companies would be well-placed to ride the wave of productivity.
Otherwise, they may find themselves gradually being left behind
in a re-structured economy of higher-value and more innovative players. Ignoring
productivity enhancements would be to our own peril. I would like
to share with the House on how a local company, Seng Hua Hng Foodstuff
Pte Ltd, famously known as Camel Nuts, has adapted as an SME to
meet the challenges of the New Economy. </p>

Singaporean company which has used SPRING Singapore's Integrated Management

areas for improvement and productivity gains and has since adopted
the Lean Six Sigma into its factory layout and processes to successfully
improve productivity. In addition, the company has also leveraged
on grants from SPRING
Singapore to invest in machines and equipment to progressively automate
their processes and reduce their reliance on foreign workers and
cater for long-term growth planning.</p>

by Eliyahu M Goldratt to develop their mindset and introduced them
to the Theory of Constraints – I have the book here – and the commonsense
approach in finding productivity gains in the workplace. In his
own words, Mr Poh said, "Just by using a commonsense approach and
overcoming the constraint in our mind that things cannot be improved,
we are able to increase productivity and do more with less." </p>

Nuts, a well-known Singapore brand, is an example of how an SME embraces
the new business landscape and provides employability for its workers
by upgrading themselves and changing their mindsets to increase
productivity. It remains committed to its workers through innovation
and R&amp;D. It hires the elderly, the disabled and manages and
provides opportunities to the low-income to upgrade their skills,
stay relevant and committed to the company's values and purpose.
I feel that the approach taken by Camel Nuts and the principles
discussed in Mr Goldratt's book have been and can be aptly applied
to Singapore and our businesses, always making improvements despite
our constraints. This will ensure that we continuously improve and
grow as an individual, family, organisation and as a nation.</p>

we are anticipating the impending "silver tsunami" impact of our
ageing society. Many appropriate measures have been introduced in
this year's Budget. I feel that the Government could also propose
incentives for the elderly who lead active lifestyles through the
creation of a reward scheme for them to attend health talks and
screenings, participate in health-related events where they can
accumulate points to redeem for vouchers or cash benefits. This
would motivate the elderly to earn investments to their health.
Although there are localised reward schemes to promote certain programmes,
such as the Northwest CDC Brisk Walk Club, I feel that a more broad-based
reward scheme that promotes healthy lifestyle activities can be
implemented to further enhance our health promotion efforts. The
Government should also consider measures to support and incentivise
innovation in providing health support services using technology.
Recently, <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> reported about telemedicine.
We should also encourage initiatives in the medical sector to support
the elderly living at home in e-ordering medicines, e-visiting GPs,
managing dietary needs and personal health.</p>

as mentioned in my speech in Malay, I am puzzled by what was said
by the hon. Members of the Workers' Party, Mr Chen Show Mao and
Mr Faisal Manap, calling for inclusiveness. Sir, I happened to be
doing some research when I was writing this speech about the issue of
inclusiveness. I looked through all the past Budget debates and
I happened to find the efforts and policies relating to inclusiveness.
I found the level of depth given by the Government in ensuring that no
one is left behind. After hearing the speeches, I went to Google
the words "inclusive" and "Singapore Government", and I got about
more than 13 million results coming from it. </p>

Budget resembles the Singapore Way of being a forward-looking Government
that continues to demonstrate its ability to deliver good governance
so that its people can realise their aspirations and goals. It reflects
our values and approach of managing challenges and opportunities,
that we take no short cuts, no populist moves but it is all about
taking a longer perspective with Singaporeans being at the heart
of it all. Sir, on that note, I support the Budget.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr
Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Deputy
Speaker, Sir, I welcome the noticeable shift from previous Budgets,
which concentrated mostly on economic growth, towards more social
programmes in this Budget. Over the last decade, our society faced
many challenges, such as widening income inequality, rising inflation
and slower social mobility. Wages of low and lower middle income
earners have stagnated or grew much slower than that of our highest
income earners. Our over reliance on market-driven policies has
resulted in deficiencies in the provision of social goods. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b15ab776-f504-4918-92af-e16e1c4423ef">
                  <a name="motion__id-b15ab776-f504-4918-92af-e16e1c4423ef"><!--a--></a>Refocusing on the weak,
disabled and elderly amongst us is timely. The Government has to
step up to mitigate the adverse effects of the widening income inequality
by proactively providing essential social goods and services. This
Budget is a first step. Moving forward, we need to tread between
growth and equity; between individual's and society's responsibility.
How far will we go in our journey to be inclusive? How much do we
provide for in elderly care and medical costs? What is affordable
public housing? What levels of social security are we comfortable
with? These questions must be debated upon as our nation defines
a new socio-economic model going forward. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-23bffaed-35e3-40c7-a20c-beb7d0523515">
                  <a name="motion__id-23bffaed-35e3-40c7-a20c-beb7d0523515"><!--a--></a>Next, I would like to
touch on Small and Medium Enterprises, a subject that is close to
my heart as I operate in this space. There are a number of assistance
schemes in this Budget for SMEs. We have not been short of schemes
for SMEs in the past, especially in the form of grants. While these
can provide some slight help, given the challenging environment
SMEs operate in, they are like aspirins for short-term pain relief.
We need to look deeper beyond assistances and tackle directly the
important issues confronting SMEs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cf4afe57-352e-4c6d-9560-369c45791a47">
                  <a name="motion__id-cf4afe57-352e-4c6d-9560-369c45791a47"><!--a--></a>In preparing for this
section on SMEs, I recall a hike I made into the primary rainforest
of Sarawak some years ago. Walking into the rainforest on a hot
day, I noticed dim lighting and a distinct lack of undergrowth.
With sunlight blocked by the canopy of the giant trees, smaller
plants could not flourish. SMEs operate in challenging environments.
Industrial rent increased at more than three times inflation rate
at 16% last year. This increase is the highest level in the past
14 years. Retail rent rates have risen steadily too. Industrial
and retail spaces are now dominated by REITS. I join Members Inderjit
Singh and Mr Teo Siong Seng to echo my concerns about the effects
of a decade of the proliferation of REITS on rent. Could retail
rent increases be partly driven by Retail REITS enhancing their
negotiation position given common market practice that they can
obtain the retailer's gross retail turnover data? I urge serious review
on the effects of REITS on SMEs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5e283909-2a50-40de-a3a0-1bbf3cbe120c">
                  <a name="motion__id-5e283909-2a50-40de-a3a0-1bbf3cbe120c"><!--a--></a>Going forward, SMEs will
find it harder and more costly to hire suitable manpower. In certain industries,
there will be continued competition from the big boys. The Budget
provides for assistance in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As).
Some SMEs may be forced to close or merge. SMEs form 99% of our
business entities and employ some 63% of our workforce. Jobs will
be at risk as a result of closures and mergers. We need to brace
ourselves for a rough ride in the SME space in the next five years
as the economy restructures. We need to be prepared to help those
whose jobs will be lost during this period of restructuring.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-32d209c4-9dc0-46a6-8c0f-0d155b344ed1">

thing to fly the Singapore enterprise flag globally. How do we achieve
that? Going back to the rainforest analogy, how do we get smaller
plants to grow? They need air, water, good soil and sunlight. The
seeds themselves must also be of good quality. Companies need a
positive business climate, which can be promoted by good Government
policies, just as plants need air and water for sustainability.
We do have fairly positive policies that allow companies to get
started quickly and favourable tax structures. We need to constantly
look ahead to ensure our environment stays small-business-friendly.</p>

grow in. We may not have a large domestic market, but we do have
a domestic market that can support our SMEs. It would help if the
Government can make the soil richer by stimulating domestic consumption
from time to time as necessary. The seed represents the soundness
of each company's business ideas as well as the talents it has.
Good programmes to cultivate our young to be more innovative and
entrepreneurial can help seed improvements for our future SMEs.</p>

just as plants need space for sunlight to come through in the rainforest.
I noticed that in the rainforest, where there were patches that
the giant trees were absent for whatever reasons, there were thriving
smaller plants. The space vacated by the giants had allowed smaller
plants to flourish. I had spoken previously on this. I will agree
to disagree with some Members of this House as to whether there
is crowding out by large trees, the industry giants. Beyond arguing
about crowding out by large companies, I would like our Government
to create fresh spaces for SMEs to grow. It can do so by being a
significant player in the economy to drive the creation of innovative
SME-led solutions in certain key sectors.</p>

more. </p>

may be risk aversion by Government officers to buy solutions from
SMEs for fear of having to answer for failures, even if SMEs can
meet the specifications and offer lower prices than larger companies.
We need to prevent this mindset. One possibility is to have smaller
tenders that only SMEs can participate in. If there are no SMEs
who can fulfil the requirements, then the tenders can be opened
to the larger industry players.</p>

areas where there is substantial Government demand and a strategic
reason for us to have our home-grown innovative solutions. A positive
example that comes to my mind is in water technology. We could have
imported all the technologies we require but it was good that we
also chose to go with some local players to allow them to grow and
compete in similar projects internationally. We need more of such
successes. </p>

projects ongoing now. We can use this opportunity to aggressively push

enhancements. </p>

requiring the public sector to favour green procurements. This can
favour the development of our local suppliers to meet green standards
that will allow them to compete for projects in countries that have
already implemented such policies. Green procurement policies are currently
gaining traction in places such as Taiwan, Thailand, Canada, Japan
and Korea. We can even dovetail this initiative with that of the
Renovation and Refurbishment Deduction Scheme by having better tax
deductions for retail and food and beverage (F&amp;B) outlets that
adopt renovations that are eco-friendly. </p>

to learn that a local SME, Greenpac (S) Pte Ltd, had developed an environmentally-friendly

I took a walk outside this House recently and noted the inscription
on the statue of Sir Stamford Raffles by the Singapore River, which

inscription, "On this historic site, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles
first landed in Singapore on 28th January 1819 and with genius and
perception changed the destiny of Singapore from an obscure fishing
village to a great seaport and modern metropolis." </p>

a new phase of our development. The world has moved into a new century. There
is a great need in this 21st century to have our people to be ingenious
and perceptive to spot gems of opportunities caused by constant
upheavals. There will be plenty of this, caused by constant technological
changes, political changes and shifts in economic power. We live
in an exciting world. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, became
the world's youngest self-made billionaire at just 23 years old,
four years after starting his business in the dormitory of his university.
Such opportunity and speed are only possible today with constant
technological changes that have broken down old barriers and level

quantum leaps in productivity improvements.</p>

21 years ago, her skin peeled daily and looked like fish scales,
thus she was called the girl with scaly skin. She had to take medicines
and injections everyday, with monthly medical expenses that can
go up to thousands of dollars. She also had arthritis. When her
story appeared in Shin Min
Daily then, the public donated generously to her and, upon receiving
sufficient donations, her parents said they had enough and even
donated the extra funds to the Chinese Development Assistance Council.
The couple decided to bring up Baoping against all odds and had
never complained about their plight.</p>

of Baoping when she was eight months old and during that time, as
there was medical subsidy, she received special treatment in the
hospital and could afford the medical expenses. As she grew up gradually,
we can see her skin peeled and shed daily. Under such circumstances,
she grew older and was eventually able to attend PCF Kindergarten
like any normal child. </p>

went to Primary school and Secondary school. But she suffers pain
whenever she walks due to her arthritis, thus everyday her father
would send her to the bus stop on a bicycle, then she takes a bus
to school, and, after school, her mother would fetch her from the
bus stop on a bicycle. After secondary school, she attended ITE
Simei and learnt a skill. Now, she can work from home on a computer.
But she has to face the realities of life. Her struggles are lifelong. </p>

Baoping comes from a low-income family. And over the last 20 over
years, because of our inclusive society, she received much help
on her medical treatments and also benefited from the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme so that she need not worry about expenses, such
as textbooks, school fees and uniforms. And now, she finally enters
a new phase in life. She is a working adult. Thus, it is commendable
that the Finance Minister, in presenting the Budget this year, has increased
the income ceiling for MOE Financial Assistance Scheme to allow
80,000 families, up from 40,000, to benefit from the Scheme. </p>

Statement, Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam played a motivational
video about how Singaporeans strive for the best. The video featured
several Singaporeans, some from low-income families, some are older
workers, and others have disabled family members. But these people
were full of confidence and were motivated to work hard and do good.
Meanwhile, they benefited from the Government's various assistance
schemes for the poor and needy. Amongst them, the most touching
story was Madam Wu Qiaozhen. When she finally witnessed her husband
stand up on his feet after receiving physiotherapy, she said, "I
often told my daughter, there is compassion in this society." </p>

society. This inclusive society will eventually help those who are crippled
to stand on their feet, allow older workers to regain confidence

And it is in this prospect can we build a stronger and more inclusive society. </p>

two days ago, I attended a dialogue on the Budget. Unlike previous
years, people no longer talk about who gets a bigger red packet,
but rather they want to understand from various aspects how the
Government will help these three groups of Singaporeans – the low-income
families, older Singaporeans and families with disabled members.
They supported the Budget but they also had some questions. Why
do we need to provide $1.1 billion for public transport operators
to buy new buses? How does the Government ensure that bus services
would improve and fares would not increase? And I, too, would like
to ask the Finance Minister whether the Government would ensure
that the bus companies would increase drivers' wages, otherwise
how are they going to employ another 1,000 bus drivers? If we cannot
find more Singaporeans to become bus drivers, we would have to employ
over 1,000 foreign drivers. Of course, we need some foreign drivers
in the team, but we need to ensure that Singaporean drivers can
have higher wages. </p>

Government for increasing their CPF contribution rate, so that they
will have higher savings. As for the self-employed, such as taxi
drivers, they would like to thank the Finance Minister for increasing
their training subsidy. </p>

a point – some Singaporeans, particularly the Budget's targeted
beneficiaries, are unclear or even ignorant about how the new policies
will benefit them. We should think hard and come up with practical
ways of communicating the message to them. For example, the Primary
Care Partnership Scheme implemented last year is a good policy.
But many people did not know about this scheme, neither did they
apply for it or enjoy its benefits. The scheme is now renamed "Community Health
Assistance Scheme". </p>

Lee mentioned this scheme during a dialogue in our constituency
and found out that not many people knew about this scheme and its
details. As a Chinese saying goes, "good news are often kept within
the walls but bad news spreads quickly and widely". So, I hope the Government
would be able to spread the good news far and about and be bold
in sharing the bad news directly. The Government can be wordy and
detailed in their internal documents, but for the key messages to
the people, particularly the benefits for the low-income earners,
older Singaporeans and the disabled, they should be "short and sweet
and easy to understand".</p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Mr Deputy Speaker,
Sir, I would first like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, for an enlightened Budget Speech
delivered on 17 February 2012. I am pleased that with this Budget,
which provides a number of benefits for the elderly as well as the
middle and lower income groups, will help many Singaporeans. It
is only right and fair for the Government to remain prudent in using
taxpayer dollars – in kind and social benefits – so as to deliver
the desired social compact for citizens. Representing my constituents
in the Chua Chu Kang GRC, I am glad to be given this opportunity
to give my perspectives on Budget 2012.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d7d77cf4-10ee-4d61-a8ad-fb508b14d910">
                  <a name="motion__id-d7d77cf4-10ee-4d61-a8ad-fb508b14d910"><!--a--></a>Overall, I think that
the Budget 2012 is a balanced Budget – aiming to address some of
the basic needs of the day, for example, rising costs of inflation,
the increasing needs of the elderly as well as for the long-term
interests of our country. By doing so, we can give our people that
sense of security that the Government cares for our longer term
well-being and cultivates a balanced society – and not just one that
is focused on GDP growth. Many are therefore heartened that there
has been some re-think of our policies to allow for more active
intervention to alleviate the stresses of those in the lower rungs
of society.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5aa020f5-46b2-4a77-afff-3e8e8a3791a4">
                  <a name="motion__id-5aa020f5-46b2-4a77-afff-3e8e8a3791a4"><!--a--></a>There are three areas
of the Budget that I would like to cover today: (i) the rise of
the dual economy: bridging the income disparity and concerns with
the "one-size-fits-all" productivity drive; (ii) the welfare of
elderly: "lifestyle security" for the elderly; and (iii) the new
social compact: compassion versus competitiveness.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8200ad04-1127-494d-ab81-f5a83566a43a">
                  <a name="motion__id-8200ad04-1127-494d-ab81-f5a83566a43a"><!--a--></a>Firstly, we have to recognise
that the old economic thinking that GDP growth translates to citizen's wealth
does not apply today. For example, in the USA, two-thirds of the
nation's total income gains from 2002 to 2007 flowed to the top
1% of US households, and that top 1% held a larger share of income
in 2007 than at any time since 1928, according to the Centre on
Budget and Priority Policies' Report dated 9 September 2009. USA
today has a Gini coefficient of 0.45. In Singapore, we are facing
this issue. Our Gini coefficient has risen from 0.442 in 2000 to
0.472 in 2010, according to the report, Department of Statistics
2010. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-37817293-3c6a-429d-9cf9-94151a8087ca">
                  <a name="motion__id-37817293-3c6a-429d-9cf9-94151a8087ca"><!--a--></a>At the lower income end,
wages of the lowest 10% of the income scale have remained stagnant
for the past decade. Some have even experienced earning declines,
as reported in <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> on 7 February 2012, that
in 2000, the median gross wage for cleaners and labourers was at
$1,277. By 2010, it fell to $960. On the other hand, the number
of individuals who earn at least $10,000 a month in Singapore has
jumped from 48,400 to nearly 140,000 in a decade. Singapore today
has the highest proportion of millionaires – one in six households.
Some have highlighted that Singapore, as a small economy, is more
susceptible to global trends and influences and, hence, the more
pronounced rising inequality. But what can we do to manage this
inequality better? While we can add more to smoothen out the path
for greater mobility, as Deputy Prime Minister Tharman rightly pointed
out, it will get more difficult to keep up this mobility in the
years to come. There is therefore a need to provide more direct help
for the average person to tackle the issue of cost of living. We
need to ensure that there is space for lower-skilled or retired
Singaporeans to make a living and enjoy the fruits of the nation's
wealth. It must be remembered that no one can reach the high levels
of productivity to cope with high costs of living and doing business
here.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1373</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-132d402a-7272-4b58-804b-d8d90c855b04"><!--a--></a>Looking at our Budget of the future, I
fear that our economic model seems to be heading one way – the way
of higher productivity and higher costs of living. I think that
we may have a policy clash – while the Government pushes for more
productive, highly skilled economy, Singaporeans are caught in a tension
because a dual economy seems to have evolved in Singapore. On one
hand, we have structural changes brought about by globalisation,
skills-biased talent, and a maturing economy. On the other hand,
we have businesses and workforces that also cater to the domestic
market and the less-skilled population that have not been able to
adapt. We are a society with also different make-up of abilities
and interests. Thus, our productivity drive cannot be a "one-size-fits-all"
approach and hope that the "other" economy will sort itself out,
disappear or ends up overseas. </p>

and policies on tax, CPF and immigration – while necessary to increase competitiveness
– may have also accentuated some of these divergent forces. We need
to find more sustainable economic measures that can be provided
to give the poorest workers a decent wage, which is depressed by
the forces of free markets. Our Budget transfers have served us
well and well-justified to support the Government's position against
minimum wage. However, I fear that our reliance on this tool over
the long term will create more stresses on the middle class, especially
on basic needs of housing, healthcare, transport and education. </p>

SMEs. I understand and agree that we have to continuously improve
the productivity levels of our companies to stay competitive. I
fully support the Budget's tightening on foreign manpower to give
our citizens a better chance of employment and better wages. However, speaking
to business owners, many SMEs are impacted by the increases in foreign
manpower levies and, more so, the tightening of foreign labour.</p>

to let market forces decide, to determine the fate of our local
businesses, be they in manufacturing, retail or food and beverage
industries. But it is quite another thing to count the thousands
of Singaporean jobs likely to be lost should these SMEs fail or
move overseas to operate their businesses because they cannot be
competitive here due to the high costs. It may be worthwhile to
track among the listed Singapore companies, how many have already
moved their core and administrative operations out of Singapore
and is this trend on the increase?</p>

raised when it emerged online that SMRT was still hiring bus drivers
from China due to shortage of drivers. This raised the perception
of double standards that the productivity drive imposed on SMEs
and businesses were not applied as stringently across the board.
In MOT's reply in Parliament earlier this month, SMRT and SBS employ
close to 40% foreign bus drivers and this has been an upward trend
in the past two years. Public companies such as SMRT and SBS should
be the ones setting the standards – that the focus should be on
giving local recruitment first priority and to put forth an attractive
wage structure and job condition. I also agree with Member Seng
Han Thong on the fact that we should look at the wages of our bus
drivers and transport workers. After all, the Government is already
putting $1.1 billion in new investment to co-finance the purchase
of 800 new buses. Much effort is being put into transforming the
security, landscaping and cleaning industries. This is a good opportunity
to transform the public transport sector as well, to make jobs there
more attractive for Singaporeans. And let us build more of such
sectors from here on. </p>

some sectors which I think Singaporeans wish to continue to enjoy
low-cost services. Productivity measures and foreign worker tightening
are likely to mean that business cost increases will be passed on
to consumers. Many are concerned about potential cost of living
increases as a result. Sectors such as Food and Beverage and retail
serve many Singaporeans. In fact, we commonly refer to shopping
and food to be our national pastimes. So, there are many business
owners in these sectors feeling the strain of not being able to
recruit and not able to service clients effectively. Most are already impacted
by rising rentals, and it is hard not to see these sectors being
able to sustain and serve our local population at current cost.</p>

that the Government also closely monitor the impact on foreign manpower
tightening measures on the Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) and retail
sectors and review the rate of tightening on foreign manpower needs
to be slowed. Price increases or the lack of affordable options will
only serve to create more tensions as it impact services closest
to the common Singaporeans. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, productivity
is a function of output and costs. Our approach to productivity
has always been about increasing business and workforce output.
However, perhaps, the Government can enlighten us if we have also
truly explored and put as much emphasis on reducing our costs –
costs of living and costs of doing business here, which also translates
to the expectation of costs of wages. </p>

to balance the costs increase with schemes such as the PIC and other
credits and grants. These are short-term measures and I cannot see
them being sustainable without burdening taxpayers or drawing our
reserves in the long term. What I fear most is if policymakers have
made a foregone conclusion that prices can only go up – and that
we have to find ways to subsidise the increases for the lower segments
in the long term. I am particularly concerned for middle-income
group and PMETs as they are bluntly impacted by cost increases and
most of the times do not qualify for many of the subsidies. We cannot
ignore the fact that they too need options to enjoy a decent standard
of living in Singapore. It is also important to reduce financial
burden and enhance affordability so that more in the different rungs
of the social ladder can benefit from the wider economic pie. I
hope that our policymakers also make it a priority to look at our
economic structure to find areas where we can bring our costs down
– especially in the areas of necessities such as housing, utilities,
healthcare, education, transport. This will ease cost pressures
and survival stresses on citizens and businesses. There are also long-term
implications of our sense of security of our future here in Singapore.</p>

a number of benefits for the elderly, especially through the Special Employment
Credit (SEC) and Silver Housing Bonus Scheme, which will help them
unlock the savings in their homes, so as to boost retirement income.
We have to recognise that more and more elderly these days cannot
rely on their children to support them. Many of the Government's
social assistance schemes abide by the principles that the family
is the first line of support. But this assumption is changing. According
to NCSS and MCYS, a 2005 study showed that only less than 50% or
44% of residents aged above 55 relied on their children for financial
support, up from 64% in 1995. This downward trend is expected to
continue.</p>

right direction to encourage employment of older Singaporeans, but
there are also some practical realities that need to be considered.
According to MOM's 2010 Labour Force report, about 61% of the number
of elderly, or those aged 55 and above, are employed, but they were concentrated
in the lowest income brackets of below S$1,500 a month. Even with
more seniors rejoining the workforce, with their limited incomes,
it is difficult for them to cope with the rising costs to maintain the
standard of living that they have today in the future.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-08f412c4-2585-48bb-af26-ce2a16dda5d1"><!--a--></a>The mindsets of employers
still have some way to go with regard to employing and creating
the right working conditions for our seniors. Fortunately, the majority
of Singapore's elderly own some assets. While the most common of
these are savings and fixed deposits, their largest assets are the
homes that they live in. The Silver Housing Bonus Scheme is a good
move. But many elderly who own HDB flats tend to be less willing
to uproot themselves and to downgrade into smaller flats in another
area. Many of their children are also likely to have purchased flats
nearby. We need to have a more flexible solution to help our seniors
to retain a roof over their heads and at the same time enjoy "lifestyle
security", over the next few years. While allowing the elderly to
monetise or unlock value from their assets is a good move. However,
as recently reported, today, the adoption of the Lease Buy-back
Scheme has not been good. However, perhaps, the target segment to
try this programme should have been different. </p>

could consider extending this scheme to the owners of larger HDB
flats, that is, the 4-room and larger HDB flats. The scheme should
be made available for older Singaporeans in larger flats to monetise
their needs. The existing position that larger flat owners can downgrade
to monetise their assets involves high risks in market cycles and
cash transactions. The Lease Buy-back Scheme is a safer, more rational
alternative. The adoption of the Lease Buy-back Scheme may also
be better among the middle-income population as the amounts monetised
from larger flats are likely to be higher and the education profile
of the flat owners may mean that they are better able to appreciate how
the schemes will benefit them.</p>

If this group do not see any social mobility in their livelihoods,
they will lose confidence in their future as they sense no economic

to help the less well-to-do Singaporeans in our society, and we
should be ready to provide them with even greater support, especially
the "big-ticket" items in life – for example, more housing subsidies
for first-time homebuyers, childcare support, healthcare, education,
especially tertiary. This will give them and their children a boost
up in social ladder. This can also be positive social multipliers
– as our people will then have a better sense of security, more
commitment to raise their families here and willingness to contribute
back to society.</p>

we face new challenges which calls for a new social compact today
for social sustainability. Addressing the interconnected challenges
of the poor, stagnant wages, rising income disparity, lower social
mobility, and a growing feeling of reduced well-being in this new environment
will require not just policy tweaks. What we need is a broader,
more holistic re-thinking of Singapore's economic and social policies
to find the right balance between economic growth and social sustainability.
If Singaporeans feel insecure for long, we will risk losing the
faith of the people in our system. This will not be good for Singapore
and can create even more social problems, deepen divisiveness and
ultimately lead to permanent fissions in our social fabric. We have
to think of what we want Singapore to be over the next 10, 20 years
and it is important for the Government to work more proactively
with its people to ensure socially desirable outcomes that meet
the preferences and aspirations of all Singaporeans. Mr Deputy Speaker,
Sir, I support the motion.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask about the Concept Plan
2011. Every 10 years, we have a collective look and we ask ourselves,
what kind of Singapore would we like? In the past, this sort of
question would have had fairly definite answers – in the long term,
we will have this many people, we will aspire to the Swiss standard
of living, and so on. We have aspirational goals defined in material,
objective and realistic terms. Now, we do not quite have such a
concept of Year X. Now, there are new rules and new paradigms. In
fact, now Concept Plan 2011 does not appear in 2011! I am hoping
that we will get to see it sometime in 2012. But of course, the question
still remains – what kind of Singapore do we want? The answers are
vastly different. More complex, more intriguing, yet in a way, more
urgent than ever before.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-74ae04e9-ee12-4522-b38a-da1373d7cca4">
                  <a name="motion__id-74ae04e9-ee12-4522-b38a-da1373d7cca4"><!--a--></a>Sir, each year, the Budget
is the way for our country to put its money where its mouth is.
To make real its dreams and vision, to make substantial commitments
to plans and predictions. Budget 2012 has seen a significant shift of focus and
approach to cover older Singaporeans, in particular, and to also include
the middle-income group. As we push for inclusive growth, as we
push to improve and increase the social mobility of all Singaporeans,
we should not forget that we need to keep an eye out on growing our
economy and ensuring as high an employment rate for all citizens,
and in the process, strive to improve job and wage prospects for
all. In laying out its vision for the concept, the Minister for
National Development had pointed out five key ideas: economic growth
opportunities; good quality living environment; an inclusive society
where the needs of various sectors of the population are taken care
of; a sustainable Singapore that balances growth with responsible
environmental management and an endearing home where people have
a strong sense of belonging to Singapore.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-554538cc-6c12-46c9-a4a0-0ff7051a06b6"><!--a--></a>In a sense, these five
have always been the key issues for us – economy, work, happiness,
prosperity, progress. But moving ahead, I ask the Government to
consider three key changes that need to be taken into account for
the future.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7eb693d9-7d28-4143-8638-005bf4660642">
                  <a name="motion__id-7eb693d9-7d28-4143-8638-005bf4660642"><!--a--></a>First, from optimal to
being "good enough". I call this "satisficing". Sir, one key thing
I feel we ought to do is to take a broader, more enlightened and
tolerant stance in policy-making. It is the notion of "satisficing"
rather than satisfying. Let us talk about floods, for example. One
key piece of data provides perspective – our PUB has done an incredible
job of reducing the flood-prone area from 3,200 hectares in the
1970s to 56 hectares today and only 40 hectares by next year. This
means that only 0.0005% of Singapore, or an area the size of the
Night Safari, is at risk of being flooded. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4c020f42-afad-4014-b577-5169206e3180">
                  <a name="motion__id-4c020f42-afad-4014-b577-5169206e3180"><!--a--></a>Now, how much risk is
there of us being flooded? A typical risk matrix is that "risk will
be defined as a combination of probability or likelihood and consequence",
so for the Mathematicians: "Flood Risk = Probability of Flooding
x Consequence of Flooding". In other words, high risk can occur
either from frequent floods that have relatively limited consequences
or from rare floods that have great consequences. The first are
the sorts of floods in Singapore last year, wet stores and feet
for half an hour in Orchard Road; and the second, far more disastrous,
with severe costs in life and homes, such as the 2005 floods in
New Orleans. It is true that Singapore may be "high risk" under
this calculation but to just trust the final number without appreciating
the type of risk is a mistake. Singapore may have a high probability
of flooding, but with relatively small consequences. Surely, the
preparedness – both in terms of infrastructure and psychology –
needs to be different. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3ca8f09c-2fe3-4d4b-869d-81dc33217446">
                  <a name="motion__id-3ca8f09c-2fe3-4d4b-869d-81dc33217446"><!--a--></a>Sir, we might benefit
from an alternative perspective, which is the need to increase citizen
resilience. Given the random nature of floods and the near impossibility
of total prevention, what level of protection do we want, and what
level of discomfort can we tolerate? Is $750 million too high a
price to be paid for what we went through last year? Singapore,
of course, will have to be prepared to bear with something not quite
the ideal. It is "satisficing" – a function of our imperfect knowledge
and limited resources.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c94622f6-325a-4076-ab9d-2820a8c98b40">

we need to review. A commentator, Eric Jaffe, wrote in an article
for <em class="ph i">Atlantic Cities</em> in December last year. He said, "Many
designers size a road or intersection to be free-flowing for the
worst hour of the day. Sized to accommodate cars during the highest
peak hour, such streets will be €˜overdesigned' for the other 23
hours of the day and will always function poorly for the surrounding community."
Sir, I am a driver, and I hate jams as much as the next man. Sometimes,
I curse – quietly and to myself of course – that I wish there were
wider roads. But I may have to accept that this is the price to
pay for larger parks, for better homes, for larger trees and the
fantastic biodiversity we have. Do we need to design roads that
completely address the problem of congestion, or can we learn to
live with some traffic jams, not too bad, not too long traffic jams
during peak hours? Of course, we can have more roads, or we can
have fewer cars. To me, the latter seems a better alternative. Perhaps,
it is time for us to continue to tackle more on the oversupply of
cars, rather than the undersupply of roads.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-10c550fc-8edf-42f5-bcf8-d9f5a0e0b642"><!--a--></a>Second, from solving problems
to negotiation. Sir, even as we recognise that there are increasingly tighter
limits for decision making, the process of how decisions are reached
must change. I must say that I
admire the assorted "political watchers" and "pundits" out there
who always seem to have a brainwave about how to tackle issues –
while the rest of us, Opposition MPs included, we work the ground,
we scratch our heads, we hold our residents' hands as we try and
work through seemingly hopeless situations late into the night at
our MPS. Some problems are really intractable. And once decisions
are made, rules are set, the cost of opening up the discussion,
of undoing what has been done – that is not easy. Sir, our policies
are blunt instruments by and large – they do mostly good, but they
can also be a little hard to a very few. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1377</p>

mutual gains, negotiation effort, can help. For example, parking
problems in any private estate. Let me relate what happened in one
of the private estates in my constituency. Many residents were upset
as parking spaces are limited, and whenever people try to sneak
into an illegal spot, the Traffic Police are called and summonses
are issued. Perhaps, it was due to intolerance, inconsiderate parking;
perhaps, due to new residents who moved in and did not know other
long-time residents well enough and so ties with community and neighbours
there were not so strong. Perhaps, all that was needed was for everyone
to seek to understand each other's perspectives. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c818134e-b701-41cb-95a8-58ac517ae195">
                  <a name="motion__id-c818134e-b701-41cb-95a8-58ac517ae195"><!--a--></a>What I did was to link
them all up, engage all of them in some dialogues initially via
email and eventually a face-to-face meeting with all of them at
one of the owners' home. We shared openly the issues at hand, implored
all to listen, to better appreciate and understand each other's
perspectives – that really there was no right or wrong. But we all
agreed that as a community, we could take the first and most important
step to help solve our own local problems. So, we drew up a list
of ground rules for these residents to agree and to adhere to. Now,
calls to Traffic Police will only be made as a super last resort and
also by the internal neighbourhood committee. We exchanged and collectively
drew up this set of rules. We hope to implement these next month
and we will in fact be having a street party soon amongst the residents
there and I look forward to joining them at this street party next
Saturday. The solution is really nothing new – I told them this
was called "neighbourliness"! </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2be8efd0-9ae5-4877-8df5-bafb996defe0">
                  <a name="motion__id-2be8efd0-9ae5-4877-8df5-bafb996defe0"><!--a--></a>I adopted the same approach
with another group of residents in another private estate, also
regarding parking issues about a year and a half ago. So far, the
outcome has been positive and the neighbourliness spirit is better
than before. Sir, we have a background set of rules and regulations
designed for parking offences – but to enforce them, all the time
without regard for nuances of relationships and interests at hand
is unhelpful. Besides, if we call the Traffic Police out for every
little disagreement, I can imagine the state of the Home Affairs'
budget the next year! </p>

Some flats were designed a long time ago, such that now to provide
full lift access, it creates "problems" for others such as blocked
views. So, in my case I again engaged each block of residents who
are affected, had dialogues with them, explained and hoped. As a
result, all of them have a better appreciation of the problem and
the very difficult issues that confront the desire to provide full
lift accessibility for all residents in their block. I have about
eight such blocks requiring eight such sessions. In some cases,
I had to have another two or three follow-up dialogues. Time-consuming
no doubt but, to me and, I believe, to many others, necessary and
useful. I do not know if it will all turn out well because they
are all different and some are still pending but I think we all
would want to work out some solution which will not satisfy everyone
but which they will all hopefully understand. This is what I call
"satisficing" – some satisfaction, some sacrifice. And I think by
and large, we are understanding and reasonable when we are engaged
and we have all the information needed to make a decision. </p>

and open conversation concept, we can also make the point, without moralising,
that Singaporeans can take ownership and responsibility for things
which they are accountable for. It could be about pet ownership
abandonment, leaving dog poo all over the place, leaving a disused
bicycle in the void deck, high-rise littering, parking improperly
or not giving way to the elderly. We make mistakes, we admit them,
we apologise and we help each other along. </p>

is about hard infrastructure and the limits of growth. Sir, the
Singapore we want can be created in our minds and hearts, but the
reality is still some 700 square kilometres we have to work with.
Sir, the URA takes 6.5 million as a planning parameter. We are not
yet at 6 million and already feeling the heat. We are cheek to jowl,
and fighting and scrambling for what is yours or mine – jobs, homes,
a seat on the bus or the train. At the same time, the "community"
approach that has served us so well in the past may not work now
– as we develop discrete and fragmented identities – it has recently,
sometimes unfortunately become a zero sum game, in part borne by
a sense of deprivation at the rising inequality. Sir, inequality
is an insidious and creeping problem and I will address this more fully
in my MCYS cut. In my mind, if we do not reduce this scourge, it

concentrate on the notion of limits. Are we reaching the biophysical
limits of growth and do we want to stop at a certain point? This
is an important question because at the end of it all, we come back
to the most important question: what kind of Singapore do we want?
This Government through this Budget has made some significant moves
and signal its intention to have more inclusive growth and build
a more inclusive society. It is and will continue to be always work
in progress. </p>

as I have said, but in a sense they are also a function of the complexity
of society today – not just in Singapore, but the world over. In
the analysis of the Challenger tragedy in US, the Enron collapse
and the recent Western financial crisis, we see the fragility of
complex systems. They are what Yale Professor Charles Perrow call
"normal accidents" – accidents caused by the way minor events interacted
to produce major disasters.</p>

routine or frequent. It just means that it can occur within the
normal functioning of a complex system. As journalist Malcolm Gladwell
says, when accidents of this sort happen, there is "no one to blame,
no dark secret to unearth, no recourse but to re-create an entire
system in place of one that had inexplicably failed". Well, he is
wrong about the lack of recourse, of course, because the most obvious
and yet most difficult is to recalibrate our response to disasters. </p>

                  </span>:
Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Budget. Sir, many Singaporeans
have voiced support for this year's Budget. Many have called it
an "inclusive Budget" targeted at restructuring our economy, helping
the low-income and elderly Singaporeans. The Budget is indeed a step in the
right direction to build an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore.
However, the targeted approach in assistance always fails to fulfil
the needs and aspirations of certain segments of our population.
That is why we can still see media reports of SMEs and different
groups of Singaporeans asking for more subsidies or assistance from
the Government.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1379</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-acd162b5-4951-4929-bb8c-dc046e279d01">
                  <a name="motion__id-acd162b5-4951-4929-bb8c-dc046e279d01"><!--a--></a>Sir, a Budget which targets
on helping certain segments of the population will always tend to
make the rest feel "short-changed", thus resulting in unhappiness
among Singaporeans. To address this unhappiness, I would propose
to the Finance Minister to consider adding a "sharing" component
in the Budget. Despite having attained an economic growth of 4.9%
in 2011 and a budget surplus of $2.3 billion, there is no "Growth
Dividend" to recognise the efforts of all Singaporeans. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7eb40c22-e287-4327-b916-43a609bccc2d">
                  <a name="motion__id-7eb40c22-e287-4327-b916-43a609bccc2d"><!--a--></a>Sir, may I ask the Finance
Minister: (1) what is the purpose of the Growth Dividend?; (2) under
what circumstances will the Government give out Growth Dividend?;
and (3) why is no Growth Dividend given out to Singaporeans this
year? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-641d47bd-8ac5-4224-b737-14d4ed9a20cc">
                  <a name="motion__id-641d47bd-8ac5-4224-b737-14d4ed9a20cc"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Growth Dividend
is a good mechanism for the Government to share our Budget surplus
with Singaporeans regardless of age, income or the annual value
of their property. In times of economic crisis, the Government encourages
Singaporeans to take tough economic measures to cut costs. Therefore,
when there is economic growth and budget surplus, there should also
be Growth Dividend to recognise Singaporeans' contributions. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-4ccab726-3ca6-4a8b-916e-0495cab2857f"><!--a--></a>Sir, I support the permanent
GST Vouchers to help lower income Singaporeans. At the same time,
I would urge the Finance Minister to consider providing Growth Dividend
to Singaporeans. In this way, it provides a fairer distribution
of budget surplus to all Singaporeans while helping the lower income groups.
This is what I would call the "share and care" approach for budgeting.</p>

Budget is inclusive, there is a lack of measures to promote a caring
society where Singaporeans will care for one another and others.
We need to build a strong economy. We need to build an inclusive
society. But what is more important is to nurture more caring Singaporeans
and Singapore companies. </p>

read a letter in the Forum page in the <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> dated
24 February 2012 titled, "Thanks for saving my wife's life: SIA
passenger". The professionalism and care shown by the SIA crew of
Flight SQ 322 in saving a passenger's life is indeed commendable.
Sir, we need more caring Singapore companies and more good Singaporean
Samaritans to build a caring society.</p>

caring Singapore companies and Singaporeans:</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-ebd93554-6c7b-4a1b-ac10-80dfa9c6334a"><!--a--></a>(1) Supporting firms which
employ older Singapore workers. Sir, I support the Special Employment Credit
(SEC) for older workers above 50 years old and the reduction of
dependency ratio for foreign workers. But I am concerned that it
will have undesirable side effects resulting in firms employing
more "phantom older workers" to meet the reduced dependency ratio
and profit from the SEC. Although the SEC may encourage more firms
to retain or recruit older workers, it may not result in older workers getting
better pay and employment terms. Furthermore, SMEs may not benefit
much from the SEC as they do not employ many older workers. Therefore,
I would urge the Finance Minister to consider adopting a two-tier
SEC for SMEs and larger firms. A higher SEC for SMEs will give them
a more level playing field and further incentivise them to provide
more job opportunities for older Singaporeans.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-e4084547-6671-4e71-a2be-513a209c24ee"><!--a--></a>Sir, we can also help Singapore firms
to take care of their older workers in two areas. First, we can increase
the skills and pay of older workers through the companies. I would
urge the Finance Minister to consider providing a Special Training
Credit to encourage firms to send their older workers for continual
skills upgrading. Second, we should provide more SEC for firms which
employ older workers earning a basic salary of $1,000 or more. Sir,
the SEC has an income ceiling of $3,000 but no minimum salary criteria
to protect low wage older workers. As such, older workers may not
be able to earn more. </p>

raised by the Finance Minister on the low wage of some Singaporean workers,
especially cleaners. Over the last three years, the 14 PAP Town
Councils spearheaded a Job Redesign Programme with NTUC to help
raise the skills, productivity and wages of cleaners working in
the Town Councils. At the start of the programme, we faced many
challenges as cleaners were not well trained, their morale and salary
were low, and cleaning firms were not keen to upgrade the skills
of their workers. Furthermore, the wage of cleaners was often affected
or suppressed by the competitive bidding for cleaning contracts. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e7eb453c-3c74-4a8d-9611-6cae022ecaf3">
                  <a name="motion__id-e7eb453c-3c74-4a8d-9611-6cae022ecaf3"><!--a--></a>Sir, to address these
challenges, the Town Councils developed a three-pronged approach,
namely: (1) redesign the tender specifications; (2) incorporate
a performance evaluation system; and (3) modify our tender evaluation
criteria for cleaning contracts. The changes help us to increase
the skills of our cleaners, raise their productivity and salary.
At the same time, cleaners are more motivated to provide better
cleaning services to our residents. </p>

Minister will adopt a two-tier SEC and set a minimum salary criteria
to help older Singapore workers get better salary.</p>

Social Responsibility and Philanthropy. Sir, to build a caring society,
we need more successful companies and individuals to come forward
to help the needy in our community. We should also encourage more
start-ups of voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), and incentivise more
Singaporeans to make donations to help the sick and needy in our
society. Sir, at this juncture, let me share with Members the experience
of North West CDC in encouraging companies and individuals to make
monthly donations of at least $100 per month to help our needy. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-21189966-ef3e-4fcb-a4e0-e10d34aaa36b">
                  <a name="motion__id-21189966-ef3e-4fcb-a4e0-e10d34aaa36b"><!--a--></a>In May 2008, North West
CDC started the Club-100 @ North West to foster philanthropy spirit among
Singaporeans. We identified a cause for the donations and conveyed
the message that all donations will go towards the North West Food
Aid Fund which provides food rations and vouchers to over 700 needy
households monthly. To date, we are pleased to report that Club-100
@ North West has 300 members, contributing half a million dollars
a year to help our needy.</p>

do more to encourage corporate social responsibility and philanthropy. Besides
providing the 2.5 times income tax exemption, I would urge the Government
to provide a one-to-one matching grant subject to a certain cap
for donations made to VWOs with Charity or IPC status. At the same
time, the Government can be a VWO venture capitalist to provide
seed money for VWO start-ups. More tax exemption can also be provided
to encourage individuals to make monthly donations. The returns
for such investment will be a more caring society with many helping
hands.</p>

to build a caring community. Sir, the building of a caring community requires
the efforts of the 3Ps (Public, Private and People) sectors. We
must continue to encourage more initiatives by the 3Ps to spearhead
"Caring Community" programmes or services. The Government, business
community and our people must take ownership to achieve the same
desired outcome − a caring community where Singaporeans will take
care of one another.</p>

as a useful channel to match 3Ps projects in the community. The
experience of the CDCs in identifying the needs of the community
will ensure better outcomes for 3Ps projects. In this aspect, I hope
that the Government will allocate resources and initiate more 3Ps
projects to strengthen the partnership of the 3Ps. This will build
capabilities in the community and sustain more community programmes
and services. </p>

common understanding with regard to the number and configuration

will send patients a reminder if they do not settle their bills
within a month. There will be subsequent reminders in the following
months, if necessary, by mail and telephone. When there is still
no response, some hospitals may refer the case to an authorised
debt collection agency to collect the arrears on their behalf. At
any time, should a patient express problems paying his or her hospital
bill, the hospital will assess the case and explore options for
financial assistance, such as instalment payments or Medifund assistance. </p>

                  </span>: Today,
the residents in the vicinity of Park Green Condominium and Block
102, Rivervale Walk are already served by two existing LRT stations
(SE4 Kangkar and SE5 Ranggung), which are located within a walking
distance of 400 metres to 500 metres. The residents are also served by
two bus-stops (B11 and B12) along Sengkang East Ave, where Service
119 connects the residents to the transport node and amenities at
the Sengkang Town Centre and provides a direct link to Heartland Mall
and the food centre at Kovan. </p>

that it would not be technically possible to add a station in the
vicinity. As the LRT alignment in the area is curved, there is an
insufficient length of straight track to accommodate an additional
station.</p>

LTA, together with the relevant agencies like the Urban Redevelopment Authority
