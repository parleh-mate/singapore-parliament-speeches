<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In accordance with the provisions of

paragraph (6) of Standing Order 85, I have for  the

Estimates of Expenditure of Singapore for the  year

1967 fixed the times on each allotted day (that  is

to  say,  15th,  16th and 19th December)  at  which

consideration  of  the  heads  of  expenditure   in

respect  of  which amendments stand  on  the  Order

Paper  shall,  if  not previously disposed  of,  be

concluded.  Those  times  have  been  notified   to

Honourable Members and will appear in the  Official

Report*.

<div align="center"><b>(Malay Secondary School classes)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  he  proposes  to  start   Malay

Secondary  School  classes  at  the  Ahmad  Ibrahim

Integrated  Secondary School, Sembawang  Hill,  for

the  Malay  stream students living in the Sembawang

Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Malay medium

secondary  classes  have not been  started  at  the

Ahmad  Ibrahim Integrated Secondary School  because

of the relatively small demand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



for Malay medium secondary places in this area. For

the  years 1960 to 1966, the number of pupils  from

Sembawang Malay schools who qualified for Secondary

I  Malay medium was 45, 50, 45, 36, 77, 68  and  63

respectively.  It will be seen that each  year  the

number  was  too small even to start  two  classes.

Lack  of  adequate  staff at the higher  level  and

subject  teaching  requirements  call  for  a  wise

deployment of Malay medium secondary teachers,  and

we   are  very  short  of  qualified  Malay  medium

secondary  school  teachers.  A  minimum  of   four

classes  of Secondary I would be necessary to  make

the   best  use  of  staffing  facilities  and  for

effective  teaching.  The  Sembawang  Malay  medium

secondary students are posted mainly to Monk's Hill

Secondary School to which they can go by  one  bus.

The  majority of them are receiving bus  bursaries.

In  view of these circumstances, it is not proposed

to  start  Malay  medium secondary classes  in  the

Ahmad Ibrahim Integrated Secondary School, at least

not until the demand increases to make possible the

formation of four classes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Finance what is the policy in regard to changes  of

the  names of streets and kampongs, and whether the

residents concerned are consulted when any  changes

of street or kampong names are proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, as a rule, names of streets

that  are existent are generally retained.  In  the

choice  of names for new streets and kampongs,  the

former  practice of using colonial and snob  names,

or  names  of  royalty, has been discontinued.  The

present  practice  is  to choose  names  which  may

relate to the historical background or the physical

features  of  the area, or to use  names  of  local

flora or fauna.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the practice specifically to consult

the  residents of an area, but suggestions received

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Reasons for resignations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what  is  the rate of resignations from the  Income

Tax  Department and whether the rate is  high  when

compared with the rate in other departments; and if

he will give the reasons for the resignations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Resignations in the middle seniority grades have

occurred  and  the  reasons are generally  that  of

better   remuneration  offered  in   non-Government

employment outside or for less onerous and exacting

work.  Over  the last three years, the resignations

have been as follows:



<pre>

               1966    Division I -

                           2 Assessment Officers

                                for better remuneration outside;

                           One Probationary Legal Officer,

                                who is a non-citizen, left after

                                serving less than six months' service;

               1965    Nil.

               1964    Nil.

</pre>



<br><br>In  the  lower seniority grade, resignations  have

been  due  to failure to pass examinations required

for  confirmation  of  their  appointment  and  for

better pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1966 Division II - Assistant Examiners. Out of

the  eight  who  resigned, six left  to  better

their  prospects in non-Government  employment;

one  for  further studies and one left to  join

her husband overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Division III - Clerical Officers. Seven

resigned.  Of these, two left for  better  pay,

one   was   selected  to  undergo  a   training

Officer's   Course  in  the   Singapore   Armed

Forces,   three   left  to  undertake   further

studies,  and one obtained a bursary for  study

at the Teachers' Training College.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Division IV Typists, Process and Notice Servers,

Office  Boys - one each. The typist left  for

alternative  employment with  better  pay.  The

Process  and  Notice Server  left  for  reasons

unknown.  The  Office Boy left for  alternative

employment at higher pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1965 Division II - Assistant Examiners. Six

resigned.    Three    left   for    alternative

employment with better pay, and three  left  to

undertake further studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Division III - Clerical Officers. Eleven

resigned.  Four  of these left for  alternative

employment  with  better  pay;  four  left  for

further  studies, one left to get married,  and

two  left  because  they  failed  to  pass  the

examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1964 Division II Assistant Examiners. Four

resigned.  Two left for alternative  employment

with  better  pay; one was awarded an  overseas

scholarship  to undertake professional  studies

overseas  and  he  has since  returned  to  the

department, and one left on account of  failing

to pass the departmental examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Officers. One resigned for

alternative employment with better pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1964 Division III Assistant Examiners-in-training. Three resigned to undertake further

studies,  one  left as he failed  to  pass  the

examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerical Officers. One left for alternative

employment   as   he   failed   to   pass   his

examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Division IV - Typists. One resigned to

accompany  her  husband on  transfer  to  Kuala

Lumpur.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> A supplementary

question,  Sir.  Apart from  the  reason  given  of

better  emoluments from outside, is it a fact  that

the Income Tax Department is the only department in

the  Government  that  has  the  greatest  rate  of

resignations?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can the Parliamentary Secretary

answer that without notice?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I do not think so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> A

supplementary question, Sir. What is the Government

going to do about this brain-drain from Government

departments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is always impossible  to  prevent

people from leaving Government departments. Whether

it  is  a brain-drain or not is open to contention.

On  our side, we are quite happy that some of  them

left us. The Government can do without them and  we

will get better ones later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

whether  there is any possibility that the Head  of

Department,  in  dealing with the junior  officers,

has  failed in his human relationship and that this

has brought about this high rate of resignations in

the Income Tax Department?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I do not know what rate of

resignations  the hon. Member for Bras  Basah  will

consider to be a high rate. From the figures given,

I think it is quite a normal rate. In fact, most of

them  resigned because of higher pay or to  further

their  studies, and I think they should  thank  the

Commissioner of Inland Revenue, for they  are  able

to  get  better emoluments outside because  of  the

training that he had given them while they were  in

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

saying  that the Income Tax Department  has  got  a

high  rate of resignations. I am asking,  is  it  a

fact   that  this  department,  compared  to  other

departments,  has got a high rate of  resignations?

The  Minister  for  Finance, as  his  post  in  the

Government  is  more  or  less  like  that  of   an

employer,  should  know whether  other  departments

have the same rate of resignations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If the Member would like a

comparative  table  of  resignations   from   other

departments, I will supply it later on.  But  I  am

quite satisfied with the personal relationship that

is existing between the head of that department and

the staff, The Income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



Tax Department is a little bit peculiar in that  it

requires   a   greater   amount   of   output   and

productivity from the staff. It is quite a rigorous

department   in   that   we   are   dealing    with

entrepreneurs who are very astute in  finding  ways

and  means  of  wriggling out of their  income  tax

responsibility.  Therefore,  the  people  who  work

there  require  greater acumen, greater  drive  and

greater interest in their work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Grouses about working conditions)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he has received any representations, or has any

knowledge  of grouses among the junior officers  of

the  Income Tax Department about working conditions

in  that Department, and what action he has  taken,

or proposes to take, in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Officers have from time to time complained of being

asked  to  work  harder than  the  staff  in  other

Government departments and occasionally  of  having

to  work  outside normal office hours  during  peak

periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to be expected as taxation work is both

exacting and onerous. During peak periods the staff

will occasionally have to work extra time, but this

is offset by a freer time during off-peak periods.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am not quite satisfied with

the  answer of the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Finance. What I am asking is  whether

he  has received any grouses from the staff of  the

Income Tax Department, and if he has, what steps he

has taken to remedy the grouses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Their complaints are of being

asked to work hard and occasionally having to  work

outside normal hours. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the supplementary question

is  really  directed at asking if there  have  been

grouses  other than those relating to  overwork  or

work outside office hours,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Not that I am aware of, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>FLATS IN JURONG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance if he will request the Economic Development

Board  to furnish him with information on  (a)  the

number  of  flats built by the Board in the  Jurong

Industrial Estate; (b) what is the rental  charged;

(c)  how  many flats are occupied; and (d)  whether

steps  have been taken to encourage factory workers

in  the area to occupy the vacant flats; and if  he

will furnish the House with the information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> The

Economic  Development Board has so far built  4,512

units   in  the  residential  zone  of  the  Jurong

Industrial Estate. Of this number, 2,614 units  are

occupied. The rates of rental are $20 per month for

a  one-room  flat; $46.50 per month for a  two-room

flat;  and $66.50 per month for a three-room  flat,

inclusive of service and conservancy charges. These

are   the  rates  of  rental  applicable  only   to

Singapore  citizens with a family  income  of  less

than  $800  per  month.  Singapore  citizens  whose

family  income is more than $800 are only  eligible

for  three-room flats and are charged a  rental  of

$91.50  per month. Further, flats may also  be  let

out  to  non-Singapore  citizens  on  the  specific

approval of the Economic Development Board. Rentals

applicable  to non-Singapore citizens  are  $106.50

for  a three-room flat; $66.50 for a two-room flat,

and  $30 for a one-room flat. It will be noted that

while   rentals  for  workers  who  are   Singapore

citizens  are  at  subsidised rates,  non-Singapore

citizens  with work permits have to  pay  the  full

economic  rental if they wish to stay in the  flats

at the Jurong Industrial Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning the development of the Jurong

Industrial  Estate, the Economic Development  Board

aims at building up a self-contained community. Low-cost housing is therefore built so that workers may

stay near their places of work and need not commute

from other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



areas  of  Singapore to Jurong, which  may  involve

journeys  of  20 miles or more a day.  The  Board's

policy,  therefore, is to encourage as many workers

as  possible  to stay in the flats  at  the  Jurong

Industrial Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing estate at Taman Jurong is provided

with  markets,  a  school, shops, a  playground,  a

football field as well as a community centre. Early

next year an open-air cinema will be built there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leasing out lands to industries in Singapore,

a  clause is inserted which requires all lessees to

try  to house their workers at Taman Jurong in  the

industrial  estate. Manufacturing and  other  firms

located  at  Jurong are regularly informed  of  the

availability of low-cost housing for their workers.

Industrial  firms  themselves are also  encouraging

their workers to stay in Jurong by granting housing

allowances in lieu of a transport allowance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> A supplementary, Mr Speaker,

Sir. Is  it true that the flats at Jurong  are  at

present  half  empty and that there  was  only  one

registration  at  the  school  there  and  that  at

present it is being put to other uses?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Part of that question should, of

course, be addressed to the Minister for Education.

But,  Mr Ramaswamy, do you want to reply  to  that

part to which you can reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I have given the figures of

occupation  of these flats. There are 4,512  units.

Of  this  number,  2,614  units  are  occupied.  Of

course, the hon. Member can calculate whether it is

half or more than half.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> A

supplementary  question, Sir. In view  of  the  low

wages paid in Jurong, what is the Minister doing to

encourage  employers  to  subsidise  the  rents  in

Jurong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> These are already subsidised

rates   of  rental  charged  to  workers  who   are

Singapore citizens. I think at the moment in Jurong

most of the workers are either given free transport

or a transport allowance, so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



if  they desire to live in Taman Jurong, they  will

get,   in  lieu  of  free  transport,  a  transport

allowance,  which  is  a form  of  subsidy  towards

paying their rental. In fact, in some cases it  may

be almost the rental of a one-room unit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> A supplementary, Mr Speaker. I

think  the Minister is wrong, because in most cases

in  Jurong they do not subsidise, neither  do  they

give  a  transport allowance. They leave it to  the

union to fight. So I am hoping the Minister will do

something to encourage future developers in  Jurong

really to help the workers in the subsidy of  rent.

In  fact,  I  understand the  policy  of  providing

transport has been stopped for quite some time now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I will not argue about the

policy of the labour union with regard to a subsidy

for  transport or a subsidy for houses. But I would

like  the hon. Member to remember that we  are,  at

the  moment,  engaged  in the  task  of  increasing

productivity   and   lowering   costs.    If    the

entrepreneurs in Jurong find that it is possible to

give  additional  pay, either  in  the  form  of  a

housing  allowance  or in any other  form,  and  be

still  able to compete externally, then  the  union

will  have a good case. Otherwise, I think it  will

have to hold its horses for the time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> A supplementary, Sir. Does the

Minister  not  consider  that  the  giving   of   a

transport subsidy would, in fact, encourage  people

to  stay  away  from  Jurong rather  than  stay  in

Jurong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I have just said that the

employers  are requested to pay a housing allowance

instead of a transport allowance, and most of  them

are doing that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> A supplementary, Mr Speaker. Has

the  Parliamentary Secretary investigated how  many

employers are subsidising house rents in Jurong?  I

am quite sure he is not aware, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I am not aware. But this is what

the Government or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



Economic   Development  Board  is   doing,   asking

employers to pay a housing allowance instead  of  a

transport allowance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> A point of clarification, Sir.

It  is not the Government or the Housing Board that

has  asked employers to pay a housing allowance  in

lieu  of a transport allowance. I think the  Member

for  Telok Blangah must be aware that where workers

have been receiving a transport allowance, this has

been  termed  a housing allowance if they  stay  in

Jurong. To reply to the Member opposite, it is  not

Government's policy to encourage employers to pay a

housing  allowance, because in one way it  prevents

the  workers  from  staying  in  Jurong,  which  is

exactly opposite to what we intend. We have spent a

lot of money on the infrastructure in Jurong and we

would like the workers to turn it into a town.

Finance  since the Trade Mission to Africa what  is

the  progress  of trade between Singapore  and  the

African countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> The

Trade  Mission  to  Africa  visited  seven  African

States  in  March  and April this year.  Since  its

return,  a continuous flow of trade inquiries  from

Africa has been received. Individual merchants from

Africa  have  also visited Singapore and  concluded

business  with our own manufacturers  and  traders.

The Manager of the Zambian Trade Fair recently came

here  to  persuade our manufacturers to participate

in  the Zambian Trade Fair to be held next year. We

would  consider  favourably participation  in  this

Fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade between several African countries and

ourselves  has  shown encouraging increases.  These

countries  are  the  United Arab  Republic,  Kenya,

Zambia,  Malawi and Tanzania. An increasing  amount

and  variety  of  locally  manufactured  goods  are

finding markets in Africa. Exports of products such

as tyres, tubes and steel pipes have shown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



substantial  increases in the first  11  months  of

this year, compared with the same period last year.

For  instance, exports of tyres and tubes increased

from  $121,000  in  1965  to  $674,000  this  year.

Similarly,  exports of steel pipes  have  increased

from  $40,000 last year to $330,000 this  year.  We

are  confident  that with active export  promotion,

our  goods  will find ready acceptance  in  African

markets  in  terms  of price, quality  as  well  as

delivery.

come under this head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I know it is

not  very  relevant, but I think it is relevant  in

this  connection, that all those citizens who  have

passed the age of 21 prior to the pronouncement  of

Government about citizens by descent have  to  take

an  oath  of allegiance. When these people went  to

the  Identity Card Office to apply for a change  of

going to do with these rejected persons?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am not aware of any such citizens

should  arise,  I  can assure the Member  for  Bras

Basah that any such person claiming citizenship  by

descent  will  be  given the opportunity  to  swear

allegiance  if he has not sworn allegiance  in  the

past. Perhaps the Member is referring to cases  who

have  passed  the age of 22. They are  supposed  to

swear  within  the  one-year period.  I  think  the

Member  is  worried about such cases. I can  assure

him  that even in those cases the persons concerned

will be given every opportunity to swear an oath of

allegiance.

of  any  cases of forged new identity cards.  There

are many cases of forged old identity cards. One of

the   objects  of  introducing  the  new  laminated

the Member for Joo Chiat is saying is true, it must

be  rather  disturbing  and  I  will  be  happy  to

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy of

in  high-class hotels or night clubs frequented  by

be relaxed to those in general application in large

metropolitan  towns,  for example,  London,  Tokyo,

Bangkok  and so on. As it is very unlikely  that  a

great  number of people in Singapore can afford  to

frequent such high-class hotels or night clubs, the

promotion  of  a healthy culture in Singapore  will

not be affected by this relaxation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards censorship standards of stage shows

open  to  the  general public either in second-rate

into  self-contained flats each with its own toilet

facilities, or alternatively, the reduction of  the

Speaker, Sir, the Housing and Development Board has

considered   the  possibility  of  converting   the

existing Bukit Ho Swee one-room units with communal

facilities into self-contained one-room or two-room

units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are altogether 904 units of one-room

service  communal flats sited in five  blocks.  The

conversion    will   involve   making    structural

alterations and substantial foundation  costs,  the

cost   of   which  will  be  prohibitive  and   not

economically justifiable. The rent of  these  flats

is  already  low - $20 per month - and  it  is  not

economically feasible to reduce the rental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government subsidy for these one-room units

already averages as high as $17 per month per unit.

Any  further  reduction  in rental  will  therefore

require a corresponding increase in subsidy.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like

to  ask  the  Minister whether he  has  given  some

thought  to the residents of the 900 flats in  this

area.  I would also like to ask him whether  he  is

aware  that there are three urgencies in life.  The

first  urgency is beyond control, and that  is  one

must  go  to  the  lavatory.  The  lavatories   are

situated  in  a common corridor. So the  women  who

want   to  go  there  must  be  escorted  by  their

husbands, otherwise they have to use a spittoon  as

a temporary lavatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the Minister

whether  he remembers that last year there  was  an

unfortunate  incident relating to a small  girl  in

this  area  because  there  are  no  self-contained

lavatories.  This child was victimised  and  killed

after having gone to the common lavatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the answer given by the Parliamentary

Secretary,  I would like to ask him whether  he  is

prepared to convert the existing flats for the  use

of male residents only, or as quarters for men, and

the   present  tenants  may  be  given  some  other

accommodation  with self-contained  lavatories  and

kitchens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>

three points relating to one-room units which have

given rise to some inconvenience and possible

trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all aware that the one-room units are

rather crowded in space, which is very limited.  So

certainly this will give rise to some inconvenience

at times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other point about converting the

present  structures, I have already  said  that  it

would  cost about $½ million for the reconstruction

of existing units into some other kind of units. In

other  words, the Government has to spend  $500  on

the  reconstruction of each unit. If the Government

really  desires  to  spend this additional  sum  of

money,  it will mean that the subsidy will have  to

be  increased. At the present moment,  it  is  most

uneconomical  to  spend  $½  million.  It  is  also

unrealistic because this sum of money could be  put

to better use elsewhere by putting up more units of

houses  for  other  people. Regarding  the  present

residents   who   may  have  to   face   unpleasant

inconveniences,   I   think   this   is   not   the

responsibility of the Housing Board.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have just

now  asked  a  question  which  has  not  yet  been

any of these two things, whether he is prepared  to

do this within the shortest possible time, that is,

to allow the present tenants to have fair treatment

by  moving  them into alternative accommodation  so

that  they can get away from the inconvenience  and

other unpleasant incidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, at

the  present moment, applications for Housing Board

accommodation  in  Bukit Ho Swee  amount  to  about

8,000;  that  means to say, there are  still  8,000

applicants on the waiting list for accommodation in

Bukit  Ho  Swee.  The request to transfer  existing

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> A supplementary,

Sir. I wish to know from the Minister for Law and

National Development whether he is prepared to

consider installing more standpipes in the rural

areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know how

this is relevant, but I believe the Member wants to

know  whether  I  would  consider  installing  more

standpipes in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is that we are not going

to put in any more stand-pipes in any area, whether

it is rural or urban.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, water is one of our basic

necessities and it is not easy to get in Singapore.

The  standpipes in Singapore consume about 7½ to  8

million  gallons  per day. The  Government  is  not

afraid of supplying the 7 or 8 million gallons  per

day, and supplying it free. It is not the cost that

worries us. It is the wastage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am sure that Members of this House

have  seen on many an occasion someone washing  his

lorry or motor-bike, or using a long tube from  the

standpipe  to his house about 500 yards  away,  and

using  the water for domestic purposes - that would

be  well  and good. But normally they  use  it  for

their  motor-cars, their lorries and  their  motor-bikes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reached a stage in Singapore where we

find  it  most  inadvisable  to  put  in  any  more

standpipes. In fact, we intend to reduce the number

of  standpipes  as far as possible. This  does  not

mean that we will not supply water; instead we will

supply  it  direct  to  every house  in  Singapore,

whether  that  house is authorised or unauthorised,

numbered or unnumbered.

[5th December, 19661, "That Parliament approves the

financial  policy of the Government  for  the  year

1967.".-[The Minister for Finance]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, let me thank the Finance

Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



the  financial statement which he delivered in this

House.  It was full of life and vigour. The  Budget

for 1967, like the one for last year, is a balanced

one.  Although  the Government  does  not  seek  to

increase  taxes,  yet  it is able  to  balance  its

budget.  It has also been able to get a surplus  of

$5-odd  million, and $30 million is transferred  to

the  Development Fund. When we analyse this budget,

we  will  find  that there are more surpluses.  For

example, we have contributed a sum of $23.3 million

to  the International Monetary Fund and a sum of $1

million  to the World Bank. And these two  sums  of

money are meant for investment in order to boost up

our  economic development. These two items are  not

recurrent  expenditure. There are some items  which

have  been  increased. For example, the development

item  for Education. This year, the item was  $15.8

million,  but  for next year the  amount  voted  is

$26.5  million, an increase of about $10.7 million.

This  is  an  increase of 68 per cent.  The  amount

voted  for the Ministry of the Interior and Defence

this year was $33.67 million, but for next year the

amount  to  be  voted  will be $78.89  million,  an

increase of about -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I draw attention to the speakers

to  which I drew attention on Monday? There  are  a

number  that are on, and persons who are not  using

microphones are finding it difficult to follow  the

Member  as  the translation in other  languages  is

coming  through the microphone. Perhaps  after  Mr

Teong  resumes,  this can be detected.  Mr  Teong,

please resume.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): An increase of

about  230 per cent. Therefore, there is a  further

improvement in our national financial situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the countries around us in South-East Asia. Whenever a budget is brought into

Parliament, whenever a Finance Minister tables  his

budget, he will have either to increase taxation or

borrow money from other countries. As a result, his

country's  foreign debt will accumulate. Therefore,

it  is  small wonder that our Finance Minister  has

said that, as the Finance Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



two  successive years, he has been fortunate enough

to be able to maintain a balanced budget and end up

even  with a small surplus. I feel that it  is  not

only  the good fortune of the Finance Minister  but

it  is  also the good fortune of all the people  in

our  Republic. We do not have to worry,  as  people

elsewhere   do,  whether  we  will  have  increased

taxation whenever the Government tables its budget.

The  fundamental spirit of the budget  is  that  of

progress  in  the midst of stability.  This  is  no

exaggeration. This budget incorporates the elements

of   encouragement,  vigour  and  the  spirit   for

betterment.  This is evident from  the  Development

Estimates which total about $411 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Government which professes

to  carry  out democratic socialism,  there  is  no

doubt  that the purpose of our economic development

is  not  just for the benefit of a few capitalists.

It is not to widen the gap between the rich and the

poor  so that the rich becomes richer and the  poor

becomes  poorer. If this were so, then our economic

development  would  lose  its  meaning.   What   is

significant in our economic development?  What  are

its  objectives? I am of the view that the  purpose

of  economic  development  is  to  consolidate  our

national  economy. It should boost up  our  economy

and raise the standard of living of our people.  It

should  create  more  job  opportunities  for   our

people. In other words, the benefits accruing  from

economic  development should be shared  equally  by

all the people. Only thus can it be compatible with

the  principle of democratic socialism.  Only  thus

can we carry out, step by step, our high ideals  of

democratic socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past five years, because

of the active encouragement given by the Government

in  the  field of industrial development,  we  have

been  able to create 58,000 more jobs. Nonetheless,

there  are  still  about  60,000  people  who   are

jobless.  They  are waiting for us  to  help  them.

Therefore,  unemployment is still a  very  critical

and grave social problem in our nation. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



the Finance Minister has said, unless we can during

the  coming five years reduce this spectre then all

the economic gains would be lost in the turmoil  of

social and political unrest. He has also said  that

over  the  next  five  years, from  1966  to  1970,

Singapore  would  need not only  to  wipe  out  the

backlog  of  the  existing  unemployed,  but   also

provide  another 95,000 jobs for our  youths.  They

would be leaving schools and seeking entry into the

labour  market.  Therefore,  it  is  not  a   small

problem.  It  involves  the very  survival  of  our

nation. Five years from now, if we are not able  to

solve this grave problem of unemployment, then  our

people  will suffer and all construction programmes

will have to come to a standstill. Our struggle for

democratic socialism will come to a critical stage.

Therefore, we must concentrate all our efforts  and

go  all out to expand our industrial programme.  We

should  also expand our trade to provide more  jobs

for   our  people  in  order  to  solve  the  grave

unemployment problem. Only thus can we realise  the

ideals of democratic socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk on the

subjects of industrial progress and external  trade

and  to  offer my views on them. Undeniably in  the

past  one  year our industrial programme under  the

guidance of the Economic Development Board has made

good  progress. Let me now quote a certain  portion

of  the  speech by the Minister about  the  pioneer

industry.  He  says  there are  about  165  pioneer

industries. In 1964 there were only 113. At present

about  103 are already in production, while 33  are

in  various stages of implementation. By  September

1966  the total investment of these pioneer  firms,

in  terms  of  fixed assets, has  grown  from  $255

million  at  the  end of 1965  to  more  than  $300

million,  showing an increase of $45  million.  The

total value of output of these firms is expected to

reach  $450  million  this  year  as  against  $318

million  in  1965,  showing  an  increase  of  $132

million.  In terms of employment, the total  number

of workers in pioneer firms has grown from 5,400 at

the  end  of  1964 to 12,000 today, an increase  of

more than 120 per cent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



Therefore, we can see that our industrial programme

has been carried out in practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that in the past two or three years

certain  ignorant politicians, including the  anti-national  Barisan  Sosialis, have  made  statements

mocking our industrial programme. They ridiculed it

saying that it would be a flop. They said that  the

Jurong industrial estate was a stretch of bleak and

desolate land; but now, after a few years, this so-called  bleak and desolate land has become a  grand

industrial  town, with chimneys springing  up  here

and  there. The Jurong industrial estate  has  been

able to earn a large amount of foreign exchange for

us.  I  do not know what is their reaction  to  the

present  site at Jurong now. The reasons  for  such

success are that, firstly, the Government has  been

actively   encouraging  and  promoting   industrial

development.  The  Economic Development  Board  has

been  giving  all  sorts of aid to  the  investors,

including  industrial  financing,  and  a  tax-free

period  of  five  years.  Secondly,  there  is  the

economic and social stability in our country,  plus

our advantageous geographical position. All this is

conducive  to  confidence  and  investment  in  our

country.  Thirdly,  there is labour  stability.  We

have  quite a lot of skilled workers. In  the  past

few  years, under the guidance of the N.T.U.C., our

democratic trade unionism has been put on the right

track  and workers in various sections of  industry

have   been  better  organised.  No  doubt,  labour

stability   is   a  very  important  factor   which

contributes   to   the   success   of    industrial

development, because with the help of large  armies

of labour, we will be in a better position to carry

out  our industrial programme and to boost  up  our

output.  But, at the same time, we must also  treat

the  workers well. This is our basic task. In  this

field,  I believe the N.T.U.C. will look after  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the Finance

Minister, in the past five years, although we have

been able to create 58,000 more jobs for our people

by industrial development, we still fall short of

the number envisaged, which is 70,000 jobs. We are

still short of about 12,000 jobs. This goes to show

that our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



industrialisation  programme has  not  reached  the

anticipated  target and we have to strive  further.

Much  more  effort must be made and better  schemes

must be devised. More incentives must be devised to

help  industrialisation, such as those  which  have

been announced by our Finance Minister, in order to

develop  our  pioneer industry  in  the  next  five

years,  and to cope with our unemployment  problem.

We  are  glad  to hear of the three new  incentives

announced  by our Finance Minister which have  been

well  received  by  our businessmen  and  investors

alike.  With the passage of time, I hope a  lot  of

investment  will go into our industry, either  from

local  sources  or  from abroad. We  welcome  their

active   participation  in  our   industrialisation

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the international

market has become highly competitive. Therefore, we

must  try  our  best to raise the  quality  of  our

products  and  to  lower costs. Only  thus  can  we

compete with products from other countries. Another

method  to  market our produce is to encourage  our

people  to  use  locally-manufactured  goods.   The

Economic  Development Board and  our  manufacturers

should  jointly  hold  trade fairs  and  industrial

fairs  in order to introduce and sell our goods  to

foreigners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the increase in productivity, as far

as I know, certain factories in Jurong have started

a campaign to raise output and yields. They do this

by  giving  cash  and other encouragement.  On  the

other   hand,   the  N.T.U.C.,  the  Manufacturers'

Association and the Employers' Federation have also

drafted a charter for industrial progress in  order

to  guide and encourage the growth of productivity.

From the point of view of democratic socialism,  an

increase  in  output and profit must be accompanied

by  an  increase  in wages, because our  industrial

programme  can be successful only if  the  benefits

are mutually shared by management and labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me review our external trade. According

to  the  Minister for Finance, our  external  trade

export  and  import  trade -  totals  about  $7,200

million.  This  is an increase and  the  reason  is

that,  firstly,  we have pursued a non-aligned  and

neutral foreign policy and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



we  have been able to gain the respect of countries

all over the world. Many countries have established

friendly  trade  links with us. We  have  not  only

maintained our links with our old friends in trade,

but    have    also   established   new    friendly

relationships, including trade relationships,  with

our  new  friends,  including  countries  such   as

Russia,  America,  Britain, Bulgaria  and  Hungary.

They  have all concluded trade treaties with us  on

equal  terms, and African countries are  continuing

to  trade with us. Indonesia has now discarded  its

confrontation policy and has resumed trade with us.

This   will   encourage  our  trade   and   further

contribute  to  our economic prosperity.  Secondly,

our   favourable   and  advantageous   geographical

position  will be a great help. We are situated  at

the  hub  of South-East Asia and at the cross-roads

of  Europe  and Asia. We have favourable conditions

for  a trading centre in South-East Asia, plus  our

harbour which can accommodate big steamers of up to

thousands of tons. On top of this we have very good

harbour   facilities  and  banking  and   insurance

facilities. All these contribute to our  being  the

trading  centre of South-East Asia. It  is  not  an

accident of history. In fact, our port is the fifth

largest  in  the  world. It  has  contributed  very

greatly to our economic life and prosperity and has

earned for us a lot of foreign exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk about public construction by

the Government. The development in this respect has

been  rapidly carried out. The building of bridges,

construction  of  roads and various  projects  will

require  millions  of dollars.  Many  projects  are

nearing completion. When the road linking Connaught

Drive and the Katong area is completed, the traffic

congestion in this area will be relieved. There are

expansions   of  road  surface  and  other   public

projects. All these will tend to solve our  traffic

problem. The Government's vote for the Public Works

Department next year amounts to $34.8 million. This

is  a  large  sum of money. This will be  used  for

various projects in both the rural and urban areas.

One of the projects will be construction work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



to  alleviate the flood situation in certain areas,

and  this  will  be good news to the  residents  in

these areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on another point -

education. The vote for Education for next year  is

the  highest, amounting to $143 million. Other than

recurrent expenditure, $26.5 million will  be  used

to  set up primary and secondary schools to develop

further  our education. From this we can  see  that

the  Government  is paying great attention  to  our

education problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year's vote for Health will be $4 million,

which will provide medical facilities to take  care

of  the  health of our people. The vote for  social

welfare is $10 million for next year, which will be

used to advance the welfare of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the budget for next year is a very

progressive one. Judging from the point of view  of

democratic  socialism, it is  an  ambitious  budget

because  it  reflects  our  firm  determination  in

economic development. It also reflects our wish and

desire  to  promote the standard of living  of  our

people.  It also manifests our resolute spirit  and

confidence    in    marching   towards    a    more

industrialised  and modernised  Republic.  I  fully

support the Government's budget for next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  budget,  introduced   by   the

Minister  for  Finance and after  its  publication,

according  to  what I have learnt,  has  been  well

received  by our society. We know that our Minister

for  Finance  wants to build an ideal  society  and

achieve  economic  prosperity  in  Singapore.   His

ambition  and  desire have been reflected  in  this

budget.  On the whole, it is a successful  one  and

should be supported by all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing it, we normally have two things to

consider. One is to maintain the balance of revenue

and  expenditure. The other is to project into  the

future   to  see  whether  the  various  items   of

expenditure    can   meet   our    basic    minimum

requirements, and whether it is possible to make or

whether  we  have  already made  full  use  of  our

economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



capacity  and have tapped every possible source  of

revenue. On these various aspects I would  like  to

air my views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the budget of a country should not

only  contain economic significance but should also

embody  political as well as cultural significance.

The  Communists regard cultural revolution  as  the

pre-requisite to political revolution and  economic

revolution - as a guiding force for the two or as a

precursor to them. Ours is not a Communist country.

In  this initial period of nation-building,  we  do

not  have very strong inclinations towards cultural

construction and we have not placed it  on  top  of

economic construction. But it does not mean that we

must   entirely   neglect  cultural   construction.

Therefore,  I  feel  that  the  contents   of   the

Minister's  Budget  Statement  in  regard  to   the

cultural  aspects should be reviewed. The  vote  in

1967   for  Culture  and  Social  Affairs  is  $4.3

million. Compared with $7.6 million for 1966, it is

nearly half of the previous vote. The Minister  for

Finance  has explained that it is because  a  large

part of the previous vote was spent on the building

of  T.V. and Radio stations before 1966; they  were

the  major  projects then. Therefore, in  1967  the

vote has been reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see from the budget that the vote for

cultural    construction   for   1967    is    very

insignificant. In this respect, there is  provision

only for the setting up of a library in Queenstown.

It  is the only outstanding project and seems to be

the  only project in cultural construction in which

Government is interested. I would like to point out

that  the  meaning  and  significance  of  cultural

construction  are  not highlighted  in  the  Budget

Statement.  Therefore, it is not quite  in  keeping

with  the  requirements of our present-day society.

We  need  to  give some consideration  to  cultural

construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this budget and the various items of revenue

we  can see the general picture. For instance,  the

possible  revenue  from the Victoria  Theatre  next

year  shows a significant decrease. Perhaps  it  is

due to the fact that next year the theatre will  be

undergoing repairs,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



resulting  in  the  decrease of revenue  from  this

source.  But revenue from criminal fines and  other

fines has shown a marked increase. For instance, in

respect  of  Customs, the revenue will increase  by

$90,000;  in respect of Public Works, the  increase

will be $20,000; in respect of various other items,

the amount to be derived from fines will amount  to

$218,000.  This can only be explained by  the  fact

that  culture  is  deteriorating, whereas  criminal

activities  are  on  the increase  and  this  is  a

symptom of deterioration in social morality.

<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation by Government for cultural

activities  is  very  small, but  the  estimate  of

revenue  from advertisements on T.V. and  Radio  is

much  larger, about $5.3 million - an  increase  of

$1.3  million over the previous year. This can only

be  explained  by the fact that the  Government  is

more  willing  to  add  some commercial  colour  in

cultural  activities  and  is  not  interested   in

developing  culture itself. It is  praiseworthy  of

the  Government to make provision to build a branch

library  in  Queenstown.  But  our  development  in

society  requires that the Government must  have  a

new  prison  in Queenstown at the same  time.  That

means the prison and the library will be seen  side

by  side, which is not a good sight for anybody  at

all.  We  would  like to see more cultural  centres

instead  of more prisons in our society. Of course,

we  fully  appreciate that if one is not fully  fed

and   clad,  one  cannot  talk  about  culture  and

ceremonies.  But  a  certain standard  in  cultural

development  must be maintained in  order  to  keep

pace  with  economic development, otherwise  solely

economic  development will mean the  production  of

more  well-clad and fully fed nincompoops  who  are

good for nothing and uncultured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to economic progress, we must do our

best to have some kind of social education together

with  academic education for our citizens. Although

we have made great achievements and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



progress  in academic education, socially speaking,

social education is still in a state of immaturity.

The  Ministry  of  Culture has not  got  sufficient

financial  resources to push forward  our  cultural

movement.  This is a defect which must be corrected

in good time. The National Theatre is not receiving

financial  aid  from  the  Government  because   of

insufficient  funds  allocated  for  the   cultural

movement.   Initially,  it   depended   on   public

donations.  As soon as the building was  completed,

public donations became rather unreliable, although

they  came in useful in the initial stage. Now that

it  is in the self-development stage, the situation

may  arise  where  it is not enough  to  depend  on

public   donations   alone  for  its   development,

otherwise  we  will  be  in the  same  position  as

Nanyang  University,  which in  the  past  depended

solely  on  public  donations but  now  also  needs

government  aid.  Public donations  alone  are  not

sufficient  to  maintain existing institutions  and

they  are not sufficiently of help to their further

development.  The  present  situation   which   the

National Theatre faces should be an eye-opener  for

us in cultural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see from the Budget Statement that there are

signs  of  prosperity in economic  development  all

round  Singapore.  We also hope that  in  the  next

Budget  Statement  he  will be  able  to  add  some

cultural  colour and instill optimism  in  cultural

construction.  The  Budget  Statement  itself,   of

course,  is  not very much concerned  with  culture

but, generally speaking, it is very encouraging.  I

would like to express my full support for it.



<br><br>4.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to raise

a few points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore achieved independence, it has

made remarkable progress and development in various

fields, such as economy, culture, education, health

and  construction. Within a short year,  tremendous

progress in concrete form



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



has   been  achieved.  Even  foreigners  who  visit

Singapore are full of praise for Singapore. It is a

credit to the efforts put in by the Government. But

as  the  Prime Minister has said, we  must  not  be

complacent about our achievements so far.  We  must

redouble  our  efforts  with  a  view  to   greater

achievements. Therefore, I would like to take  this

opportunity  to speak on some problems existing  in

our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question deals with capital which is a

driving  force  behind our economic activities.  We

all  know  that the Economic Development Board  has

played  a  very important and leading role  in  the

economic  development  of  our  country,  and   its

achievements  are very impressive and  encouraging.

It  is clear that the Government has made very good

progress in encouraging capitalists to come in  and

invest. Certain concessions have been announced  to

attract  more capitalists and foreign capital  into

our  country. In the Budget Statement, the Minister

for  Finance: has said that he has been able to add

to these concessions. He has announced that certain

new  concessions  will be made to  new  industries.

This  is  a  wise move. I hope that both local  and

foreign   capitalists  and  investors   will   take

advantage  of these concessions by coming  here  to

invest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point which I would like to

bring to the attention of the Government, and  that

is   whether  it  has  been  able  to  attract  all

available  idle  capital into  industry.  In  other

words,  is  there not a great deal of idle  capital

which is hesitant to come forward to invest because

of  certain restrictions and requirements? This  is

the  question  we have to answer.  I  believe  that

capital  investment is a must for greater  economic

prosperity.  But are we doing our best  to  attract

all  available capital - idle or otherwise  -  into

production in the interest of our national survival

and  social  prosperity? Where it is necessary,  we

can  relax certain restrictions and regulations  so

that, within a short space of time, a great deal of

hidden  idle  capital may also  be  attracted  into

production.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discovered that there are two kinds of

idle  capital which may be attracted into  industry

to  boost our economic development. Firstly, people

who  have come to stay here have been residents for

many  years.  Some  of them have  become  permanent

residents while others have even become citizens of

our  country.  These people have  accumulated  some

capital  outside  Singapore - in their  country  of

origin.  If  they  are allowed to  bring  in  their

capital  from  outside for investment purposes,  it

will be a good thing for our economy. But so far as

I am aware, these people have not transferred their

liquid  assets from foreign countries to  Singapore

to extend their business here or to invest in fresh

enterprises. There is one factor which  makes  them

hesitate to do this. If they transfer their foreign

capital  or  convert their foreign properties  into

liquid  assets  here in Singapore,  the  Government

will  tax 40 per cent of their capital remitted  to

Singapore  according to the income tax regulations.

So  a  great  deal of their capital is knocked  off

even  before  it is invested locally. This  is  not

very  pleasant for them. Therefore, I feel that  in

order  to  encourage more capitalists to invest  in

economic production, it is necessary - in  fact,  I

would say it is a prerequisite - in this context to

relax certain regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another kind of idle capital

comes  from  our  own people.  Some  of  them  have

capital  for  which  they  are  unable  to  account

legally because it may be difficult for them to  do

so.  So  because  of  this necessity  for  them  to

account  for  their capital, it remains  idle.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is necessary for us to investigate

into the sources of income in certain respects, and

I  do  not,  in fact, advocate that the  Government

entirely  relaxes  all  the  regulations  for  this

purpose.  But there are certain accomplished  facts

in respect of which we may be able to relax certain

regulations.  For example, some people  might  have

acquired  money through illegal means or through  a

windfall.  But  because  of the  regulations  which

require them to account for their capital, money or

income, they have to hide it away. So, in my  view,

in order to give further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



impetus  to our economic development, such  capital

should  be  made  use of. Certain  devices  may  be

worked out to encourage people with such capital to

come  forward to invest. I would suggest that  some

measures may be worked out so that within a  period

of  six months people with unaccountable income  or

capital  may be allowed to invest within  limit  in

certain kinds of production. We will then have more

capital to develop economically. On the other hand,

we  can  also  prevent a lot of  capital  remaining

idle.  This is a good thing to those who have  such

idle  capital, and it is also a good thing  to  our

nation  and  society as a whole.  I  believe  that,

apart   from  attracting  and  encouraging  foreign

capital,  our Government must also encourage  local

and national capitalists to come forward to invest.

So  certain positive measures must be worked out to

attract  this  frozen idle capital into  our  local

production so that it will become useful capital. I

must,  of course, stress that, by so doing, we  are

not  going  to  encourage people in trying  to  get

money  through illegal means, but in the past  some

people  did so. So if we encourage them by relaxing

certain  regulations for the time being  or  for  a

certain limited period of time, I think it will  be

a   more  realistic  approach.  Otherwise,  as  the

Minister for Finance has said in his Annual  Budget

Statement,   this  capital  would   invariably   be

invested  in  some finance companies  which  borrow

money at high interest rates to be lent out in turn

at even higher interest rates, thereby making these

finance companies a very risky enterprise, which is

no  security  to the depositors. As  far  as  I  am

aware,  a lot of poor people have saved some  money

and  deposited  it  in such finance  companies.  If

these  finance  companies do  not  have  sufficient

funds  and  are engaged in risky enterprises,  then

the  people who suffer will be the poor people  who

have  saved up some money and invested it in  these

finance  companies. It is, therefore,  praiseworthy

that   the  Finance  Minister  is  proposing   some

legislative action against these finance companies.

But  if the idle capital that I have mentioned just

now can be used gainfully, as I have suggested,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



then  a  lot of finance companies would not compete

among themselves for more deposits at high interest

rates,  and  at the same time the depositors  would

have  their  money  safely invested  in  productive

enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk now about trade relations in

Asia as a whole. As we all know, in the past decade

it  has  been the international tendency to  switch

from international and long-distance trade to short-distance local and regional trade. This is  because

it  has been realised that it is important to  have

regional  co-operation. Short-distance  trade  will

save  a great deal of financial and human resources

and  time,  particularly in the case of a  backward

and  emerging country. This kind of trade  must  be

strengthened and consolidated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country is positioned in the central part of

Asia and it is the gateway to the East and West. So

our  fate is inseparable from that of the whole  of

Asia. We have all the facilities and infrastructure

for  trade and commerce with other Asian countries.

We  are in a very advantageous position and  it  is

necessary  for  us to set up new trade  links  with

other  countries and strengthen existing ones  with

other  Asian  countries.  After  our  independence,

several  trade missions have been sent  to  African

and  East European countries, and, as a result,  we

have  concluded  several  trade  pacts  with  those

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one big country in Asia which has

been  overlooked and with which we have no official

relations.  I refer to China which has a population

of 700 million. This population provides us with  a

tremendous  market  which  we  must  not  overlook.

Undoubtedly  we  must recognize  that  our  foreign

policy  is neutral and non-aligned. This is  in  so

far  as politics is concerned. But for our survival

and for more prosperity, economically speaking, our

economic  activities must have a  wider  scope  for

expansion,  since  this  is  in  keeping  with  our

policy.  We  must  make friends with  more  people,

irrespective  of their political ideology.  It  is,

therefore,  a  good thing that  we  should  set  up

commercial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



and  trade relations with China, which is  a  great

nation in Asia. Whether it is for us to do business

with them or to sell our finished products to them,

is  all  to our advantage. Perhaps some people  may

criticise  me  for  making this suggestion,  but  I

would  say  that if they do so, they are trying  to

add  political colour to purely economic relations.

We   want   to  survive.  We  want  to  have   more

prosperity.  Therefore, it  is  necessary  that  we

should send some form of trade mission to China  to

win over this tremendous market for our country. We

must set up some kind of reciprocal trade relations

with China. This is necessary and essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the financial policy of

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have read

the  Budget  Statement by the Finance  Minister.  I

believe  that when I make my speech,  he  does  not

expect  to get a bouquet from me. However,  I  will

give him the bouquet he deserves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Thank

you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I read his Budget Speech with

pleasure  and  optimism. I have followed  it  very,

very  closely, and I have no hesitation  in  saying

and   agreeing   with  him  that  the   uncertainty

following  the  separation has been dispelled,  and

that  Singapore, as expected, will continue to have

a  buoyant economy. It is appreciated that if  each

sector plays the role assigned to it, there can  be

no  reason  why  we should harbour any  fears  that

Singapore  will not solve not only its unemployment

problem  but  also set an example to  the  rest  of

South-East  Asia, including our hostile  neighbour,

that we have really become a welfare State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that the economy is

forging  ahead with substantial increases in  gross

domestic product, external trade market, and so on.

While   identifying  myself  with  the   sentiments

expressed by the Minister for Finance, I cannot for

a  moment  subscribe  to his undue  optimism  which

apparently is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



not matched by a stroke of realism. I am not for  a

moment making any suggestion to the effect that  we

are   misled   by   our  Finance   Minister,   but,

nevertheless, as a Backbencher of the ruling  Party

-  not  on the Opposition, of course and as a trade

union  leader who has the interests of the  working

class  at  heart, I cannot but express reservations

with  regard  to  the  Finance Minister's  approach

towards  the solution of confronting problems  that

appear  to face Singapore both in the economic  and

political spheres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether the economy can afford to

produce  more  or less the number of  new  jobs  to

reduce   the   present   rate   of   increase    of

unemployment, especially when we have  one  of  the

youngest populations in this region, and also  when

we recognise the fact that 10 to 15 per cent of the

economically  active population are  unemployed.  A

casual  look  at  the  speech with  regard  to  the

unemployment figures appears to convince me that  -

to borrow his own expression:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore would need not only to wipe off the

backlog  of  the  existing  unemployed,  but   also

provide  another  95,000 jobs for our  youths,  who

would be leaving schools and seeking entry into the

labour market.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we add these figures, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the

number  of unemployed at the end of 1965, that  is,

56,300,  we  arrive at the shocking  figure, viz.,

151,300 unemployed. The pioneer industries, the pet

project  of  our  Government, and our  people  have

provided jobs for only 12,000 up to today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'During the period 1961-1965, employment

opportunities increased by 57,600 jobs.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, four very important facts appear to

crystallise  out of these figures provided  by  the

Finance   Minister.  First  of  all,  the   pioneer

industries have only provided one-fifth of the  new

employment  available during the past  five  years.

Secondly, we are faced with the tremendous task  of

providing  employment for 151,300 during  the  next

five  years. Thirdly, based on our past  experience

as  well  as from the information provided  by  the

Finance Minister, if we keep up the present rate of

an average of 11,520 jobs per year during the next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



five years, even with our herculean efforts and our

excellent  optimism, we will only be in a  position

to  provide new jobs for 57,600 people during 1966-1970. In other words, there will be a spill-over of

93,700 in the labour market of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has stressed the fact that

the   manufacturing   sector  alone   can   provide

employment during the next few years. Based on past

performances, the manufacturing industries can only

provide  new  employment for 5,729 per annum;  from

his  figures  which  I  have  taken  (47,217  minus

41,488). Thus during the next five years the  total

new  employment opportunities in the  manufacturing

industries would be 28,645. I am not for  a  moment

ignoring   the  multiplier  effect  of   employment

provided    in    the   manufacturing   industries.

Nevertheless,  I  would  rather  warn  the  Finance

Minister that in his unwarranted optimism he  might

be  caught in the pitfalls of the economy. I wonder

whether  the manufacturing sector can really  raise

the  employment figures thrice in a matter of  five

years from today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have also to recognise the

fact  that  every  year 19,000  teenagers  will  be

entering  the labour market, based on  the  figures

supplied by the Finance Minister. I wonder  whether

the  present system of liberal education has "tuned

and   tailored"  the  labour  force  to  meet   the

requirements  of  our industrialisation.  Otherwise

you  will have a very strange paradox that, on  the

one  hand,  you  will  have a  large  reservoir  of

unemployed with a secondary education, and, on  the

other  hand,  you will find a lack of  skilled  and

semi-skilled labour force. This situation  is  fast

developing in Singapore and I am glad to note  that

the  Finance  Minister has accepted  my  suggestion

during my criticism of the budget last year when  I

advocated   a   crash  programme   to   solve   the

unemployment problem. I am all for gearing  up  the

present    educational   system   to    meet    the

requirements.  It  is high time  that  the  Finance

Minister  also  thinks in terms of incorporating  a

training programme within plants and industries for

producing specialised labour. If the employers  and

Government will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



consider these suggestions, the unions in Singapore

will go all out to make it a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding our industrialisation programme, while

congratulating the Finance Minister on initiating a

bold  approach, I cannot give the seal of  approval

of the trade union movement, especially with regard

to   all  the  steps  to  increase  production.  We

definitely  support  the  Government's  efforts  to

attract   both  foreign  and  indigenous   capital.

Nevertheless,  I would prefer to sound  a  note  of

caution  or  warning with regard to the quality  of

foreign capital that enters the Singapore arena. We

do  not  want  to  encourage  those  entrepreneurs,

whether  they  are from Hongkong or Timbuctoo,  who

would  be only interested in exploiting labour  and

accumulating  profits  on  the  basis  of   sweated

labour.  Many  of  them might have exhausted  their

quotas  in  foreign market from their countries  of

origin,  and these birds of passage might  consider

Singapore as a convenient place for exploitation of

labour  and  building up new quotas. This  type  of

capital is unlikely to be helpful to the economy or

the  larger  interests of this nation in  the  long

run.  Hence,  I will be extremely grateful  if  the

Finance  Minister can give an unqualified assurance

to  the  labour force in this country that  in  his

enthusiasm  to  create  a  climate  favourable  for

foreign  capital,  he  will  not  follow  a  policy

consistent  with  a Gladstonian economy.  Unless  a

categorical assurance is given to the workers,  the

possibility of our co-operation is rather remote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister's advocacy for a

productivity  drive  is well taken  by  the  labour

force.  But  he  should realise that  labour  alone

cannot increase productivity. Secondly, even  in  a

plant  or  industry where the productivity  is  not

high,  it  need  not necessarily mean  that  labour

should be held responsible. Low productivity  might

be   due   to   inefficient,   unqualified   family

management,  which employs cousins and nieces,  and

excessive    investment   on    overheads,    wrong

predictions   made  by  the  entrepreneurs,   large

inventory  due to lack of understanding of  market,

absence of specialised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



skill due to inadequate training programme  of

the  industries,  and so on. The  possibility  does

exist  of an industry even with 100 per cent labour

efficiency which is still unable to make the grade.

So  why  blame  only  labour  for  not  helping  to

increase  productivity? Hence it is high  time  the

Treasury  benches  refrain from  the  over-emphasis

that  labour  should further tighten  its  belt  to

increase  productivity.  Labour,  of  course,  will

continue  to  co-operate in  increasing  efficiency

provided  the  management will answer the  question

"At  what  price  do  you want labour  to  increase

productivity?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder what the Finance

Minister  had  in mind when he mentioned  that  the

Government  will  hold  "a  fair  balance   between

management  and  labour". If he  had  in  mind  any

decision  to be made by the Government, ipso  facto

to  be  accepted and implemented by labour,  he  is

sadly  mistaken.  Any unilateral  approach  coupled

with  the  hysteria  of "industrialisation  at  any

cost" would be completely rejected by labour if  it

amounts to the exploitation of the interest of  the

working  class.  I am greatly disappointed  at  the

Minister for Finance with regard to his budget  for

1967   making  no  provision  for  its  daily-rated

employees. The Finance Minister knew full well that

the 1961 collective agreement solemnly entered into

between  the  management as  an  employer  and  the

Public Daily-Rated Employees Unions Federation  has

not  been  implemented by the authority. During  my

budget speech last year, after the Finance Minister

had  presented his budget, I made the case for  the

daily-rated  Government employees  quite  explicit,

and  I  was  under  the impression  that  he  would

introduce  the necessary provision in  this  year's

budget  which  will  meet the requirement  of  this

particular  case. But, unfortunately,  the  Finance

Minister, who quoted Dr Benham last year to reject

the demand of the Government daily-rated employees,

has  maintained a Sphinx-like silence this year  by

making  no  provision  in the  budget  estimate  in

meeting the requirement under the terms of the 1961

agreement. In short, are we supposed to come to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



conclusion  that  when the Government  attests  its

signature  to  any  agreement as  an  employer,  it

deserves to be treated as a scrap of paper and that

implementation  of a collective agreement  is  only

applicable  to the private sector and  not  to  the

public  sector?  If Government can flout  its  past

agreements and assurances, I do not see any  reason

why a private employer should not follow suit. I am

extremely doubtful how we can increase productivity

with  a  dissatisfied, disillusioned and  disgusted

labour  force. It is high time the Finance Minister

and the Prime Minister wake up from their "slumber'

and  prove  to the workers that they do believe  in

the expression, "Industrial Peace With Justice".  I

would  like  to  say here in this  House,  for  the

information of Members, that today the situation in

regard  to  the  dispute between the Public  Daily-Rated   Employees   Unions   Federation   and   the

Government  is  explosive.  If  we  cannot  find  a

solution, then there is no way out, they are  going

on  strike. If you have read the editorial  of  the

Sin   Chew  lit  Poh  yesterday,  even  the   paper

suggested,  "Why cannot both parties  get  together

and talk and negotiate, and if they cannot talk and

negotiate, why cannot the Government send this case

to  the  court?" Now the Government says,  "No,  we

will break the strike." Suppiah says, "We are going

on strike and let you break it." So, where do we go

from here?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We are not on Government-labour

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member is trying to

relate  this  to his regret that the  Minister  for

Finance did not make provision for payment. I was a

recollection   is   correct,  Mr   Ho,   you   are

anticipating  something for which you  have  got  a

Question  down for tomorrow or the day  after,  and

there  is a Standing Order against anticipation  of

matters that are coming up in some other form.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shudder to

think  that, as in 1962, the same thing will happen

again  within two or three weeks' time. All of  you

are aware that in 1962 Singapore was plunged into a

state of chaos. You saw night-soil vans overturned,

heaps of rubbish everywhere. Do we want to see this

kind  of  situation  happen?  So  why  cannot   the

Government  refer  this matter to  the  Arbitration

Court?  Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said,  how  can

you expect labour to increase productivity? Further

it  is highly unrealistic to suggest that the wages

of  daily-rated employees, who have put in 5 to  20

years'  service in the different Ministries, should

be  compared with the existing rate in  the  labour

market,  before  a  decision could  be  taken  with

regard to wage revision. In that case, applying the

same principle, I wonder whether the senior boys in

the  Treasury,  who might have helped  our  Finance

Minister to prepare the budget, would be willing to

accept  salaries consistent with the existing  rate

in  the  labour market for a fresh Honours graduate

from  a  university.  I do not  believe  they  will

accept  the  rate. So why blame the  public  daily-rated workers? Perhaps our Government, particularly

the  Prime Minister and the Finance Minister,  will

provide    the    necessary    candle-power     for

enlightenment. Give an explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While stressing on the so-called fair balance

between management and labour and the necessity  to

provide basic facilities, the Finance Minister  has

not  sufficiently emphasised the role of the  State

Economic   Consultative   Council   which    should

necessarily  be  the  back-bone  in  smoothing  the

process of industrial relations. So far it has  not

been that effective and it is high time the Council

is  rejuvenated  and  that more sub-committees  are

formed within the orbit of the Consultative Council

so   that   problems   in   industrial   relations,

productivity   and   so   on,   affecting   labour,

management or the Government can be thrashed out in

an atmosphere of understanding and appreciation. It

will  relieve  tension and also help  in  exploring

more  avenues  of co-operation so that  labour  and

management   can  form  a  basis  of  understanding

without losing their respective identities.  It  is

my fervent hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Government will take the  initiative  in

this  direction if it sincerely wants  to  smoothen

the process of industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to industrialisation, it is gratifying to

note  that  the Finance Minister has  accepted  the

crash   programme   which  I  advocated   in   this

Parliament a year ago. But he should remember  that

he has to take into account two factors, namely:  a

policy with regard to raw materials and markets.  A

few   among   our  industries,  like  the   plywood

industry,   depend   on  our  neighbour   for   raw

materials.  A  situation is fast developing  where,

with  open  hostility,  our neighbour  is  exerting

economic  pressure on us with a view  to  crippling

our  economy. So we should look elsewhere  for  raw

materials.  If  we are not careful about  this,  it

might  result  in  a  ban  on  the  supply  of  raw

materials  which  in turn might  create  jerks  and

jolts  in  our  economy. Under  such  conditions  I

wonder whether it is possible in future to think in

terms  of  establishing industry with raw  material

from  abroad at competitive rates so that  we  will

not  face  a  situation with the sword of  Damocles

hanging over our head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further in his speech the Minister for Finance,

while   quoting   facts   and   figures   of    the

industrialisation  programme,  has  not  told  this

House  whether any market survey has been conducted

by  the  Economic  Development  Board.  Without   a

knowledge  of and understanding backed by  relevant

facts and figures of international markets for  our

products,  we are unlikely to make much headway  in

our  industrialisation programme. I am quite  eager

to   know  what  steps  have  been  taken  by   the

Government  in this direction and where they  stand

with regard to markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister appears to have gloated over

the  fact that the Gross Domestic Product  in  1965

has  increased  by $206 million to $3,017  million,

representing  the rate of growth of  7.3  per  cent

over 1964. While admitting the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



that  the  economy  is surging forward,  we  cannot

afford  to relax as Socialists unless and until  we

have  relevant and reliable information with regard

to  the distribution of income. If the increase  in

the  rate of growth has not resulted in eliminating

inequalities but perpetuating them we cannot afford

to  congratulate him on presenting these attractive

figures before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking in general terms the

Budget  for  1967 is rather pragmatic and  also  is

consistent    with    our   general    policy    of

industrialisation. The allocation  for  development

expenditure and the fund reserved for education and

social services are sufficient, bearing in mind our

financial resources and also our goal for a  better

and  more prosperous Singapore. Further the Finance

Minister  has not introduced new taxes  which  will

hit  the  less privileged class in Singapore.  From

that  point  of view, I must say that  the  Finance

Minister  may get all the bouquets from the  common

man.  Nevertheless,  the people  of  Singapore  are

likely to watch every step the Government takes  in

implementing its programme and I only wish that  in

its  over-enthusiasm during the transformation from

an  entrepot economy to an industrialised State, it

would  not  sacrifice the interests of the  working

class.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

standing  here  to  give a little  bouquet  to  the

Finance  Minister, not like my colleague, the  hon.

Member for Bras Basah, who is giving him additional

grey  hairs with his speech! The second  budget  of

the independent Republic of Singapore presented  by

the  Hon. Minister for Finance in the House on  5th

December marks a better and brighter future for our

national economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also gratifying to note that he has

presented a surplus budget in this House at a  time

when  quite  a  number of developing countries  are

having a deficit budget session at this moment.  To

a newly independent, stable and progressive society

like ours, such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



a  fiscal  policy  adopted by the Finance  Minister

would  encourage  more economic activity,  and  the

investment  is beneficial to our initial  stage  of

industrial  development. The 1967 Budget  not  only

gives the public a sense of economic stability  and

prosperity,  but  also  a  sense  of  security  and

survival of our country in this turbulent  part  of

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be a sound

and  efficient  fiscal policy for our  budget  next

year  if  it  was not for the increase  of  driving

licence  fees.  This  affects all  driving  licence

holders. Furthermore, it directly affects the  wage

earners  and lower income group. The rich will  not

mind  this  increase, but the poor  and  the  lower

income  group,  like those who  earn  a  living  as

irregular  or part-time drivers, will experience  a

corresponding fall in their income. Therefore, they

will  be  shouldering an additional  burden.  As  a

result,  Sir, the very poor and lower income  group

seems  to pay a somewhat larger proportion of their

income  than  the  middle and  upper  income  class

groups. It may not be the intention of the Finance

Minister to add another burden to the lower  income

group  just  to get an additional revenue  of  $1.8

million. But the fact is that with such a  fall  in

the  income of this lower income group, there  will

be  less butter and bread for their families.  Sir,

how   can   the  desired  standard  of  living   be

maintained   in  such  a  state?  With   his   wide

experience and knowledge of economics, the  Finance

Minister could have easily found alternative  means

to  raise  the  additional revenue of $1.8  million

from  sources such as luxury products, e.g., whisky

and  brandy, which all the rich men drink  and  not

the  poorer men, instead of increasing this driving

fee licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all in all, I think the 1967 Budget is a

very  sound  one  and  I wish to  congratulate  the

Finance Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think this is a convenient time to

suspend  for  tea. I suspend the sitting  and  will

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to congratulate

the  Minister for Finance of the State of Singapore

on his success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the tax rise announced by the

Minister  for  Finance  is with  the  objective  of

raising   the   economic  status  of   the   State,

particularly   in  view  of  the  fact   that   our

neighbour,  Malaysia,  has imposed  a  similar  tax

increase.  If  we do not impose a similar  rise  as

Malaysia has done, our economy will be affected.  I

believe  our Minister would not have increased  the

tax  if  Malaysia had not already  done  so.  After

Singapore became an independent State, its progress

has been remarkable, which is due to the efficiency

of  the  Minister for Finance. This is commendable.

There  is  every prospect that we will continue  to

prosper in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to associate

myself   with  the  sentiments  expressed   by   my

colleagues who have supported the Budget  Statement

of  the  Minister for Finance. We  see  it  as  the

initial  budget  of  a budding nation.  Though  our

nation   lacks  natural  resources,  it   has   the

determination  and  has  taken  positive  steps  to

develop and protect the interest of our people  and

the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the indulgence of the Minister, I wish

to  speak  on a few points in the Budget Statement.

It  is  noted  that the annual rate of increase  in

Gross  Domestic Product during the period  1960  to

1965  is  only 8.5 per cent, and that in  1965  the

gross capital formation increased by 11.8 per  cent

over 1964, accounting for about 15 per cent of  the

Gross Domestic Product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note the frankness of the

Minister  for Finance in admitting that this  falls

short  of the 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent rate  of

capital  accumulation which is considered necessary

for self-sustaining growth in developing countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is noted from the external trade

figures  that  the re-export of goods has  declined

from  37.9  per cent in 1964 to 36.2  per  cent  in

1965.  Although  it may be argued  that  a  certain

percentage  of imported goods have to  be  retained

either   as  raw  materials  or  capital  equipment

required  for  new and developing  industries,  the

figures of import valued at $3,017.9 million during

the first nine months of this year as compared with

exports  amounting  to  only $2,494.6  million  are

quite   disconcerting.   They   show   a   definite

unfavourable balance of trade, despite an  increase

of 13.3 per cent in exports over last year. If this

trend continues, we shall soon be a nation in debt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I trust that with the establishment of

direct trading relations with other countries, as a

result  of  visits  of  their  trade  missions   to

Singapore,  and with the possibility of  resumption

of  trade with Indonesia, there will be hope for an

expansion of our external trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget Statement shows an external

reserve  of  $1,038 million - an increase  of  $123

million  over last year. It also shows an  external

debit  account of $61.75 million - an  increase  of

$2.75 million over last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the separation of currency in June next

year,  though  our currency will be  supported  and

issued at par value of our external reserves,  with

the  unfavourable balance of trade and the  payment

of  interest on international loans, there is  fear

that  there  may be a considerable depreciation  of

our   external  reserves  unless  proper  care   is

maintained  and our external trade and  balance  of

payments are watched very carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has a population which is nearing

two  million and more than half of this  population

comprise young people. In addition, 40,000 children

are  born  every year and about 20,000 are  leaving

school yearly to look for jobs and swell the  ranks

of our unemployed every year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the efforts of the Minister for Health

in  advocating family planning are praiseworthy,  I

wonder  to what extent does he really believe  that

population  growth can be controlled by  Government

effort to push through contraceptives?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bearing in mind our ever-increasing

population,   we  are  faced  with  the   attendant

problems of providing more houses, more schools and

more jobs. These are really domestic problems.  But

our improved port facilities should be utilised  to

provide  employment opportunities  and  sources  of

revenue  for  our  Republic.  Exports  have  to  be

increased  so that we will be able to pay  for  the

consumer goods imported for the use of our  growing

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next subject I would like

to  touch  upon is rural development. Although  the

Minister for Finance in his Budget Speech has  laid

stress  on  the importance of industrial and  urban

development, he has regrettably omitted  sufficient

mention  of  rural  development  schemes.   It   is

unlikely  that  in  the near  future  all  land  in

Singapore  will  be utilised for urban  development

and,  hence, of necessity, some land will still  be

available for rural development schemes,  and  this

aspect   of  development  should  be  given   equal

treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas, our farmers and producers of

primary  products  are  working  hard  to  increase

output.  I feel that encouragement should be  given

to  them  to  enable  them  to  produce  sufficient

poultry,   livestock,  etc, to  make   appreciable

exports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that if sufficient attention and drive is

given  to  rural  development and to  producers  of

primary  products  as  has  been  given  to   urban

development and industry, the output of farmers can

be   increased  considerably  for  the  benefit  of

Singapore as a whole and of our export trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as a Back-bencher echoing the

sentiments  of the general public of  Singapore,  I

should  like to observe that the present Government

is  one  of the best in South-East Asia. Our people

have  every  confidence  in  the  commitments   and

sincerity and integrity of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



Government.  Furthermore, the countries  around  us

also  share the same view, which I feel is a  great

tribute to us.



<br><br>5.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget

as presented to this House is a useful and down-to-earth  one. This is to be expected in view  of  the

special circumstances in which Singapore is placed.

We  are  a  small nation with no natural resources.

Our  only resources are our manpower. This at  once

is  our asset and our problem. We have a tremendous

reservoir  of manpower which, if properly  deployed

and  developed,  would lead us to fortune,  but  if

neglected  would be the cause of our failure.  This

basic problem of ours is realised by our Government

and  positive steps are being taken to  combat  it.

Unfortunately,  this is a problem which  cannot  be

solved overnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives me confidence, however, to observe that

the Minister in charge of financial affairs was the

person   who,  as  Chairman  of  the  Housing   and

Development Board, was responsible for breaking the

back  of our housing problem. He is now at the helm

of   our  financial  affairs  actively  engaged  in

tackling  this unemployment problem.  In  order  to

solve it, a great deal of thought has been spent on

industrialisation;  but in order  to  industrialise

effectively, we need a market. Singapore by  itself

is  too small to provide a market to absorb all the

products  that  our  factories can  turn  out.  Our

attention, therefore, is turned to export. However,

our  industrialists are not quite familiar with the

export  market.  Therefore, in order  to  encourage

them  to  export,  we  have to  offer  them  export

incentives.  In  last  year's  budget,  there  were

certain  incentives offered, but these  were  found

insufficient and I am glad to observe that in  this

year's  budget, the incentives we offer  are  of  a

bold  and  imaginative kind and should do  well  to

encourage our industrialists to export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, however, I find that the

Minister for Finance was practically silent on  the

prospects of our export markets. A great  deal  was

said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



last  year about the finding of export markets with

the help of the Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

read  from  last year's Budget Speech contained  in

Volume 24, No. 2, column 49 of Hansard in which the

Minister,  with  reference to prospective  markets,

said, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I should like, Mr Speaker, to go into some

detail  on the question of prospective markets  for

our  manufactured  goods. These fall  roughly  into

four categories :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Markets in the developed, highly

industrialised countries of the world;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) New markets in Africa and Eastern Europe;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Markets to be provided by those countries

which    have   been   consistently    running

favourable balances of trade with us; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Markets in those countries which have a

vested  interest  in ensuring  that  Singapore

remains  viable and stable so that,  in  turn,

their   own   security   interests   are   not

jeopardized.'.



<br><br>I am afraid no further reference to this particular

development  is  contained in  the  present  Budget

Speech,  especially in regard to  category  (d)  as

contained  in  last  year's Budget  Speech  of  the

Finance  Minister  -  that  is,  markets  in  those

countries which have a vested interest in  ensuring

that Singapore remains a viable and stable country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister for Finance in his

reply will inform the House what progress has  been

made  in this particular respect and what prospects

there  are for our industrial products being  taken

up by these particular markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the year, Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  were  certain bi-lateral agreements  entered

into  with  East European countries, but  it  would

appear  that we were significantly unsuccessful  in

getting  a foothold in the African market in  spite

of  the fact that a trade mission had been to  that

continent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the debate on last year's budget and

I  notice that there was a good suggestion from the

hon.  Member  for  Punggol: he recommended  to  the

Government to consider the question of creating  an

export credit guarantee agency. This may be one  of

the ways of helping our exporters. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



the  hon. Member for Punggol argued, exporters  are

usually  unfamiliar with export markets,  and  they

are  not  quite willing to risk their resources  in

such  markets unless they can be reasonably assured

that there is a return on their exports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is difficult to comment upon

the  Budget Speech in view of the fact that we were

given  so little time in which to prepare and  also

the  fact that a lot of information is not  at  our

disposal. However, I would like to touch on  a  few

subjects  that  appear  in the  current  Budget  as

presented by the Finance Minister. May I, first  of all,   take   the   question   of   building    and construction? As appearing in the Budget Statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The value of buildings commenced in the first

six  months of this year stood at $56.5 million  as

against  $80.7  million for the  same  period  last

year.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, a drop of something like $24

million.  I think the responsibility for this  drop

in  the  development of buildings and  construction

must  be laid at the door of high rates. I am  glad

that in the present budget the Finance Minister  is

making  provision  to lower the  rate  for  special

development  and  for  development  in   designated

areas.  Unfortunately it would appear that this  is

rather  restricted  and  is  not  broad  enough  to

encourage   private  development,   especially   of

commercial  buildings. A great deal  of  labour  is

employed in the construction industry and  a  boost

to  that industry will, in fact, be one of the ways

of helping the unemployment problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

recommend  the  Government to have a  look  at  the

present  legislation regarding  rent  control?  The

present  legislation may be an  impediment  in  the

development    of   building   and    construction,

especially  of  commercial buildings.  Perhaps  the

Government may wish to have a look at this  problem

and  possibly decide, for example, on selective de-control. This could first be done in the commercial

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solution to this problem may be the

setting up of a tribunal to settle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



the  question  of  disputes between  landlords  and

tenants  on the amount of compensation payable  for

removal.  If  this suggestion does not find  favour

with  the Government, I wonder whether it  will  at

least  appoint a committee to look into  the  whole

question  of  rent  control  and  its  effects   on

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to see the announced intention of

the  Government  to  control finance  companies.  I

think this is the appropriate time to do so. We are

an  affluent  society. A lot of us  are  living  on

credit. In fact, we may term our present economy as

an H.P. (hire-purchase) economy. I think it is high

time  that  legislation  should  be  introduced  to

protect  the  consuming public against unscrupulous

finance companies, not only, as the Minister in his

statement says, to protect the depositors but  also

to protect the borrowers from the finance companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that in the Budget Statement there is no

mention  whatsoever of our public transport system,

although sometime ago we saw in the Press that  the

Government  wanted  the  companies  running  public

transport  to come together to work out  a  certain

scheme to better serve the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> On a point of

clarification, Mr Speaker. I wonder  if  the  hon.

Member was referring to an article in the Malaysian

Times,  when  the Malaysian Minister for  Transport

came  down  to  Singapore and  had  some  hush-hush

meeting with the bus companies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> No, Mr Speaker, I was not

referring  to that. I was referring to the  meeting

of  the transport companies. I think it was at  the

invitation  -  I am not too sure,  I  stand  to  be

corrected - of the Minister of State for the  Prime

Minister's Department. But we have heard nothing of

that  since,  and  I  was  wondering  whether   the

Government  will  now  contemplate  legislation  to

nationalise  public transport so  that  the  public

transport  system  can  be  a  more  rational   and

efficient one than it is at present.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with industrialisation, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as we said in the debate  over  the

subject  of resettlement last Monday, I  think  the

Government may be paying far too much attention  to

industrialisation and not enough to the problems of

the  farming  community. As I  have  said,  farming

properly developed may again be one of the ways  of

finding  more job opportunities for our unemployed,

since, at the present stage of development, it is a

labour intensive industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see from the financial statement, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that  a tremendous amount of money  is  being

given out on loan to the Economic Development Board

for the development of Jurong. Jurong, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  an imaginative scheme. I think  it  is  a

scheme  of  which we in Singapore should be  justly

proud. On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  you

go  to  Jurong you can see that a lot of sites  are

not  being  taken up and it would possibly  benefit

the  Government to spend more thought on attracting

foreign  manufacturers to Jurong before  developing

Jurong further. There is no point in developing the

sites  when they are not being taken up.  It  would

only  be  locking  up a lot of financial  resources

which  could be better deployed elsewhere.  On  the

whole,  Mr  Speaker, this is  a  practical  budget

devoid  of  dramatic changes which,  unfortunately,

in, our  present state of development the  Finance

Minister is not able to make. I support the budget.



<br><br>6.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, for the Budget Speech  for  1967

delivered  by  him on 5th December, 1966,  we  must

shower congratulations on the Minister for Finance,

although there has been an increase in road tax and

driving licences too. We understand that to develop

a  new  emergent State like ours in  Singapore,  we

must  have  a  balanced budget  in  line  with  the

developments which we have made. We also appreciate

the  increased  allocation  for  the  Ministry   of

Foreign  Affairs  to  establish  missions   in   12

countries.  There is a possibility that the  number

may increase in future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Speech we find

that  the  road  tax  and licence  fees  have  been

increased. What I am referring to here is that  the

Minister  for  Finance,  in  preparing  his  Budget

Speech,  naturally  must  have  taken  considerable

time, and due consideration must have been given to

how  to  raise  more  money and  increase  revenue.

Possibly  in  raising new taxes  the  Minister  for

Finance thinks that licence holders are car owners.

If  that is his assumption, then it is an erroneous

one.  There  are licence holders who  are  not  car

owners  but who work as drivers. When we  levy  the

new  taxes  on drivers and licence holders,  it  is

certain  that, as has been mentioned  by  the  hon.

Member  for Changi, it will be an extra  burden  to

them as they belong to the lower income group.  But

it  is not so with licence holders who, at the same

time,  are  car owners. They cannot only afford  to

pay  the increased licence fees, but they can  also

employ drivers. To such people, the increased rate,

in  my  opinion, is not a burden. They can pay  not

only  $10 but $20. But to those who become  drivers

by occupation, it will be a bitter pill for them to

swallow.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance  can

find  ways and means to exempt them from the  newly

increased road tax, if they are employed as drivers

in  a  Ministry  or in a commercial  firm.  Licence

holders  who are car owners should not be exempted.

In  the  case  of drivers, I ask the  Minister  for

Finance to give due consideration as to whether the

extra  tax should be levied upon the employers,  or

to do whatever he thinks best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, the financial

policy   for  1967  is  fair  because  a   lot   of

development is being carried out at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  the  1967 Budget Statement given  by  the

Finance  Minister  is  a very encouraging  one.  It

gives us great stimulation and impetus, and,  as  a

result,  the people have full confidence  in  their

future.  I  believe this Budget Statement  will  be

welcomed by the people at large.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main feature of this financial policy is

that,  apart from some adjustments in road tax  and

an increase in driving licence fee, there have been

no  increases in other taxes. We cannot only arrive

at  a  balance in the budget, but we can also  have

some  surplus. This surplus reflects  the  economic

stability  of  our  country,  which  is  of   great

importance  to  a  developing  country.   In   many

countries,  particularly in the emerging countries,

financial and economic instability always leads  to

political   unrest  and  social  chaos.  Therefore,

economic  stability  is one of the  most  important

factors in the Government policy in order to  bring

about  an  improvement  in the  livelihood  of  the

people  and  to lead our country into  a  state  of

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first achieved independence, some people

expressed doubts and were very sceptical about  our

ability  to survive. But after a year of  struggle,

we  can show, from the present financial statement,

that  we  are not only able to survive but  we  are

also   able  to  do  something  better  to  develop

ourselves.   Mr  Speaker,  the  Budget   Statement

reflects the realistic foresight of our Government.

Although we are devoid of any natural resources, we

are able to expand our industrialisation and to win

more foreign markets for our local products. We are

also able to create more job opportunities for  our

people.  From this Budget Statement we can see  for

ourselves  that  the  Government  is  giving   full

encouragement to various quarters. This is all very

encouraging.  Government  is  encouraging  our  own

people  to  take  part  in  industrial  and   urban

development by giving them some kind of  incentive,

such  as the reduction of property tax from 36  per

cent  to  12 per cent. This is a far-reaching  plan

which  is  welcomed. But we can also see  that  the

concession of property tax is not so well  modelled

on  the pioneer concessions given in the industrial

sector.  There  is  no  time limit  given  to  this

concession on property tax. Because of  this,  the

people  who  participate  in  urban  renewal   will

forever enjoy this kind of concession, particularly

owners of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



property in the designated areas, thus perpetuating

the gap between the rich and the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our financial development is

dependent upon the co-operation between capital and

labour. If this is overlooked, then the future will

be  very  gloomy, because there will be  industrial

unrest  which  may  lead to  economic  collapse  or

political  instability. So I urge trade  unionists,

before  they take any industrial action,  to  think

twice before they launch any such campaign. If they

take  haphazard  industrial action, thereby  giving

rise  to social chaos, then the people will suffer.

On  the  other  hand, if there is full co-operation

between  management and labour, and if  both  exert

their joint efforts for our development, then there

will be a better future and greater prosperity  for

our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in view of this, I fully support the

financial policy of the Government for 1967.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the financial policy of the Government  for

1967.  In  doing  so,  I wish to  congratulate  the

Finance Minister on his realistic and down-to-earth

budget.   It   would   not   have   required   much

intelligence or courage, especially in a House with

a  dominant  majority, for a  Finance  Minister  to

weave a budget with yarns of expectations and hope.

There  is an abundance of economists and even  more

of  economic theories to help a Finance Minister to

dodge  his problems and tasks. But it really  takes

courage  and  common  sense to prepare  a  balanced

budget that firmly plants the country's feet on the

ground and allows the hands to get to work. Such is

the budget before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our eviction from Malaysia, we were faced with

one  country  dedicated  to  our  destruction,  and

another  to  our economic ruin. Another  government

and  another people might have given up in despair.

Our  determination and our will pulled us  through;

and  very  nicely too. Our Gross National  Product,

our   External   Reserves,  our   trade   and   our

manufactures have all gone up. There was  indeed  a

miracle.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the development programme for the

public  sector  for next year, I am amazed  at  the

magnitude of our problems and our capacity to  meet

them.  Bearing  in  mind that we  have  a  balanced

budget  before  us,  our public sector  development

programme  is  really  astounding.  The  people  of

Singapore are asked to invest in this sector, a sum

which comes to nearly 70 per cent of the budget and

which  represents an outlay of over $200 for  every

man,  woman  and child. In other words,  for  every

dollar  we  spend on ordinary expenses,  we  invest

another 70 cents either from savings or from loans.

This  rate  is, I am sure, something  a  number  of

developing  countries would envy. Furthermore,  the

distribution   of   this  massive   investment   is

something  which  many developing  countries  would

find  it  difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.

No  other country in this region has been  able  to

allocate  57  per cent to economic development,  36

per cent to social development and only less than 7

per cent to public administration and defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the budget itself, I note that in spite

of  the  calls  for inducements and incentives  for

entrepreneurs, it remains a very socialist one.  Of

the  $590  million of revenue, income tax, property

tax,  taxes  on  property  transfers,  customs  and

excise on liquor, petroleum and tobacco account for

nearly $360 million. Reimbursements, sales of goods

and   services  and  income  from  investments  and

property amount to over $122 million. Together, the

items I have narrated account for over 80 per  cent

of  the  budget. And in this big sector,  the  poor

contributes but little.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On expenditure, I note that education and public

health  alone take up over $211 million, or  nearly

40  per  cent.  Special expenditure or  expenditure

largely  of a capital nature accounts for over  $93

million  or  some  14  per  cent.  Culture,  social

welfare, public parks and gardens and public  works

expenditure come to nearly $60 million, or some  10

per  cent. Statutory expenditure comes to some  $76

million or over 11 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts which I have just mentioned account for

my  support of the 1967 Budget. There is,  however,

one point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



insignificant though it may be to the House but  of

vital  importance  to me as a  trade  unionist,  on

which  the  Finance  Minister  is  silent.   I   am

referring  to  the  casualty  of  labour   in   the

transition of the Republic from an entrepot  to  an

industrial centre. Ample provisions are made in the

budget,  as I have said, to induce foreign  capital

to flow into the Republic. But no provision is made

to  enable  the  labour force  which  may  be  made

redundant through the closing down of firms engaged

in  the  import trade - a necessary side effect  of

the Government's export drive - to be retrained and

channelised  into the industrial  sector.  In  this

respect, I should think something in the nature  of

a  National Employment Insurance Scheme may well be

considered by the Finance Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, however, hasten to say that the point which I

have just raised may have been fully considered  by

the  Minister, and for his own reasons he  has  not

dealt  with  it in his 1967 Budget. It should  not,

therefore,  detract from my support of  the  budget

which  is  progressive and sound. I  wholeheartedly

support  the Finance Minister for such  a  balanced

budget.



<br><br>6.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the people of Singapore  have  been

greatly   encouraged   by  the   Budget   Statement

delivered  on  the 5th of December by  the  Finance

Minister.  Everyone says that it is an  encouraging

one.  But  as a Back-bencher, I would not  like  to

praise it excessively. Otherwise, people would  say

that  I  am the loud-speaker of the Government.  My

duty  is  to play the role of the Opposition  Party

and  to  make  certain criticisms and  comments  on

certain  parts  of  the  Budget  Statement,   where

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I would like to point out

involves  the  100  per cent  increase  in  driving

licence fees. I feel that this is in conflict  with

the  principle of the P.A.P. I do not know  whether

the  Ministers in the Government are aware that our

Party's  aim is to bridge the gap between the  rich

and the poor. When



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



the Finance Minister raises this licence fee, I  do

not know whether he himself has paid enough thought

to  it, as most of the driving licence holders  are

poor  people.  If  70 per cent  of  them  are  rich

people,  then  I  will acquiesce in this  increase.

However,  in  point of fact, most  of  the  driving

licence  holders are from the lower  income  group.

They  are  poor  people. They  work  for  the  rich

towkays, because most of the towkays have big  cars

and they do not have to have driving licences. They

can  engage chauffeurs by paying them about $100  a

month.  Such a meagre income is hardly adequate  to

support  the  livelihood of a  family.  Some  other

driving  licence holders are earning money for  the

capitalists,  e.g.,  the  taxi  drivers   and   bus

drivers.  These  taxi  drivers,  bus  drivers   and

chauffeurs who work for their towkays are only able

to earn about $100 a month. But the Government goes

out of its way to increase the licence fee from  $5

to  $10 per year, and this is done when the country

is  experiencing  a  period of economic  stability.

This  is  really  beyond my understanding.  If  the

Minister can assure us, as suggested by the  Member

for  Kampong  Kapor, that the increase  in  driving

licence fee is to be paid by the employers of these

wage-earners and chauffeurs, I will gladly  support

it.   Otherwise  this  will  be  contrary  to   the

principle of an egalitarian society. The budget, on

the  whole, is a sound one. Therefore, I will fully

support  it notwithstanding what I have  said  just

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should

like  to congratulate the Hon. Minister for Finance

on  a  realistic and sound Budget Speech. There  is

practically  nothing in it that one can  criticise.

"The  economy continues to move forward"  were  the

very  words  of the Hon. Minister and  these  words

must  have  acted like a shot in  the  arm  to  the

public. The Hon. Minister said that it was his good

fortune  as  Finance  Minister for  two  successful

years not to have had to raise revenue by increases

in  the  rates of taxation. I am sure the taxpayers

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



this  country must have sighed with relief to  know

that  we  have  a Finance Minister  who  knows  his

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Minister has stated that the only

change  is one of increasing the motor vehicle  tax

and  this  would bring in a small increase  of  $5½

million  in revenue, an increase which  we  do  not

really need, as this increase is incidental to  the

introduction  of sound principles of  taxation.  If

this  is really so, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would  have

expected the Hon. Minister to spread the benefit of

$5½  million among the lower income group  so  that

these  citizens would have to pay less  income  tax

for  the  year 1967. Perhaps our very understanding

Minister will consider what I have just said and be

the  first Finance Minister in South-East  Asia  to

start  a good example by lowering income taxes  for

the lower income group.



<br><br>6.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I support the Minister in his presentation  of

this  budget, but I would not, like other  Members,

congratulate him on so doing. He has admitted  that

it  has  been  his good fortune for  the  last  two

successive  years  not to have  raised  revenue  by

increases in the rates of taxation. For 1967 it has

been not only his good fortune but I would say  the

good  fortune  of  the  people  of  Singapore  that

increased  revenue is forthcoming  because  of  the

rising revenue in the major taxes. The only new tax

which  has  been  imposed  is  the  change  of  the

principle  of  the motor vehicle tax and  also  the

increased rate in driving licence fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were in Malaysia, there were two

very controversial taxes. I refer to the sugar  and

diesel taxes. When these taxes were imposed in  the

Malaysian Parliament, I believe that our Government

leaders very vigorously opposed these two forms  of

taxation. I would like the Minister for Finance  to

explain  to  this  House why  it  is  necessary  to

continue imposing customs duty on sugar which is  a

basic  essential food of the people. I am not aware

that we have started a sugar refinery. Perhaps  the

Minister can enlighten us on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other controversial tax which was imposed on

the  people of Singapore during the Malaysia period

was  the diesel oil tax. This affected the cost  of

living  of  our  people  with  increased  costs  in

electricity, the manufacturing industries  and  our

transport industry. I would also like the  Minister

to  explain why the imposition of this duty  should

continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on one point

with  regard  to export incentives  which  was  not

covered  by the Minister for Finance in his  Budget

Speech.  I  would say that the incentives  proposed

are  very attractive to the manufacturing industry.

But  one  point which I feel he may have overlooked

is that for our export industry to be successful we

will  also  have  to  depend on  transportation.  I

believe  that  our Government has no  control  over

freight  rates  and ships which call at  Singapore,

and that freight rates can be controlled by foreign

shipping companies by increasing the rates for  the

carriage of goods from Singapore to export  places,

thus  serving  as a deterrent to our  manufacturing

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has quite rightly been encouraging

the  development  of the building industry  in  the

private sector. According to the Minister's  Budget

Speech,  the  encouragement is  mostly  centred  on

those  urban  areas where sites have  already  been

cleared   for  development,  and  this   will   not

therefore create a problem. But I believe there are

other  sites  in  the  urban  areas  where  private

enterprise  would like to redevelop but  are  being

hindered  by  the  provisions in the  Rent  Control

Ordinance, on which, I believe, the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang  has  spoken. I would  suggest  that  the

Minister look into this Ordinance to see whether he

can   repeal   any  provisions  which  hinder   the

development of the building industry and  to  bring

the Ordinance up to date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am disappointed to note that

the  Minister  for  Finance has  not  made  certain

provisions  in this year's budget for  Government's

participation in the public road transport  system.

I  will not dwell in detail on this subject at  the

moment,  but I will raise it again in the Committee

of Supply during the debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



on  the  Deputy Prime Minister's Ministry.  I  feel

that the road transport industry is the only public

utility  still  in the hands of private  enterprise

with no Government participation at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If there are no other Members

wishing to speak, I will call upon the Minister for

Finance to reply.



<br><br>6.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full

agreement  with  the Member for Sembawang  when  he

rightly  gives  a large part of the credit  to  the

people of Singapore for the fine performance of the

economy  during this year, as a result of which  we

are  getting a larger surplus than anticipated, and

also  I  am in the happy position of being able  to

present  a  balanced budget for the  year  1967.  I

think   we  can  count  ourselves  fortunate   that

although added responsibilities have come to us  on

achieving  our  independence, I need  not  have  to

raise further taxes, with the exception of revising

the method of taxing motor vehicles and an increase

in  driving  licence fees, because of  the  energy,

drive  and  entrepreneurship of the  people.  Apart

from  this, I need not have to raise further  taxes

to  meet additional commitments. In reviewing these

taxes,  I think I have made it very clear  that  we

still  adhere to our socialist principle,  that  we

should  tax  those who are best able to afford  it.

Therefore, in revising the road tax, we saw  to  it

that  only  those  who  can afford  will  pay.  The

majority who own smaller cars will not have to bear

too  much of the incidence of taxation. Here again,

in  raising the driving licence fee from $5 to  $10

per annum, I do not think that we have been bearing

down unduly hard on the poor section of the people.

I  doubt very much the statement of the Member  who

says  that the majority of driving licence  holders

are   poor.  There  are  roughly  360,000   driving

licences  in Singapore and the holders  of  driving

licences  belong to the rich, the  very  rich,  the

poor and the not so poor, and they are asked to pay

$5  more not per month, per week, per day, but  per

year,  which means, in effect, that if the  average

smoker  forgoes three cigarettes per week, he  will

more than be able to meet this $5 more.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall take up as many as I

can remember of the points made by hon. Members  of

the House. The Member for Bukit Merah has said that

he is quite disappointed with the smaller provision

made  to  the  Ministry of Culture. I think  it  is

wrong to assume, solely from this vote allocated to

the   Ministry   of  Culture,  that  the   cultural

activities  in  Singapore  are  financed.  Cultural

activities   are  being  undertaken   through   the

Education Department, the People's Association  and

various other bodies, and I do not believe that  we

can  relate the level of cultural activities to the

amount  of money that is being voted for.  I  quite

agree  with  him  that one of  the  most  important

aspects  in  nation-building is  the  promotion  of

culture,  and I can assure him that we are spending

quite  a  sizable sum of the revenue  in  promoting

culture in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has suggested to me

that in order to attract capital here we should  be

flexible  with some regulations and think  of  some

device  to waive some of the Income Tax regulations

to  allow people who have money but cannot  account

for  it  to bring it in and invest. I do  not  know

what regulations or what device he has in mind.  If

he  is thinking of any device which will compromise

the  Government and make it appear that we  condone

any irregularities just because we want capital  to

come in, I can assure him that we will not agree to

any  such  device which he may have  in  mind.  For

those people who, he says, have assets overseas and

who are resident here and would like to bring their

money in but are afraid to do so because the Income

Tax  Department would be after them and they  would

have  to  pay 40 per cent of whatever they  brought

in,  under the Income Tax laws if it can be  proved

that  these  are  assets  which  a  non-Singaporean

residing here has built up by monies earned by  him

outside  Singapore prior to his coming  here,  then

they  are  not  taxable. Anyone who  has  got  such

assets  and would like to bring them in here  would

be welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been sending trade missions all over in

order  to find an export market. We have said  that

we will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



be friends with everybody and willing to trade with

anyone. We will allow trade missions to China if it

can  be proved that they are going to China to sell

our products and not to buy. At the moment, we have

an   unfavourable  balance  of  trade  with   China

annually, running into an odd $100 million. In  the

present circumstances, Sir, I think it would not be

in  our  interest to allow further missions  to  go

there  if its purpose is to buy goods made in China

and  not  to  sell our products. But  if  the  hon.

Member  can  assure me that if a trade  mission  to

China  is formed in Singapore and that it  will  be

able  to  sell our products there, I will willingly

recommend that this mission be allowed to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad, Sir, that the Member for Bras

Basah  realises  that  the most  important  problem

facing  us is unemployment. But I do not understand

how  he  came  to  the conclusion that  I  am  most

optimistic in feeling that the unemployment problem

can  be solved. In fact, if he has been paying  the

attention  which  he  says he  has  to  the  Budget

Statement,  he  will  remember  that  I  sounded  a

warning that unless and until every sector  of  the

economy  understands the problem that we  face  and

pull  up  their socks and work together,  then  the

future is going to be very bleak indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has also mentioned that

he  would  like to see training within industry.  I

presume he has got a copy of my Budget Speech,  but

I will refer to col. 455 where I said, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Economic Development Board has already

started,  on  a  limited  scale,  the  training  of

technicians  and skilled workers in tool  and  die-making,  electro-plating and  heat  treatment.  The

specialised training programmes help to upgrade the

skill  of  our  workers in the existing  industries

and, ...



In    addition,   specialised   production   teams,

including workers, will be sent overseas for on-the-job training . . . By building up a large reservoir

of  technicians and skilled workers, and by gearing

training to the industrial promotion programme,  we

can  quickly enter into a more sophisticated  stage

of industrial development.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the point that he has made has been

provided for - we are giving training in industries

and giving our people special skills.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I do not know, Mr Speaker, Sir,

where  in  my Budget Statement I implied -  was  it

implied  that  I am blaming labour  for  not  being

productive? I cannot remember, nor can  I  find  it

anywhere  in my statement, but I did say that  both

labour  and  management should co-operate  together

towards  creating greater productivity. I  said  in

the Budget Statement that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With the co-operation of the National Trades

Union   Congress,   the  Singapore   Manufacturers'

Association    and    the   Singapore    Employers'

Federation,  we jointly drew up in 1965  a  Charter

for Industrial Progress.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere, Mr Speaker, did I blame labour alone for

lack of productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah realises that the main

problem   facing   us  is  unemployment.   In   the

meanwhile,  he  is accusing the Government  of  not

living  up  to its agreement and that  we  are  not

willing to negotiate to raise wages for the  daily-rated  employees.  I  will  again  quote,  for  his

information and to refresh his memory, the  minutes

of the meeting held on 27th July, 1965, between the

Prime  Minister and representatives of  the  Public

Daily-Rated  Unions Federation,  and  the  N.T.U.C.

were present. I quote:

evaluation  exercise  of  ten  outstanding   grades

involving about 300 odd employees. In the event  of

failure  to  reach  agreement in  the  negotiation,

consideration would be given for the claims  to  be

referred to arbitration.'"



<br><br>I  think  he  is not unaware that a  few  days  ago

representatives  of the Public Daily-Rated  Workers

Unions Federation and the N.T.U.C. met the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



Minister.  And I think, apart from wage  claims  at

this  meeting, both have agreed that it should  not

be  the subject of negotiation. A Committee is  now

sitting and considering any outstanding issues.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> That is what the Prime Minister

said. We did not agree.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> These are the minutes of the

meeting  held  on  27th July, 1965.  And  the  same

reply,  the same quotation, was given to the Member

for  Bras  Basah last year. I have never heard  any

refutation of it, not even up to today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> The agreement was not given to

us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> That is your business and not my

business.  It is up to you to see that  you  get  a

copy  of  the  minutes of any meeting  you  attend.

Otherwise  it is a tacit assumption that  you  have

approved whatever is written in the minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Bras

Basah is not unaware that, on the one hand, we have

a  large  number of unemployed which looks  a  very

formidable problem and that we are doing everything

we  can in order to solve it. On the other hand, he

is  not  unaware  that, with a large  reservoir  of

unemployed  on our hands, the unskilled  labour  in

the  public daily-rated unions is the highest  paid

unskilled labour in South-East Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> After putting in 20 years'

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> And yet, after having agreed

that  this is no time for wage revision,  that  the

public daily-rated workers are the highest paid  in

South-East  Asia, and that there are thousands  and

thousands  of unemployed, he is asking for  a  wage

revision  at  a  time when we are  going  to  fight

unemployment and when we have got to prove that  we

are more efficient than the rest in order really to

attract  entrepreneurs with industrial  schemes  to

create  more  employment. He  is  doing  all  these

things knowing full well what the implications are.

I do not think he can rightly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



say   that  the  daily-rated  labourers  are  being

exploited. From his own experience and from my  own

experience  and from the experience of a  few,  not

only  are  they the highest paid, but I think  they

are being worked the least.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah did mention that we

must  not forget in our industrialisation programme

to  bring  in industries which will purchase  their

raw  materials from all over the world. Here again,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, if he has been paying  as  much

attention to the Budget Statement as he has said he

had,  he  will  find somewhere  there  that  I  did

mention that we are giving every incentive in order

to  attract entrepreneur manufacturers, with world-wide  connections who can purchase their  materials

from  all  over the world and who have got  markets

all  over the world, in joint ventures with our own

citizens. As far as markets are concerned, we  have

feasibility   studies  before  we   allow   pioneer

industries to receive pioneer certificates, and  we

have  agents  in  some of the main  cities  of  the

world.  It is our intention that later on, when  we

have  set  up  embassies, to attach to  them  Trade

Commissioners  who  will be  able  to  provide  the

necessary market information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Farrer Park, he is a bit

worried that if we keep on retaining more and  more

of our imports, our balance of payments will become

more  and more unfavourable. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it

all  depends  upon whether we use retained  imports

for  manufacture of products to be re-exported,  or

whether  we consume the retained imports ourselves.

I think I have made it very clear that the increase

in retained imports is largely due to the fact that

our  increasing number of industries are using more

and  more  raw  materials  which  are  turned  into

finished products and re-exported. And if  he  will

look  through  my  statement  on  the  question  of

financing  for  development for the year  1967,  he

will  see that, on Development Expenditure of round

about $411 million for 1967, we will be drawing  on

our reserves of the Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



Fund to the extent of only $32 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I did not mention export markets in my

Budget Statement, it does not mean that nothing  is

happening  in that sphere and that we  are  keeping

still.  I did not mention it for the simple  reason

that  during the course of the year, when we signed

bi-lateral trade agreements with Bulgaria and  some

East  European countries, sufficient publicity  had

been  given and I thought it would be wasting  time

to mention that again. I think sufficient publicity

had  been  given during the time when we  sat  down

with  the  Americans to negotiate  on  the  textile

quota.  So, Mr Speaker, Sir, although  I  did  not

mention  or  enlarge on the statement I  made  last

year  about  looking  for new markets,  things  are

happening there, though at a much slower rate  than

I or anyone of us would like it to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the statement that the

substantial drop in building and construction  last

year  was  due  to the high rate of  property  tax.

Building  and  construction is the  most  sensitive

sector  of  the  economy,  and  if  there  are  any

political changes, it is bound to suffer. I do  not

understand  very clearly what the Member  for  Choa

Chu  Kang meant when he said that unless and  until

the  property tax on building of commercial  houses

is  reduced,  there  would be no  progress  in  the

building  of commercial houses. I think he probably

meant the re-building of commercial houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of clarification,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I do not think I said that

unless and until the property tax is reduced  there

would  be  no  progress. I think I  said  that  the

concession  was not generous enough or not  general

enough  to  embrace the whole of  the  economy  and

possibly a reduction in the rates would serve as an

incentive to the building trade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I probably

misunderstood  him. But I thought  it  was  implied

that  if  no reduction in property tax is given  to

commercial building, there would be no progress  in

commercial  building. I would say  that  under  the

urban  renewal  scheme it is exactly to  commercial

building that the reduced rate will apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the removal of rent control, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  time will come, much sooner than  we  at

first expected, when it would be possible to remove

rent control without great hardship to the majority

of  the poorer tenants, because with the success of

the  low-cost building programme, we find that more

than  50 per cent of the people who were living  in

the  city have now moved into low-cost houses,  and

very  soon more and more will go out and then  that

would  be  the  time  to  consider  removing   rent

control. I am very sure that if we were to  pass  a

Bill now to remove rent control, the House would be

really   divided  on  this  issue.  But   for   the

information  of  Members who  feel  that  something

should  be  done in order to assist the development

of  the  city, we are thinking along the  lines  of

setting up a tribunal in order to be able to settle

compensation  payable for removal  for  development

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the nationalisation of public

transport,   I  personally  feel  that   once   you

nationalise  public  transport,  it  may  be   more

rational, but it would not be more efficient.  That

is  one  thing  I am very sure of. I have  not  the

slightest  desire  to nationalise public  transport

nor  would  I  recommend it, because  that  is  the

quickest way to lose Government revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang, while agreeing that

we  should  industrialise,  felt  that  not  enough

emphasis has been given to the agricultural sector.

I cannot agree with him on this. Within our limited

confines we are doing everything we can to  promote

agriculture  - not  agriculture  in  the  sense   of

planting  rubber trees - and we have not  done  too

badly.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, if  you  will  remember,

about  three  or  four years ago we were  importing

pigs,  poultry  and  eggs, but  now  we  are  in  a

position to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



export pigs, poultry and eggs, and I think we  have

got  a  really good herd of locally-bred stud  pigs

which I think very few countries in South-East Asia

have. Therefore, the Primary Production Department,

under  the  Ministry  of National  Development,  is

pushing ahead and improving pig-rearing, husbandry,

poultry  rearing and market gardening  methods.  So

within  the  very limited space in this island,  we

are  doing everything we possibly can in  order  to

take   full  advantage  of  modern  technology   in

intensive  farming poultry breeding and its  allied

lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon - is it Serangoon? -

Telok  Blangah, yes. Mr Speaker, he proposed  that

we  should look after the unemployed by bringing in

a  national  unemployment insurance scheme.  I  can

assure him that we are trying to get an actuary  to

work  out  unemployment insurance for this country,

and  so far we have not been successful. But I hope

during the course of next year to be able to put up

a  scheme for consideration by the Cabinet  and  by

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to come to the Member for River Valley

who  wants  me to give an explanation  why  certain

taxes which were imposed during Malaysian days have

not  been  removed. It is not true to say that  the

cost  of living has gone up because there is a  tax

on diesel oil, and that electricity rates have gone

up  because of the tax on diesel oil. In fact,  the

P.U.B. is given exemption from paying this tax, and

because of its desire to raise loans from the World

Bank,  it  is  now forced really to look  into  its

system of trading and put it on a very firm trading

basis, as a result of which it has found that it is

in  a  very peculiar position, in that the more  it

sells, the more it loses! Therefore, before we  can

get  a  loan from the World Bank, we first have  to

put  our  house  in order, that is, the  P.U.B. in

order,  and to see that it really conforms  to  the

organisation  and  to the principle  of  a  trading

concern,  that is, the more you sell, the more  you

should  be  able  to make, and not  the  other  way

round.  So  it  is  not true that the  increase  in

electricity is due to the diesel oil taxes. In  any

case, the P.U.B.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



is not paying tax because it has been exempted from

the tax on diesel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His point on shipping is noted, and it has been

exercising the minds of the officers of my Ministry

to  see  in  what way we can break the stranglehold

that  the  Shipping  Conference  have  on  shipping

rates.  We will try as far as possible to see  that

this  monopoly  does  not in  any  way  put  up  an

insuperable   barrier   to  our   industrialisation

programme.  In  fact, we have managed  to  get  the

Australian-Singapore run to accept two of our local

steamers to be members of the Conference,  so  that

goods  manufactured  here  could  be  exported   to

Australia   in  their  bottoms  and   at   a   rate

competitive with freight rates elsewhere. I think I

have  touched on most of the points that have  been

raised, and before I sit down, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

would like -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Finance Minister prepared to

give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, on the point of

the  imposition of duty on sugar, the Minister  has

not given the House an answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, I think I have left that

one  out. I must thank the Member for reminding me.

The  reason  why  the  tax on sugar  has  not  been

removed  is that there will be a sugar refinery  in

Singapore soon. From what I understand, the factory

is in an advanced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



stage  of  construction, and when  it  is  refining

sugar, there would have to be a protective duty. So

rather  than removing the duty now and  putting  it

back  later  on, we thought it best to  leave  well

alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, before I sit down, may I

request  the trade union leaders always to keep  in

mind  that  the biggest problem facing  us  is  the

unemployment  problem, and that far  from  allowing

labour  to  be  exploited by  management,  we  have

always   maintained  that  there   should   be   no

exploitation  of  one by the other,  and  that,  in

spite  of the fact that there is a large number  of

unemployed, we would not allow any entrepreneur  to

take advantage of the situation. But still, at  the

same  time,  I  hope the trade union  leaders  will

realise  the  significance of it and that  for  the

success  of our industrialisation programme,  which

ultimately will mean more employment and prosperity

for  Singapore, everyone of us should pull  up  our

socks,  do our best, understand the problem  before

us,  and do not do anything at all which will bring

harm to our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the Government for the year 1967.
