<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Select Committee's Report)</b></div>



<br><br>10.02 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move the

motion standing in my name, viz.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Housing   and   Development  Bill,  as  contained   in

Sessional Paper No. L.A. 20 of 1958, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report of the Select Committee has been in

the  hands  of hon. Members since November last.  Hon.

Members   have  had  sufficient  time  to   read   the



representations received on the Bill, and  which  were

given careful consideration in Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only major amendment which has been made to the

Bill  is the deletion of the clause providing for  the

relaxation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>



of  building  by-laws in connection with  the  Board's

operations.  Similar clauses appear in legislation  in

the  United  Kingdom  and  elsewhere,  and  while  the

Government  remains of the opinion that the  inclusion

of  the original clause would not be unreasonable,  it

considers   that  the  arrangements  with  the   local

authorities for waivers has worked reasonably well  in

the  past, and does not consider it necessary to press

for  its  inclusion  in the Bill. However,  Government

will  do  so by way of an amendment, if the operations

of  the Board are found to be hampered as a result  of

local  authority by-laws. The remaining amendments  to

the Bill in Select Committee were mostly minor and  of

a  purely  technical  nature, and  were  intended  to

improve the drafting of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.05 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

sure  this  House is at last happy to  note  that  the

Housing Authority can be put into reality. But certain

details  should still be patched up - especially  those

that raised consider, able debate in Select Committee.

I  wonder  whether the Minister was aware  that  those

points  had  been raised by the Opposition with  very,

very strong reasons behind them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I quote an example? The automatic transfer

of  the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust  staff  without

reference  back  to the Public Service Commission.  To

me,  I  think  this is a most dangerous move.  We  are

aware that the determining of posts is in the hands of

a  few  persons. I just wonder what is the  merit  and

purpose  of  the P.S.C., a body on which this  country

relies  so much. To ensure the stability of a  country

the  public  service is of vital importance.  This  is

especially true when we see the pocket-size government

of  the P.A.P. in the City Council. How the City Council

employs its staff is seen in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>



the policy of the P.A.P. Now the Minister proposes that

the  present  staff  of  the  S.I.T. be  automatically

transferred  to the Housing Authority. Sir,  maybe  the

public  or  this  House has confidence in  the  present

Minister  and the present S.I.T. staff, but what  about

the  future?  Will filthy party politics play  a  great

part  in  all  public appointments? I  wonder  if  this

Housing   Authority  is  keen  to  serve  only  certain

Parties' interests, but not all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of this point, I strongly urge the

Minister to consider putting in the hands of the P.S.C.

the appointment of staff for the Housing Authority. Any

grievance  or any technical points of assurance  raised

by  the  present S.I.T. staff should, I think, be  very

easy  to  deal  with. But if this Bill  is  now  passed

without  any amendment and we accept it as it is,  then

let these few persons hold the extraordinary powers  to

determine any appointment in the new Housing Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, what is the use of changing its name? Why

not  let  us  continue to use the name "S.I.T."  rather

than change it to the "Housing Authority"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope, Sir, through the P.S.C. and through the

wisdom  of  our Minister we can try to do something  to

improve  the  machinery of the S.I.T. - which undoubtedly

has  not  satisfied the public demand  for  housing - and

thereby help it to solve the housing problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the pros and cons of this important

point,  I  hope the Minister will not only think  twice

but  three  times not to allow any political  Party  in

power  in the near future to use this Housing Authority

for  their own ends. Sir, I strongly urge the  Minister

to give me and this House a satisfactory reply.



<br><br>10.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this question of

the  Public Service Commission having jurisdiction over

the  appointments of employees in the City Council  has

been  debated in very great detail during  meetings  of

the Select Committee. The fact is that the Select



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>



Committee  was of the opinion that, for the time  being

at  least as regards the category of employees who  are

already  in appointments with the Board of Trustees  of

the  Improvement Trust, it would be unfair for them  to

appear  before  the  Public Service  Commission  to  be

confirmed  in  appointments in  which  they  have  been

acting  or  working for the past few years. However,  I

can  assure the Member for Changi that with the  coming

into  being  of  the  Housing  and  Development  Board,

Government will do its best to see that politics should

not  be introduced into the workings of the Development

Board, because, in the first instance, appointments  to

the  Board will be made by Government not on the  basis

of  political affiliation but purely on the merits  and

ability of the member to serve on that Board. Secondly,

Sir,  Government  may  also  endeavour  to  extend  the

services  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  to  new

employees  of  the Development Board  as  well  as  the

Planning Section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point for clarification?

too late!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Housing and Development Bill, as contained in Sessional

Paper No. L.A. 20 of 1958, be adopted.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw your attention, Sir, to a note

in clause 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 15, line 7, to leave out "1958" and insert "1959".

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The alterations will be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to

take up so much time of the House, but I would like  to

raise  a few points. The Minister in his reply has  not

satisfied me. Sir, as I said, the first point  is  that

the  P.S.C. should solve the technical difficulties  of

the  present staff of the S.I.T. and to assure them  of

the  security of their jobs. Secondly, I  am  sure  the

Minister  has not understood me correctly. I  said,  at

the  present,  maybe  this House and  the  people  have

confidence in the Minister and his Permanent Secretary,

but  what about the future, Sir? I have already  quoted

one  practical  example and that is the  present  well-known  method of employment in the City Council - if  you

want  to seek a City Council job, you must be a  member

of  a  political  Party, and you can then  be  sure  of

getting  a job. Sir, it is obvious that party  politics

are   creeping   into  our  public  service   and   the

appointment  of  staff from the S.I.T. to  the  Housing

Authority, which is such an important body, can only be

determined by the decision of the P.S.C. Sir, let  them

determine who should remain or who should be  asked  to

resign;  or  who  should be humiliated  and  forced  to

resign.  We  have  known that Mr Marcus  of  the  City

Council  had to resign. Why should he resign  from  the

Hawkers  Department? It is evident that party  politics

are being played in the public service and therefore  a

principle is involved - should Singapore preserve a





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



clean  public  service  or  not?  Otherwise,  if  party

politics  are permitted to get into our public service,

candidates would try to bribe or find a way to  by-pass

the Public Service Commission. That I think is the most

dangerous,  disastrous  and  sorrowful  thing  for  the

people of Singapore. Why allow one-



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> In regard to the present or future

employees  of the Singapore Improvement Trust,  is  the

Member  for  Changi  trying to  say  that  the  present

employees  of the Improvement Trust should be confirmed

by  the Public Service Commission in their appointments

in the future Development Board?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, Sir, I want all the present

staff   of   the  S.I.T. to  be  confirmed  in   their

appointments since the S.I.T. is to become a Government

authority; unlike in the past when the S.I.T. have  for

years  been a statutory body. Once you allow  this  new

Government  department to by-pass  the  Public  Service

Commission in its appointments, then I am afraid  many,

many  more  Government departments  would  follow  this

Housing   and   Development   Board.   Therefore,    by

implementing  this Bill, we create  a  very,  very  bad

precedent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why the Minister cannot find any means to

solve  the technical difficulties of the S.I.T. staff,

who   are  much  worried  and  feel  insecure  in   the

confirmation  of  their  appointments  by  the   Public

Service  Commission. Sir, it is just a minor difficulty

which I am sure the P.S.C. and the Minister can find  a

way   out   to  solve,  rather  than  embark   on   the

implementation of this Bill. We want our public service

to keep entirely away from politics. I have just quoted

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>



example  of  party politics having already  infiltrated

into the City Council. You cannot deny

it,  Sir,  and I hope the Minister for Local Government

can  take notice of such happenings. If you want to get

a job in the City Council, you must be a member of such

and such a political Party, and that is -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> <b>(Tanjong Pagar):</b> On a point of

information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Member enumerate three

specific  cases,  instead  of  making  these  unfounded

allegations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I want to quote the case of the

Hawker Inspectors. When the City Council advertised in

the Chinese newspapers for many more Hawker Inspectors,

certain required qualifications were made known. You

must have a Senior Cambridge School certificate or a

Chinese Senior Middle School certificate. I learned

from a reliable source that many applications -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Name three!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> -came from India. These applicants

even  possessed B.A. degrees and they applied as Hawker

Inspectors. There were still others who possessed  even

higher qualifications, but all these applications  were

turned down. If the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  wants

to know the details, I think he can get the information

from  his  colleague  in the City Council,  because  an

Assemblyman  like myself has nothing to  do  with  such

political   manoeuvring.  I  can   only   gather   such

information  from persons who approached me  for  jobs.

Many of these job-seekers have approached me these last



few  months  since the results of their  Senior  Middle

School  examinations were published. They tried to  get

jobs  in the City Council. I would like to quote a  few

names:  Chan Yin Fong, who has just graduated from  the

Chung Cheng High School; another one, Miss Ng Teck Choi

from Chung Hwa Girls' School. They approached



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



me  for  jobs and the question that confronted me  most

was  that they wanted me to recommend them to a,  say,.

Singapore People's Alliance or Lib-Soc. City Councilor.



I  asked the girl about the registration, and she said,



"Oh,  I have got through because I have enrolled  as  a

P.A.P. member." Sir, these are the facts. Whether these

applicants were really seeking jobs in the City Council

or not, I have no right to question, but it is true, on

their  own words, that if you are seeking a job in  the

City  Council, you must prove your political  leanings.

As  they  say, Sze Siang Tsen Chueh, which  means  that



with a right political mind, you have more chances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I strongly oppose the passing of this Bill

without  any  amendments, particularly in view  of  the

great danger of allowing this Government Department  to

by-pass  the  P.S.C. and I am afraid  it  is  going  to

create a very serious precedent which a political Party

in  power  in the future might follow. Then Singapore's

days will be numbered.



<br><br>10.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

congratulate  the Minister for Local Government,  Lands

and  Housing, for being able at last after a period  of

four  years, to present us with his Housing  Authority.

My   only  regret,  Sir,  is  this:  that  whilst   the



Government has been giving its parliamentary  draftsmen

a  great deal of practice on how to draw up Bills, many

will  be  subsequently scrapped, because there  is  not

enough time for the Government to get on with its ideas

before it is thrown out of office. If I may remind  the

former  members of the Labour Front, this  was  one  of

their key planks in their last election platform.  They

talked  about it for four years and now, when they  are

on  their way out, they present us with this Report  of

the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not without significance that the senior

staff  of the Singapore Improvement Trust are concerned

about  their  future  and want to  entrench  themselves

before this Government goes out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



of office. That is a well-known fact. It is also a well-known  fact  that  they would like to build  themselves

into new jobs - unlike what happened to the City Council

senior  officers who were unable to get the old Council

to  put  protective  amour-plating  around  their  jobs

before  they,  the old councillors were  swept  out  of

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no objections to this Bill being passed, but

I  do ask the Minister to consider seriously whether he

should   embark  on  the  implementation  of  such   an

important  task  when  he  knows  full  well  that  his

Government has got only another eight weeks to go.  The

next  government may well have very different ideas  as

to  how this Bill should be implemented, even though it

may  be  of  the  opinion  that  there  should  be   an

independent  or  separate Housing Authority.  The  next

government may well be of the opinion that this Housing

Authority should be under the direct control, direction

and  drive of a Minister for Housing, and not under  an

appointed Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore submit this view for the Government's

consideration - that the administrative apparatus of  the

Government should not be strained to breaking point  by

last-minute switches in policy. If the Government  goes

on  with the implementation of this Bill, and the  next

government disagrees with it, in a matter of weeks  all

these gears will be thrown into reverse. That will  not

be good for the country - and they know it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask the Minister to remember this.

Whatever the views of permanent Civil Service  may  be,

and  whatever  the views of the S.I.T. Senior  Officers

are,  the  final decision has to be made by a political

head.  As  the  political head, he  must  assume  final

responsibility for what happens to the S.I.T. and  this

Housing Bill. I would also ask the Minister, if he  has

any  confidence at all in his programme and his  policy

and  what  he  intends to do, to place  it  before  the

electorate and get a mandate to get on with it.

am glad he has made clear the position of his Party,

but what I do hope is that, should his Party get into

power, the whole of the Government and its

administration will not be in the same sorry state as

the City Council is today -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It has never worked so well!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> -as a result of irresponsible and

rapid  changes of administration of its office  and  of

its  administrative  officers  without  regard  to  the

public of Singapore as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, Sir, I think, except for the

extremists  in Singapore, everyone will agree  with  us

that  the affairs of the City Council are not what they

should  be  at all. And if this were to happen  to  the

administration of the island of Singapore, then I shall

be  very, very sorry for all of us who think on exactly

the  opposite lines. I must therefore forewarn everyone

of us to be prepared to meet that challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has sat down!



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, I did not intend

to  say  anything on this Bill. I agree with  the  hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar that, of the Bills which  have

been  passed last week or the previous month,  some  of

them are very important, and should have been held over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



after  the  elections, so that the people who  get  the

mandate   can   introduce   them.   But   the   present

Government - most  of  the  Members  have  changed  their

labels  - have  thought fit to bring up  this  important

Bill  on,  I  would  say, the eve of their  misrule  of

office.  I would suggest that though they will get  the

Bill passed, it should not be implemented till the  new

Government  comes into power. I am not going  to  enter

into party politics as others have done, but it is  the

people  who will elect Members to this Assembly on  the

basis of their past performance, and it is those people

who   have  been  elected  who  should  implement  this

important Bill.



<br><br>10.33 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dato Abdul Hamid, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Yes, Sir, I think there is very

little  to reply. With regard to the statement made  by

the  hon.  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar,  I  am  somewhat

unhappy to learn that, on the one hand, he supports the

Bill  and,  on the other hand, he does not support  its

implementation. Sir, whether the Bill has  come  up  in

the  first year or the second year or the third or even

the  last year of office of the present Government, we,

on  this  side of the House, will, within the political

and  legal life of this Government, implement  what  is

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi was again harping on the

question  of the Public Service Commission. As  I  have

said  earlier, Sir, it is against all accepted  service

principles to insist that the present employees of  the

Trust  should  be rubber-stamped by the Public  Service

Commission in appointments which they have been holding

for  years  and years. Furthermore, Sir,  there  is  no

comparison  at  all, in my opinion,  between  the  City

Council  and the future Development Board. The  alleged

happenings  in  the  City  Council  could  probably  be

because   that  body  is  a  fully  elected  one.   The

Development Board, on the other hand, will have members

who will be nominated by Government and who will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



be  elected  members, as it is in the City  Council  or

even  in  this  Assembly. So the  chances  of  politics

getting  into  the  Development  Board  would,  in   my

opinion, be very remote. I still say, Sir, that  it  is

unwise,  and  we  should not attempt to  introduce  the

powers  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  into  the

Housing and Development Board, at least in the case  of

the  present  employees who have been with  the  Board,

some for twenty or thirty years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister has sat down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>PLANNING BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Select Committee's Report)</b></div>

<br><br>10.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Govermnent, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Govermnent, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Sir, I rise to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Planning Bill, as contained in Sessional Paper No. L.A.

21 of 1958, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a Bill of some difficulty, and it is for

this  reason  that the Bill was committed to  a  Select

Committee at the sitting of this Assembly held on  10th

September,  1958.  The  Select Committee  has  had  the

benefit  of representations from, among others,  public

bodies  and institutions, such as the Singapore Harbour

Board, the City Council, the Institute of Architects in

Malaya,  the Singapore Ratepayers Association, and  the

Society  of Malayan Architects. The representatives  of

some  of  these bodies also appeared before the  Select

Committee to supplement their representations  by  oral

evidence.  These representations, Sir, were given  very

careful consideration by the Committee, even where some

of  them have had to be subsequently rejected. Many  of

the  amendments which have been made in the text of the

Bill in Select Committee have been the direct result  of

these representations. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



intend  to  go  through  all of them,  Sir,  but  would

mention particularly the amendment now incorporated  in

clause  9  (11) as it appears in the Select Committee's

Report,  which  makes it necessary  for  the  Competent

Authority  to  make  known its  decision  within  three

months  and  the  reason  for  such  decisions  if  the

applications  were  refused  or  granted   subject   to

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill in the Select Committee's Report

also  incorporates certain safeguards against arbitrary

exercise  of  powers  to enforce  planning  control  by

enabling,  in sub-clauses 2 and 3 thereof,  any  person

aggrieved  by any direction of the Competent  Authority

to appeal to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments, Sir, while they have improved

the working of the planning organisation are of a minor

character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, my remarks on the Housing Bill

apply with equal force to this Report which we are  now

asked  to adopt. The Government must recognise that  it

has  a duty not only to do what is right to themselves,

but  also  to do what is right to the country.  Knowing

full  well  that  the  policy of the  next  government,

particularly in regard to the implementation of housing

policy,   may  well  be  different  from  the   present

Government's,  they  should follow what  the  Financial

Secretary  did when he presented the Budget, and  leave

the  position open. If the Financial Secretary, who has

now   retired,  had  adopted  the  attitude  which  the

Minister  for  Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing,

perhaps  without proper consideration,  has  chosen  to

strike  in  this Assembly, then he would have  gone  on

with  those  development schemes and incurred  for  the

country  a waste of public expenditure when the schemes

are reversed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are prepared to face any criticism. And let me

tell  the  Member for Paya Lebar this.  It  is  because

there  is  drive  and energy at the  top  in  the  City

Council  that  the people are satisfied that  the  City

Council   has  never  functioned  so  efficiently   and

politely  on  behalf of the public and for the  public.

Let  me  also tell him this. If the S.P.A. leaves  the

Civil Service in a state of coma and the bureaucracy in

a  state  of paralysis, then he will get the  situation

where  the  City  Council  Pavilion  in  the  Singapore

Constitution  Exposition  is  ready  on  time  and  the

Government Pavilion is not. Everybody knows, and 20,000

people  who went to the opening on Saturday also  know,

despite  the  conspiracy of silence in the Press,  that

the  opening of the exhibition was delayed because  the

Government Pavilion was not ready, and not because  the

roads were not suitable for pedestrian traffic. If  you

want results, then you must have drive and dynamism. If

Ministers  just sit back and only bestir themselves  on

the  eve of an election, having slept for the last four

years,  then  I  say that those who awaken  from  their

sleep  at such a late hour will find that the  bus  has

already left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two Bills - one we have already passed and

one  we  are about to pass - are the instruments  through

which,  not the present Minister, but the next Minister

for  Housing  will  have to push  through  his  housing

policy,  and the question of policy is closely  related

to  the question of personnel. Whilst we agreed in  the

main with the Housing Bill, I think the Minister did mc

an  injustice  when  he  thinks that  my  Party  agreed

wholeheartedly with every single detail in  that  Bill.

For  instance, I had already indicated to  him  earlier

that  it  is my opinion, and the opinion of  my  Party,

that  the head of the Housing Authority should  be  the

Minister  and not a Chairman appointed by the Minister.

If  it  is  to propel itself with the drive with  which

the  Minister thinks it ought to be propelled, then the

Minister  should  be present himself to  see  that  his

policies  are  pursued with vigour, and not  do  it  by

proxy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many amendments of that nature that we have

in   mind.   All   that   will   necessitate   amending

legislation.  What  is  worse,  we  do  not  want   the

personnel  to be fixed beforehand. If he had done  this

at, the beginning of the career of his Government, with

three years ahead of him to carry out and implement his

policy, then we would have no grounds for complaint. It

is  no use to talk about "We will do what is right  and

what  we think is right in this respect." He knows full

well   that   he  has  got  only  eight  weeks   before

dissolution  and that what is right for the  Government

to  do  now  is  not to queer up the position  for  the

country  by making it necessary for the next government

to reverse gears.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very seldom have

I  been  able to agree with the hon. Member for Changi,

but  I  find myself in entire agreement with him today,

particularly when he accused a certain Party  of  using

the  City  Council  as  a propaganda  machine  for  its

political  purposes. Sir, that has been amply confirmed

by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, when he said just

now  that  the  City Council's stand in  the  Singapore

Constitution Exposition is ready whereas the Government

one  is  not, and that it is because of the  drive  and

energy  of his Party which is ruling the City  Council.

Sir,  to  many  people like myself, I  think  it  is  a

dreadful thing to say. It is not proper to use a  local

government, like the City Council, which is part of the

Government,   for  its  propaganda,  to  denounce   the

Government for what it has done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> For what it has not done!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> What he said is completely wrong.

I  have been to the Constitution Exposition ground many

times  during  the  week,  and  I  can  say  that   the

Government departments and all the pavilions were ready

and willing to start on that night at the same time  as

the  City Council, and their drive is no less than that

of the P.A.P.'s.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, Sir, I used to, but not now.

That shows their defiance of the rules of the game  and

of  the law. When the Committee decided that the public

should  not  be  allowed to go in, because  that  would

disturb  the  work that is going on in the  exhibition,

they purposely put on the lights to defy the law and to

get the people to rush in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What law?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> After all, they came in as a

member-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Surely if the-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, Sir. Surely they enter the

exhibition as part of the team under the aegis  of  the

Chinese  Chamber  of Commerce, who  started  the  whole

exhibition? Therefore, they should abide by the  rules.

If  the  Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce  say  that  the



exhibition  has to be postponed, then the City  Council

should follow the rules; but instead of that, they  saw

in  it  a  glorious opportunity to put on  a  blaze  of

lights, and say: "Here we are - ready, and everybody else

is not!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, to my mind, definitely not fair, and that is

why I want to see a fair game being played in Singapore

and  in  this  House.  The exhibition  is  not  ready

because of the inclement weather we have had during the

last two weeks.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I have allowed this aspect of

the  debate  to go far enough. I think it is completely

irrelevant  to the Report and, therefore, I  must  stop

any  further debate on the exhibition. Let us come back

to the Planning Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Thank you, Sir, for your ruling. I

must  say that many of us, particularly those who  have

appeared  before the Select Committee, are not  at  all

happy about the Bill as it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



presented today. Many points have been brought up,  and

most   of   them  have  been  turned  down.  The   only

satisfaction we had was the amendment to clause 9 (11),

as mentioned by the Hon. Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and Housing. Under that clause, anyone  who  now

submits plans will get an answer - yes or no - within three

months;  and if any condition is imposed upon the  plan

that  is  submitted,  or if the plan  is  refused,  the

planners must give the reasons for the refusal. That is

a step forward, Sir. At least those who want to develop

or  take part in the development of Singapore will know

that  they  will  get  a definite answer  within  three

months  instead of, as they had before, being  referred

back  to  and  fro  by  the  Planning  Department,  and

sometimes it took over a year to get the plans through.

But  changing of the law and giving a definite time for

plans  to  be  passed are not enough. We have  now  the

authority of the planners decentralised by the creation

of  the  District Councils. I do hope that the District

Councils  will  use all the powers and energy  to  push

through as many plans and as soon as possible when they

are sent to them for approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the duties of the District Councils,

especially  the Planning Department, are  very  onerous

today. It has a backlog of plans to approve, and  I  do

hope they will use the powers they now have to try  and

help  the small man living in the area, so that he  can

repair   his   house   or  build   extensions   without

encountering  a  great  deal of  difficulties,  as  has

happened  in the past. It is because of the  difficulty

of  getting plans through that has encouraged or forced

some people to commit breaches of the law and carry out

repairs on their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that by changing this law we will be able

to  allow people who submit plans to build quickly,  so

that we can curb the number of illegal houses that  are

being erected every day in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.53 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I just wonder how many hon.

Members  will  agree with me when I  say  that  when  a

person  is thirsting for power he can easily  be  lured

and become a fanatic.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated that I

wish to keep this debate on a proper plane from now on,

and I rule that the word "fanatic" with reference to  a

Member  of this Assembly is, unparliamentary, and  that

word must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I beg to withdraw, but I

substitute  for  it  the words "a selfish,  opportunist

politician".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is not careful

with  his  language, then, of course, I have  power  to

stop  him  from talking at this sitting. I ask  him  to

restrain himself, and try and be relevant to this Bill.

He must now withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I apologise to you, and I beg

to  withdraw  the  expression. But I  must  express  my

bitter  feelings at the course the debate on this  Bill

is  taking, because I have discovered that certain hon.

Members  are  actually not interested  at  all  in  the

debate,  but  are merely here to seek some other  aims.

Maybe  you  wish to rule me out again, Sir? As  I  have

already said in my speech on the previous Bill, I still

wish to repeat the same remarks on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has still failed to answer my query as to how he is going to assure the S.I.T. staff (now the

Planning staff) that they will not be involved in party

politics,  particularly in the coming year. I  wish  to

ask  the Minister again whether he has any solution  to

such a minor technical point about the present staff of

the S.I.T. who should feel secure in their jobs and  be

confirmed  in  their appointments by the P.S.C.  It  is

important to preserve the integrity of the service  and

that  can only happen if appointments are made  by  the

Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will recollect, the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  challenged me to mention  a  particular

case of party politics in the present City Council. May

I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



crave  your indulgence to name the appointment  of  Mr

Jek as the Mayor's Secretary, who was appointed by-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The P.S.C.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot see how that is relevant

to the Planning Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I strongly oppose any appointment

to  the staff of the Housing Authority - where the P.S.C.

has  been  by-passed.  I  maintain  that  in  such   an

important body every appointment made must be  referred

to the P.S.C. and be confirmed by it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take this opportunity also to comment on

the  policy  of the planning of Singapore.  The  Master

Plan  is,  in  the eyes of many people, still  a  myth,

especially  among  the  masses. The  peasants  and  the

ordinary  man-in-the-street do not know the purpose  of

the  Master  Plan.  They think it is  only  a  plan  to

beautify the City and to build skyscrapers, or even for

the  benefit  of  the wealthy class of the  population.

This  question has been constantly put  to  me  by  the

people  in  my constituency, the majority of  whom  are

fishermen and farmers scattered around the rural  area.

because  they feel that even up to now the Master  Plan

has not provided them with houses. They want Government

to  provide some means to raise their living  standard.

They  want to know whether the Government has  anything

in  the Master Plan to provide them with houses,  which

they badly need, or a place where they can settle down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has mentioned before his plan to build a Malay settlement. I remember I told him that he should

enlarge  his  plan  for  attap dwellers  which  he  has

outlined in his plan to include not only the Malays but

also  any person who is unable to rent a house provided

by  the Government or, as present, the S.I.T., and  who

has  no  chance to buy a house of his own. The  farmers

will be happy and contented if only the Government will

give  them a piece of land and allow them to  build  an

attap  house on it. Sir, I wish the Minister will  give

an answer to these two points.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it is with mixed feelings that I speak on the Bill. On

the one hand, I am very glad that at the end of four

years we have seen an attempt to abolish that notorious

organisation called the Singapore Improvement Trust. On

the other hand, Sir, much as I would like to have

imagined before my election, I could never have

imagined that a Bill of this type could be made on this

side of the House of which I am a Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken many times in the Select Committee on

the  policy  of the Trust and the people are  tired  of

what it has been doing all these years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My one and only hope is that this new Bill will be

able to stop all this dictatorship and corruption,  and

whatever  else that goes with it. But I see nothing  in

this Bill that gives me encouragement on all the points

I  have  raised. According to this Bill,  you  can  do

nothing except with the approval of the Minister or his

appointees.  There is nothing to say that you  can  get

the  plans passed or get a scheme approved except  with

the approval of the Minister or his officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance the question of design. Nowhere in

the  world has an architect been able to put in writing

or in whatever form what is called good design. Yet the

Government wishes to seek powers to control design.  If

the  authorities concerned cannot find any reasons good

enough,  they can just turn it down and say,  "No.  Bad

design."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "design" can mean planning and anything that

the  officer can think of. I have no objection  if  the

control  of  design is vested in the  Local  Authority.

although  I  do  not agree that they should  have  such

powers. That is not so bad. But I think it is too  much

to  ask  for control of design at the initial stage  of

planning.  I  do not believe you can find  such  powers

anywhere in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, if you want to submit a scheme to the

planning   authority  of  the  Improvement  Trust   for

approval, you just send in a site



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



plan,  indicating the number of storeys you  intend  to

build,  and  for what purpose the building will  serve,

and  then leave it to the authority to say yes  or  no.

But  if design is one of the points of approval and  if

the officer concerned insists on it, then the architect

will  have to submit a sketch plan. A sketch plan is  a

very   expensive   item.  Take,   for   instance,   the

Polytechnic.  It costs about $8 million.  According  to

the  scales for a sketch plan, an architect is entitled

to  charge 2½ per cent. If we know that the scheme  is

sure  to go through, then that amount is worth spending

because  ultimately, before you make a working drawing,

you  will have to submit a sketch plan to the owner for

approval.  But to commit yourself to an expenditure  of

$200,000 without any assurance whatsoever, I think that

is most improper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the question of appeal, Sir. As it is, you

have to appeal to the Minister. I have fought very hard

in  the  Select Committee to make the point that before

the Minister makes his decision, this appeal should  go

before the Committee appointed by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say that, I do not mean that I have to ask the

Minister  to  follow whatever decision is made  by  the

Committee.  I just ask that the Minister, before  he

makes  a decision, should at least hear the opinion  of

the  Committee which he appoints. I think that  is  not

too  much  to  ask. I have never any doubt  as  to  the

ability  and  integrity of the Minister. But  we  know,

Sir,  that the Minister is a non-technical man. He  has

to depend on the advice of his officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are no regulations to say what is right and

what is wrong, so it is a matter of opinion in a lot of

cases.  The Master Plan has already been submitted  and

approved  by the Government. Yet I find in  many  cases

that  even  if a plan conforms entirely to  the  Master

Plan,  it  is  disapproved. So how can you  expect  the

public to support the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



when they do not know what is right or wrong? As it is,

Sir,  the approval or disapproval of a plan, to a great

extent, depends on the whims and fancies of the officer

concerned. We know, Sir, even in the Improvement  Trust

today,  that  if  a certain officer is in  charge,  you

might get a disapproval, and when another officer is in

charge,  you might get an approval. The Bill  has  done

nothing to alter or improve it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning, Sir, is not a matter, as many imagine,

which only concerns the architect, the contractors  and

the  estate  people.  It  concerns  everybody.  If  the

Government makes it expensive for land to be developed,

the  cost  ultimately will be charged to the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, Sir, on the question of controlling design

and  having  to  submit a sketch plan, I  am  sure  the

architect would welcome clause 10. At least today, Sir,

if we were asked to submit an application, we just type

the application, enclose the site plan and submit it to

the Improvement Trust. But if the Government insists on

having a design first, as what the Bill provides,  then

you  have to submit a sketch plan with the application.

In  this  respect, Sir, you can be sure  the  architect

will  not render a service free of charge. It goes back

to - who else? Is it fair, Sir, that the public should be

burdened  with  this  unnecessary expenditure?  If  the

Government  cannot tell the public what is  right,  how

can  they condemn what is wrong? That is why I objected

very  strongly to that clause in the Select  Committee,

and I object very strongly to it now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the administration of laws, Sir, there are two

sides  to it. One is the law itself; the other  is  the

officer  who  administers it. I know very well  that  I

will  not  have  the support of this House  even  if  I

decide  to vote against the Bill. But I sincerely  hope

the  officer who will administer this law will make  it

as  easy  as possible for the public to be granted  the

approval  which  they  seek, if they  comply  with  the

regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.12 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

like the remarks of the last speaker, especially at the

end of it. I think that in all ventures that we

undertake, everything must be based on practicability.

I have seen the S.I.T. planning section working for the

last few years, and I have one or two observations to

make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly I know there is a Planning Department in the

Singapore Improvement Trust. I believe that the work of

this  Department  is to plan. I further  believe,  Sir,

that  we  have  many architects going to  the  Planning

Department, but the work of the architect must just  be

to put up plans for houses. They should have nothing to

do  with the planning of an area. They should only plan

as to how the houses should be built, and see that they

conform  to all the requirements of safety and  so  on.

What  I  have actually found, Sir, is of a very curious

nature.  It seems to me that those who want to  put  up

buildings  have to go to the architects to  have  their

plans drawn up. But the architects have also to put  up

a  site  plan  and an overall plan for the whole  area.

That I think intrudes upon the work of the planners. We

have  experts in planning. The experts are  now  asking

the architects, who should not be doing that job, to do

the job for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, a great deal of the heartburn felt by

so  many  people could be removed if we could  ask  the

planning   section  of  the  S.I.T. - now  the   Planning

Authority - to put up tentative plans for the whole area,

including  plans of where the roads should be situated,

where  bungalow  lots  should be  situated,  and  other

little   details.  Then  when  builders   go   to   the

architects, they have the area already planned out. The

architects  just draw to plan, and everything  will  be

set in motion very quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the answer may be that we have not enough

planners,  and if we do not have enough planners,  then

further details should be given to assist those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



who  are going to do the work of planners, and not just

say - this is a green belt, that is something else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I find, Sir, is that not all people

know about the Master Plan. They only know very roughly

what  they  can  do. They may not even know  what  they

cannot  do. A man who wants to develop a piece of  land

may not even know that it is in the green belt and that

nothing  can be done about it. I would suggest  to  the

Minister that further publicity be given to the overall

planning of Singapore. I know that we have already  one

such publicity campaign whereby everybody is invited to

go  to the Victoria Memorial Hall and look at the whole

area  of  Singapore. But I think that should be carried

further. Every district should have a plan of it put up

so  that  everybody in that district will know what  he

can  do and what he cannot do and the intention of  the

Government  with  regard to the future  development  of

Singapore.  That  will dovetail all  the  work  of  the

Government and the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find also, Sir, that although this type of planning

usually  applies to the rich people, yet  many  of  the

people  who can only afford to build attap houses  come

within  the scope of that authority. I have  known,  in

many  advanced  countries and also many not-so-advanced

countries,  that they have many types of plans  put  up

for  sale  to the people. I have recently gone  to  the

Rural  Board to ask for cheap plans for the  people.  I

find that these plans are out of stock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the Minister that plans for houses

should  be freely made available to the people, and  if

the  people  know where to build and how to  build,  it

will  solve a lot of problems. We know that  there  are

plenty  of unauthorised houses coming up, and that  may

be  due to the inconveniences caused to the people,  or

to  their  ignorance  of  the plans  of  Government.  I

suggest that the Minister look into this in more detail

in order better to help the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.20 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there are many sites on main roads in the rural areas

where shop-houses could be built and yet they are not

allowed to be built, just because these sites happen to

be in the green belt or belts. It is well known that

the housing shortage is very acute here, and if shop-houses could be built, at least the housing problem

could be solved to some extent if, say, two persons

were to live on the premises of a shop-house. There

would be many thousands who would go to the shop-houses

and overcrowding in their own houses would be eased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope whenever any developer or planner applies for

permission  to build shop-houses on the main  roads  in

the  rural areas, the Competent Authority will not  put

up obstacles such as general layouts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dato Abdul Hamid, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the points

raised  by  Members  on both sides of  the  House  have

already been debated in the Select Committee and  I  do

not  think I will be called upon at this stage to reply

to  them. However, I would like to reply to the  Member

for Changi and the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi is still harping on the

question of the Public Service Commission, but I  would

like  to  point out to him, Sir, that we  are  at  this

moment  debating the Planning Bill. If he has read  the

speeches which I have made both in the Assembly and  in

the  Select Committee, he should know by now  that  the

Planning    Department   of   the   present   Singapore

Improvement Trust will be a Government department in my

Ministry - the  Ministry of Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing.  Because  it will be a Government  Department,

the  Public  Service  Commission  will  naturally  have

jurisdiction  over all the appointments and  dismissals

of the officers of that department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, about settlements. Again, the Member

for  Changi  has  asked  me why  I  have  been  opening

settlements for Malays in Singapore and why I have  not

done  so for other nationalities. I would like to point

out-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I deny that I

had  asked  why. I was only expressing  the  hope  that

while  the  Minister  was  planning  to  set  up  Malay

settlements, he should at the same time set up a  wider

sphere   of  attap  dwellers'  settlements.   I   never

questioned the merits or demerits of Malay settlements.

What I want the Minister to do is to say whether he  is

in  a  position  to  enlarge the  scope  for  an  attap

dwellers settlement.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> The hon. Member said he hoped I

would  open  up  attap  dweller settlements  for  other

nationalities.  But I would like to point  out  to  him

that  every  year  Government is spending  millions  of

dollars in buying up land and in resettling farmers  in

various parts of the island. Most of these farmers  are

from  the Chinese community. I do not think I  can,  at

this stage, agree with the proposal put forward by  the

Member   for  Changi  that  I  should  open   up   more

settlements for the people of the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I come to the Member for Tanjong Pagar. My

reply  to  him will be the same as the one I  gave  him

when  the  Housing  and Development Bill  was, debated

earlier  this  morning. Again, Sir, he brought  up  the

point where he insisted that this Government should not

implement  the  policy embodied in the  Planning  Bill,

because he said the present Government could only  last

a month or so. Again, he did say we on this side of the

House have been sleeping for the last four years. I  do

not know who has been sleeping.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He demands that we should not implement the policy of

the Government in the Planning Bill. If only the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar would read the Report of the  Select

Committee, he would certainly find that his  Party  was

represented in the Select Committee. I believe  it  was

the  Member for Sembawang. Also, at no time during  the

deliberations  of the Select Committee  did  his  Party

Member   put   forward   suggestions   regarding    the

implementation of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House have a responsibility to

the  people,  even though our responsibility  may  last

only  another month, six weeks or two months.  We  will

carry  out whatever policy is accepted by this Assembly

and  which  we  think will be good  to  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me warn my good friend, the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar. We on this side of the  House,  and

particularly my Party, will not be intimidated  by  the

People's  Action Party. We will do everything  possible

for  the  people of Singapore because we  know  we  are

doing the right thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Planning Bill, as contained in Sessional Paper No. L.A.

21 of 1958, be adopted.



<div align="center"><b>Third Reading</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Now, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, may I draw your attention, Sir,

to  clauses  1  and  5,  where the  figure  "1958"  was

mentioned.  I  think  it should be  "1959".  With  your

permission, Sir, I hope it will be changed to "1959".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The alterations will be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>11.27 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section 5 of the Civil Defence Ordinance (Chapter  73),

resolves  that  the Civil Defence (Singapore  Auxiliary

Fire  Service - Service) Rules, 1958, made on  the  23rd

day   of   December,   1958,   published   as   Gazette

Notification No. S 4 of the 2nd January, 1959,  and  as

contained  in Sessional Paper No. S.L. 1  of  1959,  be

approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auxiliary Fire Service forms part of

Singapore's Civil Defence organisation and, apart  from

one  Staff Officer who is a regular fireman, is  manned

entirely  by volunteers. Unlike other branches  of  the

organisation,  however, no rules have  yet  been  made

that  clearly  lay  down the liability  of  members  on

enrolling  into the service. The rules now  before  the

House  seek to rectify this omission by making detailed

provisions in regard to hours of attendance, discipline

and the type of service to which a member is liable. On

this  last  point, the rules bring into being  for  the

first time a reserve into which trained members can  be

transferred  after  completing the  initial  period  of

their  enrolment.  They are thus readily  available  in

times of emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules also make active and reserve members liable

for   mobilisation  in  the  event  of  an  emergency - a

liability that is essential if the regular Fire Brigade

is  to  be  expanded quickly and efficiently  at  short

notice.  It  is also to be noted that the  adoption  of

these rules will give the members of the Auxiliary Fire

Service  the  same  liability in  regard  to  training,

discipline and service as members of the other branches

of the Civil Defence Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further rules in respect of rates of pay for

mobilised service and pensions for injury are in course

of preparation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,143,973 for Head 45 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, this is an opportunity to

elaborate  on  the explanation given on  page  2.  Hon.

Members will note that of the total of $1,189,681 asked

for  in  the Schedule, about 91 per cent of it,  namely

$1,143,973,  is  asked for in respect of grants-in-aid.

The  capitation  grant, as explained in  the  Sessional

Paper, was increased from 30 cents per head to 50 cents

per  head  for  primary pupils, 75 cents per  head  for

secondary  pupils  and $1 per head  for  Higher  School

Certificate  pupils. The former rate of  30  cents  per

head  had been in existence for about 30 years  and  it

was  felt that this rate should, be changed to  enable

the  schools,  especially the  Chinese  schools,  to

better  their  equipment.  The  Government  decided  to

increase  this  grant so that these  schools  can  have

their  equipment  and the buildings can  be  made  more

presentable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other item, as explained here, is the salaries of

teachers. I believe that this question has been in  the

melting pot for many years. The salaries of teachers in

Chinese  aided  schools especially have been  neglected

for  a  long time and it has taken the Government quite

some  time  to  streamline and bring  the  salaries  of

teachers  of  these  aided  schools  at  par  with  the

salaries  of  the  teachers  in  other  Government  and

English schools. The arrears amount to a big sum and we

ask  the Assembly to approve this amount in the  spirit

in  which  the All Party Committee on Chinese Education

recommended  that the salaries of teachers  in  Chinese

and  other vernacular schools should be brought to  the

same level as that of the teachers in English and other

Government  schools.  As I said,  Application  No.  264

covers  two  points:  one, the increase  of  capitation

grants to Chinese schools and the other the arrears  of

salaries  to  be paid to the teachers of Chinese  aided

schools.

which  are more particularly delineated and edged  pink

on  Certified Plan No. 10401 filed in the office of the

Chief Surveyor, Singapore.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the trunk roads which connect Johore Bahru to

Singapore  city carry a very heavy flow of  traffic  at

almost all times of the day. Rapid developments in  the

northern part of Singapore island, both industrial  and

residential, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



necessitated improvements in road communication in

this  part of the island. The trunk roads  leading

to  the  north have had to be considerably widened

and  dual  carriageways have been  constructed  to

facilitate the faster flow of traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this road widening scheme, the

construction  of a dual carriageway  at  Woodlands

necessitates  encroachment on part of  the  Kranji

Forest Reserve Lot 162-5, Mukim No. 13, Sembawang.

The  proposed excision of the Forest  Reserve  for



road development comprises an estimated area of  a

little  over  two  acres  which  is  approximately

1/26th  of  the  total area of the  Kranji  Forest

Reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must mention, Sir, that the Trustees of the

Board   of  Management  of  the  Nature  Reserves,

appreciating   the   Public   Works   Department's

requirements  of  land  for modernisation  of  the

Woodlands  Road,  have agreed to the  excision  of

this  land  with great regret. However, the  Board

has  made  a detailed botanical survey before  the

natural vegetation is lost for all time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section   4   of  the  Nature  Reserves  Ordinance

(Chapter  235), resolves that paragraph 4  of  the

<div align="center"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL (Select Committee's Report)</b></div>



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Local  Government Elections (Amendment)  Bill,  as

contained in Sessional Paper L.A. 22 of  1958,  be

adopted, subject to the recommitted of the Bill in

respect  of a new clause immediately after  clause

11 to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Report of the Select

Committee   on  the  Local  Government   Elections

(Amendment)  Bill has been in the  hands  of  hon.

Members   for  nearly  two  months.  I  refer   to

Sessional Paper No. L.A. 22 of 1958. Hon.  Members

are  aware that the purpose of this amending  Bill

was  to implement the recommendations of the Elias

Commission by embodying them in the law  with  the

object    of   eliminating   malpractices   during

elections.  As  a  result  of  oral  and   written

representations as well as new proposals  made  in

Select  Committee, a number of amendments  to  the

original Bill have been made. As hon. Members have

had  a  good  deal of time in which to  study  the

Report, I feel it would be unnecessary for  me  to

do  any  more except draw attention to  the  major

amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first major amendment is at clause 3. It

has nothing to do with the Elias Commission, being

solely  concerned with changing the franchise  for

local  government  elections  by  permitting  only

those   persons   who  have  been  registered   as

Singapore citizens to vote. The qualifications for

voting  at  local  government  elections  are  now

identical  with those required for the Legislative

Assembly  elections. In other words, the franchise

is  confined to Singapore citizens. By  virtue  of

the   proviso  at  paragraph  (d),  the   existing

qualifications  will  remain  unchanged  for   the

purposes of any by-elections which may take  place

between now and the completion of the revision  of

the  register of electors towards the end  of  the

year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second major amendment is shown at clause

16,  by  which  a  new Section 41A has  been  added  to

provide  for compulsory voting. Views on this amendment

were  not unanimous as the Hon. the Minister for  Local

Government,   Lands  and  Housing  voted  against   its

inclusion  in the Bill. The amendments made at  clauses

2,  4, 11 and 14 are consequential on the provision for

compulsory  voting. The principle which is inherent  in

the  proposal for compulsory voting is that persons who

are  now  privileged to become Singapore  citizens  are

required as a duty to vote and not simply regard voting

as a right which can be ignored without redress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our new Constitution, we have taken into our

Singapore  family  a large number of  persons  who,  by

virtue  of  only eight years' residence, are privileged

to become Singapore citizens. By introducing compulsory

voting,  we  bring  all  these  citizens  into   active

participation in elections. On the one hand, therefore,

they  have a proper status and a stake in this  country

and have a voice in its affairs, and on the other hand,

they   are   expected  to  exercise  their   vote   and

demonstrate  tangibly  their interest  and  loyalty  by

discharging their duty by voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will recollect that the Government had

received  representations from many  organisations  and

individuals  urging  upon the Government  to  introduce

compulsory voting and in deference to their wishes  the

Government   agreed   to   give   support   to    their

representations. My colleague, the Minister  for  Local

Government,  Lands  and Housing, however,  is  under  a

special  directive from his Party to oppose  compulsory

voting and I have therefore given him and the Assistant

Minister for Education permission to take their Party's

stand on this issue. As this is a matter which concerns

all  political Parties represented in the Assembly  and

as Members of the Select Committee were drawn from such

political  Parties, it was fully discussed at  informal

meetings  and,  apart  from  the  Minister  for   Local

Government.  Lands and Housing there was no  opposition

to compulsory voting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also considered that compulsory voting will,

together  with  the  other  measures  which  have  been

written  into  the  Bill, reduce the opportunities  for

malpractices such as intimidation and coercion  of  the

electorate. In fact, the Elias Commission  was  of  the

opinion that a system of compulsory voting would be the

most  important single measure that could lead  to  the

elimination of corrupt practices. Another reason,  Sir,

was  on  account of the inaccuracies in the  registers,

which,  for various reasons, are thought to be as  high

as  20 per cent inaccurate. With compulsory voting  the

electoral registers can be corrected once and for  all.

It   is  for  these  several  important  reasons   that

provision has been made for compulsory voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noticed that in the event of persons

failing  to vote, mild sanctions are imposed. I  should

mention  that  Members  of  the  Select  Committee  had

informal discussions on the sanctions proposed and  the

effect  on the public. It was generally agreed that  as

this  would be the first time that many members of  the

public  will be visiting the polls, it was not intended

that the legal sanction should be harsh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was necessary, however, to provide an inducement

to  all voters, old and new, to discharge their duty on

polling day. It was agreed to recommend as a Government

policy  to  confine State organised social benefits  to

citizens  of Singapore and their families whose  names,

if  their ages are 21 and above, should appear  on  the

electoral   roll.  Such  benefits  are   free   medical

treatment, unemployment and other relief, free  primary

education,  S.I.T. accommodation, etc.  The  issue  of

passports and employment in the Civil Service are  also

points of Government policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of transport to the polling stations,

the  amendment at subclause (2) of clause  22  confines

the  use of motor vehicles to the owner and members  of

his  family. A definition of "member of his family"  is

given at subclause (3).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision to regulate the display of posters

and  banners  has  been added at  clause  24.  By  this

amendment  we  hope  to  eliminate  the  indiscriminate

plastering of posters and banners and the disfigurement

of  the City and the countryside whenever there  is  an

election  or  a  by-election. The regulations  will  be

published in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards election activities, the amendment to the

new  Section  73C  on  page 14  specifically  prohibits

primary  or secondary school students as well as  known

secret  society members from participating in  election

activities. The reason for this provision is, I  think,

clear enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have now covered the main amendments. As

notified in my motion, however, I have one amendment to

make  on recommittal of the Bill. I will speak on  this

amendment at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before we proceed further on this

matter, perhaps I had better draw the attention of hon.

Members to Standing Order 55 (3). If hon. Members  will

look  at  page 23 of the Standing Orders, perhaps  they

will  follow  me a little more closely.  Paragraph  (3)

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upon a motion to adopt the report of a Select

Committee  on  a  Bill,  any  Member  may  propose   an

amendment  to  add,  at the end of the  motion  or  the

original  motion  may include at the end  thereof,  the

words  "subject to the recommittal of the Bill  [either

wholly  or in respect only of some particular  part  or

parts of the Bill or of some proposed new clause or new

schedule  to  a  Committee of the whole Assembly",  and

upon that motion being seconded the Bill shall stand so

recommitted  without question put. The  Assembly  shall

thereupon either forthwith or upon a day to be named by

the Member in charge of the Bill, resolve itself into a

Committee to consider the business so recommitted."



<br><br>The  position then in this case is that when  once  the

motion  is  seconded, then, to use  the  words  in  the

Standing  Order,  upon that motion being  seconded  the

Bill  shall stand so recommitted without question put."

Therefore, if an hon. Member wishes to discuss or  vote

against  any specific clauses in the Bill itself,  then

this is his opportunity to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>



amend the motion under the provisions of Standing Order

55  (3) so that the Bill can be recommitted not only in

respect  of  a new clause to be proposed  but  also  in

respect of those specific clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust I have made myself clear, and if hon. Members

wish  for time to consider that aspect of this  motion,

perhaps we could take the suspension now.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Is it to be seconded, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not asking for a seconder yet. I

would like to know whether hon. Members would like time

to consider that Standing Order. Perhaps Members of the

Opposition could indicate to me whether they would like

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it would be very wise to

adjourn  now as the time is about 12 o'clock. It  would

also give us time for consideration.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This is just to give hon. Members an

opportunity  to  discuss  in  Committee  of  the  whole

Assembly  certain specific clauses. If hon. Members  do

not  wish  to  take advantage of Standing Order  55(3) ,

then  I  will  call for a seconder and that  means,  of

course,  that  the  matter  then  goes  straight   into

Committee of the whole Assembly only in connection with

the new clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might also mention, of course, that if hon. Members

wish to discuss generally the contents of the Bill, the

opportunity will present itself at the Third Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I have a seconder?

 'Amendment of        Subsection (3) of section 22

section 22.           of the principal Ordinance

                      is hereby section amended by

                      appearing in the fourth line

                      thereof and substituting therefor

                      the word "three".'.-[The Chief Minister].

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the clause be read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law stands at present, Sir, the Local

Authority  must  hold  an election  to  fill  a  casual

vacancy  within  two months of that vacancy  occurring.

This is a very short period and allows only the minimum



amount  of time in which to follow the legal procedures

as  well as to enable political parties to prepare  and

campaign  for  an  election or by-election.  For  these

reasons,  an  extension is thought to be necessary,  in

particular in view of the forthcoming General Elections

and the possibility that there may be some vacancies to

fill   in  the  City  Council  as  a  result  of   City

Councillors  wishing  to  participate  in  the  General

Elections.  It  is  felt that a three-month  period  is

necessary  to  enable  the  by-election  that  may   be

necessary  to  be  held  after the  General  Elections.

Without  this  amendment, it may happen  that  the  by-election may have to be held almost at the same time as

the General Elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill.



Bill reported, with an Amendment.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading. What day?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee (Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Mak Pak Shee):</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, this is about the most

illuminating   example   of  the   futility   of   this

Government's legislation, of which we have had quite  a

few examples in the last few days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill was first introduced in this Chamber,

we  were all led to believe that at some time or  other

there   were  going  to  be  elections  to  the   Local

Government and that the District Council elections were

going  to be held. We were told in 1957 that they would

be  held  at the beginning of 1958. After the  disaster

they  encountered  in the City Council  elections,  the

Labour  Front  tarried and dallied. In  the  middle  of

1958, we were told that there might be elections at the

end of 1958. Now in 1959 all pretence has been dropped,

and  it  is openly acknowledged that there will  be  no

elections  to the District Council during the  life  of

this  Government. So why are we debating  this  bit  of

shadow legislation? What is the purpose of it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a good thing that the Legislative Assembly

elections  are  not  so much at the  disposal  of  this

Government  as  the  Local Government  elections  were,

otherwise  it may well be that 1959 would not  see  the

General Elections. However, we were informed that  some

of  the principles which we debated in Select Committee

might be embodied in the Singapore Legislative Assembly

Elections (Amendment) Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have had the Bill for a few days and when

that  Bill  comes up for Second Reading and  goes  into

Committee, we shall inform the Government of our views.

If  it  were  possible,  I would  like  to  inform  the



Government of our views before it comes up for Second



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



Reading.  After all, we are all publicly  committed  to

free   elections - whatever  each  Member  may  privately

desire.  And  since we are all committed to  trying  to

frame  rules  to  ensure  free  and  decent  and  clean

elections,  it  should not be difficult  so  to  devise

things  that gangsters are nicely put out of  the  way.

And  if  it hurts the Member for Serangoon,  who  is  a

schoolmaster, to have schoolboys put out of the way;  I

have  seen  his own students working not for his  Party

but  for  some  other Party, and if the Chief  Minister

thinks  that  compulsory  voting  might  yet  save  the

sinking  S.P.A.,  ex-Labour Front, ex-Progressive,  ex-Liberal-Socialist -

all the political  riff-raff  and flotsam and jetsam, then we will-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Firstly, I think the expression

"riff-raff,  flotsam  and  jetsam"  with  reference  to

Members  of the Assembly - I take it there was  reference

to    Members    of    the    Assembly - is    completely

unparliamentary, and all these personalities seem to me

to  be  quite  irrelevant. And if the hon. Member  will

continue  with the debate on the Third Reading  of  the

Bill which must be confined to the contents of the Bill

and nothing more, then perhaps we can get on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, Sir, I am very keen to get

on  with  the Bill because I think it serves no purpose

whatsoever.  Firstly this Bill is going to  be  another

piece  of  futile legislation, and all I was hoping  to

drive  home was to remind Members on the opposite  side

that they can think of all the schemes they like in the

world,  but the secret of a long political  life  is  a

clean,  healthy,  good  political  life.  There  is  no

substitute for it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have asked the hon. Member to

withdraw certain words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I was not referring to Members

of the Assembly when I said "flotsam and jetsam". I was

referring  to  the political Parties that have  plagued

this country for the last few years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Including yours!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member

should  debate what my opinion is. My opinion was  that

he  did refer to a government consisting of Members  of

different political Parties; and those expressions,  to

me, had some reference to Members of this Assembly, and

I ask the hon. Member to withdraw those expressions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In so far as they referred to

Members of this Assembly, Sir, I withdraw. But let  the

Government at least have the courage, if they  want  to

try their luck at compulsory voting, to say, "I want to

try this. This is my last gamble, the last throw of the

dice.  I  believe  the P.A.P. got in  because  lots  of

people who supported the Labour Front did not vote."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said quite frankly to the Chief Minister in

Select  Committee what we had already stated  publicly,

and  what my Chairman has stated publicly on behalf  of

my  Party.  We are not afraid of compulsory voting.  If

the  Government want another last throw  of  the  dice,

short  of the dice being loaded, short of ballot papers

being stuffed beforehand into the ballot boxes - and that

is  not  possible - nothing  will  save  them.  If  they

believe  that  compulsory voting is  the  answer  to  a

democratic government, then I say, so be it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as this Bill is concerned, we are all

wasting  time  debating a piece of  shadow  legislation

which  they have not the slightest intention of  using.

Now,  they  have  not even the opportunity  to  use  it



before  they  go out of office. The whole solemnity  of

the  legislative  process is  being  abused  by  people

pushing through measures which they know full well  are

just so many extra words on the Statute Book.



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this afternoon, we

are adopting this Report of the Select Committee. I  am

glad after all that elections are due, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



we  had  this  promise of elections in 1956,  1957  and

1958, when the minority government was working.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the situation is much worse. Certain Members

elected  on  certain Party tickets have  resigned  from

their  Parties, and therefore they no longer  represent

their electorate; they only represent themselves.  Sir,

the  Liberal-Socialist Party elected  members  have  no

objection  whatsoever to whatever Bills the  Government

pass,  because  after the life of this Government,  the

people  will  be able to judge who is faithful  to  his

word.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought I made it quite clear

that we are now on the Third Reading of this Bill,  and

the debate on the Third Reading can only be confined to

the contents of the Bill. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, with due respect to the Chair,

I  am  trying to confine as best I can, but as a person

elected from my electorate, I am sure I can express  my

political opinion. But if I am prevented, Sir, by  your

ruling, I have nothing more to say. After all, this  is

an   Assembly  where  we  can  express  our   political

opinions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is not

satisfied with my ruling, he has his remedy - he can move

a  motion. But I must try and apply the Standing Orders

as  best  I  can. The Standing Orders are the  Standing

Orders of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now on the Third Reading of a Bill. Now if the

hon.  Member  had comments of the nature he  wishes  to

pass, he had the opportunity when I indicated what  the

procedure was-to recommit certain clauses of this Bill,

which  perhaps would have given him the opportunity  to

pass  the remarks he wished to pass when these specific

clauses  were  discussed  in Committee.  But  he  never

availed  himself  of that advantage,  and  now  we  are

debating  the  contents of the Bill, and  the  contents

only.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have always respected the

has  guarded  the  rights of the Assemblymen,  and  the

Assemblymen  have their own rights too. Thank  you  for

the  remarks, Sir. After these few remarks, what I want

to  ask is this. Do you call this legislation or  rules

and  regulations  a guided democracy, or  dictatorship?

But  what  I  say  is this. The voters will  judge  the

persons whom they are going to vote.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I for one would

like  to  comment  on compulsory voting.  Personally  I

think compulsory voting is rather undemocratic. On  the

other  hand, compulsory voting would give the masses  a

chance to give expression to their demands. I say  this

because  I  want  to quote one incident which  happened

during  the by-election in Tanjong Pagar in  1956.  One

was  the  way the members or supporters of the People's

Action Party behaved themselves during that time. Their

methods  remind  me of violence and gangsterism.  I  am

referring to an incident which occurred after  the  by-election  result was known, that is, about midnight.  A

few  hundred  supporters of the People's  Action  Party

were  marching  in  regimental order along  Kreta  Ayer

Road. They then cut into Keong Siak Road and Sago Lane,

where the death houses were. This band of people, while

marching  along the road, were shouting "Oompa  Oompa,

Merdeka!"  I do not mind this expression at  all.  This

group  of unruly ruffians or hooligans then arrived  at

the  Branch Office of the Liberal-Socialist  Party.  In

front of the Branch Office was a coffee

stall, and across the road there was a banner put up by

the  Liberal-Socialist. Party candidate, Mr Chong  Wee

Ling.  When this group of people came to the  front  of

this  Branch Office, they behaved in a violent  manner.

This  reminded  me  of  the Hock Lee  Bus  riots.  They

climbed  on to one another's shoulders and pulled  down

the banner, and tore it into strips



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>



which  they then tied together. They then marched along

the  road like a funeral procession. At the same  time,

they  tore down the posters of Mr Chong Wee Ling  from

the coffee stall, which were pasted by the sympathisers

of  our Party. The stall was then smashed by these same

hooligans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compulsory voting is to allow expression by the

people  of  Singapore. Do we want a party in  power  to

adopt  such violent and gangster methods or not? I  for

one  would  advocate that the people who  make  use  of

these hooligans should be punished.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> He had his chance to speak.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has not given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not the people of Tanjong Pagar?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> We have given many chances to the

People's Action Party. One can now see the force of the

P.A.P. to  show  how lamblike they  are  and  honestly

trusting  the Communists. They are men who  would  use,

without compunction, the strong-arm and violent methods

of gangsters to get into power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the House

to  another fact, if compulsory voting is going  to  be

adopted. In my area alone there are over 1,000  voters.

They  are  staying  in  huts and attap  houses  in  the

electoral  division  of  Tiong  Bahru.  The  Statistics

Department   go  by  the  boundary  in  compiling   the

electoral registers. The even numbers in the  area  and

the  odd numbers in the other area along the main  road

will  be divided, so much so that the people living  in

my  kampong  have  had  their  names  compiled  in  the

electoral  register of Delta Division. If  the  polling

station for the same voter is in the Delta area,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>



how  do you expect these people, most of whom are  old,

to go from Tiong Bahru to Delta Road area to cast their

votes,  a  distance of about one mile? I  have  pointed

this  out  to  the  Commissioner of  Elections  and  he

replied  to  me  that he was unable to  transfer  these

people from the electoral register of Delta area to the

electoral  register of Tiong Bahru. Sir, I  would  also

like  to  say  something about the compilation  of  the

records. I should say that about 30 to 40 per  cent  on

the register are inaccurate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I took part in the election at Tanjong Pagar, I

found  that  90  cards,  with  the  voters'  names  and

addresses printed on them, were distributed to  one  of

the  houses there. In actual fact, there were  only  40

people  living in this house. Why cannot the Government

take  steps  to  rectify this mistake? Why  cannot  the

Government see to it that the people who do not live in

these  houses  should be debarred  from  casting  their

votes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back now to the question of voters in my

area - it is rather strange that Government expect  those

people  living in my area, that is, in Tiong Bahru, to

cast  their votes in the Delta constituency to elect  a

candidate  to represent their interests in a  different

constituency,  that  is, electing a  representative  in

Delta  to represent the people who live in Tiong Bahru.

This  is  most  ridiculous.  But  I  cannot  blame  the

Department of Statistics, Sir, because I found out that

they  compiled  the  registers by the  numbers  of  the

houses.  Take, for instance, people living alongside  a

long  road.  The  houses on one  side  will  have  even

numbers  and  the opposite side will have odd  numbers.

The even numbers will fall into one electoral register,

and  the  odd numbers will fall into another  electoral

register.  For instance, the Tiong Bahru register  will

include  all  houses with even numbers irrespective  of

the  fact  that some of the even numbers of houses  are

situated  in  another area, say Delta  area.  In  other

words,  the  Department take the road as  the  dividing

line. I hope the Government will take steps to put  the

voters back in their respective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>



constituency.  That is, the voters who  live  in  Tiong

Bahru, but whose names appear in the register of voters

in  the Delta constituency, should be transferred  back

to the Tiong Bahru register. I am sure that other areas

have  the  same  problem as my area  has.  I  took  the

trouble  of  looking into the question of voters  in  a

different  constituency and I found  that  the  figures

came  to  over  1,000  people - over  1,000  voters   are

involved. I would urge the Government to see that  this

mistake be rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one would support compulsory voting. As I said,

it  would  give the people the opportunity  to  express

their feelings, and to decide whether they want a Party

which  adopts  the methods of gangsterism  or  a  Party

which adopts a democratic method to run Singapore.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to talk on compulsory voting. The Member for

Tanjong  Pagar has spoken very strongly indeed on  this

Bill. He said that this Bill should never have come  to

this  Assembly-we have wasted the time of the Assembly.

I  do  not think so. I have been a member of the Select



Committee,  and I would like to read out the  names  of

other  members of the Select Committee. They  are:  the

Hon.  Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat, the Hon. Mr  J.

M.  Jumabhoy, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Lim Cher Kheng, Mr

Lim  Choon Mong, Mr E. P. Shanks, and the Hon. Dr Lim

Yew Hock-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Tun, Tun.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Well, Sir, I wonder why the

protest was not registered at that stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has not given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I do not know why, if this Bill

is  not good, it should have come to this Assembly; and

why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



we  should  have  had so many meetings  of  the  Select

Committee. In this Report the first meeting was-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> 22nd August.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> dated 22nd August, 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - the elections in December?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - at which the Member for Tanjong Pagar, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, was present. Sir, I was really

impressed by his enthusiasm at that time. He talked  in

a very business-like manner. He said that we must clean

up  all  these things; we must prevent the  thugs  from

running  the elections; we must prevent those  who  are

non-citizens  from participating in the elections,  and

we  must  sit down and seriously think what methods  we

must   adopt   to  make  our  elections   clean.   Very

commendable, Sir, I would like to commend him  further,

Sir,  because, after the discussion in the first Select

Committee  meeting,  and at his own  request,  we  were

called  to an All-Party Committee meeting at the  Chief

Minister's  Office.  We put up proposals  and  counter-proposals.  Every detail was discussed, right  down  to

posters,  compulsory voting, use of students, this  and

that.  He  was most enthusiastic. I think he should  be

given a medal for showing such public spiritedness. But

after  hearing  him today saying: "Look,  this  is  all

useless. Take the Bill away. We are wasting our  time",

I just cannot reconcile the action he showed previously

with his present action. What is all this about? Why is

the  change? Why should we have the change? Who  should

have the change? Should the change be initiated by  the

Government, or by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar?  I

suppose  if the change were initiated from the  P.A.P.,

then  everything  should be all right.  The  people  of

Singapore  should be very happy. But  if  anybody  else

should  initiate it, then it would be a waste  of  time

for  this  Assembly.  No,  Sir.  Talking  about  people

changing political Parties, talking about all these-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has gone

very,  very  far  from the Bill. Now  he  seems  to  be

straying  a  little further. Let us come  back  to  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I was just commenting on a few

points  which  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  had  said

during  the Third Reading and which had interested  me,

and  I  thought we should also let him have our opinion

on  the  same subject! I was saying that talking  about

all  these changes, it should not be just the  wish  of

one   Party   to  change  but  the  wish  of  everybody

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come back to the question of compulsory voting.

I  think  it is a very good measure, because the  Party



which  wins  will know that it has the support  of  the

majority  of the people and not of a small  section  of

the people. Compulsory voting, Sir, will rule out to  a

large  extent the use of thugs, as alleged  by  Members

here.  It  will tone down the use of schoolchildren  in

the electioneering campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been referred to as a school teacher. I

think  it  is,  after all, a very good thing  to  be  a

school  teacher  and  to  be able  to  look  after  the

interests of school children and not just to  make  use

of  them. Today, school children stay at their work  to

study  their lessons, and not influenced by  the  rebel

talks  of  those people, need not go to  principals  or

teachers  to ask that they be promoted, or  plead  that

they  be found an extra school to go to. I have  always

been of the opinion that the people who really have the

welfare  of  the children at heart should refrain  from

using  them.  They should ask them to  think  of  their

studies  first,  so that when they  grow  up  they  may

better  be  able to serve Singapore, instead  of  their

having ideas put in their heads, being sent on a  wild-goose  chase, neglecting their lessons and  failing  in

their  examinations.  How  many  of  them  have  failed

miserably?  If you look at the list of failures,  I  am

sure  you  will find that those who are most active  in

shouting  slogans and marching down Kreta  Ayer  Street

will be amongst them. Now, after they have failed, they

ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>



the  Government or public-spirited people to help them.

I would say we have helped them. But those who make use



of them have no solution for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the idea of getting these children away from

all electioneering is a good one.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, back in the year

1956  the  Branch Secretaries of the Labour Front  were

meeting regularly and were considering the work of  the

1955 elections and the work that would be necessary for

elections which were foreseen as possible in 1957,  and

they  produced the proposals which finally  took  fruit

just  over  2½ years later in this Bill. Substantially

this  Bill  embodies  the proposals  then  put  forward

through  my  friend,  Gerald de  Cruz,  by  the  Branch

Secretaries of the Labour Front - for compulsory  voting,

holidays, control of transport, the use of transport by

candidates. The findings of the Elias Commission, which

are  also related to this Bill, were substantially  the

findings of that group of Labour Front workers at  that

time.  The Elias Commission did it more thoroughly  and

more  judicially,  but the matters  discussed  and  the

conclusions arrived at were the same. Sir, it makes  me

happy  to  think that the principles embodied  in  this

Bill  are  ones which find the general assent  of  this

Assembly, however they may regard details of timing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one basic principle in politics, Mr Speaker,

which I think this Bill protects and which is best  put

in  the  words of Confucius. I can quote  them  in  the

English version:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a man's mind is ruled by passion, his conduct

will be incorrect."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is already obvious, Mr Speaker, that in this

Assembly you are most scrupulously watching to see that

our  minds  do  not  become moved by  passion  and  our

conduct  does  not err into indecorum.  You  have  been

pulling up speakers very frequently for verging on  the

bounds of indecorous words from which they might go  on

no doubt into undesirable actions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as the elections become closer, so politicians

will  allow themselves to be guided by their  feelings;

and more than that I am afraid. From past experience, I

consider it a certainty that politicians will  seek  to

get  the  people of Singapore guided by their feelings.

They will try to work them up, to make them feel, "Away

with  this, and away with that!" The still small  voice

of  reason  will be less and less heard,  except  where

reason  can  be used as a machine to produce  emotional

results.  It  is, to some extent, a necessary  part  of

political  life  that politicians should  try  to  stir

men's  hearts and rouse their feelings, because a great

many  people  undoubtedly are not profoundly  moved  by

political affairs. They go forward in their daily lives

not  interested  in the complicated courses  which  may

make  them in fact happy or unhappy. It is not for most

people  a matter of intellectual interest to study  the

trade figures of Singapore. They frequently appear  not

to  realise  that  on the figures of  trade  and  on  a

sensible  interpretation  of  them  depends  their  own

expectation   of  future  employment,  prosperity,   of

adequate  hospital services and education services  and

all  the other things that they get, which are  in  the

end a share of the profits of Singapore's trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, if we are to interest people in

policies,  we have to try to bring those policies  down

into  their  daily lives and put them into words  which

will stir their minds and move them. It can be done  in

a good way. It can be done in a bad way, it is the part

of the honest politician to present it truthfully, only

illustrating it so as to make it understandable. If you

come  with  long academic words and profound scientific

explanations to an audience of people who  cannot  more

than  barely  read  and  write, with  a  vocabulary  of

perhaps  1,000 or 1,500 words, you cannot  expect  they

will listen to you with attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the problem of the school master - and it

refers  to  my own profession - teaching in school  where

you  have to teach difficult subjects in simple  words.

The  same thing applies to politics. Consequently,  the

honest  and good politician will study his subject  and

see in what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>



way it can be presented so that it can be understood by

people who have not a great deal of time to spare,  and

who  have  already  done a heavy  day's  work  and  are

sacrificing their own leisure time to come  and  listen

to him talking. He will try to make his explanations of

political affairs interesting and significant to  them.

But  because  things  have to be often  put  in  simple

political  terms, there is a great temptation  for  the

dishonest politician to misrepresent the facts or  even

to  tell lies. It is this which provides a great danger

to Singapore, and has provided it in the past, and will

provide  it  in the future, as it does in  any  country

where  people  go  out and try to  win  for  themselves

popular  support. It applies not only  to  politicians,

but  it  also applies to all attempts to secure popular

support, whether in your trying to sell a soft drink or

a  patent  medicine or a newspaper or any  other  thing

where your success depends on bringing in hundreds  and

thousands  of people to say, "That is very good.  I  am

for  that."  The  temptation to  dishonesty  is  always

there, and very often people yield more or less to that

temptation.  It  would not be hard to bring  into  this

Assembly - in  fact  I  have one here - election  addresses

sent  out  to the voters of Singapore in which  blatant

lies  were  told  and  things were misrepresented.  The

truth   was   shirked   and   intentionally   dishonest

statements were made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee which sat on this Bill, there

was  one  point which I noticed. There was the question

of the interpretation of a Malay word. Whether it meant

that  the minds of the public were disturbed or whether

it  meant that the minds of the public were - I  forgot

what  the  other  interpretation was.  Anyhow,  it  was

discussed in the Select Committee and the witness  said

he  did not mean that people's minds were disturbed  in

any bad way. But, nevertheless, they were disturbed  by

the  two or three months of intensive shouting and  the

rudeness  and  so on which goes on between  politicians

before elections start.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witness in the Select Committee suggested that

there  should  be two or three days before  the  actual

polling day during which political activity must  stop,

so that the voters would have a chance to cool down and

consider  soberly what had been said,  what  the  facts

really were and then cast their votes in sober judgment

and  not  in  the  excitement of a mind  inflamed  with

electoral oratory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that has not been provided, but at least it has

been  provided that on polling day itself the  mind  of

the elector shall be left free, and there shall not  be

attempts  to  control  or  intimidate  or  persuade  or

influence  him  as he prepares himself  to  go  to  the

polls.  As he goes there, the parades of all kinds  and

descriptions of men - some of rather menacing aspect - whom

we  have seen standing outside polling stations in  the

past,  will I hope not be seen again. If they start  to

hang around 200 yards from the polling station - that  is

the  distance fixed in the Ordinance - then  I  hope  the

police will stand a few hundred yards away as well  and

will say, "Will you please move along the street, which

is  for  people  to pass along, and not for  people  to

loiter in?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in the Kallang by-election there was an

informal agreement between the Parties not to put these

watchers or supervisors outside the polling stations to

watch the people coming to the polls. But it had little

effect.  In  fact,  the  day  ended  with  very   large

accumulations  of people wearing all  sorts  of  little

funny hats lining up outside. I myself observed elderly

and  quiet looking people coming, as it were, with  the

intention of voting and then looking rather dismayed. I

saw  two elderly Chinese ladies, for example. They came

along,  talking,  with their bits  of  paper  in  their

hands,  and  then they suddenly looked  up  from  their

talk.  They  saw the accumulated crowd  and  then  they

looked  at  each  other and had a short  conference  or

consultation. Then they turned round and went away.  At

least  two  people did not cast their votes  that  day,

because  they saw a crowd of people there.  They  said,

"Well, we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>



quiet  people;  we  do not want to  walk  through  this

battery of staring eyes, all trying to wonder which way

we are going to vote."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I very much welcome the provisions in this law

that  on polling day the political Parties should  keep

quiet  and  stay at home and let the voters go  to  the

polling  stations, with their minds made up  not  under

the  influence of passion - whether anger or fear or  any

other  passion.  Let the voters go to  the  polls  with

their minds free to think and judge wisely. That  is  a

great step forward, I think, among the things which are

worth achieving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also personally welcome the introduction of

compulsory  polling  or  voting,  whichever  word   you

prefer.   I  suppose  the  point  has  been  thoroughly

studied,  but  the  effect, of course,  is  that  in  a

compulsory poll, a voter has to turn up and go  through

the  motions of voting; and if he likes to  write  some

rude remarks on his paper or draw pictures of somebody,

or  do  any other action, it should not be possible  to

find  out what he has done since he has voted secretly,

because  this compulsory polling is, I feel, a  further

safeguard for the peace of mind of the voters.  If  all

must  vote,  then it is harder to say of any individual

whether he has voted this way or he has voted that way,

because  he  is  just one small drop in  a  very  large

ocean.  The smaller the po1i, the easier will  a  voter

feel  it  for  an unsuccessful candidate afterwards  to

say, "I believe you voted for the other man, and now  I

am going to pay you out for it." That is a danger which

will certainly be feared by voters sometimes, and it is

most  important that they should not feel  that.  Under

these  proposals, the crowd will be greater, the number

of votes will be greater, and the chance of identifying

the feelings of any particular voter will therefore  be

less.  For  that  reason alone,  compulsory  voting  or

polling is a very desirable thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable on other grounds as well, Mr

Speaker.  We  have  seen  a  number  of  elections   in

Singapore.  My  mind  goes back to 1955.  Approximately

156,000  voted then, if I remember rightly.  Officially

that  was  about  53  per cent  of  the  poll.  If  the

registers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>



were  20 per cent inaccurate, as they usually are,

then  it was more like 66 per cent of the possible

poll.  Anyhow, it was a fair vote,  though  not  a

very  heavy  one. Now in that poll,  Mr  Speaker,

there were 25 Members elected to this Assembly. Of

those  25,  the great majority were elected  by  a

minority vote. They may not like to have  it  said

of them but, nevertheless, it is certainly true. I

remember  the  indignation with which  the  former

Chief  Minister, Mr D. S. Marshall,  received  my

analysis  of  the election results, when  I  quite

innocently remarked that the Labour Front won five

of its ten seats on a minority poll, including the

Cairnhill  Division where the Labour Front  polled

3,500  votes  and  the  Opposition  Parties -   the

Progressives  and  the  Democrats  - polled   3,630

votes;  so  that what was a fairly  nice  majority

over  the  next candidate was, in fact, a minority

vote  for  the Socialist side and a majority  vote

for the capitalist side. That was completely shown

in  the Cairnhill by-election thereafter, when the

capitalist vote undoubtedly carried the day.  That

case, I think, applied to about 14 or 15 of those

elected to this Assembly and if there had  been  a

different  method of voting they  would  not  have

been  here.  They  are here because  there  was  a

single vote and the man had got, say, 1,100  votes

and his two opponents got 1,000 votes each. He has

definitely  only got about a third  of  the  total

votes  cast, but as he has got the largest  single

number of votes he becomes an Assemblyman and says

very   proudly,  "I  speak  for  the   people   of

Singapore!"  What he speaks for is a few  thousand

people   who  voted  for  him,  and  in  his   own

constituency the majority of the people would have

voted  against  him if they could.  Unfortunately,

they  could not agree whom to vote for, and he  is

now   sitting  in  the  Assembly.  These  are  the

inevitable  results of our electoral system  which

is  modelled  on  the electoral  system  of  Great

Britain; and the justification for it - if it  is  a

justification - is not so much that it gives  effect

to  the  wishes  of the people, as that,  it  does

secure  that  a government comes into power  which

has a useful majority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>



On  the  whole, the tendency is to  give  a  small

minority of voters the decisive word which  throws

the   majority  in  the  Assembly.  If   I   might

illustrate that, Mr Speaker, by referring to one

case in this little textbook. In Great Britain  in

1931,  the  Conservative Party  polled  12,730,000

votes  and got 460 seats in the House of Commons.

The   Liberal  and  Labour  Parties  polled   over

9,500,00  votes and got 250 seats in the House  of

Commons. The Conservative Party got 120 more seats

than  their votes would have justified.  In  other

cases,  the  additional seats achieved  have  been

still higher sometimes. It may go to any Party. It

does  not matter much to which Party it goes.  The

tendency  possibly will be in the future  for  the

Labour  Party in Britain to get advantage of  that

system of voting for single members where you have

to make a choice, and if your choice is not one of

the majority, your voice is not heard at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, as we bring in compulsory

voting,   we   shall  I  think  do  something   to

ensure - not necessarily that every man or woman  in

the  Assembly  has the unanimous  support  of  the

people  in  the  constituency  where  he  or   she

stands - because it is most unlikely that he or  she

will - and  I  shall expect myself that  any  future

Assembly will contain a great many Members who  do

not  represent the majority of the voters in their

constituencies but who represent a  minority,  but

the  largest  minority that has managed  to  agree

together...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to look back to 1955, if I may

look  back to it. Had the Liberal-Socialist  Party

been   formed, say,  in  1954  and  fought   the

elections  and  had the Member for Telok  Ayer  at

that  time been a member of the Party and  not  an

Independent,  then  the  Liberal-Socialist   Party

would have had the seats to form the Government if

they  had  been  able to get the  support  of  the

U.M.N.O.-M,C.A. Alliance. They would  have  had  a

clear  majority  and  they  would  not  even  have

needed,  I  think, Members nominated to  fill  up

their  Benches. The nominated Members  could  have

sat  on the other side if they had wanted to. They

would have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



certainly not needed a nominated Minister like  myself.

The Member for Serangoon, as the leader of the Liberal-Socialists, might

well have been the Chief Minister  of

Singapore  for  the last four years had  there  been  a

united  Right or Liberal-Socialist Party at that  time.

Although,  in fact, the votes as cast showed  a  slight

majority - a  few thousand votes-for what you might  call

the Left Parties, nevertheless, the Right votes were so

distributed  that  had  there been  unity  between  the

Democrats and the Progressives at that time, they would

have  been  able to form the Government, although  they

would not have represented more than 50 per cent of the

votes actually cast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rather lengthy excursion into an analysis of

electoral results, Mr Speaker, is only to reinforce my

point  that  compulsory voting will give the  1959-1964

Assembly a better chance of knowing what the people  of

Singapore  want. What the people of Singapore  want  is

not  necessarily  the  whole programme  of  any  Party.

Certainly when we say "the people of Singapore", it  is

a loose expression which usually means "my supporters",

but  not any Party in Singapore is going to command all

the  support  of  all  the voters.  But  one  thing  is

certain - that  a  very large number of the  voters  will

disapprove  of whatever Party comes into power  at  the

next elections. How vigorous that disapproval may be it

is hard to say, but it is very much to be hoped that as

the  struggle for votes develops, only fair and  proper

means will be used and feelings of hatred and emotional

excitement will not be encouraged. There should  be  no

need  for a competent party which knows its party work,

has  proper policies, and has taken the trouble to  get

to   see  the  people,  to  play  on  emotions  in  any

unreasonable and undesirable way. It should be able  to

get their votes by clean, honest and truthful politics.

It  is  to be hoped that we shall be able to get  that,

because if we do conduct our party politics over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>



the  next  two  or three months on a basis  of  vicious

attacks  on each other and irresponsible statements  or

lies  to  the voters, we can then expect that the  next

Government - whatever Government it may be - will come into

power  against  a wave of bitterness and an  opposition

which   has   committed  itself   to   all   sorts   of

unjustifiable positions of attack, and then the affairs

of   Singapore  will  not  be  ruled  by   wisdom   and

forethought. They will be ruled by emotion and, in  the

words of Confucius: "A mind ruled by passion or emotion

is a mind which will not be correct in its actions."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So compulsory voting will give to the incoming

Government,  I  hope, a weight of public opinion  which

might otherwise be lacking. They will see that although

they  are forming the Government, nevertheless, a large

percentage  of the people did not vote for  them.  They

came to the polis but they did not pass their votes for

Mr  X or Mr Y of Party X or of Party Y. They cast for

another  party  and  that in itself should  exercise  a

moderating restraint on those who might otherwise  seek

to  carry  their  personal political  excitements  into

extremes. In political affairs, the people who make the

decisions   are  seldom  those  who  suffer   for   the

decisions. The politician makes a mistake but it is the

poor  people  who  pay for it. He  puts  the  blame  on

somebody else and says, "Well, it was not my fault.  It

was  the other chap who did the thing wrongly," and  he

attacks the other Party. But if a factory has gone  out

of  production and men have lost their jobs;  if  trade

has  fallen off and there is less milk for the children

to  drink so that their bones are not so strong, it  is

the  fault  of  the politician. He put himself  into  a

position  of  responsibility.  He  made  a  mistake  in

decision.  He  got  into  a  muddle;  he  got  into  an

unnecessary  fight - whatever it is - and he does  not  pay

the  price. No, it is the poor people at the bottom who

pay the price - the 370,000 or so people in Singapore who

live  on  less  than $1 a day. They are  the  ones  who

suffer first - and they will be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>



ones who will suffer first if the political Parties  of

Singapore  misconduct themselves in  the  next  general

elections or in the District Council elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru made one point on which I

would  like to express my profound agreement with  him,

and that is on the difficulties which are presented for

the  electorate and indeed for political Parties by the

registers which are still far from satisfactory. It  is

a  matter  in  which I personally have been  interested

since 1955, I think it was. I received a letter from  a

man with the correct postal address. He lived somewhere

in  the area between Braddell Road and Serangoon Garden

Estate  and  I  had to say "somewhere  in  that  area",

because   there  is  no  other  recognisable   way   of

describing it. On the map, it is called "Ang  Moh  Kio"

but Ang Moh Kio runs for about seven or eight miles and

you  cannot identify the words "Ang Moh Kio". And  this

man  wrote  to me a very reasonable letter  asking  for

something or other - I have forgotten what it is  now - and

I  wrote to him a very reasonable reply. Within about a

fortnight,  my  letter came back to me in  my  Ministry

marked  "Not delivered - Address not known", or  whatever

the  wording was. I then got on to the Post Office  and

asked,  "Can you try and find this man, please? He  has

written  me  a letter. I want to send him a  letter  in

reply,";  and  in the end they had to  put  two  postal

inspectors  on  and they spent two days. Finally,  they

found  the  man  who had a proper house with  a  proper

Rural  Board  number on it. Everything was correct;  it

was  the correct postal address, but it had never  been

heard  of by anybody in Singapore, because that is  the

way  the  local authorities had dealt with their  legal

duty of fixing street names and house numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was an early example to me of the very serious

neglect of the rural areas which had taken place in the

past.   I  do  not  necessarily  blame  the  old  Rural

Board - they  worked  within  their  terms  of  what  was

possible - but there has been very great neglect  in  the

past of rural and often urban areas as well. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>



still, I am afraid, true today that as I go through the

electoral  register of the rural areas and try  to  see

where the people are living and what they are doing, it

is almost impossible to say, "Ah, this man is living at

such a number, and I shall find him at such a place  on

the road." You will find No. 47, let us say, at the 5th

mile;  you will find No. 47 at the 7th mile;  they  are

both proper numbers and they are both on the same road;

they  both have the same numbers and they are two miles

apart. You will also find No. 47 very likely not on the

road at all - it is a mile and a half away, at the end of

a  track, a path, over a river and a bridge, and  there

is  No. 47 as well - still with the same address. It does

not  necessarily mean getting off the  main  road;  the

fact is, if you go along some of the roads like Yio Chu

Kang  Road, you will find the house numbering is almost

incredible in its confusion. It may jump from, say, No.

30,  to  No. 100 or No. 1000 to No. 30 and back to  No.

143,  and back to No. 30 again! There is just no system

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those defects have been accumulated over a long time

and  I  was  interested primarily because  they  caused

difficulties for the postal authorities, and because  I

held that any man in a civilized country has a right to

have  his letters delivered to his door. It is  a  very

important  point  for the production of  the  electoral

registers. It is not now possible, but I hope  it  will

be  done,  to  provide  a renumbering  and  road-naming

exercise  for the whole of Singapore. I hope  the  work

will  go on and be done so that in a year's time anyhow

it  will be possible to produce correct registers,  and

every man, woman or child living in Singapore will have

a  proper  address; and every political party  will  be

able  to  look  into the registers and reasonably  know

that  such  an  address  means such  a  place  and  not

somewhere  five  miles  off. It is,  however,  a  local

government  responsibility, although  it  is  one  with

which  the  Government is also concerned, at  least  my

Ministry is concerned, because my Ministry is concerned

with  the  delivery of letters or telegrams,  and  that

kind of thing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have spoken at rather great length, I am afraid, but I do want to make clear to the House my

strong  support  for the principles  embodied  in  this

Bill.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the democratic

system  of government of any country has the  right  in

conferring   rights  on  its  citizens  to   expect   a

corresponding  duty from its citizens. I  am  proud  to

say,  Sir,  that  this Government  has  given  to  some

300,000 aliens resident in Singapore the right to  vote

for  the first time. It is, therefore, not too much for

the  Government to ask these citizens to  show  whether

they  want  these  rights or not. If  they  want  these

rights,  they  should vote. If they do not  vote,  then

their rights will be taken away from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has been accused of doing many

wrong things, but no one can accuse this Government  of

having  done wrong in giving these 300,000  people  the

right  to  vote for the first time. For over a  hundred

years,  Sir, however long resident you might have  been

in  Singapore, you have had no right to have a  say  in

the   Government.  But  now  these  rights  have   been

conferred by this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have boasted that they had an

overwhelming  success  in the City  Council  elections,

forgetting  that at that election there was a  suicidal

alliance  between  the  Labour  Front  and  the  P.A.P.

- suicide  for the Labour Front! We were given Divisions

where  the  Right-wing was strong; we were  taken  away

from  Divisions  where the Left-wing  was  strong.  The

P.A.P. won and the Labour Front lost! Sir,  this  time

things may be different. This time we have 300,000  new

voters. No one can forecast how they are going to vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must support compulsory voting. I, on my

side,  feel  certain that the Government  will  provide

booths for the people, bringing the voting stations  to

the  people, and not asking people to go to the  voting

stations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar's tactics recently have  been

to  declare  that all measures that the Government  has

introduced  since last month are futile - that  they  are

just  written  words  with  no  meaning - and  that   the

Government  cannot carry out the essence  of  the  law.

Sir,  when  he  said that this Bill would  just  remain

"certain  words",  I was wondering whether  it  is  the

P.A.P.'s intention to try to break what is contained in

this  Bill by manoeuvring in such a way that they  will

escape  the written words of the law and yet in essence

still do what they like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compulsory voting is important for certain

reasons. After the achievement of the status under  the

Rendel Constitution, there was a clamour by hundreds of

thousands  of  people,  who have made  Singapore  their

home,  to acquire citizenship rights so that they could

belong  to  this place. That clamour meant,  Sir,  that

they  wanted  the rights of citizenship, the  right  to

belong  to Singapore, the right to participate  in  the

shaping  of their destiny, the right to participate  in

the  running  of  government at  all  levels - local  and

legislative levels. Sir, since they clamored for  these

rights,  they must exercise the most fundamental  right

of   all  these  rights,  and  that  is  the  right  to

participate  in electing representatives of  their  own

choice -  compulsory voting will ensure that the  people

of  Singapore get the government they really  want.  In

this way, they cannot afterwards complain that, as  far

as  the  total voting strength is concerned, they  have

got  a  government  which  does  not  have  an  overall

majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is, Sir, a much deeper significance in this

compulsory  voting,  and that is this.  The  democratic

system  on  the British pattern has in England  evolved

over  a  period of centuries into what it is today.  We

can see that it is by evolution, because even up to now

the United Kingdom has no written Constitution. It  is

a Constitution which has been evolved through practice.

Sir,  this  system is being handed over to  most  Asian



countries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>



in  the form of written Constitutions, which they adopt

on their attaining independence from a colonial status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us examine the history of most of the Asian

nations.  We  find, Sir, in the history of  many  Asian

nations  that  before the imposition of  colonial  rule

during the last century or the century before, they had

a   pattern  of  one-man  rule  and  that  the  British

democratic system did not obtain in many of these Asian

countries.  Therefore,  it  is  an  experiment  on  the

British democratic pattern that we are playing with  in

Asia today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Western countries, fears have been expressed

recently   at   the  coming  into  power  of   military

governments in some of the Asian countries.  I  do  not

deny,  Sir, that some of the military governments  that

have   taken  over  the  charge  of  affairs  in  these

countries  have been more beneficial than the  previous

elected governments. But the point is that the workings

of  the democratic system are being questioned in these

countries  today, because if the democratic system  had

functioned well, then it would not have been  necessary

for  the military governments to take over. Originally,

Sir,  the democratic system, and in fact in law  it  is

still  so today, is a system where an individual stands

for  election in a defined area and is returned  as  an

individual. The party system does not exist in law. But

it  is  unfortunate, Sir, that in the British  pattern,

after evolution, it came about that cliques began to be

formed.  These  cliques were officially  recognized  as

political  Parties, and therefore,  what  you  can  get

today   is   either  dictatorship  by   one   man,   or

dictatorship  by a military commander, or  dictatorship

by  a  military government, or even dictatorship  by  a

Party,  which can then ignore the democratic system  if

it has got sufficient strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant manner in which the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  has  expressed his belief that whatever  we  do,

they will win the elections and that everything that we

do  is  futile, Sir, gives me a little bit of  fear - "Is

Singapore  going to be handed over to persons  who  are

not democratically inclined?" I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>



this fear because I recently read a book by one of  the

great personalities of today, a Prime Minister (I  will

not  mention  his name), and he said,  "A  small  elite

using  the  masses  as a battering ram  can  control  a

country", or words to that effect. Sir, if you can  get

hold  of determined persons, a clique of, say, four  or

five  persons,  and  if they can follow  the  technique

properly,  they  can fool thousands of people  and  use

them  to  their advantage to set up a government  by  a

clique; legally they would be recognised as a political

Party, but in effect they could ignore the process  of

the democratic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked why I could not make up my mind on

certain  Bills; why I had to speak for two hours.  That

is  exactly the difference in the way of thinking, Sir.

I  follow the democratic procedure-, where I found that

the   fears  expressed  by  the  Opposition  were  well

founded,  I  gave way, I made alterations, so  long  as

these alterations did not affect what I aimed at.  But,

Sir, there are people who will say, "Just because I  am

introducing this, all opposition should be  ignored;  I

am  in the right, and you are in the wrong." That  sort

of  person. Sir, is a person to be feared. That is  why

compulsory  voting  is  very necessary  in  Singapore.

There are persons who limit the controlling power in  a

political  Party  to a cadre of 500 or  so - which  means

that  they would then cause - not even all these 500  but

only  a handful - the hierarchy of the Party - to set up  a

dictatorship.  Let the people of Singapore  go  to  the

polls  and  decide whether they want such a government.

If  they  decide  to have such a government,  they  are

welcome  to it, and they cannot blame anybody for  what

follows then.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Member of

the  Select Committee on this Bill, I feel  more  than

pleased  and happy to support this Bill. Sir, before  I

go further into the debate on the merits or demerits of

this Bill, I wish to extend my congratulations to a few

Members  of this House. My first congratulation  is  to

the Member for Ulu Bedok who showed much courage and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>



made   personal   sacrifices,   despite   the   strong

opposition from the Party U.M.N.O. Without him,  I  am

afraid this Bill cannot carry on so smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second congratulation I wish to extend to the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar. Sir, I am honoured  to  be

associated  with him so closely on this  Bill  in  the

Select  Committee. He was very understanding  and  co-operative - not  only  as  what  the  hon.  Member   for

Serangoon has said, highly enthusiastic. Many of us in

the  Select  Committee were surprised that the  Member

for Tanjong Pagar was so understanding and cooperative

in  the  discussion, even on certain aspects of  vital

importance  to his Party policy. For example,  on  the

question  of  the limitation of age of those  who  can

take  part  in  election activity, I for one  strongly

advocate  that we must set an age limit to  those  who

can  participate  in elections. In view  of  the  past

election experiences, we must bar anyone below the age

of 21 from actively engaging in any election campaign.

We  are  more  than happy to have the support  of  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar when he said, "Let  us  not

bother with the time or the age limit. Let us agree to

bar  all  the registered students from taking part  in

the  election." I am sure this vital point  shows  how

keen  and generous the Member for Tanjong Pagar is  on

this aspect of the election. It is the first time that

I  discover  that the Member for Tanjong Pagar  really

has  the interest of the people of Singapore at heart.

It  is  the first time that I discover that the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar has a genuine nationalist  spirit,

and has the national interest at heart, and that he is

not  merely working for the interest of his Party.  It

is  the first time that I discover that the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  is really prepared to make  sacrifices

and  to  bury party differences and work for the  best

interest  of the people of Singapore in order  to  let

this Bill be passed, as it appears today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have learnt just now from the Chief Minister

that he is going to bring up new clauses as amendments

to  the  Bill, and the implementation of one  of  them

will restrict, as I have already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>



mentioned,  registered students from  taking  part  in

future  elections.  I  am sure  this  will  avoid  the

incidents  just now mentioned by the Member for  Tiong

Bahru when students or hooligans marched in regimental

fashion   along  the  roads  to  support  a  political

campaign.  A  very  important  clause  also   is   the

prohibition  of canvassing on election day,  and  also

the  limitation  to  the putting  up  of  banners  and

posters  and even the use of transportation.  We  have

learnt  a great deal from past elections, and many  of

us have experienced how much corruption has been going

on because the candidates can supply transport and put

up  numerous  posters.  Some candidates  also  paid  a

certain amount of money to seek to protect the banners

they put up. In other words, as mentioned in the Elias

Commission  Report, the candidates  engaged  gangsters

not  only to paste the posters but also to protect the

banners. All these things do influence the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, you still remember that I am an

ordinary Member who moved a motion in this House  last

year  that compulsory voting should be introduced.  It

was    only   due   to   many   unexpected   political

repercussions  that I had to drop the  motion.  I  beg

your  indulgence, Sir, but first let  me  congratulate

myself! I congratulate myself because today I  see  my

dream  come  true.  Sir,  the reason  why  I  advocate

compulsory  voting is because I believe that  one  who

believes  in  democracy  must  accept  the  fact  that

popular   voting  is  of  vital  importance   to   the

democratic  process, because it is only  through  this

vehicle  that  the  true will of  the  people  can  be

implemented through the authority of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore, Sir, because of the colonial nature

of  the Government, and because of the commercial port

status,  the majority of the people always think  that

politics is not important and some have even  come  to

think that it is filthy. They therefore refuse to have

anything  to  do  with politics.  This  has  naturally

created  a  most unfortunate and undesirable situation

of political apathy. This has created a vacuum for the

manoeuvrings of ambitious and selfish politicians  and

unscrupulous gangsters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us trace back to the last City Council elections

in 1957. We notice that the number of qualified voters

who  failed to go to the poll was very high. If  I  am

not  mistaken, the average voting strength on  polling

day  in the 1957 City Council elections was just  only

slightly  over 30 per cent. Only 30 per  cent  of  the

voters  turned  out on polling day. I  would  like  to

bring to the notice of this House that even among this

small figure, the majority of them were illiterates or

students  or  hooligans. They went to the poll  either

because   they  had  received  money   or   had   been

intimidated  or  because they had been  influenced  by

fantastic  and  irresponsible political  promises  and

political propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every responsible person in Singapore as

confronted with this question. Did all the voters  who

turned  out and voted for the present City Councillors

really  represent the wishes of the people? These  two

points   are   of  vital  importance.  Firstly,   must

Singapore  fall into the hands of the young extremists

and  the  young gangsters? Secondly, if it is not  the

wishes  of  the people (and it should be so)  by  what

methods can we encourage the people to go to the  poll

in order to redress the grave situation that is facing

us  today? It is only the youngsters who are  keen  on

taking part in election either because they have  been

lured   by   irresponsible  and  fantastic   political

promises  and  propaganda, or because they  have  been

lured by corruption, or they have been intimidated  by

gangsters.  Therefore, I firmly believe that  only  by

introducing  compulsory  voting  can  we  solve   this

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken a little trouble to study the history of

compulsory  voting. Sir, compulsory voting  was  first

introduced  in the early 19th century. In  Switzerland

it  is  not  called compulsory voting  but  obligatory

voting.  But  later  on it proved  very  popular  and

successful  even in Belgium, and other countries  soon

followed  suit,  and up to date there  are  nearly  30

countries in the world which adopt compulsory voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason why I am in favour of compulsory

voting   is   that  I  believe  that,  by  introducing

compulsory voting, it would be possible to rectify the

error  of  not having a truly representative  form  of

government which might arise from optional voting.  We

have  just listened to the speech by the Hon. Minister

for  Communications and Works when he touched  on  the

analysis  of the last general elections. He said  that

if  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party  had  succeeded  in

getting  together  during the time of  the  elections,

maybe  the hon. Member for Serangoon would have become

the  Chief  Minister for the past  three  and  a  half

years.  This is exactly the point on which I am  going

to  touch. If a candidate is elected by only  a  small

section of the eligible voters, he will represent only

those  who  voted for him. Therefore, any  legislation

that  is passed would not represent the wishes of  the

nation as a whole. As the Hon. Mr Francis Thomas  has

said,  anybody can shout: "Ah, I represent the  people

of  Singapore!" But can he really claim  to  represent

the people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to my second point why I believe in

compulsory  voting. It will bring to  the  polls  many

voters  who are in favour of a stable government.  Sir,

you  cannot deny that the political scene of today  is

not  as hopeful as we think. In last year's debate  on

the Budget I said that 1959 would be unstable from the

political  point  of  view and a more  difficult  time

would lie ahead, and we people-
