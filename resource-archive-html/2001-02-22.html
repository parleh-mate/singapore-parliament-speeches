<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have to inform the House that I

received  a  letter dated 22nd January 2001 from  the  Deputy

Registrar  of  the  Supreme Court stating that  a  Bankruptcy

Order was made by the High Court on 19th January 2001 against

Mr  J  B  Jeyaretnam.   On 23rd January 2001,  Mr  Jeyaretnam

informed  me  that he had filed an appeal in respect  of  the

Order.  The Deputy Registrar informed the Clerk of Parliament

on  7th  February 2001 that the appeal by Mr  Jeyaretnam  was

dismissed by Justice Tan Lee Meng on the said date.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam has written to me on 19th February 2001

that  he has filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of  Appeal

against  the Order made on 7th February 2001.  Mr  Jeyaretnam

also stated, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I trust there will be no difficulty in my continuing to

attend  Parliament in accordance with the practice stated  in

the Constitution until the appeal has been heard and disposed

of."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sought the advice of the Attorney-General on the

matter and he has advised that  "Parliament should wait until

Mr  Jeyaretnam has exhausted his right of appeal to the Court

of Appeal."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am of the opinion that it is not

appropriate  for me to ask Parliament to make a determination

under  Article 48 of the Constitution as to whether his  seat

has been vacated as the Member has filed an appeal.

contributed  at  least a total of $100 to any  of  their  CPF

accounts between 1st January 1998 and 31st December 2000  are

eligible for the top-up.  Those who did not already meet this

$100   minimum  contribution  requirement  at  the  time   of

announcement had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



about 4 months to make voluntary contribution to qualify  for

the  top-up.  Of the 2.13 million Singaporeans eligible, 1.94

million (or 91%) qualified for the top-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 200,000 (9%) Singaporeans who did not qualify for

the top-up, 69% are aged below 55, 8% are between the ages of

55  and 65, and 23% are aged 65 and above.  33% of them  stay

in  1-  to  3-room  HDB  flats, in homes  or  are  on  public

assistance,  27% in 4-room HDB flats and 40%  in  5-room  HDB

flats  or  private housing.  55% are females.  The CPF  Board

will  conduct a sample survey to find out why these  citizens

did not participate in the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Top-up Scheme has already taken into account the

CPF  contributions made over a generous 3-year period  and  4

months  was  given  for those who needed  to  make  voluntary

contributions to qualify to do so. There was thus  sufficient

time   for  Singaporeans  to  qualify  for  the  CPF  top-up.

Nevertheless, the Government is prepared to consider allowing

those who missed out on the first payment, a second chance to

qualify  for the full payment of the CPF top-up,  nearer  the

date of the second payment.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I welcome the gesture

from  the Government.  May I just ask whether there would  be

any  specific message targeted at particularly the 1-  to  3-room  HDB  flat residents who may perhaps have  not  met  the

criteria out of ignorance or lack of capacity?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the CPF Board had

actually  conducted   publicity targeted at  encouraging  all

those  who  are  eligible to participate in the  scheme.   In

fact,  since  the  scheme was announced,  more  than  600,000

direct  mail  packages were sent to those who  had  Singapore

addresses  to  encourage them to make the co-contribution  to

qualify  for  the top-up.  We have also put up advertisements

in  the  newspapers in the four languages, radio trailers  on

the  various radio channels, including those in Malay, Tamil,

English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien and Teochew, to  target

at  the  older citizens to encourage them to come forward  to

participate.  Of course, the CPF



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



Newsline, a publication in the main newspapers, which informs

CPF members of various changes, regularly carried details  of

the  top-up  scheme and encouraged them to  come  forward  to

participate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There had also been a lot of other press publicity,

including  human  interest stories about how senior  citizens

came  forward to participate with the help of family members.

If  the senior citizen does not have the $100 to make the co-payment,  then the children should come forward to help  him.

The  children  should be the ones to volunteer to  contribute

this  $100 on behalf of their aged parents so that they would

qualify for the top-up from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier in my main answer, the CPF Board will

conduct  a  study to find out why this group  of  200,000-odd

Singaporeans,  despite all this publicity and  encouragement,

had  not  come forward to participate.  With that information

in  hand,  I think we will be in a better position  to  focus

further  publicity on this group to ensure that more of  them

will come forward in the next round.

<div align="center"><b>POST-SECONDARY FOREIGN STUDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Part-time work)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether he will allow post-secondary foreign students  to  do

part-time  work  in order to relieve the labour  shortage  in

certain trades.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1st July 1994,

my  Ministry had allowed foreign students above 14  years  of

age and who are full-time matriculated or registered students

of  approved institutions of higher learning, post-secondary,

and  secondary schools to work during their vacation  without

having to apply for a work permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1997, we have also allowed full time

foreign  students in our tertiary institutions to  work  part

time without the need to apply for a work permit. The maximum

hours  of  work should be no more than 16 hours  a  week  and

these students should first seek the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



permission  of  their  tertiary institution  before  working.

This  is  to ensure that their studies will not be  adversely

affected  by their part-time work.  As the number of  foreign

students in tertiary institutions who intend to take up part-time  work  is relatively small, the exemption  from  a  work

permit  is  not so much to help ease our tight labour  market

but to provide foreign students an avenue to finance part  of

their studies in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st February 2001, foreign students

from   the   following  tertiary  institutions:  La-Salle-SIA

College  of the Arts, the Nanyang Academy of Fine  Arts,  the

INSEAD,  Singapore,  and the University of  Chicago  Graduate

School of Business in Singapore, have also been exempted from

applying for a work permit if they intend to work part-time.

<div align="center"><b>3G LICENCES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Auction)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology how the  Government

intends  to conduct an auction for four 3G licences  if  only

four  or  less than four bidders indicate interest, since  an

auction  presumes that there are more bidders  than  licences

available.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Infocomm

Development   Authority   (IDA)   proposes   to   conduct   a

simultaneous  multiple round ascending bid auction;  ie,  the

four 3G licences will be put up for auction concurrently.  If

there  is only one bidder for each of the four licences,  IDA

will  allocate licences to the bidders at the reserve  price,

and there will be no auction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, bidders may not assign identical values to the

four  licences  because the spectrum band allocated  to  each

licence    has    different   technical    and    operational

characteristics.  It is possible that even  if  there  are  a

total of four or fewer bidders, more than one of them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



may  prefer  a particular spectrum band.  If so, the  auction

for  that  licence  will proceed in order  to  determine  the

successful bidder.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, with the

dampening  of the 3G auction market and with the  low  prices

that have been coming in, if not the failure of some of these

auctions in other countries, and particularly in view of  the

very lukewarm response from the players in the field to IDA's

draft auction rules, is the Government still optimistic  that

there will be a good response to the auction?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, staff from IDA and EDB have

been  going round to discuss with possible bidders  on  their

interest in coming to the Singapore market.  I think  we  are

quite confident that there will be enough bidders to make the

3G market in Singapore a successful one.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, what is the Minister's

comment  to  the remarks of British Telecom that the  process

actually  should  best be a beauty contest  in  view  of  the

experience  that they overpaid for the licence and  therefore

this  would  have to be passed to the consumer and ultimately

the consumer is going to suffer and the development of 3G may

not be well done?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the comments of British

Telecom's CEO should be taken in the context of the extremely

high bids made for the UK's 3G licences and I am sure, having

bidded  for such a high price, many of them would  hope  that

the  UK  government would come up with a mechanism to  return

part of the licence fee to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the

Minister said that the Ministry officials were asking  around

and  expected a good enough bid.  Given that this is a market

mechanism,  there  needs to be enough  interest.   Could  the

Minister indicate how many people he anticipates or hopes  to

come forward to bid?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, whilst some of the companies

have expressed interest, we will only know for sure what  the

actual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



interest  will  be when the final invitation for  bidders  to

come forward is given out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister is confident about the bidding system.  Why is there

a  reserve  price and how was the $150 million reserve  price

arrived at?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, there is a need to have a

reserve price to ensure that if there are too few bidders, we

will  still  get a reasonable economic value for the  limited

spectrum  that is available. The feedback from the  countries

that  have proceeded with the auction without a reserve price

or with a very low reserve price is that they regretted doing

that  and,  on  hindsight,  they should  have  established  a

reserve price that reflects the economic value.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> My question was: how was the $150

million reserve price arrived at and, at the same time, which

are  the  countries that have this reserve price and the  bid

was too low?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, for the reserve price, we hire

a  consultant firm that has experience in this sector to do a

study for us on what would be a reasonable price.  They  gave

us a range and we discounted the low-end of the range further

and  came up with $150 million.  Members should note that the

licence  is  for  20 years.  The reserve price  that  we  are

establishing is only slightly higher than what  we  would  be

getting from a 2G licence.  So for the 3G licence with a much

broader spectrum that is available, we do not think we  would

have  fetched a very high premium versus a 2G licence.   What

is your second question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Which are the countries that have the

reserve price problem?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Several countries had very low

reserve price.  The one that had a very low reserve price was

Switzerland.   Switzerland started with a  reserve  price  of

US$29  million  and the Netherlands started  with  a  reserve

price of US$40 million.  And the final price in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



Switzerland was only slightly higher than the reserve price.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> In the Minister's opinion, this does

not reflect economic value.  In other words, the bidder might

think that was the market price.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, bidders would not necessarily

push up to what is the proper economic value unless there are

a  number of bidders.  So when we have very few bidders -  in

the  case  of Italy, they only had one bidder more  than  the

number  of licences - there is really no market for  them  to

push  up  to what would be a reasonable market price.   I  am

sure  they all have established in their mind what  they  are

prepared  to  pay.  Where they can get away with paying  much

lower than that, why not.

<div align="center"><b>(Fire insurance cover for stallholders)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development, in view of the recent spate of fires in  Housing

and  Development Board (HDB) wet markets, whether he will ask

the  HDB  to take up fire insurance to cover (i) the loss  of

the personal effects of the stallholders and (ii) the cost of

putting up the temporary market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

National Development, in view of the recent fire incidents in

wet  markets, whether his Ministry has any plans to (i)  make

it  a  requirement  for wet market stallholders  to  take  up

appropriate  fire insurance policies, and (ii) provide  fire-proof storage facilities inside or conveniently near the  wet

markets.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I

take Question Nos. 4 and 5 together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

need for stall tenants to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



take  up insurance to reinstate a market or hawker centre  in

the event of a fire.  HDB or ENV, as landlord, will repair or

rebuild  the  market  or hawker centre, including  the  stall

structures and fittings.  HDB or ENV will also help  affected

stallholders secure alternative premises so they can continue

to  earn a living while the burnt market or hawker centre  is

being repaired or rebuilt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, advisors and their grassroots organisations may

decide  to  build  a  temporary market, as  has  happened  in

several cases in the last 18 months.  Hence, HDB and ENV  are

considering buying additional insurance to cover the cost  of

providing such temporary markets and hawker centres.  We  are

looking into possible co-payment arrangements with grassroots

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, it would also be prudent for

stallholders to take up appropriate insurance to  cover  loss

of personal belongings in the event of a fire.  While we will

not  make this a compulsory requirement, the Government would

like  to urge each and every stallholder to take up insurance

coverage based on his individual circumstances, such  as  the

value of his goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the suggestion to provide fire-proof storage

facilities  inside  or  near  wet  markets,  there   may   be

implementation difficulties in view of the space constraints.

All  the  markets are old markets except for one  recent  new

market and these markets were built to old standards and,  as

most  of us know, the space within the wet markets is already

cramped.   Nevertheless, Sir, HDB and ENV  will  improve  the

fire  safety provisions in wet markets by enhancing the  fire

fighting  facilities and encouraging stallholders to practise

good housekeeping.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  whether  he

could  ask HDB and ENV to consider paying 100% of the premium

for  a  temporary market in view of co-sharing.  The  parties

who are likely to co-share would be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



CCC,   town   council,  or,  maybe,  some  other   grassroots

organisations. These organisations work very  hard  to  raise

money ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you asking a question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Yes. Could the Ministry of the

Environment  and  HDB consider paying 100% of  the  insurance

premium?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB and the

Ministry  of the Environment have considered this  suggestion

from  the  grassroots organisations because we have  been  in

contact with them.  We feel that the grassroots organisations

should  take ownership of the markets and the market  stalls.

HDB's  and  ENV's responsibilities really are to rebuild  the

burnt  down  market.  In other words, we will  reinstate  the

burnt down market.  But that would take some time, maybe  one

year,  and in some cases, 1 1/2 to 2 years.  In the  interim,

the  stallholders are not exactly out of the loop because HDB

and  ENV  will  help them relocate to vacant  stalls  in  the

vicinity.  Any stall that is vacant, we will give  them.   So

HDB and ENV will help them to this extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB and ENV have considered the appeal that they need to

earn  a  living in situ, in other words, their customers  are

there,  they  need  to be there.  After  a  long  process  of

consultation, we are considering buying additional  insurance

to  build  a  temporary market, very close to the burnt  down

market  for  a  short period of time.   And that  burnt  down

market  will take some time to build.  The cost of  defraying

that  temporary  market should rightly be borne  by  somebody

other  than the Government.  But the Government will come  in

this  round to provide a substantial co-funding and  we  want

the  grassroots organisations to take ownership of the market

and provide the other part of the co-funding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, could I

ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, if it is difficult to

get  shareholders  to purchase insurance  for  products  lost

through fire, whether it is possible for the town council  to

contract with the insurance company in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



obtain  the  best rate and cover and, maybe, incorporate  the

premium in the conservancy charges that are currently levied?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government cannot speak on behalf of the town councils.  This

is  for  the  town councils' chairmen and the councillors  to

decide.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask

the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, since the Ministry is not

making insurance compulsory for the stallholders, whether the

Ministry  would embark on an education programme because  too

many  stallholders feel that they have nothing  to  lose  and

therefore  they do not need to insure, forgetting  that  they

have  loss  of profits and business to face if  they  do  not

insure themselves?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that was

what  the  Government did when the first market in Eunos  was

burnt  down.  Many advisors, including myself, went to  visit

the  market  and  advised the stallholders to  take  up  fire

insurance to insure their personal effects.  And I am glad to

report   that  the  insurance  coverage  rate  has  gone   up

substantially.   But we have not reached 100%  and  certainly

not in all markets.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the two fires in Ang

Mo  Kio  GRC took place near festive seasons when the  stalls

were heavily stocked with the impending festive demand.  I do

not  know if this had caused the fire.  But it certainly must

have  made  the fire worse.  I would like to ask  the  Senior

Parliamentary Secretary if he can ask HDB to look  into  ways

to  manage  the storage of goods in the market and, secondly,

if  he  can  ask HDB to improve the design of the  market  to

reduce the possibility of fire and the consequence should  it

occur?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister  for  the  Environment,  in  his  walkabout  in  the

Clementi ward, has made an announcement of a market upgrading

programme.   The  Minister  will,  at  an  appropriate  time,

elaborate on the plans to make markets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



more spacious, less fire hazard and definitely a better place

to shop and eat.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary not have  this  opinion  that

because  the  HDB  is the landlord of many  of  these  hawker

centres  and  the  town councils are merely managing  agents,

they  really have no authority or power to buy insurance,  or

do anything to co-pay for this insurance?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

checked with various insurance companies.  The premium needed

to  insure for a temporary market is really quite low.  It is

something  like  between  $1,000 and  $2,000.   So  when  the

Government  comes up with a substantial amount of co-payment,

grassroots organisations should be able to afford  the  other

half of the co-payment.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I would like

to  ask  the Senior Parliamentary Secretary why HDB does  not

provide a fire sprinkler system, especially for single-storey

wet markets?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these

markets  were designed in the 60s and 70s.  We have not  been

building  markets  in the last 10 years and  these  were  old

design  standards.   In the new design standards,  under  the

upgrading programme, we would certainly incorporate all these

fire  fighting  features.  But still within each  market,  we

have  made  sure  that there are enough facilities  to  fight

small fires.  We have provided enough fire extinguishers;  we

have organised civil defence campaigns; we have suggested  to

grassroots  leaders to go round the market and  advise  them.

In  many  markets,  like in my market  in  Tiong  Bahru,  the

committee hires a security guard to patrol the market day and

night.   So  that is something the market committee  and  the

grassroots organisations should do.  HDB and ENV will provide

assistance where  it is needed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary misheard my question.   My  question

was not whether the grassroots organisations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



should co-pay.  My question was a follow-up of Mr Noris Ong's

question:   whether the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  feels

that  the town councils do not have the mandate to do  a  co-payment and therefore they should be left out of the picture.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> We are leaving the town

councils out of the picture.  Town councils are not  part  of

the  grassroots organisations.  The town council is an  agent

whose job is to manage the common areas.  We are saying  that

the co-payment would come from grassroots organisations other

than the town councils.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE EXCHANGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Conflict of interests)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister,

should  a  conflict  of  interests arise  for  the  Singapore

Exchange  in  its  role as both a regulator and  operator  of

securities trading, what measures are in place to ensure that

the public good is not compromised.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) performs two roles:  to

run  the  business of a stock/futures exchange and to  ensure

the  integrity  and  efficiency of trading  on  the  exchange

through an effective and sound regulatory framework.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two roles are not incongruent. The interest of

SGX's  shareholders and the "public interest" as  represented

by  traders  and users of the Exchange are more aligned  than

divergent.   An  exchange  seeking to  attract  listings  and

investor interest benefits from sound regulation as  well  as

effective  enforcement mechanisms.  It is in  the  commercial

interest  of  SGX to have a sound regulatory  framework  that

provides  the  basis for a healthy, vibrant  marketplace  for

sustained business success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before its demutualization, members of the then

Stock Exchange of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  (SES)  had to set their own in-house  rules  which

could  compromise their short-term commercial  interest,  and

SES   had  to  supervise  its  own  members,  who  owned  and

controlled the Exchange.  This made it necessary for  MAS  to

be quite involved in the affairs of SES.  SGX now has a wider

and    more   diverse   pool   of   shareholders,   including

international shareholders.  Having a wider investor base has

removed  some of the earlier potential conflicts of  interest

for  members.  However, the demutualization of  the  SGX  has

accentuated  and  made  more explicit the  issue  of  whether

making profit is consistent with good regulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has defined more clearly an enhanced role for itself

in   overseeing   SGX's  regulatory  responsibilities.    The

Exchanges (Demutualisation and Merger) Act 1999 gives MAS the

power  to issue directives to SGX in the interest of ensuring

fair  and  orderly  markets  and  the  proper  management  of

systemic  risks.  The Act also provides for MAS  to  directly

regulate  SGX's  position  as a company  listed  on  its  own

exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS recently, on 16th February 2001, issued a press

statement,  and  the  Deputy Managing  Director,  Mr  Tharman

Shanmugaratnam, made a speech which set out MAS' position  in

detail.    SGX  will,  in  the  main,  retain  the  frontline

responsibility   of   regulating  market   participants   and

compliance  with  its  own  rules.   MAS,  as  the  statutory

regulator,  will  assure itself that SGX  is  performing  its

regulatory   functions  competently  and  responsibly.    For

instance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. SGX defines and enforces its Rules and Bye-Laws.

However,  SGX must continue to obtain MAS' approval  for  any

amendments thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Whilst SGX ensures that listed companies make

timely  and complete disclosure of material information,  MAS

will  conduct  the  civil prosecution of offending  companies

which contravene the disclosure requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. SGX conducts direct surveillance of the market, and

MAS  will  assure  itself that this is done  effectively  and

responsibly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MAS will also ensure that SGX's inspection and

supervision of its members is done competently, by conducting

its  own  independent  inspection of SGX's  members,  and  by

inspecting SGX.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS believes that the current MAS-SGX regulatory

arrangement  for  the  regulation  and  supervision  of   the

securities markets, with an enhanced oversight role  for  MAS

over  SGX,  is a sound arrangement.  MAS will watch carefully

how  it  works  in practice, and will adjust the  balance  of

responsibilities  between  MAS and  SGX,  should  this  prove

necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> I would like to ask

the   Deputy  Prime  Minister,  in  the  event  of  such   an

occurrence,  ie,  if  SGX is seen to be  acting  against  the

interest  of,  say, a small group of investors  and  where  a

financial   loss  is  involved,  what  recourse,   legal   or

regulatory, can investors seek in a timely fashion.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we would

have  to look at the specific circumstance of any such  case.

There  are civil remedies which can be pursued.  As  Mrs  Lim

knows,  we have recently amended our legislation to  make  it

easier  for  investors  who  have  suffered  financial  loss,

because of market manipulation or some such practice, to  sue

the perpetrators and get damages.

<div align="center"><b>LEGISLATION TO FACILITATE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  whether  and  when  the Government  will  introduce

legislation   to   facilitate  (i)  electronic   presentation

truncation  and  clearing  of cheques  and  other  electronic

payment  orders;   (ii)  issue of  electronic  legal  tender;

(iii)  issue  of electronic purses, stored value and  payment

cards  by  financially sound institutions other  than  banks;

(iv)  creation of electronic payment clearing and  settlement

centres  by  institutions other than local  banks;   and  (v)

protection of personal financial information gathered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



by merchants and other participants of electronic commerce.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member has

asked  five  separate  questions and I  will  give  him  five

separate answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has

encouraged  the financial industry to embark on a  number  of

projects  to  improve the efficiency of the current  payments

infrastructure,  including the cheque  truncation  and  other

electronic  payment  systems.  The MAS  is  also  considering

appropriate    legislative   changes   to   facilitate    the

implementation of these new systems and processes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Today only currency notes are legal tender. As

cashless  forms of payment become more widespread, the  Board

of  Commissioners  of Currency, Singapore (BCCS)  is  looking

into the need to legislate for electronic payments to also be

accepted   as  legal  tender.   Merchants  covered   by   the

legislation must then accept electronic payment, if tendered.

Electronic  tender will reduce the cost of handling  physical

cash,  improve  the efficiency of business transactions,  and

further   enhance  the  cashless  business  environment   for

Singapore.   However,  widespread infrastructure  to  support

such an environment will be necessary, and the public must be

adequately  prepared for the transition.   BCCS  is  actively

studying this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Under the current regulatory framework, only

licensed  banks, with the approval of MAS, can  issue  multi-purpose  stored value cards (MPSVCs).  It is also  common  in

major  jurisdictions for the issuance of multi-purpose stored

value  cards  to be restricted to deposit-taking institutions

like  banks.  Issuing multi-purpose stored value cards  is  a

form  of deposit taking, so MAS wants to be certain that card

holders  have  some  protection should the  issuer  run  into

difficulty.   Banks  are subject to MAS  supervision  and  to

reserve  and liquidity requirements on the proceeds collected

from  multi-purpose stored value cards, but other  commercial

companies have no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



similar  requirements.  We  will  continue  to  review  this,

weighing the balance between innovation and proper protection

of proceeds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The operation of clearing and settlement systems is

not restricted to the local banks.  For example, Citibank  is

the  settlement bank for the US dollar cheque clearing system

while Banking Computer Services Pte Ltd (BCS) is the operator

of  the  Automated  Clearing House,  which  clears  Singapore

cheques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Ministry of Communications and Information

Technology  is  spearheading an inter-agency  task  force  to

study   general   privacy   issues,   taking   into   account

international  developments.  The study  will  focus  on  the

impact  of  e-commerce and Internet on  data  protection  and

privacy   and  will  cover,  among  other  things,  financial

information collected from e-commerce websites.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to follow

up  by asking the Deputy Prime Minister, particularly on  the

question of other financial institutions issuing stored value

payment  cards, whether the Deputy Prime Minister or the  MAS

would   consider   allowing   institutions   like   insurance

companies, which are also regulated and very liquid, to issue

such  services and, secondly, to consider whether  some  very

major  and very liquid capital-heavy companies could also  do

these services, provided they are willing to be regulated  by

the MAS.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said in

my  main reply, our present policy is to confine it to banks,

but  it is an issue which we will keep alive and look at from

time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a basic difference between banks and other

institutions.   Banks take deposits.  Finance  companies  are

the  only  ones which are close to that.  Insurance companies

do  not take deposits.  Other companies, whether or not  they

are  well  capitalised, do not take deposits.   Deposits  are

different  from  any  other form of  credit.   If  a  company

borrows money from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



bank,  the bank makes a judgement whether it is safe to  lend

this  money to the company and, if the company turns  turtle,

the  bank has a bad loan.  But the bank is supposed  to  know

what  is  good  for  it and looks after  its  own  interests.

Taking  deposits  from  the general  public  is  a  different

proposition,  because people assume that the banks  are  safe

and,  particularly for the small amounts of money which  many

people  deposit,  as will be in the case of  a  stored  value

card,  they assume that the money will be safe.  They put  it

in  and  they expect it to be protected.  And it is protected

because   the  banks  are  regulated.   There  is  a  capital

requirement  so that the banks have a buffer, in  case  their

business goes bad.  There are liquidity requirements so that,

in  case many people turn up at the bank at the same time  to

withdraw their money, the bank is liquid and can pay out  the

money  and  will not find itself out of cash.  And  there  is

supervision  by MAS on top of this, to make sure  that  banks

stick to these requirements and are properly operated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me whether somebody else who is well

capitalised  would  like  to  volunteer  to  come  under  MAS

supervision  and therefore issue multi-purpose  stored  value

cards,  in  a small way, you are asking me whether  we  would

issue  them a banking licence, to which the answer  would  be

"No".  But it is a gray area because, if we are talking about

$5  or  $10  in a phone card or some other stored value  card

with  restricted  purposes which you can use  in  the  store,

well,  that is between you and the shop, you have  given  the

company  some  credit, he has given you some  discount.   But

when  it  is a multi-purpose card and you can use it in  many

outlets, then, in fact, it is akin to deposit-taking,  and  I

think we should regulate it as such.  There are many banks in

Singapore, so there is no lack of competition for issuers  of

multi-purpose stored value cards.  I know there are a lot  of

people whose eyes popped-out when they saw the opportunity of

issuing such a card, because they thought that, if they issue

a card, they will get a float; if they have a float, they can

invest it; and if they invest it, they can get rich, and this

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



extremely  favourable.   That  is  when  MAS  starts  to  get

worried.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> The

Deputy  Prime  Minister has said about currency  notes  being

legal  tender.   Would he explain why the  courts  refuse  to

accept currency notes for the payment of stamp fees for court

documents?



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I am not aware of this. If Mr

Jeyaretnam  could  file a question, I am  sure  the  Minister

responsible would answer.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he would  not

consider  that the issue of stored value cards is really  one

way of promoting Singapore as an e-commerce hub because there

is  this perception that the banks are moving very slowly and

perhaps  the  liberalisation of this area,  just  for  stored

value  cards and not for the banking licence, would  be  good

for Singapore as a whole?



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem of

stored  value  cards  is not a question of  the  banks  being

reluctant  but  of consumers being reluctant.   There  is  no

reluctance for people to hold credit cards.  There  are  lots

and  lots of them and lots of people want more credit  cards.

But the use of a stored value card, where they have to top up

money, put the money in, pay first, then spend it, it may run

out, they will have to top up further, is not something which

has caught on in many jurisdictions.  It is quite popular  in

Japan,  it  is  not  popular in Europe or in  America.   Many

issuers  have  tried.   We  thought  that  we  had  a  killer

application  when we had the ERP system and every  car  owner

had  to  have  a card in his IVU.  But although  hundreds  of

thousands  of transactions take place on the ERP  every  day,

only  a  few  hundred transactions take place  off  the  ERP,

because  nobody  goes to the provision  shop  and  to  buy  a

newspaper  or groceries using a stored value card.   They  do

not  mind NETS because that is convenient.  But to bring  the

money  into  the  card and then carry around  a  few  hundred

dollars and spend it bit by bit and keep



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



track, is not something which consumers have found convenient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have another opportunity because we are going to

have a contactless stored value card for mass transit, bus as

well  as  train, and we are hoping to use that to  make  that

more popular and use it for small purchases, like the Octopus

Card  in  Hong Kong which can be used for small purchases  in

shops in the MTR stations.  But we will have to watch and see

how consumer demand develops.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>DEVALUATION OF SINGAPORE'S CURRENCY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  the Government will devalue Singapore's currency  to

make its products more competitive.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's

exports  have performed strongly over the past year.  Non-oil

domestic  exports (NODX) increased by 11.8% in  2000.   Since

November  2000, the growth of NODX has moderated, as external

demand  weakened with the slowdown in the global  electronics

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A devaluation does not necessarily boost our exports,

except  in the short run.  The import content of our domestic

exports  is very high at 60%.  So a weak exchange rate  would

lead  mainly to higher CPI inflation and higher import  costs

for  manufacturers.  In addition, with the economy  operating

at  full capacity, a weaker Singapore dollar would cause  the

labour  market  to  tighten, nominal  wages  to  go  up,  and

inflation  to  rise. This would negate the  initial  positive

impact of a weak exchange rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the inflation caused by a devaluation would

erode the purchasing power of the substantial CPF savings  of

Singaporeans, which are denominated in Singapore dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the MAS manages the S$ exchange rate with a

view to maintaining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



low inflation and a stable Singapore dollar, as a sound basis

for  sustained economic growth.  It has deliberately not used

the  exchange  rate  as an instrument to  manage  our  export

competitiveness.   Instead  the  Government  has  focused  on

direct   ways  to  reduce  business  costs,  improve   labour

productivity and enhance capabilities, such as the CPF cut in

1998, which has now mostly been restored.  The fact that with

this approach the economy recovered quickly and strongly from

the  Asian crisis and grew by 9.9% last year, shows that  our

policy is correct.

<div align="center"><b>REVERSE MORTGAGES FOR HDB FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether the Housing and Development  Board  will

allow  its  lessees  especially senior citizens  to  take  up

reverse mortgages for their flats so that they can have  more

disposable income.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of National Development and the

Housing  and Development Board have explored reverse mortgage

as  a  possible  way to provide elderly HDB lessees  with  an

additional source of income for their retirement needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current reverse mortgage proposals allow a property

owner  to receive monthly payments over a fixed term of about

10  years.   At the end of a reverse mortgage term,  however,

the  property owner has to relinquish ownership of his  house

unless he is able to redeem the reverse mortgage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying the conditions and implications of

current  reverse mortgage proposals carefully, we  feel  that

the benefits are outweighed by the inherent limitations.  The

monthly  payments  are  relatively  meagre  because  of  high

financing  costs.  More importantly, the elderly  flat-owners

risk  losing  their homes at the end of the reverse  mortgage

term.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



Since the current terms of reverse mortgage proposals are not

entirely  favourable,  we  have decided  not  to  pursue  the

reverse mortgage scheme for the time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether

this  is  a form of paternalism and it goes against the  idea

that  citizens should take more responsibility  for  managing

their own assets?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I think it is not prudent.

There  is a risk involved and if the elderly stands  to  lose

his home, then I do not think it is prudent for Government to

start this scheme because basically we want to encourage home

ownership.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, even if we open up the possibility,

it  will  still  be  an option for the elderly.   Is  it  not

possible, therefore, that an elderly couple could be  sitting

on  a  fully  paid-up flat but they have no  money  in  their

pockets, and would that not be a hardship?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have other

schemes  to  help them.  In fact, we have a number  of  them.

For  instance, we have made it easier for elderly lessees  of

three-room  flats  to sublet their whole  flat.   Is  it  not

better?   And  if they do not wish to move, and they  have  a

three-room or bigger flat, they can sublet one room  or  more

to  derive  some income.  They can also sell their  flat  and

purchase  an affordable studio apartment from HDB.  So  there

are  many  ways  to  help them.  We feel that  the  insurance

proposal at the moment is not favourable but if the insurance

industry  is  more competitive in the future, we may  re-open

consideration of this scheme.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister of State whether he is aware that sometimes the  HDB

officials  will  send  letters to elderly  lessees,  who  are

alone,  as an almost automatic reaction to tell them to  give

up  their  flat and sell it away, and this really intimidates

the remaining elderly lessees into action which may not be in

their interest.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I am not aware of this.

If the Member has the details, please pass it to me.

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE TO YOUNG COUPLES TO OWN HDB FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether further changes will  be  made  to  help

young  couples  solve  their housing problems  and  meet  the

financial outlay to own a Housing and Development Board flat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the average waiting time for a new HDB flat

now  is about one year for first-timer applicants.  This  has

benefited  many young couples who want to set up their  homes

early.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist in the purchase of flats, HDB has introduced a

Staggered Downpayment Scheme.  Under this scheme, first-timer

young couples who have booked a 4-room flat can pay only  10%

of  the selling price at the time of booking, and the balance

10% upon completion of the flat. This gives the young couples

more  time to save for the downpayment.  Applicants for a  5-room  flat  may  also  request to switch  to  a  4-room  flat

register so as to buy a flat that is more affordable to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is also looking into other ways to make its flat

allocation system more flexible and responsive to  the  needs

of  flat applicants.  HDB will announce the details once they

are finalized.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> May I ask the Minister

whether   he  would  be  prepared  to  review  the  staggered

instalment payment further because the time span now  is  one

year  and  they  may  not accumulate enough  money  by  then.

Secondly,  I  am also thinking of young couples who  want  to

live  in older housing estates.  Is the Minister prepared  to

look at the whole issue of cash outlay by younger couples who

want to stay near to their parents in older housing estates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there is a general rule of thumb

that  before anybody purchases a flat the couple must have  a

certain  amount upfront, either in cash or CPF.   But  we  do

recognise that the 20% down payment, for some young couples,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



especially in cases where the flat is completed early or they

are  shortlisted for application sooner than  they  expected,

there  may be some difficulty in accumulating that  20%,  and

this  is  the  reason  why  we came  up  with  the  Staggered

Downpayment Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Staggered Downpayment Scheme has got certain

restrictions.   The  flat type must be a  smaller  flat  and,

secondly,  there must be a certain age restriction  as  well.

But  the  general principle does apply that you need to  have

something upfront before you can actually apply for  a  flat.

This is the reason why the scheme is not applicable to the 5-room  flats  because obviously the question of  affordability

may not be so relevant there.  But the Member did ask whether

this  scheme would be applicable to resale flats,  especially

where  young  couples  want to move into  certain  areas  for

certain reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For resale flats, if you are a first-timer and if you

are a young couple, you can avail yourself of the CPF Housing

Grant  Scheme.  I think that already helps to a large  extent

to  make  that flat more affordable.  Other than that,  there

are  no  other schemes at the moment which they can make  use

of.   But if the Member has any suggestions, I would be happy

to consider them.

bilateral  free trade agreements with the United  States  and

other  countries  and  (b)  whether  there  are  problems  in

reaching agreements with them.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is negotiating free trade

agreements  with  Australia, Mexico,  Japan  and  the  United

States.   We are working on concluding these negotiations  as

soon as possible, hopefully by the end of the year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



We are also in exploratory talks with Canada and the European

Free Trade Area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions with our FTA partners are progressing well.

The  first round of formal negotiations with Japan last month

was fruitful, building on the joint study conducted last year

by  representatives from the government, academia and private

sector of the two countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mexico, we have completed four rounds of

negotiations last year.  Former President Zedillo  and  Prime

Minister Goh Chok Tong signed a joint declaration in November

last  year,  setting  out the main areas  of  agreement,  and

committing to conclude a comprehensive Mexico-Singapore  Free

Trade  Agreement  (MSFTA)  as soon  as  possible.   President

Vicente  Fox who heads the new administration in  Mexico  has

given  his support for the Free Trade Agreement.  Both  sides

are  committed  to build on the progress that has  been  made

thus far, and will resume negotiations shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also begun talks with Australia. Like for the

others, the Australia-Singapore Free Trade Agreement will  be

comprehensive in scope and consistent with our broader  trade

liberalisation objectives within the WTO.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the United States, we have held two rounds of

negotiations in December 2000 and January 2001.   US  experts

in  competition policy, customs and labour have also  visited

Singapore  in early January to better understand  our  system

and policies.  They had a fruitful visit to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved good progress over these two rounds of

negotiations with the US.  We have agreed with the  US  on  a

single  negotiating text that will form the basis for  future

negotiations.  But much work remains to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our immediate task ahead is to resume talks with the new

Administration  as soon as possible.  I have signed  a  joint

declaration with former USTR Charlene



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



Barshefsky,  reporting on the progress of  our  negotiations.

This  joint declaration provides an important bridge  between

the new and the old Administrations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the technical level, our negotiators will continue to

have  discussions.  At the political level, we are  confident

that  the  Bush  Administration will recognise the  strategic

importance of the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement  (USSFTA)

in its engagement of ASEAN and East Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would we

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, we have to stick to the

approach   on  labour  and  environment  from  the   previous

is  an  issue  which will have to be discussed with  the  new

Administration when talks resume.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, some neighbouring countries have

expressed  the  concern  that  should  Singapore  conclude  a

reassure our neighbours?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was puzzled

by  the  report  of  an  Australian newspaper  that  Minister

Rafidah  of  Malaysia  had given Singapore  warnings  against

allowing Singapore becoming a backdoor entrance for Australia

and  New Zealand to AFTA.  I doubt the veracity of the report

because  my discussions with Minister Rafidah and  the  other

Ministers   of   ASEAN   had  been  friendly   and   entirely

professional.  There are clear rules of origin governing  how

much  local content there must be before companies  or  goods

qualify for the privileges of AFTA.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, Singapore has

started  a Free Trade Agreement with countries far away  from

Singapore, notwithstanding AFTA.  Why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



has Singapore not opened up Free Trade Agreement negotiations

with Malaysia who is our immediate neighbour and what are the

problems, if any, notwithstanding AFTA?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Notwithstanding AFTA? Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  AFTA  means that we  do  have  a  Free  Trade

Agreement  with Malaysia and with all the other countries  of

ASEAN.   There  is  a schedule.  Apart from  automobiles  for

which  the  Malaysians had sought a delay in the schedule  of

inclusion,  with the permission of the Thais,  virtually  all

goods  are now in and by the end of next year, I believe  the

tariff lines for all goods will be down to between 0% and 5%.

In  effect,  we  do have an FTA with Malaysia and  last  year

Malaysia  became  our  number  one  trading  partner   again,

overtaking the US.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister, given that this

bilateral  activity  is in some ways seen  to  help  the  WTO

process, is there any movement or possibility of movement  on

a multilateral basis?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last

month,  there  has been a flurry of activities all  over  the

world  to  begin the process towards launching  a  new  round

either  this  year  or  next year.  The  WTO  Ministers  have

already agreed to meet in Qatar in November this year.  I  am

not  sure whether we would be able to launch this year.   The

attitudes  of  the  present  Bush  Administration  are   more

favourable to the global trade agenda.  I am optimistic  that

a  new round would be launched. Can it be launched this year?

I  am  not sure.  But if there is a chance, we should go  for

it, and in these formal and informal discussions to build  up

momentum  for  a  new round, Singapore is playing  a  helpful

role.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, do we know of any countries in

the   region,   in  particular,  which  have  launched   into

negotiations on FTAs on their own?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Thailand has expressed

interest and had exploratory talks with, I believe, countries

like  South Korea.  Japan is interested in Mexico  and  South

Korea.  Hong Kong,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



which  in  the  past, took a very doctrinal position  against

FTAs,  is  now in some kind of negotiations with New Zealand.

There  could  be other countries involved. I do  not  have  a

comprehensive list here.

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATISATION OF POWER COMPANIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what  are  the  lessons  we  can  learn  from   the

privatised operations of power companies in California,  USA,

and  how  the  same problems can be avoided in  Singapore  as

power supply is also privatised.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

California  electricity  market  was  deregulated  in   1996.

Electricity tariffs in California were much higher  than  the

rest  of the United States and it was hoped that deregulation

would lead to lower prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outset, there were flaws in the partially

deregulated market structure.  Utilities had to buy all their

power requirements through the state power exchange and could

not  buy power in forward markets or hedge prices in any way.

Prices  were  also frozen at the 1996 levels  until  2002  to

allow the utility companies to recover the stranded costs  of

old  investments.  The Independent System Operator (ISO)  was

tasked  to  operate the network but was not  responsible  for

planning and building additional transmission capacity.   The

bidding procedures in the power exchange were also vulnerable

to gaming by the generation companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-deregulation, several developments led to the

crisis  in January this year.  Fuel prices rose dramatically.

Led  by  the  economic boom, electricity demand in California

grew   strongly,  but  this  was  not  dampened   by   higher

electricity prices because those were capped and  supply  was

not  met by the planting of new generation capacity.  And due

to  its  strict  environmental regulations  and  wide  public

resistance of having a power plant in their backyard, no  new

generation  plants were built in the state for more  than  10

years.   In fact, some commentators described California as a

"banana"  state,  because  they had  this  policy  of  "build

absolutely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



nothing  anywhere near anybody."  As a result, the generation

reserve  capacity in California dropped drastically from  30%

to  below 7%.  A confluence of various factors, including bad

weather,  resulted in a severe mismatch of supply and  demand

which,  in  turn,  led to soaring prices on  the  electricity

wholesale   market.   A  series  of  planned  blackouts   was

therefore   implemented  in  January  this  year  to   ration

electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California had expected the market prices of electricity

to  remain  low  after deregulation and thus imposed  a  rate

freeze.   However, as prices on the spot market soared,  this

rate  soon  became  lower than the cost of  generation.   The

utilities  companies  incurred  a  10-cent  loss  for   every

kilowatt-hour  (kwh) of electricity sold and were  driven  to

the  brink of bankruptcy with a total debt of US$12  billion.

The  State  has now stepped in to prevent the situation  from

getting worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key lessons for us from California are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The market structure and regulatory framework must be

sound and robust;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The market must be allowed to work. Price adjustments

are  needed  to enable consumers to adjust their  consumption

and to motivate new investments in generation capacity;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Entry to and exit from the industry should be

facilitated.   In  California, it was very difficult  to  get

approval for new power stations which meant that supply could

not keep up with demand.  The strict environmental rules have

discouraged investors from building new power plants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we must make sure that good economics

drive   the   liberalisation  of  our  energy   market.    In

California, the problem was not economics but politics.  Work

on  our liberalisation is progressing well and the new market

will  start  functioning in the second  half  of  this  year.

However,  the  deregulation of our electricity industry  will

not  be  problem-free as it is a complex exercise.  For  this

reason,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



we  will liberalise in stages.  By the end of this year,  the

market for big customers will be completely liberalised  but,

for  households,  we  will do a more detailed  implementation

study before proceeding.   Our target date for households  is

the year 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Energy Market Authority of Singapore, to be set up

in  April  this year - the Bill will be tabled afterwards   - will  be overall responsible for the security and reliability

of  energy supply.  The wholesale market will facilitate  the

free  trading  of electricity either through the  Electricity

Pool  or directly between buyers and sellers.  Future trading

of electricity is permitted.  Retail competition will also be

introduced in phases.  Our new regime will continue to  allow

the  market to determine electricity prices and our consumers

to  pay  a  price  that reflects the true  economic  cost  of

electricity.   Consumers will benefit from a wider  range  of

electricity products and services at competitive prices.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo:</b> Sir, in the light of the fact that there

will  be changes in power supply and power companies  in  the

context  of  Singapore, can I ask the Minister whether  there

are  any  measures to protect the interests of the consumers,

particularly  from profiteering?  Because I  see  that  there

will  be  few  power companies which will have a monopoly  in

future.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Dr Vasoo raised a very

important  point of ensuring competition at the  supply  end.

In  fact, this is a major exercise for the regulators to make

sure  that there will be no cartel behaviour, that there will

be  no  unethical gaming, for instance, in order to  restrict

supply  at critical moments to jack up prices.  This will  be

the   key   challenge  to  regulators.   We  have  had   many

discussions  with consultants and we are confident  that  the

new regulatory structure will not allow such behaviour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether  there are measures taken  to  ensure  that

there is no repeat of the phenomenon of regulatory capture by

utility  providing  companies which  has  been  witnessed  in

countries elsewhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, our structure will not

allow  for  easy regulatory capture, because  it  breaks  the

industry  up  into contestable and non-contestable  elements.

In  addition,  there will be a separate system operator  and,

over  and  above that, a separate regulatory structure.   The

power  stations will compete in generation.   At  the  retail

end,  there will be competition.  The grid, being  a  natural

monopoly,  will be tightly regulated.  Over and  above  that,

the system operational despatch will be done separately.  And

then we have regulators on top to make sure that all is well.

Of  course, there will be problems, but then that is what  we

are here for, to solve problems.

<div align="center"><b>CHARGES FOR AMENITIES/FACILITIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry,  in view of the uncertainty  of  the  economic

situation  ahead, whether he will consider  it  necessary  to

review  the  charges  for amenities/facilities  (for  example

utility  rates, rental charges, petrol prices) so that  these

charges will not be too burdensome particularly on small  and

medium  enterprises and on Singaporeans from the lower income

group.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though our

economy  did very well last year, the performance was uneven.

Some  SMEs,  particularly those in the domestic sectors,  did

not  do  as well as those companies which benefited from  the

strong  external demand last year.  We understand the  plight

of  these  smaller companies trying to keep their  businesses

viable.  Wherever possible, we have kept business costs down.

For  example,  the  CPF was only partly  restored.   We  were

mindful  of  the  cost impact on businesses if  the  CPF  was

restored  in full too quickly.  Despite the improved business

outlook  at the end of 1999, the rental rebates for  HDB  and

JTC industrial premises were extended by another year, to the

end  of  last  year.   Last  year, the  manufacturing  sector

recorded healthy growth but the recovery was uneven.   Hence,

JTC and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



HDB  decided to lift their rebates gradually.  Only half  the

rebate  was  removed on 1st January 2001.  MTI is  monitoring

the  economic  situation closely.   JTC and HDB  will  review

their rental rates in the middle of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should avoid distorting the general market prices for

Government  goods and services by directly subsidising  them.

To  help  small  companies and the lower-income  groups,  the

Government will continue to give rebates and provide  special

economic assistance schemes to these groups directly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Sir, would the Minister

consider  the setting up of a price commission or  Government

watchdog  committee  to review prices set  for  products  and

services consumed by the masses where the suppliers  enjoy  a

monopoly  or  cartel advantage?  CASE has  been  very  active

recently, but could be likened to a toothless bulldog.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, it is always a popular

idea  to  control  prices  to make sure  that  increases  are

ameliorated.   But  we operate a market system  and,  to  the

maximum  extent  possible,  we should  allow  the  market  to

operate.    Where  there  are  monopoly  powers,   then   the

regulators involved must make sure that either the monopolies

are regulated or broken up or the sector made contestable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE has performed a very useful role being a consumer

watchdog.  I do not think it is toothless at all.  And it has

been  lobbying  MTI  very hard for us  to  establish  a  Fair

Trading  Act.  We are now working with CASE to  look  at  how

such  an Act can be legislated.  It should be done in  a  way

which  does  not make the market operate less efficiently  or

less  flexibly.   Many MPs in this House, including Mr  Chiam

See Tong on many occasions, have raised the need for such  an

Act.  MTI has not been very enthusiastic about it because  it

creates  other problems.  But we are prepared to look  at  an

Act  which is minimalist and which allows the small  consumer

to seek redress at low cost, and we can make use of the Small

Claims Tribunal for this purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very early in this

Parliament,  I  proposed the appointment of  a  parliamentary

committee to check on price increases.  May I know  from  the

Minister  what  is the objection to an independent  committee

looking  into  price increases of utilities, like  transport,

water, light and other utility services?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, MTI monitors regularly

the  index  of Government fees and levies.  Even though  this

forms  only a small proportion of total cost, it is important

for us to monitor these prices because we are responsible for

them.   There  are  statutory  boards  which  have  a  direct

responsibility  to look at these prices like  PUB,  LTA,  the

Public  Transport Council.  It is their job.  Over and  above

them,  we have Ministries.  And the Ministers are accountable

to Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will the Minister please answer my

question?   What is the objection to an independent committee

monitoring increases in prices?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  there is a more independent committee than Members  of

this  House.   If  what  Mr Jeyaretnam  is  referring  to  is

technical  monitoring  of  the statistics,  we  already  have

statistical  agencies  monitoring these  numbers,  unless  Mr

Jeyaretam  is casting doubt on the professionalism  of  these

agencies.   And  if there are cases which have  attracted  Mr

Jeyaretnam's attention that our data gatherers have not  been

acting professionally, I will be very happy to look into  his

complaint.

<div align="center"><b>OIL PRODUCTION CUT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry what will be the impact of the oil production cut by

the   Organisation   of  Petroleum  Exporting   Countries   - indicating  higher  oil  prices  -  on  the  economy  and  on

household utility bills.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Organisation  of  Petroleum Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  cut

crude oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd)  on

1st  February  this year in order to maintain oil  prices  at

around US$22 to US$28 per barrel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent crude oil price has risen slightly to US$30 per

barrel,   due  partly  to  colder  weather  in  the  Northern

Hemisphere,  but  this is well below the  peak  of  US$37  in

September last year.  The cut in production is likely to lead

only  to a short-term increase in prices amid an increasingly

sluggish global economy.  Producer competition is also likely

to depress oil prices.  Oil price futures, which is a forward

indicator of oil prices, suggests that oil prices would  ease

in  the  months  ahead.  The 3-month and 12-month  oil  price

futures as at 14th February this year are US$27 and US$25 per

barrel   respectively.   The  OPEC  oil  production  cut   is

therefore  not expected to have a big impact on the Singapore

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact on household electricity bills will depend on

global fuel oil prices.  If fuel oil prices remain stable, as

suggested by the oil price futures market, there should be no

reason for higher household utilities bills this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what  were the reasons for police  objecting  to  an

application by the Open Singapore Centre for 20-30 persons to

run to mark Human Rights Day on 10th December 2000.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the Open

Singapore  Centre  (OSC)  applied for an  assembly/procession

permit   to   hold  a  marathon  in  conjunction   with   the

International  Human Rights Day on 10th December  last  year.

The marathon was proposed to start at Mount Pleasant Road and

end at Hong Lim Park.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police noted that the Think Centre had announced,

through its website, that the event was organised by both OSC

and  the  Think Centre.  From the information made public  by

the  Think Centre, the run would culminate in a demonstration

at  Hong  Lim  Park.   The demonstration would  call  for  an

apology  by  the  Government to Mr Chia Thye  Poh  and  those

detained  without trial as well as for the abolition  of  the

ISA.  Members of the public were urged to attend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police could not exclude the possibility that those

participating  in  the  run  may  also  participate  in   the

demonstration,  especially since  the  Think  Centre's  press

release mentioned that the runners were "activists".  As  the

entire  event, including the intended demonstration, had  the

potential to lead to law and order problems, Police  rejected

the application.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Am I to understand from the Minister of

State  that  this  request for 20 to 30 runners  was  refused

simply  because the Police or the Ministry did not  want  any

calls for the abolition of the ISA or any other calls on  the

Government  to be made at Hong Lim Park?  Is that the  reason

for refusing this permit?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, I think, did

not  listen to my answer.  Anybody can make a call to abolish

the ISA.  Mr Jeyaretnam himself has made the call many times.

The  fact is that Police rejected it because of law and order

considerations.  The website of Think Centre  had  publicised

it  as one event - marathon leading to Hong Lim Park where  a

demonstration  would be held.  So from that  point  of  view,

Police  said,  "Well,  possibly law and order  problems  will

arise.  Hence, no permit for the run."



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister tell us, without

speaking  in riddles, what were the problems that the  Police

were  foreseeing?  Were these based on concrete  evidence  or

did they have a nightmare the night before?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Police makes its

decision  professionally  based on  factors  which  are  well

known.  Here you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



have  an  application for a run which will end  in  Hong  Lim

Park, and it was explicitly stated in the publicity materials

that there would be a demonstration.  When one talks about  a

demonstration,  there will be possibility of  law  and  order

problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister tell this House, is

it  or  is it not true that his Cabinet Minister - I am again

surprised  that  he  is not here - said in  this  House  that

anybody could go to Hong Lim Park and speak freely and he  or

she  would  not be arrested, harassed or questioned  at  all?

Did he or did he not say that?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I do not want to respond to

that  if Mr Jeyaretnam is referring to current investigations

as  to what happened at Hong Lim Park on 10th December.  What

we  said  in this House is that people can speak at Hong  Lim

Park.  Conditions are very easy.  You register, you speak  on

any  topic, unless it is a topic that is religious in  nature

or  a  topic  that  will create enmity,  hostility,  ill-will

amongst  different religions and races which  is  prohibited.

You  can speak on any other topic but you are subject to  the

laws of the land.  So you cannot assemble without a permit at

Hong Lim Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister of State now telling

this  House  that every speaker there needs a permit  because

there  might be an assembly of persons listening to him?   Is

that  what he is telling the House - that you need  a  permit

before you go and get an assembly of people to listen to you?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is straying

from  the  original question which talks about permit  for  a

run.  Now he is talking about incidents happening at Hong Lim

Park which are currently under Police investigation, which  I

do not think we should go into details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It is being investigated. It

may be the defence of the defendants in these cases that they

have not assembled without a permit.  So I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



not think we should discuss these details in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister saying that it is a

criminal  act for people to go to Hong Lim Park and join  the

speaker  in calling for the abolition of the ISA or  for  any

other  Acts  which  they  find repressive  or  oppressive  in

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Since the opening of the

Speakers'  Corner six months ago, there have been  more  than

800 registrations to speak at the Park.  Perhaps not all have

spoken.  But many speakers have spoken and hundreds of people

have   listened  to  these  speakers  and  no  one  has  been

prosecuted.  So, here is a place where people can  speak  any

time,  just  register  and speak on any topic,  except  those

which  I  have mentioned, and people can gather,  and  indeed

Singaporeans  of  all  backgrounds have gathered,  some  more

interested  than others, but nevertheless many have  gathered

and none has been prosecuted or investigated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like I have said, Sir, the use of the Park is

subject  to  the  laws of the land, and Mr Jeyaretnam,  as  a

lawyer,  should  know  the provisions  of  the  Miscellaneous

Offences  Act  and  the  rules, in particular  Rule  2  which

defines  what  is  an  illegal assembly,  when  people  plan,

organise  together  to  publicise  a  specific  cause,   then

possibly an offence has been committed.  That is all  I  want

to  say  in terms of the general broad framework of the  law.

In terms of the specific case, it is being investigated and I

should say no more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, I think we are digressing

away from your main question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister in his reply rolled up the

whole thing into one.  He said the permit was refused because

of  what the Police feared might happen at Hong Lim Park.  So

he  has  rolled  it up into Hong Lim Park.   May  I  ask  the

Minister of State then to tell us what were the Police  fears

about these persons running?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam said that it

was one event.  It was publicised as one event.  That was the

import of Mr Jeyaretnam's original question which was rightly

asked:  why  was the permit for the run refused?  The  permit

for  the  run  was  refused, like I have  said,  because  the

publicity had said it was one event where you end up in  Hong

Lim  Park, where demonstrations would be held to abolish  the

ISA  and activists would be invited to join in.  And  it  was

very  likely that these activists who join in might also  end

up in Hong Lim Park and be part of the demonstration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the viewpoint of rejecting the application for

the  run, it was one event.  But now Mr Jeyaretnam is  asking

specific  questions on events that happened thereafter  which

are  currently under Police investigations, which I think  we

should not discuss.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask a final question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Provided it is related to your main

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right. The main question is about

the  running.  If you separate the two, what was wrong  about

the  20-30 members of the public running together, if you now

separate the two distinctly?  Could you answer that?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It is a hypothetical

question.  We are dealing with realities here.  Public safety

is  a  very real concern of Police.  You cannot separate  the

two  because the website of Think Centre which publicised the

event had said this would happen - the run, and, in fact,  it

states  specifically,  12 noon, it will  end  there  where  a

demonstration will be held.  In reality, Sir,  that  is  what

Police has to consider.  Let me assure Mr Jeyaretnam that the

Police   will   consider  all  these  points  professionally.

Uppermost in the minds of the Police will be the question  of

potential law and order and breach of the peace problems.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the permit asked for

specifically says that there shall only be 20 to  30  persons

running.   If  the number is more than 30, the  Police  could

declare  and just ask everybody to disperse because they  are

breaking the conditions of the permit there.  So if there are

only  20  to  30  persons confined to that demonstration,  is

there a security, law and order problem for the Police?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, answer that.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think Mr Chiam is not

cognisant   with   what  may  happen  on   the   ground.    A

demonstration can start with 20 or 30 people, but who  is  to

say that other supporters will not gather?  And who is to say

that  other people who are against the cause may not  gather?

Then,  problems will ensue.  I think from Police's  point  of

view, uppermost in their minds is the protection of citizens,

like you and me, the safety of ordinary citizens.  Hence,  if

there is a potential law and order problem, they will have to

say  no.  They cannot wait for things to happen and hope that

the  31st  runner  would not join in, or  hope  that  at  the

Speakers' Corner there will be no 31st listener.  They cannot

do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You do that just because you are

speculative of what will happen.  But the point is  that  the

number will be specifically confined to 20 or 30.  As long as

that  number is limited there, I do not think there  will  be

any problems with the permit.  But as soon as it exceeds that

number,  the  Police can immediately disperse the  crowd  and

say,  "Look  here.   That is the end of  your  demonstration.

That  is  the  end  of your event.", because  you  break  the

conditions of the permit.  And if they do not break  up,  you

can start the arrest.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the law says that if

five or more people gather, you will need a permit under  the

law.  But 30 is neither here nor there because six, seven  or

eight  people can also cause problems.  So it is not so  much

the numbers per se.  Police looks at it professionally, looks

at  the nature of the event and assesses whether or not there

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



be  potential  law  and order problem, and  then  it  decides

accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must caution Members from repeating the

same  questions.   You just get the same answers.   Mr  Simon

Tay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> A slightly different question, Sir. The

application  seems  to  be by the Open  Singapore  Centre,  a

different  entity from Think Centre.  The event seems  to  be

separate,  given  that  your  Ministry  decided  to  roll  it

together.  Was this thinking of your Ministry shared with the

applicant  and  is  it a regular practice to  rely  on  other

parties' publicity information in order to reject a different

person's application?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The Think Centre website had

announced  very  clearly on 23rd November that  this  was  an

event  jointly  organised by Think Centre and Open  Singapore

Centre (OSC).  So very clearly, they were joint organisers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask a final question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right, Mr Jeyaretnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister of State speaks about some

danger  to  the public arising out of these 20 to 30  persons

running.   Could  he try and spell out please,  what  is  the

danger to the public?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam did not hear

the answer.  I have given a detailed answer.  It is confirmed

now  that  he does not hear my answer.  It was publicised  as

one event and the run culminating in a demonstration.  So  it

was  assessed  as  such.  Should we allow  demonstrations  in

Singapore?



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. End of Question time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Pursuant to Standing Order No. 21(3), Question Nos. 16-23, 25 and 27 have been postponed to the sitting of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in November last year, the Government announced

plans   to  convert  the  Intellectual  Property  Office   of

Singapore  into a statutory board with effect from 1st  April

this year.  This Bill provides the legislative framework  for

the formation of this new statutory board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government department, currently known as the

Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (or IPOS for short)

had  its  origins  in  1937.  In those  days,  its  role  was

confined   to   the  processing  of  applications   for   the

registration  of  trade marks, renewals  and  restoration  of

trade  mark  registrations, adjudication  of  opposition  and

rectification  proceedings  for such  registration,  and  re-registration of United Kingdom patents.  Over the  years,  as

the realm of intellectual property rights increasingly became

more  important, the Registry expanded its activities  beyond

its   traditional  regulatory  functions  to  include  policy

development,  law  reform  and promotional  and  facilitation

activities.  These initiatives include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) creating indigenous regimes for the protection of

intellectual  property  -  such  as  the  formation   of   an

indigenous patent registration system in 1995 and the setting

up of a new Designs Registry last year;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) introducing new regimes of Intellectual Property

protection,  for  example, protection for  layout-designs  of

integrated circuits, and geographical indications;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) advising on policy and legal issues relating to

copyright  protection,  including amendments  to  Singapore's

legislation to comply with the WTO Agreement on Trade Related

Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (or TRIPS), replacing

the  1939 Trade Marks Act with a new Trade Marks Act in  1998

and  the  1999 amendments to the Copyright Act to  take  into

account  recent  developments in e-commerce  and  information

technology;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) driving and coordinating public Intellectual

Property education and awareness programmes; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) collaborating with other agencies to develop

software packages to improve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



access  by  businesses  and  users of  Intellectual  Property

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these new roles and responsibilities, the

Registry  of Trademarks and Patents was restructured  as  the

Intellectual  Property Office of Singapore in September  1999

and  given  oversight  of the entire  range  of  Intellectual

Property  laws.  Now, one and a half years on, the conversion

of IPOS into a statutory board is a logical step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, undoubtedly, Intellectual Property is a key

resource in today's economy.  It is also a critical factor in

maintaining  Singapore's competitiveness  now  and  into  the

foreseeable future.  A poignant illustration of this point is

the  steadily  increasing number of patents being  filed  and

granted in Singapore.  In 1995, when the new Patents Act came

into  force, 2,410 patent applications were filed  under  the

new  Act  and  1,750 patents were granted.  Last year,  7,713

patent  applications  were  filed  and  5,086  patents   were

granted.   In all, more than 20,000 patents were  granted  in

Singapore between 1995 and the year 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the increasing significance of intellectual

property   rights,  we  must  ensure  that  our  intellectual

property laws, policies and supporting framework continue  to

foster   an  environment  which  encourages  innovation   and

creativity and effectively protects investments in innovation

and  intellectual  labour.  The conversion  of  IPOS  into  a

statutory board will ensure that it is given the autonomy and

resources  to  perform this task effectively,  to  match  the

efforts  of  other key intellectual property offices  of  the

world, and the flexibility and nimbleness to ensure that  our

intellectual  property infrastructure  keeps  pace  with  the

rapidly  changing  conditions and with  the  speed  at  which

innovation and creativity is moving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, IPOS will advise the Government on all areas of

intellectual   property   policies,   including    copyright,

integrated circuits and geographical indications,  and  carry

out  regulatory functions over intellectual property  agents.

Apart  from carrying out its core functions, IPOS  will  also

engage in promoting intellectual property and will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



embark  on  other  support activities to support  innovation,

creativity and use of intellectual property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from educating and informing the public on

intellectual  property, IPOS, with its greater autonomy,  can

from  time  to  time embark on the provision of other  value-added   services  and  products  that  may  be  required   by

intellectual property users.  Such services and products can,

for   example,  focus  on  the  dissemination  of   technical

information   to   facilitate   research   and   development,

emphasizing   the  importance  of  innovative  products   and

services,  and use of intellectual property as strategic  and

marketing tools to secure competitive advantage when entering

markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has a highly regarded intellectual

property regime which is one of the best in Asia.  IPOS  will

establish and maintain an effective international network  to

ensure  that Singapore continues to stay at the forefront  of

intellectual property developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now take the House through the main

provisions   of   the  Bill.   Part  II  provides   for   the

establishment, incorporation and constitution of  IPOS  as  a

statutory board.  The new statutory board will consist  of  a

Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and 8 to 20 other board  members.

Sir,  in  the  selection of board members, we  will  draw  on

expertise from both the public and private sectors, and  from

the   tertiary  and  scientific  institutions  as   well   as

intellectual property practitioners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III spells out the functions and powers of the new

statutory board.  The main functions are :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to administer our intellectual property laws and

the systems for the protection of intellectual property;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to promote public awareness and effective use of

intellectual property rights;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to advise and make recommendations to the

Government  on matters related to intellectual property   and

to   represent  the  Government  internationally  on  matters

relating to intellectual property; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to promote the development of the profession of

intellectual   property  agents  and  intellectual   property

advisers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill relates to financial matters. IPOS

will be a self-funding statutory board and will fund its  own

services  and activities.  This would allow revenues obtained

from intellectual property services and products carried  out

by  IPOS to be channelled back to the benefit of the users of

the  system,  with optimal use of resources  that  meets  the

users' needs and expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill relates to transitional matters,

such  as the transfer of employees to the new statutory board

on  terms  no  less favourable than those the  employees  had

enjoyed immediately prior to their transfer, and the transfer

of assets and liabilities to the new statutory board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII of the Bill contains various miscellaneous

provisions.   IPOS  officers will be vested with  enforcement

powers  in  order to allow them to enforce some  departmental

offences  for  the  Acts  under  their  administration.   The

offences are those under the Bill and the offences set out in

the  Third  Schedule to the Bill, which are mainly regulatory

offences  under  the  Patents  Act,  Trade  Marks   Act   and

Registered Designs Act.  IPOS officers will also be empowered

to  carry out prosecutions and the legal officers may  appear

in  court  for  civil proceedings on behalf of  IPOS  or  the

Registrars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of IPOS as a new statutory board is

another  important  step in establishing  the  infrastructure

needed  to  ensure  that  Singapore is  able  to  effectively

develop intellectual property as a strategic resource to meet

the challenges of the new economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore  Bill  is

the  first to be read in this House in 2001.  It is, in other

words,  the  first Bill of the millennium, and fittingly  so.

It  sets  up one of the most important institutions  that  we

must  have  in  a knowledge-based economy, ie, an  office  to

perform a number of important functions and duties related to

intellectual property rights in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its functions and duties are many and varied. It has a

regulatory  function to administer the intellectual  property

regime   in  Singapore  and  register  intellectual  property

advisers and patent agents.  It has an educative function, to

promote  public awareness of IPRs, and provide  training  and

scholarships  for  patent agents and other IP  professionals.

And   it   has  an  international  function  -  to  represent

Government internationally on matters relating to IPRs and to

provide advice and assistance to other countries as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these tasks are difficult ones and my first

comment  is:  is too much being expected from IPOS?   Can  it

manage its many roles efficiently and fairly?  It is a unique

institution.   I  do not think that other countries  have  an

institution    taking    on   such    wide    and    enormous

responsibilities, at least not all under one roof.  Would  it

be  able  to deliver on all its responsibilities?   Not  only

that.   It  is neither a typical statutory body or a  private

company,  but a public corporation able to invest its  monies

in  such  manner  as  it  thinks fit,  subject  only  to  the

Minister's approval.  It has no duties, such as those imposed

on  private corporations registered under the Companies  Act;

it  is not encumbered by the limitations of investments  that

are  put  on  typical statutory bodies through  the  Trustees

Investments  Act;  all in all, a very powerful  animal,  made

more so perhaps by having protection from liability that goes

beyond  those provided for private companies.   Is  this  new

type of public corporation, armed with powers beyond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



the  investment  powers of statutory bodies and  having  less

rigorous    reporting    responsibilities    than     private

corporations,  the sign of things to come?  Who  will  ensure

that the office would be acting prudently and wisely?  I have

referred to the powers of IPOS, which are as extensive as its

duties are onerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I turn to one that can be particularly troublesome

in  its conception, in its scope and in its operation.   This

is  the  power contained in clause 7(1)(c), "to  accredit  or

certify  and regulate any person as an intellectual  property

agent or intellectual property adviser".  Taken together with

the  definition of "intellectual property adviser",  we  find

that  the power given to IPOS may be extremely wide and could

very   well   be  unnecessary,  and  may  even  inhibit   the

development  of  the  IT industry.  An intellectual  property

adviser is defined as "Any person who, in the course  of  his

profession  or  business,  provides  legal  or  other  advice

relating  to any intellectual property".  And the advice  can

extend to IPRs outside of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, this definition is far too wide. It is

likely to be impossible for proper regulation or enforcement.

It  is also difficult to see what mischief this provision  is

aimed at.  It is not difficult to see that the definition  is

really  very wide.  Many professionals in the IT  field,  for

example,  would be caught by it, not just lawyers  practising

IP law but, indeed, even a lawyer, who casually deals with  a

small  IP  issue  as part of a bigger transaction,  would  be

caught.   A lawyer, who inserts an IP clause into a  contract

of  employment,  may similarly be caught.  An  employer,  who

tells  his  would-be  employee that all IP  rights  would  be

assigned  to him so long as the employee works for him,  will

be  caught.  A software engineer, who informs his  team  that

any  software  developed by them would  be  the  intellectual

property of the firm, will be caught.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is that there is a myriad of situations

where  a  person  can  be  labelled an intellectual  property

adviser  and who would therefore fall foul of the law  if  he

were  to  provide  any information or advice on  intellectual

property and he is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



properly  registered.   Indeed, the information  officers  in

IPOS themselves would be subject to the same regulations.  Is

this really the intention of the Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention two especially problematic issues. First,

such  a  wide provision means that all lawyers, who  are  all

potentially  IP  advisers, would have to register  again,  in

addition  to being subject to regulation by the Law  Society.

Why?   Is  there  some  special  concern,  some  interest  to

protect, that the Law Society, with its disciplinary  powers,

cannot  take  care  of?   Why require lawyers  or,  for  that

matter,  engineers,  accountants  or  doctors,  who  are  all

subject to their respective professional bodies, to a further

registration  process under IPOS?  In fact, the intention  to

register  such advisers may be detrimental to the IT business

generally.  It may also adversely affect foreign companies in

the  IT trade coming in, as their in-house advisers, be  they

legal   advisers  or  engineers,  would  also  have   to   be

registered.  And this may mean additional costs in setting up

business and, more importantly, perhaps perpetuate an unhappy

impression that Singapore is over-regulated.  I do not  think

that  this is a step in the right direction, especially  when

we  are talking about creating a liberal creative environment

for  the  IT industry to prosper.  I accept that there  is  a

need to register intellectual property agents who are defined

differently  in the Act.  These are the agents  who  have  to

draft    patent   applications,   trade   marks   or   design

applications,  and for whom the responsibility  of  doing  an

accurate application is particularly important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I generally support the rest of the Bill, I

would  urge  only  that  the part on regulating  intellectual

property advisers be removed.  If this cannot be done at this

stage,  then  I would urge the Minister to assure  the  House

that  the  provision  would not  be  put  in  force  for  the

foreseeable future, at least until it is clearer why there is

a  need  to register intellectual property advisers  who  are

already regulated in their respective professions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 8 of the Bill, the Minister can direct the

Office as to the performance of its functions and powers.   I

would  like  to  know whether the Minister  would,  in  fact,

direct  IPOS that no such register for IP advisers be set  up

for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remain fully supportive of the need

to have IPOS as an integral part of the proper development of

the  economy in Singapore.  IPOS will provide quality control

in  terms of the personnel involved in the IT industry, guide

policy on the development of intellectual property rights  in

Singapore and beyond, and promote the image of Singapore as a

place  where  intellectual property rights are protected  and

where  creative people can prosper and reap the  benefits  of

their creativity and hard work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, let me thank GPC

Chairman,  Prof.  Chin,  for supporting  the  Bill.   He  has

expressed some concerns which I will address one at a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me clarify that IPOS is not in a unique

situation.   It is not a unique institution, because  it  has

also similar counterparts elsewhere in other countries.   For

example,  the  UK  Patents  Office  is  responsible  for  the

registration of patents, designs and trade marks, as well  as

for the development of IPR policy generally.  Another example

is  Hong  Kong.   Hong Kong also has an IP office  which  has

taken  on  the  administration of the whole  spectrum  of  IP

rights  and  has also undertaken public awareness programmes.

So  we must also move as, in a sense, these are other centres

which also want to create and develop a culture of IP.  It is

a competitive environment and Singapore must keep in step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next point is whether IPOS can handle the task.

Sir,  let  me assure the GPC Chairman that IPOS is poised  to

take on its enhanced role.  As I have mentioned in my speech,

IPOS,  over  the  last  five years or  so,  has  indeed  been

assuming more and more responsibilities.  In a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



sense,  it  has been preparing itself for this new challenge.

As  I have said in my speech, for example, IPOS has taken  on

an  active  role in the development of new IPR  policies  and

legislation.  The new Trade Marks Act, an entirely  new  Act,

is  an  example.  The Copyright (Amendment) Act to deal  with

the   advent   of   electronic  commerce,  the   Geographical

Indications  Act,  the Layout-Designs of Integrated  Circuits

Act, and the Registered Designs Act, all these are very clear

examples.   So it has been actively involved in  helping  the

Ministry  of  Law to formulate policies and draft  these  new

Acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPOS has not just stayed within our shores, but it has

also  gone  into  joint  ventures  with  other  agencies   at

international, regional and national levels, to increase  IPR

awareness by organising workshops, seminars, exhibitions  and

training  courses.  Some of these agencies include WIPO,  the

World  Intellectual Property Organisation, the Japan  Patents

Office,  the European Patents Office, universities,  National

Science  and  Technology Board, Trade Development  Board  and

PSB.   IPOS,  in  addition, is one of the first  few  in  the

region  to have joined the Madrid Protocol, which allows  for

the international registration of trade marks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also mentioned some products and packages which

IPOS  has  worked  with  industry to put  together  including

computer  searches and, indeed, even a new portal called  the

Surf   IP,   which  offers  a  holistic,  comprehensive   and

integrated  search for information on IP.  And  I  understand

that this is the first portal of its kind in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank Prof. Chin for pointing out that IPOS

indeed  has  an enormous and difficult task ahead.   This  is

precisely  why IPOS needs to be given adequate resources  and

the flexibility to fulfil its new responsibilities.  And this

is  precisely  why  we are converting IPOS into  a  statutory

board to give it the flexibility to develop its resources and

capabilities to meet these new challenges.  So, indeed,  IPOS

would have to do more.  I have outlined what it has done, and

it has reached a certain stage.  But Prof. Chin is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



absolutely  right.  In order for it to be able to  carry  out

its  functions effectively, it will do more.  It will do more

in  terms of training its manpower, and gearing up its  staff

to meet new challenges ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just make one clarification. Prof. Chin says

that IPOS is not a statutory board.  It is a statutory board.

If he were to look at previous Bills on statutory boards, the

phrase "public corporation" found in the explanatory note  is

a  standard  phrase  found in all such Bills.   So  it  is  a

statutory board in the usual sense of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about the investment powers. The

clause that Prof. Chin has mentioned on investment powers  in

fact  reflects  the  result of a recent review  of  statutory

boards'  investment powers.  They should be given the freedom

to  maximise the investments of their own funds in  order  to

respond  effectively to changing investment  markets  and  to

allow  them  to invest in new forms of investment  which  are

appropriate for its purpose.  This clause is, in fact, a  new

standard clause adopted as a result of the review, and is not

unique  to IPOS.  The same clause is found, in fact,  in  the

other  two  statutory board Bills going  for  Second  Reading

today,  ie, the Health Sciences Authority Bill and the Health

Promotion  Board Bill.  But the point really is  that  having

the  flexibility of powers does not mean that it has full say

without  any safeguards.  Safeguards are also important  and,

indeed,  there are safeguards.  For example, their investment

power will be subject to control by the board members of  the

statutory  board  who come from a wide range of  backgrounds.

So  these  people  would be culled from the  private  sector,

public   sector  and  academia  who  will  decide   on   what

investments  to  make.  A further check would  be  that  this

investment  power  would be subject to the  approval  of  the

Minister.   So, that is a key safeguard.  Furthermore,  there

are  the  usual audit provisions, and IPOS has to  submit  an

annual report to Parliament every year.  As Members know,  if

necessary,  and if Members so desire, further  questions  can

also  be  asked  in  this  House about  IPOS,  including  its

accounts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



and  investments.  This is something which private  companies

would not be subject to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with Prof. Chin's main point. Prof.

Chin  has expressed concern about the wide powers of IPOS  to

regulate intellectual property advisers.  Let me address  his

concern  and  put  it  in context.  First,  let  me  describe

briefly the work that is being done now on the creation of  a

new patent agent profession.  This will help put the issue in

context.   This  move  is  needed to  ensure  that  Singapore

develops  a  sufficiently strong patent agent  profession  to

provide  support  services to the industry  in  the  area  of

intellectual  property.  This is in line with our  vision  of

becoming  a competitive and knowledge-based economy,  capable

of  attracting  innovators  to  create,  and  innovators  and

investors  to register and trade their products and  services

with   the   assurance  of  a  strong  intellectual  property

infrastructure here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the proposal will be announced soon. But

I  can  inform the House that, so far, 40 persons or so  have

already  signed up for the NUS' IP Law Course.  So  it  is  a

very  keen  activity.  People want to come on-board  and,  in

fact,   the  vast  majority  are  non-lawyers,  people   with

scientific  background preparing themselves for qualification

as  patent agents under the new proposal.  In formulating the

proposals, IPOS consulted extensively with the Law Society of

Singapore,   the  Singapore  group  of  the   Asian   Patents

Attorneys'  Association, and the International Federation  of

Intellectual  Property Attorneys.  Apart from patent  agents,

let  me say that there are no plans for IPOS to regulate  any

other  intellectual  property related  professionals  in  the

foreseeable future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like all Acts of Parliament, this piece of

legislation will be in our statute books for many years.   We

should therefore ensure that the Bill provides IPOS with  the

necessary  mandate to promote the development of  professions

and to advise the Government on measures to be taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



concerning  these professions, not only to cater  to  present

needs, but also to deal with future needs that cannot now  be

all foreseen.  Why do I say this?  I think this is especially

important in an area as fast moving as intellectual property.

These  vast  developments are now bringing  us  into  largely

uncharted  waters whose tributaries may lead us to  limitless

and  exciting discoveries in diverse areas such as cyber law,

information technology law, bio-sciences, bio-technology  and

life  sciences.   Therefore, in crafting this  law,  we  have

taken  a  forward-looking and long-term approach  to  provide

IPOS with the necessary mandate to promote the development of

IP-related   professions  and  to   advise   the   Government

accordingly as the state of these professions can affect  the

quality of our intellectual property infrastructure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin may be right that the term "intellectual

property adviser" is very wide, and is a term that is used to

describe the full range of IP-related professions.  The  idea

is  to  give  IPOS the mandate to promote and  develop  these

professions.   I  think  that is the point,  ie,  not  to  be

restrictive or to curtail, but to bring in the flexibility as

and  when the need may arise.  We do not see that arising  in

the  foreseeable future, to have a profession that will  push

the  industry  forward, like what we  are  doing  for  patent

agents.   There  is certainly no intention in  the  immediate

future   to   put   in   place   a   regulatory   regime   to

indiscriminately  cover  all IP-related  professions  by  one

stroke of the pen.  Any proposal to regulate any type of  IP-related  professionals will be tightly focused and  carefully

targeted at the relevant segment and would only be introduced

for  the  good  of the industry, not to its detriment.   Like

what  I  have  described, the whole manner in which  we  have

approached  the  formation of patent agents as  a  profession

which  involves not only lawyers - I think Prof. Chin's focus

was on lawyers - but indeed when a new profession is created,

other people would also benefit because they would have  more

work  to  do,  they  would be able to be involved  in  a  new

capacity in the development of IP in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members of this House and the legal

profession  that  should  the need  ever  arise  to  consider

regulating    other    types   of    intellectual    property

professionals, the Law Society and all other relevant parties

would  be  consulted in the formation of any  new  regulatory

mechanism,  just  as  what we have done  in  formulating  our

proposals in the patent agent profession.  I am sure that  at

that  time, the concerns that have been raised by Prof.  Chin

in this House would be addressed. Sir,  my  officials  have,  in  fact,  also  met  with

representatives of the Law Society to explain  the  rationale

for these provisions and to assuage their concerns.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I am heartened that

the  Minister  of  State  has given  the  answers  about  not

registering intellectual property advisers straightaway.  But

I  would  just  like to ask for a clarification.   Would  the

Minister  of  State not confirm that neither  the  UK  Patent

Office nor the Hong Kong equivalent actually has the width of

powers  that  are now being conferred on IPOS?  For  example,

there  has never been any suggestion in either Hong  Kong  or

the   UK   that  there  should  be  any  attempt  to  control

intellectual  property  advisers  as  distinct  from   patent

agents.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, that could very well be

so.  But I think in the Singapore context, because we want to

move  ahead, we are in this hub, we are in this region  where

we   have   recognised  IP  as  an  important  industry   for

development, we want to create an IPOS which should be  given

the  powers,  to push the frontiers.  But, as I have  assured

Members  of  this House and the GPC Chairman, groundwork  has

been  done and indeed I am sure the Ministry of Law  and  the

new   Director  would  ensure  that  the  powers   would   be

effectively carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>HEALTH PROMOTION BOARD BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>2.38 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to set up a new statutory board,

the  Health  Promotion Board, by integrating five departments

in  the  Ministry  of  Health, namely,  the  National  Health

Education Department, Department of Nutrition, School  Health

Service,  School Dental Service and Health Promotion Division

(Administration).  The objective of the Bill  is  to  provide

the  legislative  framework for  the  formation  of  the  new

statutory board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain the rationale for the formation of

the statutory board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health of Singaporeans today is good. We have done

quite  well by any parameter.  Our infant mortality  rate  of

four deaths per thousand live births, maternal mortality rate

of  0.1  per thousand live births and still births  and  life

expectancy  at birth of 78 years are comparable to  those  in

developed  countries.  We have made significant  progress  in

improving  the  health of Singaporeans in many areas  through

our health promotion and disease prevention programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with the children. Our children represent

the  future  of Singapore.  We need to ensure the health  and

well-being  of  our young.  We have done well in  this  area.

The National Childhood Immunisation Programme has resulted in

the  elimination  of  severe  infectious  diseases,  such  as

diphtheria and poliomyelitis. We have also reduced  childhood

tuberculosis, whooping cough, measles, mumps,  rubella  to  a

very low level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our comprehensive School Health Programme of health

screening, immunisation, dental care and health education has

contributed to the good health of our young.  However,  there

are one or two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



gaps  that  we  need  to  plug.  For  example,  many  of  our

secondary  school students who were born before we introduced

Hepatitis  B immunisation for babies, have not been immunised

against  Hepatitis B and are at risk of Hepatitis B infection

and  liver cancer. We have therefore taken action to  address

this.   Earlier  this month, we implemented the  Hepatitis  B

immunisation   programme   for  students.    This   four-year

programme  will  cover  over 300,000  students  in  secondary

schools,  junior  colleges,  centralised  institutes,   ITEs,

polytechnics,   universities  and  our   full-time   national

servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we have a comprehensive dental health

programme  for primary schools.  Every primary school  has  a

dental  clinic where dental health screening and basic dental

treatment  is  done.  However, the  programme  for  secondary

school  is less comprehensive. As a result, the dental health

status  of  our secondary school students is not as  good  as

that  of  the  primary  school students.   We  are  therefore

working  with  the  Ministry  of Education  to  build  dental

clinics in secondary schools so that our students can benefit

from having dental care on site in their schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defective vision or myopia among school children has

continued to increase from an overall rate of 43% in 1990  to

51% in 1999.  The rate among Primary 1 children has increased

from  19% to 30% over the same period.  We therefore need  to

implement measures to arrest and reverse this trend  as  high

myopia is associated with potentially blinding conditions  in

later  life.  Sir, although we have done well in  our  school

programmes, much still needs to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the adults and the elderly, however, there are

some  areas  where we are not doing so well,  such  as  heart

disease, stroke and cancer.  Although the incidence of  heart

attacks  has decreased from 94 per 100,000 in 1990 to  88  in

1998,  our  death  rate  of  76 per 100,000  population  from

coronary heart disease is higher than the rates of 58 and  60

per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



100,000 in Canada and Australia respectively.  Similarly, our

death  rate of 29 per 100,000 from stroke is higher than  the

rate of 14 per 100,000 in both Canada and Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These diseases often strike people in the prime of their

life,  resulting in premature mortality or severe disability.

This  results  in both economic and social burden  for  their

family and the nation.  Fortunately, studies have shown  that

these conditions are preventable.  The lifestyle related risk

factors  of  these  diseases, such  as  physical  inactivity,

unhealthy  diet,  smoking, obesity, high blood  pressure  and

high blood cholesterol can be controlled.  Reduction of these

risk factors can improve the health of the individual and  of

the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must improve the health of our adult population by

focusing  our efforts on the areas that we are not  doing  so

well,  otherwise,  although Singaporeans are  living  longer,

their  quality of life in their autumn years may actually  be

quite  poor  due  to  ill  health.   Singaporeans  must  take

responsibility for their own health. They must adopt  healthy

lifestyles,  go  for  health  screening  to  detect   chronic

diseases early and if they have chronic diseases, they should

go  for treatment and regular follow-up.  Unless Singaporeans

take   health  education,  health  promotion  and  prevention

seriously,  many  Singaporeans will live the  last  years  of

their life burdened with ill health and disability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other areas of concerns, such as breast cancer

and  osteoporosis.  Breast cancer is the leading cancer among

women in Singapore today.  The incidence of breast cancer has

more  than  doubled over the last 30 years.   A  study  among

women  showed  that they are not well informed  about  breast

cancer  and  its  risks.   They  are  also  not  aware   that

mammography  is effective for the early detection  of  breast

cancer and for improving the survival rate. Again, much  more

needs to be done in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osteoporosis or brittle bones is a disease of old age.

It  is  associated  with higher risk  of  hip  fractures  and

results in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



significant  morbidity  and  mortality.   The  rate  of   hip

fractures has risen by 38% from 42 cases per 100,000 in  1990

to  58  cases per 100,000 in 1999.  With an aging population,

the  number of hip fractures is expected to increase,  giving

rise  to much ill health, disability and suffering.   As  the

build-up  of bone mass reaches its peak by about 30 years  of

age,  we need to ensure that measures to prevent osteoporosis

start from the young and continue throughout life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to embark on a more focused integrated and

concentrated approach to get the health outcomes we want. The

setting  up  of the Health Promotion Board will  provide  the

framework for a greater focus on these major health  problems

and  spearhead  health  education, promotion  and  prevention

programmes  and  create  a supportive environment  to  tackle

these  and other health problems in children, adults and  the

elderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Promotion Board will work in collaboration

with  public, private and community organisations to  develop

and  sustain national efforts to manage these problems.  This

building  of  close  partnerships  with  other  agencies  and

organisations will enable the Health Promotion Board to reach

out  to all Singaporeans in various settings and to reinforce

the messages in many different ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the Health Promotion Board will also

ensure   more   efficient  use  of  financial  and   manpower

resources,  and  strengthen the capacity  and  capability  to

develop,  implement, monitor and evaluate  these  programmes.

The  Board  will  focus on outcomes and  standards  and  will

provide the impetus to ensure that results, especially in the

problem areas, are achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not touch on the main features

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III, clause 11, sets out the functions, objects and

duties of the Board which are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to advise the Government on all matters connected

with the promotion of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



good  health  and  health lifestyles amongst  the  people  of

Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to organise and implement effective health

education  programmes and other activities  to  promote  good

health  and  healthy  lifestyles and to  prevent  and  detect

diseases;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to determine, establish and recommend standards and

guidelines on diet and nutrition to encourage healthy  eating

habits; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to provide medical, dental, health screening and

immunisation services to school children and other persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII, clause 42 of the Bill covers the consequential

amendments made to the Infectious Diseases and Dentists Acts,

portions  of which will now be administered by the  Board  on

behalf of the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the provisions in the Bill are the standard

provisions found in all statutory board Bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are facing new challenges in the pattern of

diseases in Singapore.  The formation of the Health Promotion

Board  will  enable  us  to  focus on  and  spearhead  health

education, health promotion and disease prevention programmes

to meet these challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

stand  to  support the Health Promotion Board  Bill.   It  is

timely  and significant indeed, if by setting up this  Health

Promotion  Board,  there can be more emphasis  put  into  the

promotion  of good health and healthy lifestyles amongst  the

people  of  Singapore, as stated in clause  11  of  the  Bill

regarding functions, objects and duties of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national healthcare expenditure, which formed about

2.7% of Singapore's GDP in 1996, had increased to 3.1% of GDP

in 1999.  This amounted to $4.4 billion or $1,370 per capita.

This amount is projected to increase to 7% of GDP in 2030



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



or about $10 billion.  Sir, the best remedy to reduce medical

healthcare  demands is to ensure that people  live  healthily

for  as  long as possible, through preventive means and  thus

requiring  less medical care.  It is thus vital to have  good

and   successful  promotion  of  good  health   and   healthy

lifestyles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 11(1)(d), there is mention to monitor and

conduct investigations and research. I would like to urge the

Minister  to ensure that the Health Promotion Board  urgently

concentrates on epidemiological studies of diseases that  are

most  pressing  and prevalent in our population  at  present.

For  example, apart from the commonest diseases, we also need

to  evaluate  and  recommend preventive measures  to  address

pneumonia,  which  is  the fourth major  cause  of  death  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another example is the incidence of falls amongst

our  elderly.  Falls amongst them not only can  be  fatal  at

times  but  they can invariably cause the elderly to  end  up

requiring  extensive  medical care.  Efforts  to  reduce  the

incidence  of  falls through having better campaigns,  better

information  on  how  to prevent falls  and  better  elderly-friendly environment are essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether there is a need to

mention  pro-active actions towards preventive care  in  this

Bill?   For example, now that the prevalence of breast cancer

is highest for cancers in women, as mentioned by the Minister

earlier,  it is essential to increase the screening of  women

to  prevent many of them from end-stage cancers.   Also,  the

problem of getting at those chronic-disease sufferers that do

not  go for long-term preventive medications that can prevent

disasters  like strokes, cardiovascular diseases  and  kidney

failures, must be addressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the constitution of the Board in clause 5, may I

ask  if  there is a need to specify the qualification of  the

members, and especially of the Chairman, as only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>

persons  with  a  medical  or other  professional  degree  is

eligible to be so appointed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4(1) provides that the common seal may be broken,

changed, altered or made anew as the Board thinks fit.   Sir,

if there are such possibilities, then one may have to include

a  subsection to the effect that all instruments affixed with

a broken, changed or altered common seal will nevertheless be

deemed  to  have  been validly executed  and  sealed  if  the

execution and seal are carried out and affixed in the  proper

manner as prescribed in this section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 9(4), does "majority of votes" mean 51% by

show  of  hands  of  members present?  What  happens  if  the

questions   to   be   decided  by   votes   involve   serious

consideration such as disposal of the Board's property or any

dealings  between members and the Board involving substantial

amounts  of money, etc?  Is there a need to provide  that  at

least  75% majority votes are required when a decision is  to

be made for such important or serious issues?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 covers the disclosure of interest of members.

In  clause 10(1), it appears that disclosure can only be made

"at  a  meeting of the Board".  What if there is  no  meeting

held  and  a  disclosure is needed to be made urgently?   Can

disclosure be made to the Board in writing when there  is  no

meeting?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 15(3), what if the Chief Executive is

incompetent or commits an offence that makes him/her unfit to

be  Chief  Executive?  This clause does not seem  to  include

these possibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 28, dealing with the powers of

the  auditors, gives the impression that the Ministry is very

concerned about financial matters and hence has given a  very

wide  power (with no limitation or restriction) to  auditors.

It  appears  that any such person may be required to  furnish

information, including confidential information, as  long  as

they  relate  to accounts or finances.  Sir, it is  submitted

that  some form of control or limitation must be included  to

prevent any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



abuse  of  power by auditors and some limits must be  set  on

documents  that may be accessed or copied by auditors  or  at

least the auditors may be required to exercise reasonableness

or   have  a  duty  to  keep  all  documents  or  information

confidential.  Although clause 39 deals with preservation  of

secrecy, it appears that clause 39 imposes duty only  on  the

member,  officer,  employee or an agent  of  the  Board,  and

auditors are intentionally excluded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 40 deals with the composition of offences. May I

ask  the  Minister why the Chief Executive may  compound  any

offence by collecting from a person "reasonably suspected of"

having  committed  the offence a sum of money  not  exceeding

$1,000?  Sir, why should a person who is merely a suspect  be

required  to  pay a composition fine?  It is hence  suggested

that these words "reasonably suspected of" be deleted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Health will take into

consideration  my  aforesaid comments.  Sir,  I  support  the

Health Promotion Board Bill.

<div align="center"><b>HEALTH PROMOTION BOARD BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I support the Bill in

principle.   I hope that this new Board can do a  better  job

than its five other predecessors, namely, the National Health

Education Department, Department of Nutrition, School  Health

Service,  School Dental Service and Health Promotion Division

(Administration).   The  functions  of  the  five   mentioned

departments,  I suppose, are basically also to  promote  good

health and healthy lifestyles among



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



the people of Singapore.  But they do not appear to have done

a  particularly  good job.  Take, for example,  the  campaign

against  smoking.  Smoking is something bad.  It causes  lung

cancer  and  increases  the chances of smokers  having  heart

problems.   Many  public policies have  been  implemented  to

reduce or eliminate smoking among Singaporeans.  Yet, we read

in  the  press  that smoking is on the rise among  our  young

Singaporeans, especially young female Singaporeans.   I  hope

that this newly-formed Health Promotion Board can do a better

job than its predecessors and reduce the number of smokers in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been promoting good health and

healthy  lifestyles  among Singaporeans for  many  years  but

somehow  major diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases,

diabetes  mellitus, have been on the rise.   Cancer  has  now

become the number one killer in Singapore.  It has edged  out

coronary heart disease to take the number one spot among  the

major  killer diseases.  Diabetes, although it is  the  sixth

leading  cause  of death in Singapore in 1999,  can  be  very

debilitating for those who suffer from it.  I hope the Health

Promotion  Board  can  promote better healthy  lifestyles  to

reduce   the   incidence  of  this  dreadful  disease   among

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, one of the main killers is coronary disease.

The  people there realise the seriousness of this problem and

have  taken steps to stop smoking and cut down on their  meat

diet  and  replace it with more vegetables.  Many  have  even

gone on to be vegetarians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the main killer is cancer. Cancer is a

diet-related  disease.  I should like to see  the  Government

allocate  more  funds  to  the  Health  Promotion  Board   to

investigate and do research on our local food to see if there

is  something in our food we eat which causes cancer  in  our

population,  for  example,  like monosodium  glutamate  (MSG)

which  is widely used as a cheap addictive by our restaurants

and hawkers to enhance the taste of their food.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I would like to see the Board do is to

give more dental aid not only to school children but also  to

adult  Singaporeans.  I see that there are  many  polyclinics

where  adult  Singaporeans can see a doctor at  a  subsidised

rate.    The  Government  should  do  the  same  for   dental

treatment.   At  the moment, there appears to be  not  enough

Government  dental clinics.  The waiting time  for  a  dental

appointment  at  a Government dental clinic  is  about  three

months.   I  think  this is too long.   A  worker  cannot  be

expected  to visit a private dentist because the charges  are

beyond  him.   As a result, I see too many Singaporeans  with

bad  teeth.   Without a reasonable availability of subsidised

dental  treatments,  we  shall  see  more  and  more  of  our

Singaporeans with bad teeth.  I hope that the Government  can

provide affordable dental treatments widely to our workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the  Bill.  Before that, I would like to  advise  Mr

Chiam  to inform the particular workers to go to NTUC  Dental

Care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1998, the National Trades Union Congress has taken

the  initiative  to work with companies to set  up  workplace

health programmes.  These programmes have two key objectives.

One is to help prevent workers from running into hardship  as

illnesses  can cost job losses and increase health  expenses.

Two,  it  helps companies save medical cost by keeping  their

workforce  healthy.  The companies' bottomline  will  improve

and  the workers get better wages.  The ultimate goal  is  to

ensure that our workers enjoy a better life with healthy body

and healthy mind.  We understand that health affects our work

performance,  earning  capacity and our  employability.   Job

creation, job security and good wages will be meaningless  if

the  workers  are unable to enjoy the benefits  due  to  poor

health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, as mentioned by the Minister, most deaths

in  Singapore were caused by infectious diseases.  Today,  it

is the lifestyle diseases that take the greatest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



toll  -  heart illnesses, cancer and stroke.  It is pertinent

that now all the tripartite social partners work more closely

to  help  our employees reduce the risk factors in developing

all these diseases and illnesses.  The National Health Survey

done  by the Ministry of Health in 1998 found that the  level

of  high  blood  cholesterol and high  blood  pressure  among

Singaporeans   has   increased.   The  survey   showed   that

hypertension  was  more common among the  elderly  workers  - 49.5%  of those aged between 50 and 59, that is half of  this

age group, and 64.3% for those aged 60 to 69.  It is alarming

because  hypertension increases kidney disease risk  and,  on

average,  a  person with high blood pressure is  seven  times

more  likely to suffer a stroke.  This means that  there  are

more than 655,000 stroke candidates here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is said that a good worker works

hard.  In today's workplace, our workers are working so  hard

that they have been taking their health for granted.  Company

policies  and  programmes at work to  improve  the  physical,

social  and  emotional well-being of employees  now  play  an

increasingly important role.  If health care costs go up, the

company's competitiveness will be adversely affected.   As  a

firm  believer of prevention is better than cure,  I  welcome

the  move by the Government to establish the Health Promotion

Board  (HPB)  as a statutory board to better promote  healthy

lifestyle  and  good health for all.  It is appropriate  that

the Government now intensifies its effort in health promotion

and   preventive  health  care.   Like  the   PSB   for   the

productivity movement, I hope the HPB will be a champion  for

good  health  for all and to provide more resources  to  help

improve  the  health  of  our workers  and  spare  them  from

unnecessary medical expenses.  Today, unlike the  babies  and

the   young   Singaporeans  who  are  students  or   national

servicemen,  our  working adults are  not  provided  with  or

subjected to any structured health programmes.  Our employers

at  the  same time also tend to be more concerned  about  the

cost  of  medical  treatments  only,  rather  than  proactive

programmes to improve their workers' health.  The idea  of  a

workplace



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



health promotion is still relatively new in Singapore and  it

has not yet taken root in the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to do more in this area to make

our   workers  healthier  and  happier.   We  have  no  other

alternative.  Our workforce, which is the world's number one,

is the nation's best asset we have.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank  the  three Members for their support of the  Bill.   I

think  we  are  all agreed that the intention of  the  Health

Promotion Board Bill is to provide the framework to encourage

Singaporeans to take better care of their health and this  is

the  approach  that  the  Board  will  undertake.   They  are

systematically looking at the 10 most common causes of  death

in  Singapore,  analyse each disease, try to understand  what

causes  the incidence of disease and then work out a strategy

to  try  and  bring down the incidence.  Take,  for  example,

cancer.   The incidence of cancer is indeed rising, primarily

due  to  two main reasons.  First, because our population  is

getting older and therefore many cancers related to an ageing

population are now on the rise.  Second, there are also  many

types  of cancer related to lifestyle that are more prevalent

now than 10 or 20 years ago.  So we are seeing a shift in the

pattern of diseases.  In particular, breast cancer is on  the

rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each of the cancer types, the Board would

devise  strategies to deal with them.  For breast cancer,  we

are going to set up mammography facility in every polyclinic.

But  the  key  is to get Singaporean women to go  for  breast

screening.   This requires both education, promotion  and  to

get  the women to act upon awareness, and not just know  that

breast  cancer  is  a  rising  disease  and  mammography   is

important, but, more importantly, to get them to act  and  go

for  the  screening.  Second, coronary diseases and diabetes.

These are related to lifestyle and therefore the messages  we

put  out to the children, the adults and the elderly are very

important.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diabetes is a condition that can be managed. What we

need is to screen the people, particularly, the elderly.   If

they know that they have a diabetic condition, they will take

active  steps  to manage this and mitigate the  complications

that may arise due to diabetes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also mentioned pneumonia. We are studying

this.  Also, the problem of elderly falling.  This is related

to  what I mentioned earlier about osteoporosis.  It  is  not

just  building up the bone mass when we are young,  but  also

taking part in exercises so that the bone structure continues

to be strengthened.  But, as Dr Lily Neo stressed, we need  a

more  holistic  approach to also make sure we  have  non-skid

floors  and less barriers in the design of our walkways.   So

HDB  will  undertake  all  these in  conjunction  with  other

agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong made the comment that he hopes that

the  Board  would do a better job, implying that the  current

departments are not doing a sufficiently good job.  The  idea

of  creating the Board is of course to do a better  job,  but

not  to  cast  a  judgement on the present departments.   The

present  departments are doing a commendable  job.   What  we

want  to  do with the Health Promotion Board is to make  sure

these  efforts  are  integrated  and  more  focused  on   the

children,  adults  and  elderly  in  different  settings,  in

schools, institutions, at the workplace and in the community.

By  putting  the five departments together and by integrating

the  efforts and by focusing on each disease, we hope  to  be

able  to achieve better outcomes based on the strategies  for

each disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dental health, I hope when Mr Chiam said that he saw

many  Singaporeans with bad teeth, he is not doing  so  in  a

professional   capacity.   Indeed,  the  dental   health   of

Singaporeans is improving.  We have statistics on  children's

dental  health status when they are seven, 13  and  19  years

old.  The number of cavities has reduced.   Therefore, we are

monitoring  very closely the dental health of our population.

Anecdotally, many dentists would tell you that  in  fact  the

volume of business has gone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



down  because  they  are seeing fewer and fewer  Singaporeans

with bad teeth.  The dental health of our population, by  and

large, is definitely improving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that we should do more in the campaign against

smoking.  But I must emphasise that smoking is addictive  and

the trick is to prevent the teenagers from taking up smoking.

Once  they  smoke and if they do so regularly in their  early

years,  then they will be addicted and they will  be  hooked.

We  are tracking the incidence of smoking.  By and large, the

incidence  of smoking in Singapore, as a whole, is  dropping.

But I do agree that the incidence for young females is rising

which is a cause for concern.  Therefore, one of the tasks of

the  Health  Promotion  Board is to target  the  anti-smoking

campaign  at  these vulnerable groups - the  younger  people,

including the younger females.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang emphasised about the importance of

health promotion among the workforce.  This is one of the new

strategies that we are embarking to promote workplace  health

promotion programme.  We recognise that the younger people in

schools  and institutions of higher learning provide us  with

an  institutional  setting for which we  can  conduct  health

promotion,  health education and prevention programmes.   But

once  they  go  into the workforce, there  is  less  of  this

directed  effort  at  the  workforce.   Therefore,  we   have

embarked  on  this  workplace health promotion  programme  to

bring  what  we  are  doing  in the  schools  also  to  every

workplace.  We are more successful in the community  than  in

the  workplace.   So  one  of the priorities  of  the  Health

Promotion Board is to direct their efforts at the workplace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the key issues that the Health Promotion

Board, when set up, will deal with.  Let me next turn to some

of  the  administrative provisions in the Bill which Dr  Lily

Neo  pointed  out.   These  are  standard  provisions.   But,

nonetheless, since she raised them, it is worth my  while  to

clarify  them.  First, on the qualification of the  board  of

directors.  We do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>



believe  that  we should restrict the board of  directors  to

just  medical  or  professional  people.   The  Board  should

encompass  a wide range of Singaporeans - those who  can  add

value  to the Board, whether they are educationists,  whether

they  are people from the media that can help us promote  and

deliver  the  messages - who can in fact  contribute  to  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the conduct of the Board, like most statutory

boards, the conduct would be based on the majority vote,  and

not  requiring 75% vote for serious issues.  I would like  to

assure  the  Member that for serious issues involving  larger

sums  of  money, the Board would comply with proper financial

procedures  which  would  require  approval  by   a   certain

committee  of  the  Board  as well as  the  approval  of  the

Ministry headquarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On disclosure of interests of members, this is a

standard  provision.   Most board members  meet  together  to

discuss  projects and papers, and that is a  convenient  time

for them to indicate their disclosure.  However, if there  is

a project or decision paper that is done through circulation,

then  the board members can indicate the disclosure of  their

interest through writing and circulation as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the powers of the auditor, again, this is a standard

provision.   The powers given to the auditor is necessary  to

make  sure  that they conduct effective audit of  the  Board.

The   auditor   would  be  appointed  by  the  Ministry,   in

consultation  with the Auditor-General.  On appointment,  the

auditor  or his representative would be required to  sign  an

undertaking   to   safeguard   official   information.     So

confidentiality will be safeguarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on the use of the Board's seal. This

is  a standard provision.  The provision allows the Board  to

have  a  seal to affix on to important documents and, if  the

Board wishes, it could break the seal, amend and create a new

seal.  I would like to assure Dr Lily Neo that even though  a

new seal may be created, any document that is sealed with the

old  seal  will continue to be valid as long as the  seal  is

applied in the correct manner by the Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also made the point about composition of

offences.    The  provision  to  compound  offences   is   an

administrative way in which we give the offender  the  option

to compound it by paying a composition fine.  If the offender

does  not  want  to  accept the composition,  then  the  full

process of the law would take its course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Dr Lily Neo that these are all the

standard  provisions  in setting up  a  statutory  board.   I

recognise  her concerns and these concerns are  duly  catered

for in the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I seek clarification, Sir? I would

like  to  clarify  that I did not ask for specific  types  of

qualified  people  in the medical board.  I  only  asked  for

their  qualifications,  be  it  medical  or  others,  to   be

specified  in  the  Bill.   The Minister  earlier  said  that

mammography  will  be made available to all  polyclinics.   I

would  like  to ask him whether this facility is  operational

now.   Could  I also ask the Minister whether representatives

from  the  other Ministries can be made available  with  this

Health  Promotion  Board  so  that  the  implementation   and

cooperation  can be got from other Ministries as  well?   And

earlier  in  my  speech, I also asked  for  proactive  action

regarding chronic cases.  Could he say something about  that,

please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not think it

is  necessary  for  us  to  set out  in  specific  terms  the

qualifications of the board members.  It is suffice  to  know

that we will select a Board with different members to look at

different  aspects and who will add value to the  Board.   We

will  include of course medical professionals, with  interest

in   the   things  that  we  are  doing.   We  will   include

educationists,  as  I said earlier, maybe media  people,  who

will  help us devise the promotion strategy.  We may  include

representatives  from  the various Ministries,  for  example,

someone from the Ministry of Education or maybe someone  from

the Sports Council would be also useful.  So we will look  at

all  the various possibilities and put together a Board  that

can lead the management.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On mammography facilities, we have started with two

polyclinics  and  our  intention is to  extend  this  to  all

polyclinics in due course.  This will happen by the middle or

third quarter of this year.  The polyclinics are now actively

undergoing  renovations  to be able  to  take  on  these  new

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On chronic cases, we have started the chronic care

management  programme some time last year so that people  who

suffer   from  chronic  diseases,  such  as  diabetes,   high

cholesterol,  or high blood pressure, can be managed  at  the

polyclinic level.  They will be given a package to help  them

monitor  as  well  as to go for regular consultations.   This

requires the people suffering from such chronic conditions to

take  an  active  interest  and to  manage  their  conditions

actively.  We are still in the early stages of the programme.

It  is  not  as  successful  as  we  like  it  to  be.   Some

Singaporeans  still take a fairly laid back attitude  towards

this,  for  example, towards diabetes.  They do  not  realise

that  diabetes  is a silent killer, even though  it  may  not

manifest  itself in very obvious symptoms.   If  you  do  not

manage  the  condition carefully, you will end up with  quite

serious consequences.  So this requires a lot of education as

well  as  active assistance to the people, to make sure  they

are able to manage their conditions well.  So it is an uphill

task and we will continue to plug at it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to establish a new statutory

board,  the  Health Sciences Authority, by  integrating  five

departments  of  the Ministry of Health, ie, the  Centre  for

Drug  Evaluation, Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine,

National  Pharmaceutical Administration,  Product  Regulation

Department and the Singapore Blood Transfusion Service.   The

proposed  Health Sciences Authority Bill is  to  provide  the

legislative framework for the formation of the new  statutory

board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five departments to be integrated provide a wide

range  of highly specialised health scientific expertise  and

services.    Our   departments  have  achieved   professional

excellence in many of these areas of expertise and have  been

accorded international recognition.  Our objective now is  to

build  on  the  technical synergies and keep abreast  of  the

rapid  developments  in  the  healthcare  and  life  sciences

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Pharmaceutical Administration (NPA) is

responsible for ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy  of

medicines and other health-related products in Singapore.  In

January this year, the NPA achieved international recognition

for  its  Good  Manufacturing Practice (GMP)  when  Singapore

became  the  first  Asian country to  be  accepted  into  the

Pharmaceutical    Inspection    Cooperation    Scheme,     an

international benchmark organisation for GMP based in Geneva.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Blood Transfusion Service (SBTS) is

responsible  for the safe and adequate supply  of  blood  and

blood   products  for  patients  in  Singapore.    SBTS   has

consistently  applied the latest state-of-the-art  technology

for  the  testing of blood for infectious diseases to  ensure

that  the risk of transmission is as low as possible, and  to

the standards of the best blood banks around the world.  SBTS

has achieved international recognition as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



WHO   Collaborating  Centre  in  Transfusion  Medicine  since

January 1992.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine comprises

the  Department of Forensic Medicine (DFM) and Department  of

Scientific  Services (DSS) which serve as national  reference

agencies  for forensic medicine, forensic science,  radiation

science  and statutory scientific services.  The standard  of

forensic  pathology expertise provided by our  Department  of

Forensic  Medicine  to  the police and  the  courts  for  the

investigation of death is well respected by the international

forensic fraternity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Forensic Science Division of the Department of

Scientific  Services  provides a  wide  range  of  scientific

expertise to the police for the investigation of crimes, such

as   trace   evidence   analysis,  DNA  profiling,   document

examination   and   toxicology.   The  Narcotics   Laboratory

supports the Central Narcotics Bureau in the investigation of

drug  offences under the Misuse of Drug Acts.  This  Division

has  achieved international recognition by being one  of  the

few non-US laboratories accredited by the American Society of

Crime  Laboratory  Directors since June  1996  and  was  also

awarded  the  Excellence for Singapore Award in August  1999.

The   Radiation   Science  Division  of  the  Department   of

Scientific  Services is the national authority  on  radiation

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the formation of the Health Sciences

Authority  (HSA)  will  build on our existing  strengths  and

achievements by enhancing the management



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



autonomy  and  scientific synergy of  the  five  departments.

Government  has recognised the need to ensure  the  continued

presence   of   a  strong  and  progressive  regulatory   and

scientific  agency to perform these essential functions.   In

an  era  of  rapid change in medical practice and  increasing

complexity of regulatory issues, the formation of  HSA  as  a

new  statutory  board  will allow more timely  and  effective

development,   harnessing  and  integration  of  professional

capabilities necessary to meet the challenges of the  future.

This  will  allow  Singapore  to  keep  pace  with  the  best

international  practices  and  to  be  world  class  in   our

regulatory and professional expertise in the Health Sciences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of HSA will result in a larger and

stronger   critical  core  of  medical,  pharmaceutical   and

scientific  expertise to provide the synergy for professional

and  regulatory  excellence.  Developments in the  biomedical

sciences, both internationally and locally, will lead to  the

discovery of novel health-care products that will require new

expertise  and systems to make good evaluations  before  they

can  be  used by patients.  The evaluation of a biotechnology

product  derived  from  genetically-engineered  human  blood,

tissue  or  cells,  and  delivered  by  special  miniaturised

devices will require close scientific interaction of a  range

of  professionals skilled in the evaluation  and  testing  of

drugs,  devices  and  blood products.   New  capabilities  in

molecular  biology,  genetics,  toxicology  and  pre-clinical

evaluation   will  have  to  be  developed.   Combining   the

professional  strengths  in HSA will  ensure  that  Singapore

continues  to  have a capable and credible regulatory  agency

that is able to rigorously evaluate and approve these new and

innovative products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of HSA will also result in a one-stop

regulatory  agency that will administer a seamless regulatory

process  for  all therapeutic products.  Convergence  in  the

application  of  medical technology has increasingly  blurred

the  boundaries  between  health-care  products.   There   is

already  a  trend  towards  products  that  combine  multiple

technologies, eg,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



medical  devices  that  also  release  drugs.   As  a  multi-disciplinary  agency, HSA will be able  to  deliver  a  well-coordinated  regulatory process efficiently and  effectively.

The medical and pharmaceutical industry will now only need to

interact with a single agency which will have the full  range

of  professional expertise necessary to evaluate and  approve

their therapeutic products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the key to HSA's success is

knowledgeable and well-trained professionals who are able  to

discharge  their  regulatory  and statutory  responsibilities

with  competence, integrity and commitment.  With the  growth

of the health-care and biomedical sectors in Singapore, there

will  be increasing competition for good doctors, pharmacists

and   scientists.   MOH  has  already  faced  difficulty   in

attracting  these  professionals into the highly  specialised

fields  of expertise in the five departments.  As a statutory

board,   HSA  will  now  have  greater  flexibility   to   be

competitive  so as to recruit and retain its  fair  share  of

professional  talent.   With  more  competitive   recruitment

policies, HSA will also be able to attract foreign talent  to

augment and enrich the local talent pool.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now highlight the main features

of the Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the Authority shall consist of a

Chairman  and six to ten other members as provided in  clause

5(1).  All members, including the Chairman, shall hold office

for such terms not exceeding three years, as specified in the

appointment by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main functions of the Authority as provided in

clause 11(1) are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to regulate the consumption and use of medicines,

cosmetics,  medical  devices, tobacco  products,  radioactive

materials,  irradiating  equipment and  other  health-related

products   in   Singapore   in  accordance   with   statutory

requirements;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to maintain a safe and adequate national blood

supply; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to provide professional, investigative and

analytical services in health sciences to the Government  and

to any other person or body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other features are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the staff in the five departments will be absorbed

into the service of the Authority on terms no less favourable

than  those  enjoyed  by  them  immediately  prior  to  their

transfer as provided in clause 31.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other parts of the Bill are similar to the Acts of

other statutory boards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the formation of the Health Sciences

Authority   as  a  new  statutory  board  will  establish   a

comprehensive and integrated regulatory and scientific agency

to  support the Health Sciences.  HSA will build a strong and

credible world-class professional capability to regulate  all

health-care  products  and to provide specialised  scientific

expertise to support essential statutory functions.   As  the

national regulatory agency, HSA will provide seamless service

to the health-care industry, and effectively safeguard public

confidence in the quality, safety and efficacy of all health-care  and  blood  products  in  Singapore.   HSA  will  forge

strategic  alliances and partnerships with other  world-class

regulatory and scientific agencies, such as those in the  US,

Europe  and Australia, to achieve global recognition  of  its

capability and expertise for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>HDB SHOP RETAILERS</b></div>



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to declare

that I am running a clinic from an HDB tenanted shop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retail sector in Singapore, like many other

small and medium enterprises (SMEs), is undergoing a dramatic

change.    High  operating  costs,  fierce  competition   and

dwindling  business  in  the  industry  are  threatening  the

survival  of  some 12,000 HDB shop retailers.  Their  growing

woes  and  difficulties  must be  heard  and  heeded  by  our

Government.  I wish to voice their call for help and  beseech

the  Government  to  extend a sympathetic  hand  with  rescue

measures for their survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rapid economic growth, more working women and

higher  education  levels  have  changed  the  lifestyle   of

Singaporeans  and  brought  about  big  changes  in  consumer

attitude and shopping preferences.  Many also prefer to cross

over and shop in Malaysia where goods are often cheaper. Such

new trends put a toll on the local retail trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our shoppers are more sophisticated and

discerning; placing more emphasis on better quality of goods,

wider   choice   of   goods  and  prices,   more   attractive

presentation and more pleasant shopping ambience.  There is a

marked  preference  for mega shopping centres  with  exciting

atmosphere and ambience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



Many  HDB shop retailers face stiff competition from the  big

chain  retailers  that can sell goods at  much  lower  prices

operating through economies of scale.  As in the case of many

SMEs,   challenges  faced  by  the  retailers  include   weak

entrepreneurial     culture,     insufficient      management

professionalism   and  know-how,  shortage  of   professional

technical manpower, insufficient use of technology, outmoded,

unproductive  methods of operation, limited  ability  to  tap

economies  of scale and small domestic market.   Thus,  these

SMEs  are  losing out to supermarket chains and big  shopping

malls  which offer one-stop shopping and appeal to the  young

with  their  up-market image.  Sir, as this trend  continues,

these  retailers  will find their clientele  shrink  year  by

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local SMEs employ 51% of our workforce. They make up

about  92%  of all business establishments here and  form  an

important  part of the Singapore economy.  At least,  90%  of

retail businesses in Singapore are SMEs and many of them  are

in  the HDB estates.  Sir, many SMEs have not recovered  from

the last economic crisis and most of them are not feeling the

benefits  of  the  high  economic  growth  reported  by   our

Government.   In  fact, they are facing more difficulties  as

they  have to pay increasing charges such as rental, property

tax,  service  and conservancy charges, utilities  bills  and

transport   costs.   Wages  for  workers   have   also   been

increasing.   SMEs with shallower pockets and thinner  profit

margins  find  it  hard  to  cope  with  the  restoration  of

employers' Central Provident Fund contributions.  In general,

SMEs  have cited the high costs of doing business here  as  a

serious problem and are extremely concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many retailers, especially those who have obtained their

shops  by  tender, lament the high rental and high prices  of

HDB  shops.   In the older estates, retailers are faced  with

the  declining  population with lower  disposable  income  as

younger  people  move  out, leaving the older  folks  behind.

Business had been deteriorating for many and the retailers do

not  have  enough business to make ends meet.  Shop retailers

have  to  operate long hours, often late into  the  night  to

attract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



customers.  Sir, many retailers fear that this situation will

worsen with a lower projected GDP growth for this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All told, these retailers declare that times are bad and

they  need help.  No doubt, they have to bite the bullet just

like everyone else in a free market enterprise.  But they  do

have  to  abide  by the HDB rules and regulations  and  these

rules  and  regulations  may be too restrictive  and  perhaps

inappropriate for these times.  I would like to suggest  that

our  Government, together will all relevant authorities, make

a  concerted  effort to help them.  Perhaps, we  should  look

into the following areas for a start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much can be done to help the small retailers become more

competitive  and  more  in sync with consumer  attitudes  and

shopping  preferences  of shoppers  today.   New  skills  and

management ideas can be taught and the Government can  be  of

assistance in this respect by providing:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training on aesthetics and presentation and on marketing

and   personalisation  of  services.   Instead  of   allowing

products  to be haphazardly laid out, retailers can be  shown

how  to  improve  layout and appearance  of  their  shops  to

attract   customers.    Instead  of  traditional   practices,

retailers  can be taught how to provide personalised  service

as  a  niche area by offering a familiar, friendly experience

to  the  neighbourhood  customers.   Their  training  courses

should  be tailored to suit them.  For instance, more courses

should  be  conducted  in Chinese to cater  to  the  Chinese-educated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conduit for bulk purchasing so that the retailers may

save  on costs.  The small retail shops may be encouraged  to

band  together  so  that they may improve  their  stores  and

enhance  shopping  experience.  A good example  of  how  this

banding  together can work can be seen at Chong Pang City  in

Yishun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer training to introduce these retailers to the

concept of e-commerce and trading through e-commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be useful if we can allow more flexibility of

the SME Financial Scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



and  allow  shopkeepers  to  have  repayment  of  loans  with

instalments  over  a longer period when times  are  bad.   In

terms of the restoration of employers' Central Provident Fund

contributions,  this  group feels  that  the  GDP  statistics

collated do not reflect accurately their performances.   They

propose  that the authorities collate and release  statistics

on a regular basis, in order to set them apart from the large

enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SME 21 is a 10-year strategic plan launched last year to

create  vibrant and resilient SMEs in the new economy.   Sir,

as  many  of  our  SMEs are not doing well,  I  do  urge  the

Government  to speed up implementation of SME  21  with  more

resources and with a sense of urgency to assist the SMEs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High property cost and rental have been cited as a major

factor for the many problems SMEs face.  Many say that rental

cost has become a tremendous burden to them due to their poor

business.   Retailers who rent HDB shops  have  asked  for  a

reduction  in  rental  and  some  have  suggested  a  minimum

reduction of 20%. Those who paid property tax have also asked

for  a further extension of the 25% property tax rebate.   It

has  been suggested that, just as hawkers are compensated for

giving  up  their  stalls, those who wish to  retire  or  are

affected  by  redevelopment should also  be  compensated  for

giving up their leases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Sale of Tenanted Shops (SOTS) Scheme, launched in

1992  and  discontinued in 1998, some  8,000  of  the  10,000

eligible  shops were offered for sale to the sitting tenants.

Many  shopowners were encouraged to buy their units from  HDB

and  they now face large amounts in monthly repayments.  This

is  especially  so for the shopowners who have  bought  their

shops  in 1995 and 1996; some of them have as much as  $8,000

per  month in repayment of their loans.  The businessmen  who

bought  the  99-year  leasehold properties  have  very  heavy

burdens  in lieu of high monthly repayments.  They are  in  a

dilemma because the market is extremely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



weak  and  they  cannot afford to sell their properties  when

market prices are so low.  It is very sad indeed to hear that

some  of  them  are barely able to cling on  to  such  a  bad

predicament and can see no foreseeable respite.  Sir, some of

them mortgage their own homes to stay afloat and it is only a

matter  of time before they lose their homes as well.   These

people are hoping that their businesses will improve.   Alas,

I  fear  that  they  are hoping against  hope  under  present

circumstances.   In  the past, when the property  market  was

buoyant,  they could take solace and comfort on the assurance

of  having  valuable assets in their properties.   Those  who

have  purchased their shops from HDB now face a double whammy

of poor business and poor property prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be done here? I would like to echo their

requests.  Most people agree that HDB must have some sort  of

planning   and   control  to  ensure  that  no   overwhelming

duplication  of  similar  businesses  occurs  in  one   area.

Granted  that such an occurrence is detrimental for  one  and

all,  they  would like HDB to allow more flexibility  in  the

conduct of their businesses as in:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing splitting of the shops into smaller shops to co-exist with other types of businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granting "change of use" of their shops and allowing

them  to be converted into offices or wholesale shops  either

temporarily or permanently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resettling some retailers to other places that have

better need of their kind of trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relocating shops in poor locations and poor market

conditions to better business areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the option of selling their shops back to HDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I urge HDB to review the planning of HDB shops

spaces.   In view of the present trend towards mega  shopping

malls  and  supermarkets,  there is  a  need  to  reduce  and

restructure  the HDB shops, not only in terms of  new  supply

but also in consideration of existing ones.  Perhaps,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



HDB  can improve on the defining terms concerning the variety

of  trade  mix.    Poor distribution of trades  and  services

seems  to  be  a  common  problem in  the  town  centres  and

neighbourhood centres.  A survey of the retail outlets in the

town centres of Bedok, Clementi and Toa Payoh showed that the

predominant   trades   are  personal  items   (shoes,   bags,

accessories), clothing and miscellaneous retailing.  For  the

neighbourhood  centres,  the survey conducted  in  the  Bedok

neighbourhood   showed  that  the  predominant   trades   are

provision  shops and personal services such as  barber  shops

and  hairdressing salons.  There is insufficient  variety  of

trades  and  the choice of goods and services is  limited  in

most HDB town centres and neighbourhood centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB shops can be regrouped to form "commercial streets"

of distinctive features to be in a better position to compete

with  giant  shops.  Representatives for retailers  like  the

Merchants'   Association   and   the   Singapore   Retailers'

Association can work with the Government to bring this about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town councils can help by improving the physical

infrastructure in the business neighbourhood.  Town  councils

must  help  by injecting life into the business neighbourhood

to   attract  the  shopping  crowd.   There  should  be  more

effective  use  of  festivals,  eg,  Mid-Autumn  Festival  to

attract  residents  into  the  shopping  areas.   Shopkeepers

should  be  encouraged to join the Business Liaison Committee

of  the  Town  Councils to address their  concerns.   Liberal

approval  for pasar malams at HDB estates should  be  weighed

against the impact on the neighbourhood retail businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry announced the Retail

Sector  Development Plan (RSDP) in March  1992.   This  is  a

comprehensive plan to give the small retailers  a  chance  to

survive  in  this competitive environment.  This  plan,  Sir,

should  be  extended  and carried on in  a  faster  and  more

organised  fashion.  It should be undertaken  in  partnership

with  all  concerned.  The sheer size of the sector  and  the

complexity of the task require



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



close and ongoing consultation and collaboration between  the

public and private sectors, and between the planners and  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the solution to the problems of the SMEs,

especially the HDB retailers, is in restructuring  that  will

collectively  improve  them and keep  them  relevant  to  the

present  trends and lifestyles of consumers.  This needs  the

efforts  of  SMEs, private associations or organisations  and

Government  to work hand in hand.  The majority of  our  SMEs

are  not  doing well in spite of a double digit  growth  last

year.   Their  prospects are not rosy and  they  require  the

concerted  efforts of all concerned to help  them  keep  pace

with  the  rest of the economy.   Their transformation  needs

time and a lot of effort for fruition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beseech our Government to prioritise this matter

and,  in the interim, lessen their pain with immediate rescue

measures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Lily Neo has

articulated   very  clearly  and  very  comprehensively   the

concerns  of HDB shopkeepers.  She has analysed the  problems

they  face  and  offered  several suggestions  to  help  them

overcome these problems.  Over the last few months,  we  have

also  heard similar feedback from many Members of Parliament,

from  grassroots  leaders  as well as  from  participants  of

feedback sessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the

House  that  the  Government  recognises  the  role  and  the

contribution  of our HDB shopkeepers.  We share  the  concern

that  they  are not doing well and we will look into  various

measures to help them.  We will have to be guided by  certain

principles,  and one of the principles must be that  we  must

enhance the viability of the HDB retail sector on a long-term

sustainable  basis,  and  not just go  for  short-term  quick

fixes.   We  will also be mindful that HDB shopkeepers,  like

other  businesses,  must  be  encouraged  to  adhere  to  the

fundamentals of business; in other words, serving  the  needs

of   their  customers,  offering  value-for-money  goods  and

services, taking risks and being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



rewarded based on the decisions they make and the risks  that

they  take.  In the final analysis, while Government can help

to  improve their operating environment, it cannot  guarantee

their viability, survival or profitability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I comment on the various suggestions made by Dr

Lily  Neo,  allow  me to recollect the role  played  by  many

shopkeepers in our nation building.  Members will recall that

in  our early years of independence, many old shophouses were

resettled  in  HDB  estates to make  way  for  roads,  flats,

factories,   schools  and  so  on.   Government   helped   by

subsidising their rentals and the shopkeepers in turn  helped

to  keep  the cost of living affordable for HDB residents  by

passing on the benefits of these subsidised rentals to  their

customers.   In  this  process,  they  helped  to  hold  down

inflation  at a time when many Singaporeans were trying  very

hard to make ends meet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are still about 2,000 first-generation

shopkeepers; in other words, those who were relocated in  the

early  years,  but  still  plying their  trades  in  the  HDB

estates.   Many  of them are now elderly and  we  should  not

forget  the  contributions they have made and overlook  them,

even as the rest of the country enjoys the fruits of economic

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, in her diagnosis of the ills facing the

shopkeepers,  pointed  out that changing  lifestyles   -   in

other   words,   more   working  women,  more   sophisticated

shopkeepers,  more  competition, easy travel,  globalisation,

etc   -  all  these have affected the traditional  retailers.

This  is  true.   But I believe that HDB neighbourhood  shops

will  continue  to  play an important role in  servicing  the

needs  of  HDB heartlanders.  There will always be  residents

who,  for  one  reason or another, whether it is convenience,

familiarity or simply good value for money, still  prefer  to

patronise these shops, rather than big shopping malls or mega

marts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still recall the friendly neighbourhood shopkeeper

that  I used to go to as a child in Kim Keat Avenue.   I  can

still  remember the name and the owner of that shop.  It  was

called  Ban  Heng.  It is no longer there.   But  many  years

later,  when  I  went  back  to the  shop  after  my  studies

overseas,  the shopkeeper still remembered me and  remembered

the  things that I used to buy from her shop.  And I was very

impressed  and  very touched.  I think that is  the  kind  of

friendly,  familiar, personalised service that  Dr  Lily  Neo

talked  about,  that is still able to retain the  loyalty  of

customers,  even in today's world of mega marts and  shopping

malls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I think many of us in our visits to hawker

centres,  neigbourhood shopping centres and so on  will  have

come across many residents or ex-residents who have moved out

of  the  estate  but who still come back to the neighbourhood

shopping  centre,  or to the neighbourhood  eating  shops  or

coffee  houses, just to come back and eat at their  favourite

stall.   So these shops and eating houses are part and parcel

of  our social landscape.  They contribute in some small  but

significant way and manner towards our collective  memory  of

what it means to be Singaporeans.  And I believe we should do

what we can to retain them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on some of the Member's suggestions.

An   underlying  principle  of  the  Government's  assistance

programme for HDB retailers is to encourage them to  upgrade,

so   that   they   can  keep  pace  with  the   fast-changing

environment.   In other words, we will help  those  who  help

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has made several good suggestions in the

same  vein.  For example, provide training to enable HDB shop

retailers  to  improve  their  marketing,  presentation   and

merchandising  skills.  That is a very  good  idea.   And  we

should  work  towards encouraging more of these  shopkeepers,

not  to assume that they know what is happening already,  but

to  try and keep up to date with the various trends and  with

the changing lifestyles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also suggested that we should provide a means for

them  to avail themselves of things like bulk purchasing;  in

other words, to enjoy economies of scale.  Again, this  is  a

good   suggestion  and  we  will  certainly   consider   this

suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested that HDB shops band together

to form what are called "commercial streets" with distinctive

features.  I understand that there are certain areas  in  the

HDB estates which have already undergone this transformation,

places  like  Marine  Parade Town Centre,  Chong  Pang  City,

Tampines   N2   Shopping  Street,  Toa  Payoh  Town   Centre.

Shopkeepers  in these areas have got together with  the  town

councils  and  they have made improvements to the  pedestrian

malls,  shopping areas and, as a result, their  business  has

improved and their customers have not only been retained  but

they  have  been able to attract new customers.  This  is  an

idea that I would also endorse and we should find some way to

encourage more of these developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member's concern on rental cost and

prices  of  HDB  shops, I would like to point  out  that  the

16,000  HDB shop lessees and tenants today are still enjoying

rental and property tax rebates which we introduced in  1998.

The  property tax rebates have been extended to June of  this

year  at  a reduced rate of 25%.  Likewise, the HDB has  kept

its  rental  rebates till the end of this year  at  half  the

original  quantum.  The Government will review these  rebates

before their expiry, whether it is in June or December.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's request to give HDB shop retailers more

flexibility  in the conduct of their business, HDB  tells  me

that it currently grants approval on a case-by-case basis.  I

will  ask the HDB to consider being more flexible in granting

approval for change of trade, except in cases that can  cause

disturbance to residents.  One example would be conversion to

an   eating  shop.   HDB  will  also  consider  the  Member's

suggestion to facilitate exit of rental tenants who  wish  to

retire or who are affected by redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to add that the

Retail  21  Committee,  which is  chaired  by  the  Singapore

Productivity and Standards Board, and which comprises members

from  the HDB and other public and private agencies, will  be

releasing  its 10-year strategic plan for the overall  retail

sector very soon.  HDB is also looking into specific ways  to

help HDB shopkeepers enhance their competitiveness.  Sir,  it

is  in  our collective interest to ensure that the HDB retail

sector  remains  viable  and  sustainable,  so  that  it  can

continue to provide good service to HDB residents.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Prime Minister (a) how is

the  search  for members of statutory boards  and  boards  of

Government-linked Companies (GLCs) conducted;  (b)  what  are

the  criteria and guidelines for the selection of these board

members; and (c) what are the numbers of men and of women  on

these boards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statutory board or GLC, in consultation with their

respective   parent  Ministry  or  holding   company,   first

identifies   their  requirements  and  the  broad   selection

criteria  for  Board  members.  Based  upon  this,  potential

candidates from both the private and public sectors are  then

identified  and approached.  For public officers,  inputs  of

the Public Service Division (PSD) are sought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria used for searching for members of statutory

boards  and  GLCs  are  determined  by  the  vision  of   the

organisation, the nature of business, and the leadership role

demanded  from  the Board.  Potential nominees  are  selected

based  upon  their relevant knowledge and skills,  and  their

ability  to  contribute.  In addition, we take  into  account

other  factors,  for  example,  ensuring  that  there  is  no

conflict of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry concerned, or the GLC or its holding

company,  as  the case may be, also seeks to achieve  a  fair

representation  of  candidates from the  public  and  private

sectors,  as  well  as  ensure that the  interests  of  major

shareholder are adequately represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 15th February 2001, there are a total of 2,175

directorship  positions  on GLCs (including  statutory  board

companies), of which 176 (8%) positions are held  by  females

while  1999  (92%)  positions are  held  by  males.   As  for

statutory boards, there are 666 board positions, of which  54

(8%) are held by females while 612 (92%) are held by males.
