<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D8 be reduced by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D8-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, yesterday I said that the Government,  in

the implementation of its policy on the acquisition  of

land, should pay attention to the livelihood of farmers

and   people  living  in  the  rural  areas.   In   the

implementation of its schemes and plans, the Government

should  not  treat  the people concerned  unfavourably.

According  to  the policy of the Government,  the  land

allocated   to  farmers  is  not  sufficient.   To   my

knowledge,  one family can only get one  acre  of  land

from  the  Government. I can say for sure  that  it  is

impossible for a family to make a living from one  acre

of  land. Where can the labourers then go? We know that

a  serious situation has arisen in Singapore today. All

these redundant farmers and labour hands will move into

the  city,  thus aggravating the unemployment  problem.

Therefore, in the implementation of its policy  on  the

acquisition  of land and the resettlement  of  farmers,

the  Government should pay attention to the  livelihood

of the farmers and rural dwellers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I hope the Government will reconsider the

payment  of the rate of compensation. Furthermore,  the

Government  should give sufficient land to the  farmers

to enable them to make a living.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

just  a  few questions to ask of the Minister concerned

regarding  resettlement. Could he tell us  where  these

resettlement schemes are and for whom?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that the Master Plan will

be  revised  and made public very soon. Those  who  are

interested in development would like to know  when  the

Master Plan will be made public so that they could plan

ahead. Also, when will the Agricultural Leases Bill  be

out?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we understand Singapore

is  suffering  from an acute shortage of land,  but  we

should  not ignore questions relating to the well-being

of  the  people. I think this matter should be  quickly

resolved. It is imperative that it should be  given  due

consideration,  because  we  are  short  of  land.  One

important  question concerns land on this island  which

belongs to the Services and which is not put to use  at

the  moment.  I think the question arises  whether  the

Government  should  acquire such land  for  development

purposes. For instance, there are many vacant pieces of

land  in  Blakang Mati. Applications have been received

from  Pulau Brani, which has no more vacant  land,  for

the  erection  of  dwelling-houses on Blakang  Mati.  I

wonder  whether  it is possible to  make  use  of  land

belonging  to  the  Services in Blakang  Mati  for  the

erection of dwelling-houses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should also give consideration to

applications  for  sites  on  State  land.  It  is  not

sufficient for the department concerned to give a reply

merely  acknowledging receipt of the application saying

that   it  is  being  considered.  This  is  not   very

satisfactory. If an application cannot be  entertained,

the  reply should be positive and it should state  that

the  application  cannot be  considered.  The  applicant

should not be kept in suspense all the time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every

year millions of dollars are being spent on land

acquisition by the Government and yet land hungry

farmers still face the problem of a great shortage of

land. As far as I know, the Government itself has not

much land to distribute to the farmers and the

unemployed who want land.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> On a point of

elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It might be of some interest,

because  this is the first time I have heard  that  the

unemployed want land in Singapore. If it is so, then  I

will look into the matter. It is something new to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, apparently the

Prime Minister is out of touch with reality. When I was

the Minister for National Development -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Did you give land to the

unemployed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Because there was no land to give.

Often  there are unemployed people who ask for a  piece

of  land  so  that  they  can  rear  chickens  or  grow

vegetables to tide over their difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Government is faced with a shortage of

land.  Every  year  it spends millions  of  dollars  to

acquire land from big landlords and other people. It is

high  time to revise our thinking on the land  question

in  Singapore. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  a  place  like

Singapore,  where  land  shortage  is  acute  and   the

population is growing, this question requires that  the

thinking   of   the  present  Government   leaders   be

reorientated.  At  present, in  my  opinion,  the  most

profitable  business is land speculation.  So  long  as

land  speculation is profitable, much  of  the  capital

which    would   otherwise   go   into   commerce    or

industrialisation would go into land speculation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we antagonise a small section of

the   big  landlord  class,  that  is,  the  big   land

speculators,  they  are  very few  in  number.  If  the

Government  is  not prepared to antagonise  them,  land

will never be released. My view is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>



the  Government must acquire all lands which  are  held

for speculative purposes and pay for them in bonds.  We

must  achieve  our  ultimate goal of security  of  land

tenure for all those persons who cultivate the land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from what I know, when a farmer is

given  security of land tenure, the yield goes  up.  He

looks after the land. It is better for the country  and

in  the long-term interests of the land itself. We  can

pay  these  land  speculators in bonds  which  will  be

payable  in 30 or 40 years' time, and we can sell  land

to  the  farmers on an instalment basis, as  in  Japan,

Pakistan and other places, or we can sell it outright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in other countries where Right-wing

governments are in control, like Japan even during  the

MacArthur  regime,  there are  more  far-reaching  land

reforms  than  this so-called socialist  Government  of

Singapore.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, land speculators are a different

class  from  the industrialists. We want  to  and  must

protect  the  industrialists. We want to  protect  .the

people in commerce. But land speculators are parasites;

they  do  nothing but just speculate  in  land,  as  it

provides  a  bigger  return than if they  invest  their

capital  in  factories or in business concerns.  It  is

high   time   the  Government  did  not  protect   land

speculators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides this land problem, I shall also discuss

the   treatment   of  tenants  on  land   acquired   by

Government. Recently we have trouble in the  Toa  Payoh

scheme. Sir, this, I feel, is due to mishandling by the

Government.  We  also had, in 1959, a  resettlement  of

tenants in places like the Aljunied housing scheme  and

the  Tiong  Bahru housing scheme, where we  managed  to

resettle  them with the least difficulty and  with  co-operation  from the squatters there. But the Toa  Payoh

scheme   is  the  first  scheme  this  present   P.A.P.

leadership is confronted with. We see difficulties  and

heart-burning on all sides. If we are humanitarian  and

try  to  understand the problems of the squatters,  for

instance, under the Toa Payoh scheme, we will be better

able to deal with the situation. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>



far  as  I know, there is no need to resettle  all  the

squatters  at one time under the Toa Payoh scheme.  The

squatters can be resettled in little batches at a time.

We  must  convince them that they can come forward  for

negotiations so that we can settle any difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have always been told that the

Master  Plan  is to be revised. From the  progress  the

Government is showing, I think the Master Plan will not

be  revised unless and until this Government  collapses

and a new government takes over.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is there a reply from the ministerial

bench?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Perhaps a reply will be given in

one elucidation to all the points raised.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Prime Minister thinks he has the

time.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not wish to talk at great

length  on  this  amendment.  I  merely  wish  to   get

clarification from the Minister concerned on one or two

matters in respect of land, including the area of which

I  am  the  representative, that is to say,  the  Malay

Settlement at Jalan Eunos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to appeal to the

Government  to  enlarge the Malay settlement  areas.  I

think  it  is  a  necessity which the  Government  must

undertake.  But what I want is a definite assurance  in

this Assembly - according to the reply given by the Prime

Minister  in the past - that there is a possibility  that

allocation of sites will be completed during the course

of  this year. However, I hope the allocation of vacant

sites in Malay settlements could be expedited not  only

at Kaki Bukit but also at Ayer Gemuroh and Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to draw the attention of the

Government to is the method of getting State land.  For

instance,   those   applicants  who   submitted   their

applications during the time of the previous Government

paid  $25  as  deposit. Because these  applicants  were

illiterate, they had complete trust in the staff of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>



the  department.  In the case of my  father-in-law,  it

happened that he paid $25 without a receipt being given

for it. Until today it is not possible for him to get a

refund of $25. This is a matter which I think should be

investigated  by  the Government. If this  practice  is

allowed to go unchecked, the people will suffer.  So  I

hope a Commission of Inquiry will be instituted to look

into the real position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, briefly, is all, Mr Speaker. I hope I will get

a satisfactory explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, regarding the effects of acquisition  of

land by the Government, I wish to draw the attention of

the Government to the following points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is about the question of rental of land

which is requisitioned by the Government. When the land

is taken over by the Government, the rental of the land

is increased. In some cases, it is increased by 100 per

cent,  and  in  a  certain case a  $2-rental  has  been

increased to $20. Attap-dwellers are very poor, and  it

is not proper to increase land rentals once the land is

bought by the Government. I want to cite two examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lim Chu Kang and in certain areas like Toa Payoh,

after  the land has been bought by the Government, the

land  rental  is  increased. After the  land  has  been

requisitioned by the Government, the livelihood of  the

people  there  is  affected adversely  because  of  the

increase  of  rental. Therefore, I hope the  Government

will  consider  the  livelihood of  the  rural  people,

especially the attap-dwellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that after a piece of land has been

requisitioned by the Government it wants to develop it.

I  believe  that after the land in Toa Payoh  has  been

requisitioned, that place is intended to  be  developed

into a satellite town. The people in those areas do not

object  to  this plan in principle, but the  Government

has  not given full consideration to the livelihood  of

the   people  living  there.  The  Government  has  not

considered the loss of properties incurred as a  result

of the development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>



of  that area. The people in those areas are faced with

this  problem. Therefore, I hope the Minister concerned

will give full consideration to their problems and hear

their opinions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two organisations which can reflect the

views  of  the  people.  One is  the  Country  People's

Association,  and  the  other is  the  Rural  Dwellers'

Association. The Government should consider their views

because  they represent the people living in the  rural

areas.  Therefore, I hope the Minister  concerned  will

pay close attention to their views.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. is a realistic

Government,   hence   it  cannot  simply   accept   the

suggestion  by the hon. Member for Geylang  Serai  that

the  Government should buy up the land at Geylang Serai

and  then allocate it to the existing squatters. To  do

so,  Sir, would just mean the transfer of public  funds

into  the pockets of wealthy land-owners, in this  case

Alsagoff.  There  will  be  a  hue  and  cry  from  the

squatters too, as we are ,now experiencing in Toa Payoh

where  the  tenants have for years paid  little  or  no

rent,  because the landowners were not able to  collect

them.    Now   that   it   is   under   proper   public

administration,  those  who  are  asked  to  pay   rent

according   to   the  area  occupied   have   expressed

dissatisfaction. The Barisan Sosialis politicians  have

tried  to  make political capital out of this situation

by  fomenting trouble because the Government  is  doing

its  duty of administering public property in a  proper

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After balancing all factors which include taking into

account  the existing squatters' conditions, Government

will only purchase land if there is a bigger proportion

available  for resettlement purposes than for  existing

squatters. Resettlement has quite a different objective

from that of buying land from private owners and giving

it to existing settlers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of resettlement, the Member for

Choa Chu Kang, as well as the Member for Toa Payoh, has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>



made  allegations about the rates of compensation.  The

Member   for   Choa  Chu  Kang  especially   has   made

allegations  that  the rates of compensation  have  not

been  amended  but have remained the same  since  1957.

Sir, I must point out that he has his facts wrong.  The

rates  were amended on many occasions as and  when  the

resettlement  department gathered more  experience  and

adapted  the  needs  to  suit  the  circumstances  that

confronted  the department. Members will note  that  on

page  9  of  the  Report  of  the  Land  Clearance  and

Resettlement  Party, there is an amendment  slip  which

amends  the  existing Scheme "C" to provide  for  house

owners  and  sub-tenants. This amendment was introduced

on   1st  December,  1960.  There  is  also  a  further

amendment  slip  attached to page 15  where  the  whole

original scheme recommended was deleted and replaced by

a cyclostyled sheet.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items as amended are indicated in the footnote of

page 2 of this sheet and the date of the amendment  for

item  (g)  is 8th October, 1959, and item (h)  in  July

1960.  I am also to say that a special scheme has  been

devised   to   give   an  additional   house   exchange

alternative  to apply particularly to house  owners  in

the  Toa  Payoh  area. Sir, in this case,  the  Housing

Board  has  bought  a piece of land in  Kim  Keat  Road

adjacent  to  the Toa Payoh area, whereby  the  Housing

Board  will  be  erecting houses  for  the  purpose  of

exchanging  with those families who are not farmers  in

the  Toa Payoh area. Sir, to say that this resettlement

scheme  had  been the same ever since it was introduced

in  1957 is, therefore, wrong, and indeed, intended  to

mislead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang also suggested that

the  development  projects  were  held  up  because  of

resettlement difficulties. I quite agree with him, Sir.

I can point a finger at the Barisan Sosialis for making

things that way. While rendering lip service in support

of  the  Government's development plan for the  general

good of the vast majority of the people, the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis  have gone out of their way to foment  trouble

among  those affected by resettlement in order to  stir

up  the resistance of the settlers. They have tried  to

obstruct  and frustrate Government's development  plans

by  telling the settlers that they should not move out

but  should make demands for more compensation. In this

way,  the resettlement problems stagnate into long long

drawn  out  negotiations and thus development  projects

are being delayed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the Member for Choa Chu Kang now

demands that attap-huts should be compensated at $3 per

square foot as against the present $1 per square  foot,

which has been acceptable for thousands of cases.  Sir,

I  would like the House to note the tactics adopted  by

those  people who oppose the Government. For  instance,

the  Member for Toa Payoh, whilst he was in the P.A.P.,

suggested  that  one-fifth should be a reasonable  sum,

but  he  did  not  press for it. Now,  of  course,  the

Barisan  pays $3 per square foot, which is three  times

that  of the rate the Government pays. Then there  were

suggestions  made by the representatives of  the  Rural

Residents   Association.  This  Association   suggested

$2.30. There is another association, called the Country

People's  Association, which demands $2.50.  These  are

the  tactics which are used by people who are  opposing

the  Government now to raise fantastic demands so  that

the  development  projects could be  delayed  by  their

agitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see that there is no sincerity in all

these  proposals to solve the squatter  problems.  What

these  people  want is to play to the  gallery  and  to

demonstrate to the farmers how clever, or shall I  say,

how unreasonable they are in that they can make so many

demands.   But  the  farmers  are  mostly   responsible

citizens.  I am told that in Toa Payoh now,  where  the

first stage of development is going to take place,  out

of  the  19  families, several of these  families  have

already  moved out on their own, accepting  the  scheme

that is offered by the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Bulim area, for instance, this subject

was brought up by the Member for Choa Chu Kang. In this

estate  there are more than 200 acres of land  acquired

by  the  Government for resettlement purposes. On  this

land, there are 20 to 30 genuine settlers who have been

there for some time. Some of them have cultivated small

plots,  and  others  have, without authority,  extended

their  cultivation to cover large tracts of land  after

the Government has acquired the land. When it was known

that   Government   was  taking   over,   people   from

neighbouring areas encroached on this resettlement area

and  illegally  moved  into  it.  There  are  thus  two

categories of people, and not just one category, as the

Member for Choa Chu Kang would like us to believe. Some

of   these   cases  of  encroachment  have  been   most

vociferous    and,   through   the   Rural    Residents

Association,   have  demanded  that  they   should   be

compensated at fantastic rates or given large plots  of

land for themselves. I have personally looked into this

matter, and I am satisfied that where the settlers  are

genuine cases, and not those opportunists who tried  to

encroach,  a  sufficient plot  of  land,  depending  on

fertility  but up to two acres each, will be  permitted

to the existing farmers. The remainder of the land will

be  divided into lots for resettlement purposes.  Those

who are not farmers but who have huts and have actually

been  living  there for some time will  be  allowed  to

retain  their  huts with their surrounding  land  area,

between  6,000  and 8,000 square feet, these  are  fair

adjustments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang was talking

absolute  rubbish when he tried to make out a  case  of

legality.  If the squatters had any legal  status,  the

Government  would  be prepared to purchase  their  land

from them. It is because they have no legal status  and

because  the Government is generous enough  not  to  go

through  the  normal process of law  that  the  present

scheme  for ex-gratia payment of compensation has  been

devised. In the case of Bulim Estate, Sir, the  genuine

farmers will, be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>



allotted  their  farm lots and the genuine  non-farmers

will be allotted their house lots as stated above.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I just wish to add a few

words to what the Minister for National Development has

said.  It is his Ministry that is primarily responsible

for  resettlement  and rehousing.  My  Ministry,  which

includes  the Land Office, is primarily concerned  with

the   purchase  and  acquisition  of  land  for  public

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Master Plan. Sir, I do not expect the

Master  Plan, and the complete revision of  it,  to  be

completed anywhere before the next 15 months. It  is  a

matter of some importance, when an exercise of so  far-reaching  a  nature is being conducted, that  not  only

must all interests be carefully balanced, but also that

the  full  implications of the competition between  the

high  density  demanded by the Housing Board  and  more

land   demanded  by  the  Finance  Ministry's  Economic

Development  Division, should be  weighed  against  the

long-term interest of reasonable planning in  an  over-crowded island like Singapore. Members will recall that

there was a question of who the Chief Planner is to be.

It  is because some considerable importance is attached

to  the  duties of the Chief Planner, who will have  to

help  complete the revision of the Master Plan, that  I

say  it is not likely to be completed at an early date.

First  we  have  to  find  somebody  who  is  not  only

theoretically qualified as a Planner of competence, but

who   has  had  experience  of  tropical  architectural

conditions. What I can assure the Member for Tanglin is

that nobody is being held up in the present development

because  of the Master Plan. The Master Plan is  there.

From time to time minor adjustments and amendments  are

being  made to it to fit in with industrial development

and  other housing development. But to give the  Member

an  instance.  A revision was made to the  Tanjong  Rhu

industrial  site, a belt that runs somewhere  from  the

Singapore Swimming Club right up to the end of  Tanjong

Rhu.  Because  of  the slowness of development  in  the

Jurong site in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>



laying  out water and electricity services, we  decided

that  here  was  an  area which  could  assist  in  the

immediate demand for suitable industrial sites  with  a

water  frontage. The planners were satisfied.  So  were

the Land Oflice. And the land is now being reclassified

for  industrial uses. At the same time, because Kallang

Park has proved to be a little bit of a white elephant,

because  there  is not such a density of population  to

justify  a  large  and barren park-land,  readjustments

have been made to allow part of Kallang Park to be used

as  a  housing  estate by the Housing  and  Development

Board.  The  reasons are obvious. The uses  of  Kallang

Park  have been watched and scrutinised over  the  last

two  and  a  half years. For reasons not  only  because

there is no density of population in the area but  also

because  of transport conditions, the park is not  used

in  the  way  it was hoped it would be used. Therefore,

one  sector amounting to about 35 per cent of the  land

bordering  Mountbatten Road at the Nicoll Highway  side

is  being test-bored at the moment to find out  whether

it  is suitable for housing development. If it is,  one

sector  will  be set aside for housing, and  that  will

provide  the density of population for the use  of  the

rest  of  Kallang Park. So it is a constant process  of

adjustments. If any developer wants to use a  piece  of

land;  if  he  thinks the Master Plan is  not  what  it

should be because he has adequate reasons why it should

be  altered, then his proposal for reconsideration will

receive  sympathetic and new scrutiny. There is  nobody

who  is  in any way being penalised as a result of  our

not,  so  to  speak, republishing once and for  all  an

amended Master Plan. There is no end to planning.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning is to fit in with human needs. Planning has

to  fit  in  with conditions which alter from  time  to

time.  Of  course,  there are certain basic  principles

which  one  observes in planning, because they  are  of

some relevance. As I have stated, we are looking for  a

competent Chief Planner.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Member for Hong Lim is the person

least  qualified to cry on behalf of the  farmers  and

the  poor squatters. He is always crying on behalf  of

somebody,  Sir. The trouble is that when we  entrusted

him with the responsibility of doing these things -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was the

Minister  in  charge  of  land  problems,  I  remember

discussing  with  the  Prime Minister  one  day  about

trying  to  carry out a programme, the  principles  of

which I have enunciated just now. I met with the  same

opposition as I met with in the building of houses and

other things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is a strange thing! Thank God

the Chairman of the Housing Development Board does not

seem  to meet with any opposition in putting up houses

at  the  rate of about 10,000 units a year;  something

which  even the Member for Hong Lim, in his  healthier

days  as  the  Minister for National Development,  was

unable to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rate of

progress  on  the  building of S.I.T. flats  commenced

only  after  the Hong Lim by-election.  It  should  be

pointed  out  that  during the  Hong  Lim  by-election

certain Ministers spoke on the platform that the rents

of  the  flats were expensive because the  flats  were

built  on  plans  laid  down by  the  ex-Minister  for

National Development, which was an admission that  the

plans  and the organisation were laid down by the  ex-Minister for National Development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, he cannot have it both ways.

Either he had no opposition, and plans and development

were  all prepared and all he needed was to press  the

button and the houses would spring up; or he did  meet

with opposition, in which case that was why the houses

did not go up. I suggest to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>



him  that the reason why nothing happened was that  he

went  on  a  witch-hunt, and everybody  was  either  a

dangerous  stooge,  a  spy or a reactionary,  and  the

result was that he landed himself with a group of weak

and  sycophantic officials who were unable to put  the

buildings  up. It is as simple as that.  As  for  this

land -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I just finish this? This

business  about the farmers; there was no  alteration.

We said, here was the Land Office; here was the P.A.P.

Five-Year  Plan  on  land for  farmers,  drafted  with

considerable care by the Minister for Health and  Law.

In  our  minds we have certain patterns as to  how  we

could,  without in fact confiscating and expropriating

the  land of the landlords, compel the use of the land

by  farmers  at cheap rates and give them security  of

tenure. It is all on the record. If we were to publish

the  draft  Bill that he produced on his  own  without

consultation -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member will be given full

opportunity to reply. These are things on the  record.

All  we  had was a Bill. Nobody can knock a nail  down

without the Minister first saying yes. Nobody  can  go

from  A to B or do anything without the Minister first

saying  yes. The Member's theory of planning  is  that

the  Minister is omniscient, omnipresent,  omnipotent.

Yes.  No. Thou shall do this. Thou shall not do  that.

And it is all the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Omnivorous!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, we put up a practical Bill

which  we  withdrew  because, as I  explained  to  the

House,  there  was the problem of those tenants.  They

are  not tenants and they are not squatters. They  are

licensees.  They  collect  fish  and  eggs   on   land

belonging to other people who collect rubber and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>



coconuts. We did not know how to resolve that problem.

We had three possible alternatives. I gave my former

Parliamentary Secretary, the Member for Upper

Serangoon, and the Member for Choa Chu Kang the

honourable task of calling up the farmers, arranging

meetings, and getting together to try and resolve it.

The very fact - [Interruption]. Well, that is the

tragedy, Sir. They can only say, why not accept the

Country People's Association's proposals? The Member

for Toa Payoh and the Member for Choa Chu Kang told me,

"What shall we do about this Country People's

Association? There are a lot of Communists inside. They

are taking advantage of us. We get a standpipe put up

and they claim the credit for it. What shall we do?"

These are facts. We discussed this ad infinitum, time

and time again -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Prime

Minister has alleged that I told him that there were

some people in the Rural People's Association and the

Rural Dwellers' Association who were Communists. This

is not correct. After the Select Committee meeting at

that time I discussed with the Prime Minister about how

to invite the representatives of the two rural

organisations to take part in discussing this problem.

They had suggested convening a meeting. At that time,

Mr Speaker, Sir, you were the Chairman of the Select

Committee discussing the Agricultural Leases Bill. The

crux of the whole problem was that I only said that the

representatives of these organisations should be

invited to discuss this matter. The Prime Minister

talked with me as how to solve this problem. I told him

it was better to wait until the by-election was over. I

did not say there were Communists in these two

organisations -

am  pleased to know that after my absence of three days

I  am able to arouse so much interest generally! In the

process  of this investigation into the Chinese  school

students and the parents whom they rustled up to attend

the  Chinese  High School Parents' Day on Sunday,  this

particular point, as to whether the Member for Choa Chu

Kang said that, could be covered. I am prepared to  say

this  on oath, give evidence and the date. If he denies

it  and  there is evidence to justify it, then he  will

have to take the consequences -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Prime  Minister has been talking  about  something

entirely  different. He has alleged that I  said  there

were  Communists  in  the two rural organisations.  But

when  he stood up to reply, he talked about the parents

of  the  Chinese  school  students.  That  is  entirely

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot even hear the

interpreter. Now, Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There was no contradiction in

what  I  said. What I said was there is going to  be  a

Commission  of  Inquiry  into  the  students  and   the

Communists  manipulating the students. Since  there  is

already this Commission of Inquiry, one of the items it

will  have  to  inquire into are the  Country  People's

Association  and  the Rural Dwellers Association,  more

the Rural Dwellers Association than the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>



Country  People's  Association. They are  more  heavily

penetrated  and communist controlled; they  rustled  up

the  so-called "parents" for the Sunday meeting at  the

Chinese High School.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not go into details.

There  are  only five minutes left and the  Member  for

Hong Lim is anxious to get up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I say, that matter has to be

investigated,  why  did the Rural Dwellers  Association

rustle  up  rural dwellers to come along and  say  that

they  were parents of examinees? At the same  time,  it

might cover the point that the Member for Choa Chu Kang

asks  me -  what shall he do about the wicked  Communist

elements  in  the Rural Dwellers' Association  who  get

standpipes installed as a result of getting his aid and

then  claim  the benefit for themselves?  We  discussed

this  matter  umpteen times in my office. These  things

can  be investigated. But the point we have to make  is

this.  Never  deny something which can be proved.  Now,

Sir, the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the

general election, at one time I managed to convince the

Minister for Finance, in those days Dr Goh Kong Swee -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is still here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - of this basic principle, that when

we  formed the Government, we should buy over the  land

and pay the landlords bonds and distribute the land  to

the  land  hungry  farmers. But he met with  opposition

from the Prime Minister in those days. Because of that,

we did not put that programme into the Five-Year Plan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, before . -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If it is a point of order, then

the Prime Minister must say it is a point of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I want at least two minutes in the

final reply and I think there must be some relevance. I

mean, we are not going to go into bonds and so on. What

the Member for Hong Lim has raised, I have replied to,

namely, the Agricultural Leases Bill. His version was

he would cure everything by saying yes or no to

everybody -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The point of order raised is

whether or not the Member for Hong Lim is relevant. I

think he is relevant. He is talking about land

acquisition by way of payment. He suggests that bonds

should be issued. Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, now we come to

the  Agricultural Leases Bill. This has been  mentioned

for  the  last one and a half years and we  have  never

seen any Agricultural Leases Bill -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We must put him on the Select

Committee the next time!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, I had a Bill and it is true

that it gave the Minister lots of powers. I do not deny

it.  But  these powers were necessary to  settle  cases

arising  under  the Toa Payoh scheme. The  resettlement

plan  which  was distributed to members was too  rigid,

and it was necessary for the Minister to appoint panels

of   assessors  to  negotiate  with  persons  who  were

affected. But the Prime Minister opposed this  type  of

scheme. In that particular Bill, it was important  that

the  Minister  should be given powers.  But  the  Prime

Minister did not object to his Minister for Labour just

testing whether a girl of 18 should marry or not.  That

power should not be given to the Minister. But when  it

comes  to matters involving $20,000 or $30,000, I think

the  Minister should be given power. But the  power  of

deciding  that a girl of 18 should marry or not  should

not be given to the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether this

is  on land acquisition or female acquisition! Mr  Ong

Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was just trying

to  compare  Ordinances where the Ministers were  given

power.  I  said  in  the  Bill which  I  proposed,  the

Minister  should be given power. In the Bill where  the

Minister for Labour and Law was concerned, those powers

could be given to a registrar. There is no need for the

Minister to assume the power -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think there are only two

minutes  more.  I  think the Prime Minister  should  be

given an opportunity to reply. Mr Ong Eng Guan, half a

minute more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I agree

with  the  sentiments of the Member for Choa Chu  Kang,

because I know that the Prime Minister is very good  at

twisting  and turning. As usual, he will come  to  this

Chamber  and  repeat certain things  mentioned  in  the

C.P.A. Room which -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This is all irrelevant. Mr

Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The long and short of

compensation is simply this. Whatever you  pay  to  the

farmers must come out from revenue, from taxes. We  are

quite   willing  to  give  everybody  everything.   But

everybody  must have to pay for it. It is as simple  as

that.  The  duty of this Government is to  do  what  is

within reason and within the limits of the economy.  We

can  make  it  five times as much. But where  will  the

money come from? Raise the income tax, the petrol  tax,

the  workers'  tax?  Sir, there  are  simple  tests  of

whether this Government stands for the landlord or  for

the non-landowner. At Bukit Ho Swee, a fire took place.

Any  other government would have left it alone and  let

the  owner of the land benefit by it. Overnight,  as  a

result  of  a national disaster, land which  is  worth,

with  squatters  on it, 30 cents a square  foot  became

seven  times  as  valuable, because the squatters  were

dispersed -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D13 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D13 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, I brought up this question and asked

the Minister whether it was wise for an expenditure  of

$11  million  to  be  spent on the development  of  the

Airport,  in  view  of  the fact  that  the  Federation

Government was going ahead with the opening of  a  very

big  international Airport in Kuala Lumpur, and I think

the  amount  involved  there is  somewhere  around  $16

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am asking the Minister to think again,

particularly  as it says in item 10 on page  7  of  the

White  Paper (Cmd. 33 of 1961) - in the agreement reached

between the Federation of Malaya and Singapore - that Communications  and Transport are to be the responsibility

of  the  Federal Government. In view of that agreement,

can the Minister say whether it will have any impact on

our own development, and whether he still considers  it

wise  that  so much money should be spent on developing

an   Airport  which  may  have  to  compete  with   the

international  Airport  that is  to  be  built  by  the

Central Government?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I said last year that there was  a  real

necessity  for  expanding the facilities  at  the  Paya

Lebar   Airport,  and  I  repeat  again  that  we   are

proceeding  with this plan this year. To enlighten  the

Member  for  Cairnhill, I would like to inform  him  of

statistics which show the increasing importance of Paya

Lebar  Airport. First, I will give him  the  number  of

passengers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>



who  have embarked or disembarked at Paya Lebar Airport

since   1959.   In  1959,  we  had  122,000   embarking

passengers;  in  1960, 143,000;  and  in  1961,  it  is

estimated  at 172,000. In 1959, the number disembarking

passengers was 129,000; in 1960, 149,000; and in  1961,

it  is  estimated  at 175,000. The number  of  aircraft

movements at Paya Lebar Airport has also increased,  in

1959,  it  was 26,925; in 1960, it was 31,991;  and  in

1961  it  was  41,445. As you can see,  the  number  of

aircraft  movements in 1961 has increased by more  than

50 per cent over the figure for 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in reply to the Member for Cairnhill, I

have  the  assurance  of airline operators  that  their

aircraft  will operate through Paya Lebar  as  long  as

there  is  traffic generated in Singapore,  and  it  is

obvious  to  the House, from the figures I have  given,

that  this traffic, far from decreasing, is increasing.

There  is  also  the  example of Australia.  The  first

international airport in Australia was at  Sydney,  and

for  a  very  long  time it was  thought  that  it  was

necessary to have only that one international  airport.

But  with more people wanting to travel by air, it  was

found   that   Australia   required   more   than   one

international  airport. There is  now  another  one  at

Perth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D14 -



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D14 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for my moving this amendment is that last

year  the development, project in Singapore was only  a

"paper tiger". It broke when it was touched. Therefore,

I do not wish to speak at length on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as to the plan this year, I doubt whether the

Government  has  any ability to carry it  out,  because

this has something to do with the political life of the

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are on "Marine" and so

far - unless the interpreter has missed out a part of the

speech  of the Member for Stamford -  she has not touched

on anything about "Marine".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Singapore River.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well, has she mentioned the Singapore

River?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> She says that the P.A.P. is sunk!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Fung Yin Ching, the Singapore

River?



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  was saying that last year the Government planned  to

revise the Singapore River project but it has not  done

so.   It  depends  upon  the  political  life  of   the

Government whether the Government wants to do  it  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year, we approved over $2

million.  There are three items. One item concerns  the

Construction  and  Repairs to  the  Master  Attendant's

Pier.   Another  item  is  the  New  Marine  Department

Quarters  costing  $72,000.  The  third  item  is   the

Singapore River Project costing about $21 million.  But

so  far  $221,300  has been spent. I want  to  ask  the

Government why the plan was not carried out last  year.

Why  did the Government want this vote for this  year'?

Does the Government intend to carry out this plan? When

will  it  carry  out  this plan and  when  will  it  be

completed?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D14 be reduced

by $100.''

<br><br>Perhaps the Minister would like to answer that question

first. There is still time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, under Head D14, there are  three  items.

Two  are small matters: one is Construction and Repairs

to   Master   Attendant's  Pier  which  is  practically

completed,  and there is a small sum next year  to  pay

for  final  items;  the  next one  is  the  New  Marine

Department  Quarters which we expect to  complete  next

year.  But  the main thing is the Singapore River.  The

original  cost  entered in the Four-Year  Plan  is  $21

million.  The Member for Stamford wondered why  nothing

was  done.  She  said that this was  a  "paper  tiger".

Perhaps  a  more  apt description  would  be  a  "paper

crocodile". Perhaps I should explain what the Singapore

River development scheme is, otherwise we will not know

what we are talking about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, the Singapore River Working Committee

submitted  their  Interim Report and  they  said,  "The

river is congested. You have these empty lighters going

out  to  collect cargo from the ships in the roads  and

coming  back  to  unload it on to the  wharves  by  the

river."  Of course, it was a nasty business, as  anyone

looking, say, from the bridges over the Singapore River

can see that the place is congested. The Committee came

to  the  conclusion that the reason why traffic was  so

closely bunched was that the lighters could not get out

nor  come in during high tide, and at low tide, because

of  the silt on the river bed, they could not move. The

Committee  therefore  recommended  raising   the   five

bridges and deepening the channels of the river  almost

right  up  to  the quayside. In order  to  prevent  the

quayside from collapsing, steel sheet piling was  found

to  be  necessary. This was the report which  gave  the

findings  of  experts on the subject. It  received  the

general  acclamation of the business world. Of  course,

it  would take a rather brave man to say, "This is  all

nonsense." In fact, the diagnosis is wrong. As we  drew

up the plan, we said, "Well, experts and engineers have

been  working  on  it."  But when  we  discussed  which

engineers  were going to do which projects,  it  became

obvious that if we were to put engineers on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2162</b></font><br><br>



project, then other projects would be held up even to a

greater   extent.   So   we  decided   to   delay   the

implementation of this project for some  time.  In  the

meantime,  I  was watching traffic along  the  river - my

office  is in Fullerton Building - and I could see  from

one side the lighters going from the river mouth to the

ships; and when I crossed over to the other side of the

building  to  my  Conference  Room,  I  could  see  the

lighters  going up and down the river itself. I  became

more  and more doubtful whether there was any substance

in  the  report of the Working Committee, because  they

said - I do not want to go too extensively into that - that

at  certain  times there was a congestion  of  lighters

either  at  one or the other side of the river  waiting

for  the tide to go down so that they can go under  the

bridges. I looked at the Singapore River every now  and

then, and never spotted any collection of lighters.  So

I decided to question the whole basis of this report. I

had  a  team  of  officials to  keep  a  watch  on  the

Singapore River and to record the lighter traffic going

up  and down during daylight hours - there is hardly  any

traffic at night - through a whole tide cycle to find out

whether or not the traffic was affected by the tides.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They collected a great amount of data which were

subjected to very fine statistical analysis, using  the

most  advanced techniques and they found that the  flow

of  lighter  traffic in the Singapore River  was  quite

independent of the time of the tides. So it is  obvious

that,  with  this information, the whole River  develop

ment  improvement  scheme must be thought  out  afresh,

because if it has nothing to do with the tides it is no

use  spending  some $6 million - and that is  the  amount

required to raise the bridges - to allow lighters to  go

under them at high tides, when, in fact, they could  go

under  them  in any case. Subject to this, it  is  true

that  at  certain  seasons of the  year - neap  tide  or

spring  tide - or  when the tides are  usually  high  for

about a few days -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister has made

his point - that the whole scheme is being revised. There

are two Members who have indicated that they would like

to speak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. Perhaps I have made the point

why  the scheme was held up. Now I want to say what the

present scheme is. Having found out that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Minister has the time,

perhaps  he can give details of that scheme.  Otherwise

he  can  make  a  ministerial statement  tomorrow.  Two

Members wish to speak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from

what  the Minister for Finance has just said, it is  my

impression  that he is saying what he has said  in  the

Four-Year  Development  Plan.  I  refer  to  page   82,

"Improvement  of the Singapore River", paragraphs  8.11

and  8.12.  It is quite clear that the Singapore  River

working Committee was appointed in 1953. That was eight

years ago, and the P.A.P. Government have been in power

for  the last 30 months. If the Government were sincere

in  really improving the Singapore River, then I see no

difficulty in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will realise that quite a

number  of  people  depend  on  the  River  for   their

livelihood. In paragraph 8.11, it says that about 2,000

lightermen  and 4,000 stevedores depend mainly  on  the

Singapore  River.  Now,  it is  stated  here  that  the

condition of the Singapore River is congested:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'River traffic is hampered due to insufficient quay

length and difficulty of clearance during both high and

low tides.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the explanation of the

Minister for Finance, it is quite clear that it is  not

only because of the insufficient depth of the River and

the  low  overhead  bridges but  also  because  of  the

insufficient quay length.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Hon, the Minister

has  indicated that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>



will be quite willing to make  a ministerial statement on

it. Is that correct?  If  that is correct, then I will not -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister will not make a

ministerial statement. Then the Member for Havelock may

carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, having read the

Development  Plan,  we realise that if  the  Government

were  sincere in improving the Singapore River,  I  see

there  is  no  difficulty  in  doing  it,  because  the

Singapore  River has been mentioned for the last  eight

years  and  the  report of the Singapore River  Working

Committee   had  been  submitted  to  the   Government.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, the whole Development Plan

and the figures in the Development Estimates are merely

a  showcase. It says that the Government are very  keen

on  development and industrialisation in order to solve

the  unemployment problem. The conclusion is  that  the

Government  are  not really sincere  in  improving  the

Singapore River.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

admitted  that  the  original Singapore  River  project

required  revision.  So what was  nut  forward  to  the

people  in  the Hong Lim by-election was  a  half-baked

proposal.  Sir,  I  have an interest  in  this  project

because half of the electorate of Hong Lim, and I think

more  than half of the electorate of Telok Ayer, depend

on  the  Singapore River for their means of livelihood.

And  I think half the commerce in Singapore depends  on

the  Singapore River. Sir, I think it is now time  that

the   Government  gave  sufficient  importance  to  the

improvement  of the Singapore River. We understand  the

difficulties involved - that if we take more silt out, it

might  damage the foundations of buildings in the area.

But the Government must show that it is doing something

to the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is obvious that I have

been  speaking  at  some length explaining  this  whole

business  without the simplest of my ideas  penetrating

into the minds of those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>



persons to whom I have spoken. I have said that we  are

not going through with this because when we examined -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is no time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have said that, on re-examination, we found this report basically wrong and,

therefore, what is the point of going on with the

report which we know is wrong? That is not the way we

express sincerity, Mr Speaker, Sir, - to waste $20

million on a project which, on re-examination, is found

to be unsound. I hope I have made my point clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Plan report was drafted towards the

end  of 1960, before studies of Singapore River traffic

were  made. It is obvious that once we have  the  basic

information, the way to improve the flow of traffic  is

not  along the lines recommended by this Committee. You

have  to  get  a new set of technicians to  revise  the

whole  Plan, and that is what we have done. It is  only

in  October this year that the new Committee  made  its

preliminary recommendation, on a more modest scale, but

I   am  sure  it  will  be  more  effective  than   the

recommendations of the first Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Could the House be given a copy of those

recommendations, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if this subject has stirred

so  much interest, perhaps I should issue a ministerial

statement on a matter of public interest.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am trying to indicate that

that  should be the proper course to take, because hon.

Members  have only the Development Plan and the  Budget

before  them. They have voiced grievances based on  the

Development Plan and, therefore, if there  has  been  a

radical change in the Development Plan, the Minister, I

suppose,  will  either  table  a  White  Paper  on  the

revision or make a ministerial statement. A ministerial

statement  at this time would, of course, be eating  up

Opposition time. That is what I am trying to  indicate.

Dr Goh.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The only reason for hesitation on

my  part is that the second Committee has only made its

preliminary recommendations. I would like to  think  it

over  carefully - just how much to be made  public,  when

they have not completed their findings.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time has expired.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,865,700 for Head D14 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D16 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D16 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Head in the Development

Estimates  concerns Meteorological  Services.  In  last

year's  budget, $27,000 was approved for these services

but the Government has not made use of this money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a small island and so

meteorological services are of great importance to  us.

We all realise that Singapore occupies a very important

place in the world. Its importance is particularly felt

in  the  Federation. We have to be certain our  weather

forecasts - whether there will be a storm or a hurricane.

According to an engineer, if there is a hurricane,  all

buildings  on  the  island will  collapse.  So  I  hope

Government will put in much effort in these services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to know whether the Deputy Prime Minister can

explain  why the sum of money allocated last  year  was

not  spent,  and when will they be able  to  carry  out

these services this year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, for the information

of  the  Member  for  Choa Chu  Kang,  the  subject  of

meteorology covers a very wide area. It does not  cover

Singapore  Island  alone.  In  fact,  the  smaller  the

territory,  the  less  important  meteorology  becomes.

Therefore, the meteorological service in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  is  linked up with that in  the  Federation,

North  Borneo,  and Sarawak. We have  live  territories

combined  together to form this meteorological service,

in other words, it is at the moment Pan-Malayan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather or climate of a territory covers an

enormous area. What happens to the weather in Singapore

is  determined by factors which take place in countries

surrounding our island.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has inquired why it is

that we have not made much use of the vote given in the

Estimates last year. The reason is quite simple. If you

look  at  the Development Estimates, there is  an  item

there called "Installation of Hydrological Station".  A

$10  vote  is  given as a token vote. It  is  pointless

putting  up  one hydrological station in  Singapore  if

there are no hydrological stations in the Federation or

in  Borneo  or  in Sarawak. A hydrological  station  by

itself  in  Singapore will serve  no  purpose.  It  is,

therefore, important that agreement with the Federation

must also be obtained to set up similar stations there.

Similarly for other items of equipment, it is essential

that  they  can be duplicated too in other territories.

Otherwise,  I  do  not see how equipment  installed  in

Singapore alone could make any weather forecast. In any

case,  Mr Speaker, I personally have very grave doubts

about  meteorological forecasts, judging by the  amount

of  equipment that is being used. The reason is simple.

The  science of meteorological is a very young science,

and  to  make  weather forecasts you  need  satellites,

which the Americans have used, to be able to photograph

storms  and, therefore, give several hours' warning  of

storms  or the approach of storms. In any case,  I  can

assure  the Member for Choa Chu Kang that there  is  no

need  to fear that he will be visited by typhoons.  Our

service is quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>



efficient.  In fact, we have what is called  a  warning

met   service  which  broadcasts  weather  reports   to

aircraft which approach Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister says that

meteorological services are not very important to Singapore,  as  it is a very small place. But in the  Budget

for  1962,  the  Government intends to spend  $95,000.

This year it is intended to spend $26,700. If it is not

necessary,  why then should the Government  spend  some

money on this? In view of the explanation given by him,

I will withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister can speak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What I want to say is that

Singapore  happens  to  be  the  headquarters  of   the

meteorological centre. That is all. Therefore,  one  of

the  stations  is  located  in  Singapore.  But  it  is

pointless  to  have  just  a  Singapore  meteorological

station  when we do not have other stations functioning

in  the  Federation  and  the Borneo  territories.  The

clouds do not just hang above Singapore. They come from

the Federation as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Deputy Prime Minister say which post

offices  are  referred to under  this  item,  and  what

extensions and alterations are being planned?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the post offices are

the  Joo Chiat Post Office and the Tanglin Post Office.

The reasons for alterations and extensions given to  me

are  as  follows.  For the Joo Chiat Post  Office,  the

public  lobby  is  only  54  square  feet,  and  it  is

considered that at least four or five times  this  area

is required to provide reasonable accommodation for the

people  using  this office. In addition, the  extremely

limited  space  on  the official side  of  the  counter

causes  cramped working conditions for the  staff,  and

this, in turn, affects the efficient and smooth working

of  the office. Moreover, reasonable storage facilities

are  also lacking. It is, therefore, necessary to carry

out  structural  alterations internally  to  provide  a

larger  public  lobby  and counter  so  that  a  better

service to the public can be given at this post office.

Incidentally, the Joo Chiat Post Office is situated  in

a very busy shopping area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major alterations and extensions required for the

Tanglin  Post  Office are counter  positions.  This  is

because  of  the  increase of business handled  by  the

Tanglin  Post  Office, and a larger sorting  office  is

required  to  house  the delivery postmen  and  sorting

equipment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D17 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year the Assembly approved

$280,400 in respect of this item. But I understand  the

Government has only spent $5,050. This only amounts  to

.2  per  cent of the Estimate. The Government  has  not

spent the sum voted for. In other words, the Government

has  not built the two post offices in Macpherson  Road

and  Simpang Bedok. We all know that the population  of

Singapore  will  be increased by next year.  Therefore,

with  regard to postal services, the Government  should

also  take into consideration these factors. It  should

provide more postal services in crowded areas so as  to

serve  the  people  of Singapore well.  Otherwise,  the

people  will have to go to other post offices very  far

away.  They  have  to go very great  distances  to  buy

stamps  and so on. That is very inconvenient  to  them.

That  is why, I think, the provision in the Budget  for

this  item  of  expenditure is correct.  But  then  the

Government did not make use of the provision last year.

But  this year the Government intends to build two more

post  offices  from this vote. I now want  to  ask  the

Deputy  Prime Minister whether these four post offices,

as envisaged in the Budget, can be completed this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The answer is very simple, Mr

Speaker.  The  plan  for 1961 was  to  build  two  post

offices, one at Macpherson Road and another at  Simpang

Bedok.  The plan for 1962 is to build another two  post

offices,  one  at Killiney Road and another  at  Farrer

Park.  The  reason why the post offices  at  Macpherson

Road  and  Simpang Bedok have not been  completed  this

year  has been given to me like this. The delay in  the

building of the Macpherson Road Post Office is  due  to

the  presence  of squatters on the site  for  the  post

office.  The  Resettlement Department  of  the  Housing

Board  is taking action on this matter. As soon as  the

squatters  have been resettled, work on the  Macpherson

Road  Pest Office can be started immediately. The delay

in  building the Simpang Bedok Post Office  is  because

the  Public  Trustee, as trustee for the owner  of  the

site,  is not in favour of the purchase of the site  by

private  treaty. The Commissioner of Lands,  therefore,

sought  the  approval of the Government to acquire  the

site   compulsorily  under  section  5  of   the   Land

Acquisition Ordinance, and the inquiry was fixed on the

20th of November, 1961. The latest information from the

Commissioner of Lands is that an award of  $10,125  has

been  made  to  the  owners of  the  land,  and  he  is

arranging  for payment to be made so that he  can  take

possession of the land immediately. As you can see, Mr

Speaker,  the  delay is not really due to my  Ministry,

but  the  delay  is  due mainly to  the  difficulty  in

acquiring the land and getting rid of the squatters  or

getting the land ready for building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The reply of the Hon. the Deputy Prime

Minister raises a very important principle in budgeting

these matters, Sir. When the various Ministries come to

the  House  and  ask for these votes,  the  House  must

suppose that when an item for $132,000 is put into this Budget,  matters like the acquisition of land, clearing

of  squatters  and  the question of  whether  the  land

should  be  acquired compulsorily or by private  treaty

have  already  been settled. All this  should  be  done

before the House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>



is  asked  to vote the money. To come to the House  and

ask  it  to  vote  big sums of money  for  projects  in

respect  of which even the land has not been  acquired,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I suggest is not the proper  way  to

deal with the situation.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I do not agree with the Member for

Farrer Park. As far as I am concerned, I have to  build

two  post  offices in that area and another  two  posts

offices  in  the  other  area.  My  Director  of  Posts

estimates  how much money we require and by  what  time

these post offices must be  completed. It may be that in

the  course of the year, if you are lucky, you will not

have  any  problem with squatters or be faced with  the

problem  of  acquisition of land,  and  therefore  work

could  be  begun  immediately. I put  it  to  you,  for

example, proposals in the Development Estimates to  put

up  a  post office in Killiney Road and another one  in

Farrer Park will go forward the moment we get the sites

ready, because by the time we keep on negotiating we do

not  know whether the provision for building these post

offices will have been obtained or not. Therefore,  the

estimates are given here and it is up to the  House  to

study these estimates and approve.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Macpherson Road

site,  I  entirely  sympathise  with  the  Government's

position  in  that the site is at present  occupied  by

squatters and there is difficulty in getting  the  land

cleared.  It  is a difficult problem. I appreciate  the

Government's  problem on that and I can understand  it.

But  from  the  reply given by the  Hon.  Deputy  Prime

Minister  so  far as the Simpang Bedok Post  Office  is

concerned, it seems to me the site is clear.  All  that

is necessary is for the Government to go in and acquire

it.  Very well, they start to negotiate with the Public

Trustee and the Public Trustee will not sell. Then I am

suggesting  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  that  the

Government   has   adequate  powers  under   the   Land

Acquisition  Ordinance  to go in  on  the  site,  after

serving a notice, take possession



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>



of  it  and start to build. The question  of  what

compensation  is  to be paid is  a  later  matter.

There  are  sufficient  provisions  in  the   Land

Acquisition Ordinance to get on with the job.  The

Government   is  sufficiently  armed  with   these

powers.  It has not been done in this case  and  I

can only suggest to the Deputy Prime Minister that

somebody in the Land Office has blundered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I suggest the question be

referred to the Land Office. I am in charge of the

post offices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  according  to  the Deputy  Prime  Minister's

reply,  this  post office cannot be built  because

the  Government does not have the land. The Deputy

Prime  Minister can get the site through the  Land

Office. Therefore, if the Land Office delays  this

matter,  I  feel the Deputy Prime Minister  should

see  that  the Land Office get on with  this  work

quickly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if

administration  were  as  simple   as   has   been

described  by the Member for Choa Chu  Kang,  then

the  art  of  government would be  a  very  simple

matter. You must remember that the Land Office has

many  claims made upon it, not only by my  Office,

but  also  by  people who want to build  community

centres of people who want to build housing  flats

and  so  on. It is not possible for Ministers  who

are  supposed to be in charge of community centres

or  post offices or housing all at one time to  be

in  conference with the Prime Minister. There  are

official channels through which these applications

are  made  and  they all have to  go  through  the

procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if the Government says that this year  is  a

construction year, what the people want to see  is

the  result of the construction. According to  the

reply  given by the Deputy Prime Minister, I think

we  had  better not talk about construction  next

time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> When we open these post

offices and if the Member for Choa Chu Kang and

the Member for Farrer Park so desire, I will

invite them to attend the ceremony.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On that assurance will the Member

for Choa Chu Kang withdraw?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I believe this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $436,400 for Head D17 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D18 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may, I would like to take the next

item* also because they are related.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, if it is convenient.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, subheads 8 and 9 are

about  Malayan Trunk Services and Microwave  Trunk

Telephone  System  between  Singapore  and   Kuala

Lumpur.  In the item above i.e., subhead 7,  there

is  already  another related item,  Malayan  Trunk

Scheme.  So  much  so, Sir, we  wonder  why  there

should be these three separate items. Subhead  19 - Trunk   Telephone  Services.  So   what   is   the

difference between a Malayan Trunk Scheme, Malayan

Trunk  Services, Microwave Trunk Telephone  System

and Trunk Telephone Services? They all seem to  be

different trunks.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to

be  allocated for Head D18 be reduced  by  $10  in

respect of subhead 8." The next amendment* may  be touched upon.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The amendment [Amendment (2)] reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D18 be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead 9.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not blame

the Member for Tanglin or the Member for Cairnhill

for failing to distinguish the elephant's trunk

from the elephant's tail. I myself was a little

puzzled about this and I had a long chat with the

Director of Telecommunications over what all this

was about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall try to explain it in as simple a

language  as  possible  so  that  the  layman  can

understand what it is all about. As you are aware,

Mr    Speaker,   telephone   communications   and

telegraphic  communications between Singapore  and

the  Federation are now by means of the  microwave

system. This microwave system has capacity of  600

channels.    In   other   words,   600   telephone

conversations, including telegraphic circuits, can

be  performed simultaneously. At the moment,  this

capacity  is  not fully taken up. At  present,  we

have  144  telephone channels and  60  telegraphic

channels   using  this  microwave  system.   Under

subhead  8,  provision is  made  for  36  sets  of

equipment  in order to bring in 36 more  channels.

Sir,  this provision was placed in the 1961  Draft

Estimates.  The  Treasury  approved  that  sum  of

money. The reason was that it was making inquiries

whether the World Bank would provide financial aid

for  telecommunications  development.  The  answer

came very late this year, that the World Bank  was

riot    interested    in    assisting    us     in

telecommunications development. So we have  now  a

revote  of  the  1961 Estimates under  subhead  8,

i.e.,  $36,000.  This  will  provide  another   36

telephone  circuits. So altogether we  shall  have

180 telephone circuits on the microwave system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under subhead 7 - Malayan Trunk Scheme - although it is not mentioned in the amendment,

this  comes  as part of the Four-Year  Development

Plan.  Under this Four-Year Development  Plan,  we

hope  to  open  up  another  60  channels  on  the

microwave  system. So we hope at the end  of  1962

there will be altogether 300 channels which can be

used  on the microwave system. But the reason  why

one is called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>



Malayan   Trunk  Scheme,  another  Malayan   Trunk

Services,  and  another Microwave Trunk  Telephone

is,   I   understand   from   the   Director    of

Telecommunications, the insistance of the Treasury

that  they should spilt up item by item,  and  the

Director of Telecommunications had to scratch  his

head  for the terminology for each item,  and  the

best  he  could think of were these. The name  for

each  item  had  previously  appeared  in  Budgets

before.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I withdraw, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (2)* is not being moved. Amendment (3)+, Dr Thio.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* See footnote at cols. 2173-4.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D18 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

17.+



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, the item is Teleprinter Section and

just  before that there is Teleprinter  Equipment.

Does  it  mean  that  a  new  section  or  a   new

department  has  been started different  from  the

previous one?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No. It is not different, Mr

Speaker, it is part of the same thing, just as the

confusion that arose between subheads 7, 8 and  9.

The same thing has appeared in subheads 16 and 17.

The item included under subhead 16 was in the 1961

Estimates,  so  this  also is  a  revote  from  an

original  item in the 1960 Estimates.  The  reason

why it has been placed in this year's Estimates is

that  the greater part of the equipment which  was

voted  for in 1960, although ordered, has not  yet

arrived. But it is expected that most of  it  will

arrive by next year. That explains subhead 16.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 17 is a scheme to enlarge the

Teleprinter    Section   under    the    Four-Year

Development   Plan.   As   Members   are    aware,

Teleprinter business is growing in Singapore.  The

total  number of renters of teleprinter  equipment

is  97  and the total of machines in use  is  450.

Those who use this equipment include





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>



business  houses,  shipping companies,  news  agencies,

newspapers,  airline companies, the Police  Force,  the

Meteorological  Department,  the  Director   of   Civil

Aviation. Incidentally, the annual revenue which  comes

from the Teleprinter Section is estimated to be half  a

million dollars this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Deputy

Prime Minister tell us how it is that not a single cent

has  been spent this year from the $308,000 which  they

have provided for in the 1961 Development Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> As I have explained at the

beginning,  that just as for subhead 7, 8  and  9,  the

reason   is  that  the  Finance  Minister  was   making

inquiries  whether the World Bank would  assist  us  in

telecommunications development, and we had to  await  a

reply from the World Bank.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D18 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Head D18 is about

Telecommunications. The Government has emphasised  that

our  economy depends on the entrepot trade.  Therefore,

this  question of telecommunications is very important.

If  we do not have a proper telecommunications service.

then we cannot carry out our activities as a centre  of

world   trade.  Therefore,  last  year,  the   Assembly

approved  about  $3,900,000 for  telecommunications  in

order  to expand the service so that the economy  could

be  improved and we would be able to compete with other

countries in trade. But the Budget for 1962 shows  that

the  Government has spent only $250,000 for  1961,  and

that   in  1962,  the  Government  is  going  lo  spend

$3,907,420.  The Government has spent  only  seven  per

cent of the total vote. I want to remind the House that

the  Government  said that 1961 was to  be  a  year  of

construction and the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>



Minister  also  said  that  if  there  were  to  be  no

construction  in  1961, then there  would  not  be  any

construction in 1962 or 1963. From the figures  I  have

quoted, the Government has spent only seven per cent of

the total vote. How is it going to claim that this year

has been a year of construction?



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the Deputy Prime Minister can explain to the

House why only seven per cent of the vote approved last

year  has  been spent. I hope the amount of  $3,907,420

will be spent on this particular service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Member for Choa Chu Kang must have been sleeping when I

was  explaining  why we have to revote subheads  7, 8, 9,

16, 17 and 18. The reason I gave was that in 1961, when

we  had the vote in the Estimates and we were about  to

use  the money, the Ministry of Finance froze the  vote

because  they wanted to make enquiries from  the  World

Bank  whether it could finance the Singapore Government

on  telecommunications development. We did not  have  a

reply  until late this year. So naturally we could  not

spend  the  money.  So  because of  this  we  have  now

replaced  this item in the 1962 Estimates. Having  been

assured  that the World Bank has declined to assist  us

in  telecommunications development, we have to foot the

bill ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Choa Chu Kang that the

greater  part  of this sum of money will  be  used  for

telecommunications development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

just now the Deputy Prime Minister said I was sleeping.

If  I  had been sleeping I would not have been able  to

quote  the  figures for his attention. As a  matter  of

fact,  the  person who is sleeping is the Deputy  Prime

Minister himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not our responsibility if the Government cannot carry out this plan in time, or it cannot entirely carry it out. It must be the

responsibility of the Government. As the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>



Government could not carry out its plan, there  was  no

necessity  to  make  such  a  provision  in  the   1961

Development  Budget. The provision was made  but  there

has  been no result at all. I am not entirely satisfied

with   the  explanation  given  by  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister. It was very improper on his part to say  that

I was sleeping.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the 1961

Estimates were prepared in 1960. We were about  to  use

the  money in 1961. Then came the big freeze.  While  I

personally  am  anxious  to advance  the  cause  of  my

Ministry,  I  have  also to be like  the  Minister  for

Finance. I have to look at the development picture as a

whole - not just have a narrow-eyed view on advancing  my

own  cause or the cause of my own Ministry. I  see  the

difficulties of the Minister for Finance. He has a  big

project - the Jurong Industrial Scheme. He  wants  money

for  that.  He  has  a project for filling  up  Kallang

Pudding. He has also a scheme to subsidise the  Housing

Board. Obviously he has to find the money somehow.  One

of  the ways is to see whether the World Bank can  help

us  in subsidising some of our development schemes.  So

enquiries were put forward to find out whether  it  was

prepared    to    assist   us   in   telecommunications

development, and because of that I was prepared to hold

up the development for 1961 until I got a reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Choa Chu Kang that the

trade  of  Singapore has not collapsed just because  we

have spent $255,000 on telecommunications in 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  am not satisfied with the explanation  of  the

Deputy  Prime Minister. This is a very simple question.

For  instance, if you say that you want to get  married

next  year, your friend will ask you at the end of next

year,  "Why haven't you married?" You then explain,  "I

want  to  get married. But if you will not help  me,  I

will not get married." In this case, you said that  you

wanted  to  get married, but you are not  married  now.

This is all your fault.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put up a big sum for the

Development Plan and yet it has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>



not done much. Can it be said that the sear 1961 was to

be a year of construction!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

advise  the Member for Choa Chu Kang not to get married

if  he  cannot afford it or if his friends cannot  help

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we are just going over old ground again.

The  money  has  not  been  used  this  year.  It  will

definitely  be used this year because we now  know  for

sure that we have to foot the bill. That is all. It  is

as simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The proposed site for the multi-storey car park is a

piece  of  vacant Crown land bounded by  Cecil  Street,

Cross Street and Market Street. Detailed plans have not

yet been drawn up...'.



<br><br>Mr  Mammen,  I  suggest to the Deputy Prime  Minister,

under  whose  portfolio this comes, that  while  he  is

considering the scheme he should consider pulling  down

the  building  which is now occupied by the  Commercial

Crimes Department of the Police, and that the whole  of

that  area should be developed as a car park. I do  not

know whether the Budget Statement means that, but if it

does not, I suggest that that should take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that this scheme, if not completed in 1962,

will at least come near



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>



completion in 1962, because there is a very great  need

in  Singapore  for such a multi-storey  car  park.  The

Minister  for Finance has said in his Budget  Statement

that this building will be capable of accommodating 800

to  900  cars  and  a fair number of  motor-cycles  and

scooters.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear from the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  it is the intention of Government then,  after

this car park has been erected, to prohibit parking  in

the  vicinity;  or  what scheme the Government  has  to

clear  some  of  our streets from being clogged  up  by

parked cars, particularly when the rate of expansion of

cars  in  Singapore is, I understand from  the  Finance

Minister, 500 cars per month.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the proposed

site for the multi-storey car park is a piece of vacant

Crown  land  bounded by Cecil Street, Cross Street  and

Market Street, and includes the land occupied just  now

by  the Commercial Crimes Branch. We are entering  into

negotiations with the Minister for Home Affairs to move

that branch of his Ministry to some other site, so that

we  can  get started with the piling, and work  on  the

multi-storey car park can be started straightaway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out by the Minister for Finance

in  his  Budget speech, the increase in the  number  of

vehicles,  averaging about 550 new cars per  month, is

quite  phenomenal for Singapore. We are fully aware  of

the  increasing  problems with  regard  to  control  of

traffic and looking for car parking sites. The existing

car  parks  around that area will still  be  maintained

because  we  believe that the presence  of  the  multi-storey  car park will cope with the increase  in  newly

registered vehicles only for a certain number of years.

After  that, I am afraid another solution will have  to

be  found as to how to control traffic that is going to

the centre of the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-storey car park has been designed for

approximately 800 cars. It is quite obvious that  there

is an upper limit to the number of cars that can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>



contained  in one building. Supposing we have  over  a

thousand cars parked in one building, then the trouble

of getting the cars into the building and getting them

out  again will mean a considerable waste of time, and

we may very well meet with a situation where a traffic

jam will be  created around the area.

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mrs Seow Peck Leng.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that the estimated expenditure

for  the year 1961 was only $6,500, whereas the actual

amount that was budgeted for 1961 was $46,500. This is

only 0.2 per cent performance, and I am just wondering

how  the  Government has helped the farmers as regards

research and other matters as promised in 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I notice that

for  this  subhead, $6,500 was estimated to have  been

spent  in  1961 and flow $40,000 is to  be  spent  in

1962.  In  spite of all the extra money put into  this

project,  I  find  from  the Malayan  Statistics  that

labourers for animal husbandry went down in number  in

September 1958 - it was recorded as 1,071; and for  the

same  month in 1960, it was 955. I was just  wondering

why  it is that in spite of putting in more money,  it

opens up avenues for jobs for less men.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> The vote in subhead I is required

for  the  alleviation of flooding in the  agricultural

section of the Sembawang Station, which is situated in

the  low-lying  part of the area of the Station  where

floods  are  frequent. Owing to unavoidable  delay  in

surveying and planning, tenders were invited late, and

the  position was further aggravated by unsatisfactory

work  by the contractor. The sum of $40,000 represents

a revote of a part of the $46,500 entered this year in

order to complete the job next year.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, let us forget

the past about contractors' sins and all that. Can the

Minister  assure us that with this extra $40,000  that

is  going  to be spent, it will open up jobs for  more

labourers and not less, as it has been doing?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, what the Member for

Mountbatten is quoting is from the returns made by the

Labour  Department  to  show that  there  has  been  a

decline  in the number of laborers engaged  in  animal

husbandry.   Perhaps  I  should   explain   that   the

statistics  quoted by her refer to labourers  who  are

employed,  and  not farmers engaged in pig-rearing  on

their own account. They are different. These would  be

labourers, for instance, employed by the Cold  Storage

Dairy  Farm;  I  think there are  one  or  two  rather

substantial poultry and pig farms in Singapore.  There

is  also,  I think, an apiary (beekeeping).  That  was

some  time ago. And the Labour returns refer to people

engaged  in  this  type  of  commercially  run  animal

husbandry business. Therefore, whether it goes  up  or

down  does  not prove that in the whole industry  more

people  are engaged or less people. It just refers  to

those   particular  employers  who  are  snaking   the

returns.  So  I  do  not  think  we  can  draw  direct

inferences as she did.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to come back to the statement I made on

the  Financial Statement by the Minister  for  Finance.

Unfortunately, he did not have the time to reply to me,

so I want to come back to the attack.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, Sir, is this: loans are being made by

the  Government to the Housing Board. I take  it  these

loans are being made at certain rates of interests, and

there must also be terms on which those loans are to be

repaid - whether  it  is  by  annual  repayment  to   the

Government,  or  whether  it  is  a  sinking  fund,  or

whatever the conditions may be we do not know. I  think

the House should be told about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is with this intention that I have raised

this question on the vote.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D20 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tun Lim Yew Hock? Mrs Seow.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Mammen. Sir, the other time

we  spoke  about  property  tax  on  vacant  houses.  I

understand  assessments  have  to  be  paid  on  vacant

Housing Board flats - we call them the S.I.T. flats.  The

trouble  is  that  this  adds  to  the  cost  of  those

premises.  If rents are determined by the cost  of  the

premises.  I am sure that is going to raise the  rents.

That  is why the present Government is unable to charge

them  cheaper rents as it might have been for the  poor

people  who occupy these Housing Board flats. I  wonder

whether  the Minister for Finance will take  that  into

consideration, although he has promised to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>



into  consideration the problem of assessment on vacant

premises. I just want to point out to him that not only

other  people,  hut also the very poor people  who  are

housed in Housing Board flats are affected.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to

congratulate the Government on spending more on housing

next year. We all know there is a very heavy backlog of

people on the waiting list for houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bukit Ho Swee fire and, before that, the

Geylang fire show us that there are certain very

densely occupied attap-house areas in town which are

very risky fire traps, and the fact that there were no

fatalities in the Bukit Ho Swee fire -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There were two.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Were there?

There  were  two. There were not many fatalities.  That

was due to the fact that the fire took place during the

day.  Sir, it was pointed out to me, and I agreed  with

that observant gentleman, that if the Singapore Housing

Board  would give top priority - not merely to  meet  the

backlog  but to give top priority - to these  fire  traps

and  make  sure that the people are properly housed  in

Housing  Board houses, then we would not only save  the

property  of  these people because then their  property

would  be  moved intact into the houses), hut also  the

lives  of some of them. This would also save the public

and the Government more expenditure. I thought that was

a very good suggestion which I would like to pass on to

the  Government. Sir. They would have not only a scheme

to  meet  the  backlog, but a scheme to prevent  future

disasters.  Then,  of  course, later  on  the  Finance

Minister  may  not  have so much money  as  he  is  now

keeping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another suggestion that where people who are

given  Housing  Board  houses  are  badly  off  in  the

beginning - their income is under a certain limit, $800

joint income - but they prosper later (human beings often

prosper) and want to buy over those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>



houses,  not  wanting  to  move  out  because  of   the

friendships  they have formed, would it be possible  to

evolve  a  scheme  for these people  to  buy  over  the

houses?

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> First, to reply to the question

raised  by the Member for Farrer Park on the  terms  of

loans  to  the  Housing Board. This is related  to  the

question  of subsidy. In this respect, the  Member  for

Mountbatten  also  raised another  pertinent  question,

that is, why the Housing Board is charging property tax

on  empty  flats. I think I will take  the  two  points

together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact terms of the loans made by the Government

to  the  Housing Board have not been settled.  This  is

because it is related to the amount of subsidy  we  are

going to give them and the manner in which this subsidy

will be calculated. I can, of course, only express  the

view  of  the Government. What the Housing Board  feels

about  it  is another matter. But from the Government's

point  of view, we propose to make loans to the Housing

Board at market rates. In other words, if we borrow, as

we  are  now borrowing, at 5� per cent, on  a  20-year

repayment basis, we intend to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>



offer  the  same  terms on loans made  to  the  Housing

Board.    Such   terms,   of   course,   are   markedly

disadvantageous compared with the terms of  loans  made

by  former Governments to the S.I.T. In respect of past

loans  made to the S.I.T., the practice was  to  charge

the current market rate of interest, although sometimes

the  rate  of interest, I think, charged was even  less

than  the current market rate of interest. That is  not

so  important as the fact that the S.I.T. were  allowed

repayment  on  a  60-year basis, so  that  charges  for

amortization  of  loans  became comparatively  reduced.

Therefore,  if the Government were to ask  the  Housing

Board to pay the market rate for long-term loans, it is

obvious  that we must pay them a corresponding subsidy,

if  they  are  not to be compelled to raise  the  rents

charged for the flats. In effect, of course, we will be

making  loans to them at least as favourable  as  those

made  to  the former S.I.T. But I think, for accounting

purposes,  it  is  important  that  the  true  cost  of

building  and  maintaining these flats should  be  made

known  to  the public; and the fact that a  subsidy  is

made  to the Housing Board should appear quite properly

in  the ordinary estimates and not disguised as a  form

of  hidden  subsidy, as was the practice in  the  past.

Therefore, once it has been accepted that this  subsidy

should  be  stated openly and entered into the  current

estimates  as  an item of annual recurrent expenditure,

it  is  necessary to examine in what other respect  the

Housing  Board should be subsidised in the interest  of

reducing  rents  to  the minimum, so  that  the  poorer

section  of the community can benefit from the low-cost

houses  that are being put up. Obviously there  is  one

clear  element, that is, the property tax which we  are

charging now on empty flats. I think there is  a  clear

case  for  that, because, unlike private builders,  the

Housing Board is performing a social service. It is not

a profit-making concern. Anything that could reduce the

cost of operation should be carried out. Here again,  I

think  it is practical for us that the full cost which'

the Housing Board would have to pay,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>



if  they  were run on commercial principles, should  be

stated  clearly in the accounts with the  corresponding

subsidy to offset the amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, there are other services performed

by  the  Housing Board, such as the cleansing services.

They  claim  they are being charged the  full  rate  of

property  tax although, at the same time, they  provide

certain  services which are properly the  duty  of  the

City  Council  or,  in this case,  the  Government,  to

provide   from  the  proceeds  of  property   tax.   So

obviously,  they  have a case for  a  subsidy  in  that

respect.  Then  there are minor other  small  items  in

respect  of which there may be a case for subsidy,  hut

these are matters which will be negotiated between  the

Government  and  the  Housing  Board.  We   have   been

discussing  with them, both at official and ministerial

levels,  for  some time with a view to  clarifying  our

ideas so that we can get a proper formula. I am glad to

say  that the Housing Board has only recently submitted

its proposals which are now under examination. I do not

think I will go into more details on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has raised the point on the

menace  of  fire  in certain attap areas.  I  think  he

raised this point on several occasions when other heads

of  expenditure were discussed. Obviously, this subject

is  causing him grave concern. But I do not  think  the

remedy  he  has proposed is a practical one,  that  is.

build houses for these people. We can say we will waive

all  the normal qualifications, such as size of  family

of  income and so on, and ask them to take advantage of

such  flats that we put up for the general public.  But

we  cannot compel them to leave their present homes  to

move into Housing Board flats. It is just not possible.

You  can bring a horse to a stream but you cannot force

it to drink. In the same way, you cannot possibly force

these people to move in. Unless, of course, we want  to

say  that  we  are going to buy up all  this  land  and

demolish   all  these  attap  huts.  That  is   another

proposition. I do not know whether Member  for  Tanglin

has been contemplating that line of action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other point he has made, that is, to

allow  tenants  of  Housing Board flats  to  buy  these

fiats. I confess the idea is attractive to me. You will

encourage  people  to save money and,  of  course,  the

Housing   Board  would  then  have  a  new  source   of

additional  capital with which to build new  houses.  I

say   this  is  something  which  needs  very   careful

thinking, if the Government were to follow this policy.

The Government itself has been considering this subject

for  some time. It has not made up its mind. But if  we

were  to follow this policy, there are changes  in  the

law  that would be necessary. For instance, the  former

S.I.T. was  not  allowed,  under  the  law,  to   sell

properties. I think the Housing Board is operating much

under the same law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we have heard from the Government  side

about  the subsidy. But, at the present moment, we  are

aware  that those tenants who previously lived in  low-rental  premises, and who have now moved  into  Housing

Board properties are being charged higher rentals. This

is  especially  so in the case of those  fire  victims,

with  special  reference  to the  Bukit  Ho  Swee  fire

victims.  There are a few hundred Bukit  Ho  Swee  fire

families  who  are  now living in high  rental  Housing

Board  properties. These properties were cheaper during

the  time  of  the  S.I.T.  But  when  the  S.I.T. was

reorganised  into  the Housing Board,  the  rental  was

raised.  The reason for the increase of this rental  is

the  lack of subsidy. Ever since the fire victims moved

into  occupation,  they could not  afford  to  pay  the

rental.  The  Housing  Board has served  reminders  and

notices warning the tenants that if they do not pay  up

their  rents,  stronger action will  be  instituted  to

evict them.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government should subsidise these

premises  so  as  to enable them to continue  occupying

Housing Board properties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect is that the premises put up recently

by the Housing Board are, on the face of it, said to be

low-cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>



houses when actually they are not. The rent for a  two-room  flat is about $46 a month, compared with  a  two-room  flat in Geylang which is rented out at $35, which

is still considered to be very expensive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the facilities provided in the

premises  are not satisfactory, especially the kitchen,

which  is  very  small. Sometimes, on rainy  days, you

cannot even cook in the kitchen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will also see that the Housing Board has raised

the  rentals especially of those who are living in huts

standing  on  Housing Board land. The rate  of  these

rentals  is  based  on the market value  of  the  attap

houses,  which is about 40 per cent. In  this  way  the

Government  will not be able to assist  the  very  poor

people in Singapore at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Perhaps when the Finance Minister has

settled his first terms of the loans, the repayment  of

the  loans and the quantum and manner of his subsidies,

he  might  be good enough to inform the House of  those

terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect of the problem on which I want

to  speak  is a matter which particularly concerns  the

Minister  for National Development. Sir, we  have  this

afternoon listened to Head D17 - Postal Services - where

two  projects were not carried out - the Macpherson Road

Post  Office  and  Simpang Bedok  Post  Office - merely

because,  in  the  first case, the land  is  now  being

occupied  by  squatters  and  difficulties  have   been

experienced in clearing them. In regard to the  Simpang

Bedok  Post  Office,  although  the  land  is  free  of

squatters,   acquisition  delays  have   taken   place.

Therefore,  the two post offices have not  been  built.

May  I  ask  the Minister this? He has a  vote  of  $41

million for next year, which is $7 million more than he

has   spent,   on   which   performance   I   sincerely

congratulate him. Now, spending $41 million  next  year

is not going to be an easy task. If he can exhaust that

vote,  Sir,  I  think he will merit the thanks  of  the

country.  Before you can build houses,  you  must  have

land, That is self-evident. I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>



to  ask  the  Minister whether he  has  all  this  land

earmarked and whether it is now, in fact, ready to take

these  building  projects on it, or  whether  this  $41

million is merely an expectation of what he hopes to do

and  yet  he  is  now - if I may use the  colloquialism - scrounging round for the land?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the Member for Pasir Panjang

talks  of  the Bukit Ho Swee fire victims, the  Housing

Board rentals and the Housing Board raising Crown rents

in  Housing  Board land. I would like  specifically  to

answer him on this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the Bukit Ho Swee tire, some 16,000 people

were put out from their homes, but quick action by  the

Government ensured that most, if not all, o  them  were

able  to find alternative accommodation within  a  very

short  time.  All  those  who  have  any  knowledge  of

rehabilitation and rehousing problems connected with  a

fire   of   this  magnitude  have  marvelled  at   this

achievement,  in addition, the Government also  ensured

that  these victims would be immediately assisted,  and

various  means of relief had been extended to pay  fire

victims in cash and to assist them in kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no exaggeration to say that every fire victim

family with five persons or more would have received at

least  $500  in  cash  plus various  food  parcels  and

housing  subsidies  for  at least  three  months.  Yet,

because of the possible political capital that could be

made  out  of the big number of victims, a few  of  the

fire victims, also Barisan Sosialis members, have tried

to  organise protest marches and a signature  campaign

against the Government for not helping the fire victims

enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these people went around stirring up tire

victims  and telling them that if they banded  together

behind  the  Barisan Sosialis in the present  political

situation, the Government would be forced to give  more

rental  subsidies, reduce rentals for the  houses  they

live in and so on. They even engineered a group of fire

victims, more gullible than the rest, to petition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>



or  to  go in groups from Minister to Minister in order

that more could be obtained for these victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while everything within reason will be done to

help  the  fire  victims, the Government  Will  not  be

forced  into  doing something that  will  make  them  a

permanent liability in the community. The fire  victims

themselves are capable people who could within a  short

period  readjust  themselves to the new  circumstances.

The  vast  majority  of them have already  so  adjusted

themselves, and in many cases have found that the flats

provided by the Housing and Development Board are  many

times better than what they used to have. Apart from  a

few  difficult  cases for whom special  social  welfare

measures will be used to assist them, the majority  are

satisfied  with  what has been provided  and  have  now

settled down in their new circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the fire victims who are in arrears of rent,

the Housing Board has already agreed that their arrears

can  be  resolved by instalment payments.  Despite  the

fact    that    I   have   personally   informed    the

representatives of these fire victims a week ago  about

this, they have not bothered to inform the fire victims

whom they are supposed to represent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of rents, in which the

Member  for  Pasir Panjang says that rents  of  Housing

Board   flats  are  higher  than  those  of   Singapore

Improvement  Trust  flats, I would say  that  when  the

Housing  Board  came  into being as  successor  to  the

Singapore Improvement Trust, the organisation for  the

implementation  of  Government  public  housing  policy

underwent  a complete reorganisation. Every  effort  is

made  to  cut down costs and to increase the number  of

public housing units to be constructed. Where 1,000  to

2,000 houses were built on the average per annum by the

Singapore Improvement Trust, the subsidy was  about  $3

million.  The Housing Development Board is now required

to  build on the average 10,000 units a year.  But  the

Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>



not  agreed to increase the subsidy and the  Board  for

the  first  two  years has been required  to  carry  on

within  the limits of the $3 million deficit per annum.

This  being  so,  the Board has found it  necessary  to

charge  economic  rents  for  those  buildings  it  has

completed and let out to the people. In many cases  the

projects were originally planned with land acquired  at

very  high  prices: for instance, in Clarence  Lane  at

$2.89  per  square foot, and Selegie Road  at  $10  per

square  foot.  It  is not expected that  rents  can  be

brought  down although the Housing Board has been  able

to reduce the cost of construction by 20 to 30 per cent

in  every  case.  It is therefore not fair  to  compare

rents charged by the S.I.T., which had almost unlimited

funds  of  subsidies,  1,000 to 2,000  units,  against

those  charged by the Housing Board which are  in  most

cases  economic rentals. Sir, the Review  Committee  of

the  Government  and  the  Party  has, however, drawn

attention  to the fact that rents are high and  tenants

have found difficulty in paying them. The Housing Board

has,   in   the  meantime,  devised  new   methods   of

construction and provided one-room self-contained units

which, with a slight subsidy, can be let out at  $20  a

month.  The Government is actively pursuing the  review

of  the  rental  structure with a  view  to  getting  a

definite rental policy for the future. This is  a  very

complicated  matter  and will need  detailed  study  in

order  that the subsidy may not be in such a proportion

as to become a burden in future at the expense of other

social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment. Sir, rents are based on the

following  items:  loan charges, which  depend  on  the

rates   of   interest  and  period   of   amortisation.

management and administrative costs, annual maintenance

and periodical redecoration and property tax. Hence  if

the  initial cost of a building is high, then the rents

will  be proportionately higher than others. It is  not

true  to  say that the Housing Board rents  are  higher

than  the  rents  of  the Singapore Improvement  Trust,

because  in many of the cases where the S.T.T. had  let

out  its  flats at economic rentals, these  were  flats

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>



were  more highly subsidised than those charged by  the

Housing  Board. It is only in those cases where  S.I.T.

flats  had higher subsidies that the rents compare  low

with  those  now  charged, it is the intention  of  the

Government eventually to reach a position where  people

can  rent  flats from the Housing Board at  rentals  of

$20,  $40  and $60 for one-, two- and three-room  accom

modation  respectively in normal  housing  estates.  In

special  circumstances, for instance, in central  areas

where  land  costs  are high, these rates  may  not  be

maintained  and special consideration may  have  to  be

given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Pasir Panjang mentions that a two-room flat, i.e., one room and a hail, built by the

Housing Board is rented out at $40 to $46, whereas  the

rental  for a similar type of fiat in Kallang built  by

the S.I.T. is only $35. Sir, this aspect of the rent of

the  Kallang  fiats  was  touched  upon  last  year.  I

mentioned  that though the rental is $35, the  economic

rent  should  be  somewhere around $78 or  $79.  So  the

subsidy  is  in  the region of about $40.  Whereas  the

rental  charged for a Housing Board flat at $40 to  $46

is  an  economic rent and Government does not  have  to

subsidise it.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the raising of ground rent in Housing Board

land,  I have already touched on this question  when  I

spoke  about land and resettlement earlier in the  day.

As I said, some of the people who live on land acquired

by  the Housing Board have not been paying rent, or the

landowners  have  not been able to  collect  rent  from

them.  Now  the  Housing  Board has  an  administrative

machine  which is efficient, and when these people  are

charged  according to the area of the land they occupy,

there  is a hue and cry to the effect that the  Housing

Board is raising the ground rent. This is not correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

1959, the P.A.P. Government made a promise regarding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>



the  allocation  of  houses to the  fire  victims.  The

Minister for Culture does not seem to be happy. I would

like  to quote the promise made by the P.A.P. in  1959 - one  or  two sentences about the P.A.P. housing  policy

from The Tasks Ahead (Part I) printed in Chinese:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The previous and present governments have never

considered the housing needs of kampong dwellers.  This

aspect  of  housing will be  seriously  studied  by  our

future  government.  Many of the Kampong  Tiong  Bahru

fire victims will tell you that they want to live in  a

place where they can literally "live off the ground".'



<br><br>This  was  a promise by the P.A.P. The victims  of  the

Bukit Ho Swee fire are dissatisfied with the policy  of

the  Government on housing. Many of them at  that  time

lived in attap houses in the kampong areas. They reared

chickens,  ducks, etc, and they had land  on  which  to

grow vegetables and fruits. Now the Government has  not

considered the problem of their occupations.  They  had

houses  to  live in, and all along they were  depending

for their livelihood on the rearing of chickens and the

growing of fruits. Though they now have houses to  live

in, they do not have the land to produce vegetables and

fruits.  This  is  a hardship to them.  Therefore,  the

Bukit  Ho Swee fire victims are not satisfied with  the

way the Government is tackling their housing problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not know whether I heard the Minister

right  or  not, but I do not think he has  answered  my

question whether he is still scrounging around for  the

land or not. Perhaps he will answer me when I sit down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I wish to raise and which

arises  out of the Minister's speech is this.  He  says

that the Housing Board fixes rents on certain factors - loan  charges, amortisation charges, property  tax  and

administrative  charges. These are  the  usual  matters

that go into the question of what tent should be fixed.

The  Minister for Finance has said that insofar as  the

loan  charges are concerned, he has not arrived at  any

decision.  Insofar  as  the  amortisation  charges  are

concerned, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>



has  not  arrived at any decision. I am just  wondering

how  the Housing Board is able to fix the rents of  the

houses  they are now building and renting out. It  must

be  a  hit-and-miss  rental they  are  now  fixing  and

thinking that the Minister for Finance might agree on a

certain  rate  of interest and on a certain  manner  of

repayment.  So perhaps both the Ministers know  exactly

what the terms are, but we do not know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. The Singapore Improvement

Trust has been subjected to a left-handed attack by the

Minister. The Trust does not exist any more, but I  was

a  member of the Trust once upon a time and I continued

to be a trustee until 1957. I think, in fairness to the

Trust, somebody must defend it and I am going to defend

it.  The  only subsidy the Singapore Improvement  Trust

received in respect of its housing projects was on  the

question  of  the  cost of the land made  available  by

Government  to  the Trust. That could be  considered  a

form  of subsidy. The other form of subsidy which could

be  considered  as  such was the low rate  of  interest

which  the  Legislative Assembly had  to  agree  to  by

resolution  in  respect  of  every  loan  made  to  the

Singapore Improvement Trust. On pages 562 to 565 of the 1962  Estimates,

there is a list of the loans  made  by

the Government at various periods. In Loan for Building

Scheme  (No.  1), the rate of interest  was  three  per

cent.  The date of repayment was half-yearly.  In  Loan

for  Building Scheme (No. 2), $5 million, the  rate  of

interest  was three per cent; Loan for Building  Scheme

(No.  3), three per cent; Loan for Building Scheme (No.

4),  four  per cent; Loan for Building Scheme (No.  5),

four  per cent; Loan for Building Scheme (No. 6),  four

per  cent; Loan for Building Scheme (No. 7), three  per

cent; Loan for Building Scheme (No. 8) 5� per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 5� per cent is not a

subsidised  rate  of interest, but I  think  that  most

people  will agree that three per cent was,  in  fact,

the  subsidised rate of interest which the  Legislative

Assembly  sought by resolution every time the loan  was

made,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>



so   that   the   only  subsidy  which  the   Singapore

Improvement  Trust received was in a  reduced  rate  of

payment   of   the  land - if  it  was  Crown  land - which

Government made available, and in the rate of  interest

which  Government made available insofar as  the  loans

were concerned. These were the only two factors of  any

form  of subsidy that I know of. The Minister has  said

that the Singapore Improvement Trust was subsidised  to

the  extent  of  $3 million. I think, if  I  heard  him

rightly, in respect of housing. I venture to suggest to

him  that that is not correct at all. I would  like  to

hear   him  say  how  the  Government  subsidised   the

Singapore Improvement Trust to the extent of $3 million

every year on its housing projects. If the Minister  is

merely trying to get out of his own little difficulties

in  respect  of  the Housing Board by saying  that  the

Singapore  Improvement  Trust  was  subsidised  to  the

extent of $3 million a year, then I think he is going a

little bit too far.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would like to make just a brief

reply  to the question raised by the Member for Farrer

Park.  I  am not certain whether, in fact, the rate  of

interest of three per cent was below the market rate at

the time the loans were approved. It was well below the

market rate. Of course, there was an element of subsidy

there, but I think the more important thing is that the

former  S.I.T. had 60 years to pay back. I think  there

is   a  greater  element  of  subsidy  in  respect   of

amortisation. When I said that no agreement was reached

between the Housing Board and the Government, I  meant,

of  course, no firm agreement, but that does  not  mean

that  we did not come to sonic understanding about what

could  be  the  form of final agreement. Speaking  from

recollection - I   think   I   have   a    very    clear

recollection - the  Housing Board was  calculating  on  a

repayment basis of 60 years and an interest rate at the

market rate. It was therefore not hazarding a guess one

way or another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make just a rejoinder to the Member

for  Havelock. He made the point that the Bukit Ho Swee

fire victims were neglected because when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>



we  housed  them  in  flats we  deprived  them  of  the

facilities for the rearing of pigs, ducks, chickens and

the  growing  of  vegetables, and so forth.  Now,  Sir,

surely everybody knows that the reason why the Bukit Ho

Swee  fire  was so calamitous was that it  was  a  very

congested area. I was there myself before the  fire  on

several  occasions in the course of my official duties,

and  it  was  so  congested that there  were  no  roads

between  the  attap houses. There were  just  footpaths

about  three or four feet wide, and that was all. Under

those  circumstances, could it be seriously  maintained

that  large  numbers of people were growing vegetables,

rearing  pigs,  ducks and poultry? If, in  fact,  there

were  large numbers of farmers in this area,  the  fire

would  not have been so disastrous, it is true  that  a

few people did keep a flock of birds. When T was there,

I  did see a pig resting on its back and possibly a few

piglings,  hut this is not a major problem at  all.  To

suggest that we have let down the victims because we do

not  allow  them land or facilities for the rearing  of

pigs,  ducks  and  chickens, I think,  is  too  utterly

ridiculous.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

National Development mentioned a little while ago  that

the  Government did not want the fire victims to  be   a

permanent  liability to the community. I do  not  think

anyone of us wants that to happen, Sir. But surely  the

Government  must  realise  that  this  was  a  national

calamity - as  they have said - and  that  those  fire

victims  were used to paying only low rents.  They  are

poor people and they cannot possibly afford to live  in

flats  which  are let out at rentals of $60  to  $70  a

month.  If the whole income of a family man amounts  to

only  $100  a  month,  surely the Government  does  not

expect him to pay rent amounting to $60 or $70. Do  you

not think that the Government should be more reasonable

and  be more compassionate in their policies in respect

of people who have experienced such a calamity?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want an assurance, Sir, from the Minister that he

will  give due consideration to all the just grievances

of the fire victims.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member for

Farrer Park about land being available for development,

I  can  assure him that for our programmes in 1962  and

1963, the land is available, and it is just a matter of

carrying out the plans.

resolve it in the other areas too.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Queenstown, when I

mentioned  just  now about the Barisan  Sosialis  being

involved in stirring up trouble among the fire victims,

he  was the Member who led a team of representatives to

see  me.  He marched into my office without  making  an

appointment, and I had an appointment at that time with

some  people. I came out and told him, "Mr  Lee,  you

know,  I  am  quite a busy man. I have an appointment."

And  you know what he said to me, Sir, in front of  the

fire  victims?  "Well, since I am here, can't  you  see

me?"  Sir, I had the politeness to go out and tell  him

that  I had an appointment at that time and that I  was

meeting  somebody. But he did not have the  decency  to

accept  what I told him. He wanted to make  a  show  in

front of these fire victims, just to impress them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everything possible has been done for these fire

victims in the first few months. It is now entering the

seventh  month.  Some  of these  victims  have  genuine

grievances,  and  I  promised the representatives,  who

came  with the Member for Queenstown, that I would look

into them. That was the first time. The second time, of

course,  the Member did not turn up for fear  his  name

would  be linked with the trouble amongst the Bukit  Ho

Swee fire victims. But to these representatives, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>



promised that the cases of those who had their  rentals

in  arrears  due to difficulties would be looked  into.

For  those  who really owed about four to five  months'

rent,  I  would  instruct the Housing  and  Development

Board not to take action against them but to allow them

to  pay by instalments. Sir, the agreement reached with

the representatives was written in the form of a letter

to  one of the representatives. But this representative

and  the other members of the team who came to  see  me

did  not  even bother to go back to these fire  victims

and  inform them of what I had decided to do for  them.

And now we hear from the Member for Queens-town that he

wants  an assurance from me that I will do all I  could

for those people. Sir, all that could be done for these

people will be done. There will be investigations  into

all  those  individual cases where they say  they  have

hardship. But it is difficult, Sir, for us to  pinpoint

those   who  really  have  difficulties.  The   Barisan

Sosialis want us to believe that all these fire victims

are  in difficulties. But I can assure this House, Sir,

that  some of these families are living in high  rental

flats  which they have specifically asked for  and  are

paying rental. So how could you say that all these fire

victims are people who only earn about $100 a month and

pay  rental at $60 a month? Sir, there are victims  who

are housed in the $20-flats that have been completed in

Bukit Ho Swee. Altogether 900 units have been completed

and  more  than 800 of these fire victim  families  are

living   in   these  $20-flats.  Yet  the  Member   for

Queenstown says we require the fire victims to pay  $60

rental. What rubbish is that!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for National

Development  has seen fit to link the Barisan  Sosialis

with all the troubles that are cropping up.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Unfortunately it is true!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we do not mind being linked

up.  We  are  fighting for the just grievances  of  the

people, and if, by doing so, our Party gets linked  up,

we are happy, and we shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>



not  mind  getting our names linked up.  But  from  the

story  you  have heard from the Minister  for  National

Development,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, you know  straightaway

that he is merely showing off his so-called patriotism.

As  a representative of the people, Sir, if I could not

lead any delegation to see the Minister, then what  are

elected   representatives  for?  On   this   particular

occasion, Sir, these fire victims happened to be housed

in  Queenstown. I am the Member for Queenstown, and  it

was  only  right that they came to me. And I, at  their

request, led them to see the Minister. Sir, I have been

to  see you on many occasions without any prior notice.

Yet -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Now I think the hon. Member for

Queenstown is trying to link the Speaker with it! I do

not think he ought to do that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But for the Minister to say that I

had to make an appointment before I could see him, then

I say he does not deserve to be a Minister. Surely he

must realise that he is also, or rather was, an elected

representative of the people. Does he mean to say that

he is sitting on such a high pedestal? That he has only

to look down -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Queenstown is misrepresenting the Minister. The

Minister simply said that he had somebody with him and

could not see the Member for Queenstown. That is all he

said. Let him not misrepresent what has been said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well. I will quote the words that

he  used, Sir. He said that I marched into his  office.

Sir, I went with the delegation at about 9 o'clock  and

we  waited for him until 9.35 am. If he denied that, he

can  look  it up. We waited 35 minutes for the Minister

who is supposed to come to office at 9 o'clock. When he

came in, I very politely asked him - I called him by  his

name,  "Kia  Gan, what about seeing us  for  a  little

while?"   He   very   politely  spoke   to   me,   but,

unfortunately, he went into his room and must have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>



rung  up  his chief somewhere who, in  turn,  must

have directed him, I suppose, to put me off. After

that,  when  he came out again - and I  can  produce

witnesses, Sir - he completely ignored me. I did not

mind  that, Sir, as I knew that was what was going

to  happen. He spoke instead to the delegation. He

put   on  airs  and  said,  "You  never  made   an

appointment  with me. You can't come to  see  me."

The people cannot go to see the Minister. Sir!  Is

that what he is trying to tell us? Is he trying to

tell  us  that, as a representative of the people,

the people cannot see him? I remember, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member has made

his  point.  It  is completely irrelevant  to  the

subject we are discussing. He has made his point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not pursue that part

of it then. He said that I never want to see him a

second time. Can I refer to that?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think it is completely

irrelevant now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I only want to point out that

he distorted the story.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is on the record.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, to say that

these  people  have  no  just  grievances  is  not

correct. If out of 100 people, one or two  persons

happen  to be able to afford to pay high  rentals,

it does not mean that the other 98 persons will be

able  to  afford such high rentals. The mere  fact

that  these fire victims had been staying in Bukit

Ho  Swee  is  proof  enough that  they  could  not

possibly afford to pay high rentals. Nobody  would

like to live in an attap hut, Sir. Everybody would

like to live in beautiful Government bungalows and

pay  only a small rental. These fire victims  lost

not only their homes but all their belongings, and

the  Minister  now comes here and  tells  us  that

these people can afford to pay high rentals! If  a

few people are found to be able to afford, because

of help from friends



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>



or  other  business,  then I  think  the  Minister

should  be  fair enough to say that  the  majority

really  cannot afford. As a Government elected  by

the  people,  it is only fair that the  Government

should lock after the interests of the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister wish to reply to

that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan</b> indicated absent.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is only a small matter. I would like to

know  what sort of rural development projects  the

Minister has in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

from the Four-Year Development Plan we can see

that the P.A.P. Government intends to allot half a

million dollars for rural development projects.

But since 1960 up to now the so-called rural

development projects have not been implemented.

and the Government has not disclosed anything

concrete in relation to these projects. Yet in

every yearly Budget the Government provides nearly

$500,000 as provision for rural development

projects. How is this? Does it mean that the

Minister for Finance imagines that if there is a

provision of about half a million dollars, it will

make the Budget look impressive? Does it mean that

the Government by making this provision is showing

that it is interested in rural development and is

paying attention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>



to the interests of the rural people? Does it mean that

the  Government intends to reserve this sum so that  it

will  not  be used on other items of expenditure?  Last

year, the actual sum spent on this item did not amount

to  $30,000.  From this the people can see whether  the

Government  is  sincere in its rural  development.  The

Government  still  insists  on  using  very   beautiful

phrases,   such  as  we  see  here - "Rural   Development

Projects" - for the purposes of propaganda  and  to  make

the people who live in the rural areas believe that the

Government  is  still  very much concerned  with  their

livelihood.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people have a right to know what are the so-called rural development projects, and what kind of

benefit  these can give them. Therefore, the Government

should  say  clearly what is the content of  these  so-called   rural  development  projects.  The  Government

should  not waste time by taking a propaganda  line  by

mentioning  in  very  vague  terms  the  provision   of

$500,000 under this item. Mr Speaker, in the Four-Year

Development  Plan issued by the Government  last  year,

you will be able to see on page 66, under Table 7.3. on

the item, "Other Rural Development," that the total sum

there  is  $700,000. This was meant to be  used  up  in

1962. If we look at the provision of $700,000 for rural

development  projects  in  1962,  we  know  that  these

projects  will  not be completed because the  estimated

expenditure  in  1962  amounts  to  $470,200.  But  the

balance  required lo complete the projects is $200,000.

This  shows  that the Government is unable to  complete

the  work. From this very small item, we can know  that

the Government's so-called development projects are all

bankrupt.  The  very small provision of  $700,000  will

have  to  be  used up in 1962. From this we doubt  very

much  whether  all  this work can  be  completed.  Only

heaven knows when they will be able to use up all  this

provision.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan Kia Gan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> There is a provision of $470,200

under  subhead  3, "Rural Development  Projects."  This

provision  is  required  for  the  following   schemes:

fishery  training scheme, $20,000; Film unit,  $11,350;

Diesel  outboard  engine  hire  scheme,  $15,000;  soil

testing   and  anti-pest  service,  $1,100;  four   new

veterinary  extension centres, $130,700;  goat  scheme,

$34,000;  expenditure on improvement for  the  Southern

Islands,  $180,000; concrete platforms for  standpipes,

$5,000;  water  supply to Pulau Tekong,  $34,000;  and

miscellaneous, $38,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock accuses us of just having the

provision only for propaganda purposes. I think  it  is

necessary  for me to put him wise about  what  we  have

done.  The  Member  for Upper Serangoon  is  not  here.

During  last  year's debate on the Budget  speech,  the

Member  for Upper Serangoon sang a lot of high  praises

for  the Finance Minister. He said all the schemes  and

all  the things we set out to do for the year 1961 were

something which only the Finance Minister could do.  In

other  words,  the ex-P.A.P. Members  who  are  sitting

opposite  there,  thought at that  time  that  all  our

projects were good ones. But now that they are  on  the

opposite  side, they say different things. Sir,  before

the  P.A.P. Government assumed office in July 1959, the

Departments   of   Agriculture,  Veterinary   Services,

Fisheries,   Co-operative   Development    and    Rural

Development  were separate departments. Each  of  these

departments  had  some  sort of  extension  service  in

operation.  For example, the extension service  of  the

Agriculture Department was limited to only an  advisory

service  for farmers who approached the department  for

assistance.  The  Fisheries Department  had  a  similar

advisory  service, as well as a mobile unit which  went

round  the  various fishing villages to teach fishermen

how  to maintain and repair their fishing boat engines.

The  Veterinary  Department had  a  free  anti-ranikhet

inoculation service for poultry as well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>



as  a  Farm Animal Disease Treatment service under  the

charge of only one qualified veterinary officer.  There

were  only four disease treatment centres for the whole

island. These services were extremely limited in scope.

After  the  P.A.P. Government assumed office  in  1959,

immediate  steps were taken to step up  these  services

and  to  start  new ones in order to  ensure  that  the

farmers and fishermen are given adequate assistance  to

improve  their technique. For instance, the  number  of

disease  treatment centres was increased  to  six.  The

number  of  veterinary  officers  in  charge  of  these

centres  was  increased to live, so that farmers  could

get  their sick pigs and poultry attended to much  more

quickly.  In order to reduce the mortality of  chickens

during the first few weeks of their lives, a new scheme

for  the  inoculation of day-old chicks  in  the  natal

cavity was also started. Pigs of good strain were  sold

to  farmers at cheap prices to improve their stock. The

number of boars used for the free stud boar service was

also  increased at the same time. In order to help  the

farmers  to  plough their land by mechanical  means  to

increase  the  productivity  of  their  land,  a  cheap

ploughing  service was started with  one  tractor.  The

number  of tractors was later increased to three  as  a

result  of  the popularity of the service. Experimental

work  on  animal  improvement was  intensified  at  the

Sembawang  and  Lirn  Chu  Kang Experimental  Stations.

Experimental .work was also carried out to find a cheap

fertiliser mixer as a substitute for prawn dung.  These

experiments  have proved successful and steps  arc  now

being taken to arrange for the sale of these fertiliser

mixers to farmers in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two fishery training courses were also started in

Pasir  Panjang  to  teach youths the  construction  and

repair  of  fishing nets and fishing gears.  They  were

also  taught the repair and maintenance of fishing boat

engines  as well as the building and repair of  fishing

boats.  In  order  to  assist Malay  fishermen  in  the

Southern Islands to diversify their productive activity

a goat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>



rearing  scheme  has  been  started  in  four  islands,

namely, Ayer Merbau, Ayer Merlimau, Seraya and Termolo.

A  total of 201 goats purchased specially from Kelantan

have  been  distributed to a total of  76  families  in

these islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962, it is proposed to expand some of the

existing schemes, and also to start new ones to further

assist  the  farmers and fishermen. For  instance,  the

disease  treatment  service will  be   extended  by  the

construction of four new veterinary extension  centres,

one  in  each of the following areas: Tampines, Changi,

Yio Chu Kang and Thomson Road.

notice  from the figures that only a meagre performance

has been carried out by the Ministry of Health and Law.

Although  a  suitable sum has been  budgeted  for  this

time, we hope the Government will be able to carry  out

all   their  projects  under  this  head.  The   actual

been spent, and the Minister has told us that the works

and buildings are nearly completed.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> The building plans are nearly complete.

The building itself will be completed before the end of

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister

for  Health and Law tell us what is the cause  of  this

delay in the Thomson Road Hospital?



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before we became the

Government,  we  announced  our  medical  plan  and  we

appointed  a  doctor as the Parliamentary Secretary  in

the  Health  Ministry. When I took over  that  Ministry

three  months ago, I was surprised and shocked to  find

that  very little had been planned. One building  which

had  been planned was the Still Road clinic. The piling

has just been done. The plans are completed and tenders

will  be  going out. The next clinic to be planned  was

the  Queenstown  combined clinic.  Building  operations

will  begin on the 15th of this month. As Minister  for

Labour I had pressed for a clinic in Kampong Bugis  and

I  was  able to get the Kampong Bugis community  centre

and clinic built. But other than these three buildings,

I  was  very  shocked to see the state  in  which  this

Ministry  had been left. Very little planning had  been

done.  That  is  why  everybody is disgruntled  in  the

Health Ministry. Surely the blame should be laid at the

door  of  the former Parliamentary Secretary. He  is  a

doctor.  He  knows the conditions in  the  Ministry  of

Health better than anybody else does.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I agree with the Minister that he

should be shocked. But the shock should not be directed

towards the ex-Parliamentary Secretary, but towards the

Finance  Minister because he had been  too  ham-fisted.

All the money had been kept back by him. The plans were

all  ready but the money was not forthcoming,  although

it was voted for and budgeted for. Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Sir, that is not true. I have gone into all

this.  When  we became the Government, we  changed  the

system  of  organisation in the Ministry of Finance.  I

remember  sitting through all this and  discussing  it.

The  Treasury  was  broken up into  two  sections,  the

Treasury Sec, lion and the Development Section.  It  is

true  that  the  Treasury  Section  goes  through   all

estimates with a fine comb. That is their duty. That is

the purpose of a good Treasury Section. But in the case

of  the Development Section, the idea is to spend money

on  development  projects. That is why the  Development

Section  was introduced. It has been functioning  well.

How  is  it that other development projects are carried

out  in  the other Ministries? It is because there  are

people  in the other Ministries planning these projects

and pressing them on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Minister

for Health says is entirely not true. If you will allow

me  to  read out all those items provided for  in  last

year's  Budget  sittings, you will be  shocked  because

quite a number of items were not completed or not  even

spent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Probably other Ministers might

get  equal shocks, but let us confine ourselves to  the

Ministry  of  Health.  Does the Member  for  Queenstown

require a vote?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a vote for Alterations to Mortuary, and

the  vote  asked  for  is $80,000.  I  would  like  the

Minister  to  consider whether  it  will  not  be  more

economical  to  build  a  new mortuary  than  to  spend

$80,000 just on alterations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the work which

could  not  be  done  last year because  the  provision

entered  was inadequate. A sum of $20,000 was provided.

I   am   informed  that  the  mortuary  is  in  a  very

unsatisfactory  condition. There is no  proper  waiting

room  or lavatories for the public. There is inadequate

office space for the Coroner. I believe he has to  look

at  dead  bodies out in the open. There is insufficient

space   for   mortuary  staff.  There   is   inadequate

ventilation,  poor lighting and lack of storage  space.

The  mortuary tables are unsatisfactory and it  is  not

possible  at  present  to conduct examinations  without

blood  and  other fluids contaminating the  floor.  The

drainage is also unsatisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these alterations will provide long-needed improvements and facilities for the public. The

drawings have been completed and we are ready  to  call

for tenders. The work will commence early next year. In

this case, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no need for us to

build   another  mortuary.  The  alterations  will   be

sufficient to improve it. It will cost very  more  than

$80,000 to build a new mortuary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You remember, Sir, we said a few days back that

a  lot  of  money  had not been  spent  from  the

Ministry of Health and Law, and this is  a  clear

indication  of the P.A.P. not having  kept  their

promises  to  serve  the  people.  $3.7   million

budgeted   for,  but  not  spent.  We  are   just

wondering whether or not they are using the money

instead   on   something  else.  As  we   already

indicated the other day, possibly they  might  be

using the money to earn interest elsewhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand, all these projects have not

been  carried out simply because of the  staffing

personnel  not being ready. They are afraid  they

might  have  to  build  white  elephants  without

anybody to staff these buildings and projects. If

they  had  only  carried out all their  promises,

Sir, if they had the personnel to look after  all

these projects, then I am sure the facilities and

convenience  to  the  people  would   have   been

considerably  improved. Now that  the  Government

have budgeted for extra expenditure this year, we

hope  they  will  carry  out  their  promises  as

regards the health services.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to

subhead  8, these are renovations and alterations

to  wards  of the General Hospital. Much  of  the

work has already been completed. There is only  a

very  little more to be done to Ward 43, and then

the   whole  project  of  renovations   will   be

completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to subhead 11, Mr Speaker, Sir,

this is money to provide for another store to the

outpatients  clinic at the General  Hospital,  to

provide  storage  space for  the  pre-packing  of

medicines, and to provide additional space for  a

dispensary   store  to  relieve  the   congestion

because of lack of space. The attendance at  this

outpatients clinic is about 3,500 a day. There is

very  little  space available and the  dispensary

there  is very cramped. It is proposed to  extend

the dispensary facilities with this vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 13. This is for the installation of a

new  boiler. There were two old boilers. One  has

already  been  replaced some time ago,  and  this

provision  is for the purchase of another  boiler

to  replace  the second old boiler  and  also  to

provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>



sterilizing  equipment. These boilers are required  to

supply hot water to the wards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 14 is a vote to provide facilities for an

outpatient clinic in Medical Unit I. The present space

arrangements   are  improvised  and   inadequate   and

unsatisfactory.  The  idea  is  to  provide  the  same

outpatient facilities for Medical Unit I, as there are

in Medical Unit II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to subhead 27, this is an extension to

the  present  dispensary at Kandang  Kerbau  Hospital,

which is inadequate for present requirements, and also

to provide a waiting room for outpatients. In the Bulk

Store,  the alteration would be to provide  space  for

dental stores which have been transferred from Maxwell

Road  and  to  provide office space  for  the  general

surgical store staff. Tenders have been called for and

the work has started.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reads "Markets - Works and Buildings". In the 1961 Development

Estimates, details were given as  to

the  sites  where these markets were to be built,  but

this  has not been done for 1962. I am less interested

in the sites than in wanting to know the policy of the

Government  in  regard to markets  vis-a-vis  hawkers.

There  is  a tendency now for hawkers' pitches  to  be

built around the markets. If the Government think that

this is desirable, then I would suggest that a lot  of

saving  could be made by not building markets, because

if  you  build them and you ask people to go in,  they

will  not  have  business at  all.  According  to  the

revised  plan cost, the amount is $3,808,900. I  think

we  could save this money and put it to better use. If

the  Government  feel it is better  to  have  hawkers'

pitches,  then  have  them on all the  proposed  sites

instead  of  building  markets with  hawkers'  pitches

surrounding  them, so that no one can  go  into  them,

with the result that the stalls in the markets are not

occupied.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, there are now two or three

two-storey markets. They have not proved successful. I

wonder  whether the Minister will look into the policy

of the construction of such markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the hawkers, the Member for Cairnhill has

already  touched on this question. But I think  it  is

only  fair that the Minister should clarify the policy

as regards pitches in and around the markets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Members know, under

the  Municipal by-laws, it is an offence to  put  up  a

hawker's stall within 50 yards of a market. That by-law

is  being  flouted by hawkers generally. The Government

will be announcing its new policy on hawkers very soon.

The  intention is to charge a nominal licence  fee  for

hawkers who are both itinerant and who occupy permanent

pitches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the markets are concerned, those hawkers

who  ply  their  trade  outside  the  markets  will  be

required  to pay the same fee that is payable by  those

who are in the markets. That is the only way of dealing

with  the situation. This will induce them to  take  up

positions in the markets as the stalls fall vacant,  so

that  there  must  be  a differentiation  made  between

hawkers  who  ply  their trade  in  pitches  away  from

markets and hawkers who ply their trade in the vicinity

of  markets. It is only by equating the fees of hawkers

who  ply their trade in the vicinity of markets to  the

stallholders inside that you can control the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the two-storey markets, I will look into the

matter.  There  might  be a need in  certain  congested

areas where market facilities are inadequate for us  to

build upwards. However, we will go very thoroughly into

that question before making any decision.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I want  to  bring  up  a

problem   concerning   my  constituency.   Last   year,

provision was made for the building of a new Serangoon.

Gardens  market, but after about half a year now,  this

market has not been opened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister when the Government wants

to   open  that  market,  because  the  people  in   my

constituency have a great need for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> As there is only a little more work to be

done, it will be completed very soon. I think we will

be able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>



to  open  the  market by January. The work  is  nearly

finished.

in respect of item (2) of subhead 44.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(19) That the sum to be allocated for Head D25 be reduced by $10

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 44*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outpatient services of the Government have been

a  great  disappointment. The  outpatient  clinics  and

dispensaries  which were supposed to  have  been  built

have  not  been  forthcoming. The money voted  for  the

clinics  in 1961 has not been used. As we have  already

pointed  out, the combined clinics, the Kallang Outdoor

Dispensary and other outdoor clinics have not  come  up

to expectations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>



Surely  the  Government realise that in their  election

platform in 1959 they had made a specific promise  that

they would bring the medical and health services to the

people.  In  this, the Government has failed miserably.

Let  us  hope  that in the coming year  something  will

really be done.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D25 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 44."



<br><br>The  debate may range over item (2) of subhead  44  and

the whole of subhead 44.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have touched

on this before when the Member for Queenstown discussed

the provision of outpatient clinics in the Estimates of

the Ministry of Health then under review in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, we have a plan to divide the island into a

number  of  areas with the main roads of  Singapore  as

dividers. We hope to build clinics between Changi Road,

Geylang  Road  and  the sea. In that area,  as  Members

know, the Kallang Clinic is now being extended. We have

received  clearance  for funds to  turn  the  community

centre  at  Siglap into an outpatient clinic  with  one

doctor  in  charge, and work will be proceeding  almost

immediately. Further up, in Still Road, the piling  has

been  done  for  a  combined clinic. This  clinic  will

provide outpatient facilities as well as maternity  and

child  welfare  facilities and also dental  facilities.

Further  up  Changi  Road, at Peng Ghee  Road,  we  are

building  a  new maternity and child health clinic  for

the  Kampong Chai Chee area. And still further  up  the

road,  at  Somapah Road, we are building an  outpatient

clinic there. So these clinics will cover the east side

of the island between Changi Road, Geylang Road and the

sea.   In  between  Changi  Road,  Geylang  Road,   and

Serangoon Road, we already have the maternity and child

welfare clinic and ante-natal clinic at Lim Ah Pin Road

and  we  hope to build a standard outpatient clinic  in

Kampong Chai Cheng in Yio Chu Kang.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is , an outpatient clinic at

Jalan  Kayu  and in the Thomson Road area, the  Housing

Board  is  putting up a clinic for us in the  Sembawang

area.  We  hope to build also an outpatient clinic  for

the  Thomson  Road  Hospital in the  Hospital  grounds.

Going  on from there, in the Bukit Timah area, we  have

the  present maternity and child health clinic  at  the

7th  milestone. There is a vacant piece of land  behind

which is used as a store for the Health Department.  We

propose to put up an outpatient clinic there so that we

will  have a combined clinic here. There is already  an

outpatient  clinic with two doctors at  Bukit  Panjang.

Going into Jurong, we shall build a small clinic at the

14th  milestone.  At Thong Hoe Village,  the  community

centre there has been turned into a maternity and child

health  centre. Coming back into Bukit Timah  Road,  at

Kranji, we are turning the community centre there  into

a  small  outpatient clinic and a maternity  and  child

health  clinic.  Going into Pasir Panjang,  we  already

have  a  clinic  at the 5� milestone, a  maternity  and

child health centre at Kay Hai Road, and we propose  to

build a combined clinic in Keppel Road so that if could

serve the dock area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have built these clinics, it will relieve the

pressure  on  the  general  outpatient  clinic  at  the

General  Hospital. We will turn the  North  Canal  Road

Clinic  into  an  outpatient clinic for all  Government

officers and City Council employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the town area, Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope to put up

an  outpatient  clinic in a bombed  site  in  Bencoolen

Street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the projects we have in mind and we shall

complete most of them by next year.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  talking about outpatient clinics, the Minister  has

just  now  mentioned many projects. I want to  ask  the

Minister  whether these projects have been carried  out

or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote a letter at the beginning of this year to the

Ministry  of  Health  asking them when  the  Chia  Keng

clinic would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>



be  completed. They replied that this clinic would  be

completed  this year. So far the work has not  started

yet. Perhaps it will be completed next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been offered a

piece of land in Serangoon Garden Estate. But it is  a

bit  too  far away from the main road, and the  public

cannot  be expected to make good use of the clinic  if

it  is some distance from the main road. So that  site

is  not suitable. If we could have used that site, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  a clinic would have been  built  there

before  now. We have to look for another site  in  Yio

Chu Kang Road. There is a site available at the corner

of  Highland Road and Yio Chu Kang Road which is ideal

for  the  purpose. We will have to acquire that  site

for  the  purpose.  All  this takes  a  lot  of  time.

Suitable sites have to be carefully selected. But  now

that  we have the site, Mr Speaker. Sir, and we  know

the  locality, we will be able to acquire the land and

get  on with the work. And that is what we propose  to

do.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It has taken the Minister quite

some time to get on with the idea. For example, I know

the  Poly Clinic in Queenstown was scheduled  to  have

been  completed before the end of this year. What  has

happened?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that question should be

referred to the gentleman who sits on his left.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Minister  for  Health and Law wants me to  answer  the

question, I will certainly answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all I do not know how the question could

ever  be  directed  to  me, because  I  never  held  a

ministerial  appointment in the  Ministry  of  Health.

Nevertheless, even though I was only the Parliamentary

Secretary,  I had urged the Cabinet so many  times  to

get  things going It was the Finance Minister who  was

the  stumbling  block to all my appeals,  because  his

argument  was that since we were not able to find  the

doctors  to  staff  the clinic, why  build  a  clinic?

Therefore,  everytime we applied for an unfreezing  of

funds to build clinics, they said, "Show



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>



us the doctors first." It was the Minister for Finance

who was responsible, not me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that a satisfactory answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have now back from

England,    Australia   and   elsewhere   35    junior

specialists. I can give their names if you want me to.

35 doctors were sent overseas for specialist training.

We  do not need any more specialists from abroad.  For

the  medical officers, there are 55 vacancies. We have

47  housemen. We have another 21 doctors  coming,  17

from India, three from Pakistan, and one from Formosa.

So  that we will have more doctors by March next  year

than  the money to pay for them, and we will  have  to

use  other  votes  for the purpose.  So  that  if  the

Finance Minister had asked the Parliamentary Secretary

to  state where he hoped to get the doctors, it  would

have  been  quite easy for the Parliamentary Secretary

to have made diligent enquiries in the Ministry and to

have  given him this information, and the Minister  of

Finance would have been satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I assure the Minister, Sir, that

that  information  was  given  to  the  Minister.  The

Minister  for Health and Law himself puts  it,  "These

doctors will be available by next year." So how  could

this  question, when asked of me last  year  or  early

this  year, be  answered when  the  doctors  are  not

expected to come until next year?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendments* (18) and (19) are not being

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is also one of the

promises that the last Government made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, only two days ago tenders were

accepted  for the building of four blocks, of 24  units

per block at Woodbridge Hospital and seven blocks of 24

units per block at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, so  that

there  will be 96 units at Woodbridge Hospital and  168

units  at  the  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital  for  medical

servants. We are getting on with the work. A lot of the

servants  in these hospitals are unhoused, and  reports

are  that  this is a disgraceful state of  affairs.  So

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understood from the Finance Minister's speech

that  with integration there would be a lot of savings.

It  would appear, from this vote, that with integration

there  is to be more spending. Can the Minister  please

explain?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> This expenditure is required to carry out

the  integration of the City Analyst's Department  into

the  Chemistry Department. Internal rearrangements  and

alterations  are  required  in  the  two  ground  floor

laboratories in the Department of Chemistry to  provide

working   bench  space,  and  unification  of   certain

functions  which  are  at  present  duplicated  in  the

Department   of   Chemistry  and  the  City   Analyst's

Department.  This  would involve the reorganisation  of

fittings  and  existing works benches, installation  of

new  work  benches,  and  installation  of  fluorescent

lighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal for the second phase in 1962 is to erect

a  new apparatus store to take the place of the present

store which would be converted into a laboratory.  This

converted  laboratory  would provide  extra  laboratory

space  and  could also meet any additional demands  for

chemical    services   that   may   arise   from    the

industrialisation of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to convert the one-storey chemical

store,  which  is situated outside the  main  building,

into a two-storey building. The first storey could then

accommodate the apparatus. This is required because  of

the  integration of the City Analyst's Department  with

the Department of Chemistry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I first refer you to the Development

Estimates  of 1961 at page 519? It says there  (in  the

middle   column)  "Estimated  to  be  spent  in  1961 - $40,000,000".  And  what do we see in  the  Development

Estimates of 1962? In the "Estimated Expenditure to 31-12-61"  column,  it is also "$40,000,000".  I  want  to

congratulate the Minister for Finance on his ability in

having spent so much money - the only item where there is

100 per cent performance. But -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He knows it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But when we look into it, we see

that the expenditure is only paper expenditure - a paper

transfer. In fact, the performance is 0-0-0 per cent.

There is no expenditure at all. Then why put it down

there - "Estimated Expenditure - $40 million"? If the

Minister for Finance has to use his ingenuity, I

believe -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All right, since he is so anxious

to  explain,  I will give him a chance to explain  very

quickly, Sir. The only thing, as I say, is to  let  the

Minister  for  Finance  use  his  ingenuity  to  better

purpose. Make sure that whatever brains he may have  be

spent on providing good services for the people.

refer   to   the   Commission  of  Inquiry   into   the

Constructional  Capacity  of  Singapore,  because   the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>

the  recommendations are very important and  we  wonder

whether  the  Finance Minister can say  that  they  are

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is this: this Commission

has  on it several members of the Barisan Sosialis  and -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> One.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> One? Perhaps the Minister may want

Alliance member!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In any case, Sir, we feel the

Commission must go on, and perhaps the Finance Minister

will  be  able  to say when the final  report  will  be

ready.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this Commission, Sir, there are grave

shortages  in  various departments in the Ministry  and

they  recommend  that  the shortages  be  met  quickly,

otherwise it is going to be very difficult to implement

the  various schemes which Government has. I  hope  the

Finance  is that we have to deal with a lot of  papers,

and  quite  often there is difficulty  in  sorting  out

which  file to pull out the right moment. One paper  is

left behind.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first deal with the points raised by the hon.

Member for Tanglin. He raised two points concerning the

Report  of  the  Building Commission. First,  he  asked

whether the recommendations arc being implemented.  The

answer  is  yes. Second, when will the final report  be

out?  Actually the final report is with the  Government

Printers. The Minister for culture, of course, controls

priority  of  work  governing  the  programme  of   the

Government  Printers. I hope we  will  get  this  final

report as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, Mr Speaker, Sir, has

produced  an  image of another paper article.  We  have

today paper tigers. I have suggested a paper crocodile.

And  the Member for Queenstown when referring  to  the

$40  million voted for the Economic Development Board,

says  it is a paper transfer. Sir, I do not quite  know

what  is  the  point that the Member for Queenstown  is

making. There was a transfer of certain funds belonging

to  the  Government to the Economic Development  Board,

which was constituted under an Ordinance passed by  the

House. If that was the point he was making, I say it is

quite correct factually. But if his point was that this

$40 million should have been spent by now and he rather

regretted that there had been so much delay in spending

this $40 million, then I say. Mr Speaker, Sir, all the

things  I  have said in explanation of how the Economic

Development  Board  is set up, and what  its  functions

are.  I have dealt with all these matters, not only  in

my  Budget  Statement this year, but also in my  Budget

Statement  last year. I have explained that  there  are

several stages we have to go through before we  set  up

the  Economic  Development Board, let alone  spend  the

money. If the Member is contending that we should  have

spent  a  sum of $40 million worth of taxpayers'  money

before  we  have  set  a properly constituted  Economic

Development Board - if that is his point - then I  say  he

is  merely talking through his hat. I have explained in

my  two Budget speeches that this is going to be one of

the major instruments of implementing Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>



policy.  Therefore,  because it  is  so  important  and

because  it is going to cost so much money, we have  to

go through this process carefully and meticulously, and

with  the advice of experts in other parts of the world

who  have had experience in this sort of thing. I  have

already admitted that we are not geniuses, that we  are

not  going to spend $40 million off the cuff.  So  what

exactly  is  the  point the Member  for  Queenstown  is

making? Perhaps, Sir, if he is prepared to elaborate on

his statement, I will then continue with my reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will explain what I have been

trying  to tell the Minister for Finance, If  you  will

look  at  page  8, the Summary of Expenditure  of  the

Development  Estimates, 1962, you will  find  that  the

biggest  item is under Head D32, Ministry  of  Finance,

$47,600,000. The point is this. Did the Minister  spend

that money?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Therefore, why put it down to give

the  impression to the people that you have spent  that

amount of money? Why give the impression that you  have

done something when you have not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, when he was referring to the

$42  million, he was referring to the vote for 1962.  I

thought  he was referring to the expenditure  in  1961,

which  was  $47.6 million. That is clear.  That  is  an

elementary point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think he is probably wearing the

wrong spectacles! You see the figure $47.6 million, and

the  other  figure is $42.3 million.  It  is  the  same

figure, when nothing has been done by the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Goh Keng Swee.

Please be brief. The answer is so simple.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are times when I do not know

what year we are in! I believe this is the year 1961.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Take both years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In 1961, the amount voted for the

Ministry  of  Finance is $47.6 million,  of  which  $40

million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>



would be for the Economic Development Board. In 1962,

it is a different proposition. The Economic Development

Board get $20 million, and the other sums are for other

items. However, Sir, the Member for Queenstown really

did not make the point that we should have spent this

$40 million in the Economic Development Board in the

two years. That is the point. No doubt the Member for

Queenstown, who is a doctor -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you will turn to page 29 again,

Sir, "Estimated Expenditure to 31st December, l961 - $40

million". In other words, the Minister is trying to

tell the House that $40 million will be spent by the

end of this month. Is that correct? Will that amount be

spent?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, not only will it be spent,

but it has been spent. The Government has transferred

$40 million worth of assets to the Economic Development

Board. This is the point he made. This is a real bright

star! - Sir, Government having made an advance  - I

think it was sometime in October - within the brief

space of October, November and even December (three

months), he expects the Economic Development Board to

spend $40 million! Could anything be more stupid than

this, Mr Speaker, Sir, that you expect a statutory

authority, vested with the power of spending Government

money to useful purpose, to spend $40 million in three

months' time? The Member for Nee Soon [Interruption] -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - made a fair statement of

expectations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for Finance is trying to mislead us. Surely the

Economic Development Board, even as at this time last

year, was already aware that $40 million was due to it,

and it could well have made calculations to spend that

money. It is wrong to say that it only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>



got  the  money  in  October this  year.  As  early  as

November  1960  it  already knew that  that  money  was

forthcoming.   And   knowing  that   that   money   was

forthcoming  and not spending it - that is what  we  are

pointing out.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am indebted to the Member for

Nee  Soon for pointing out this so-called alleged fact.

He  says that the Economic Development Board knew  last

year  that it had this money to spend, and why  did  it

not  make plans to spend it? The answer is very simple.

The Economic Development Board was formed on the 1st of

September this year. It did not exist last year. So how

could it make plans? How could a non-existing body make

plans  to spend this money. Perhaps the Member for  Nee

Soon would like to amplify?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The shadow CaBinet, so to speak,

Sir,  of the Economic Development Board was already  in

existence long before that. After all, this was one  of

the  P.A.P. promises. Although the Board was officially

a  pointed  on 1st September, a mock Board,  if  I  may

phrase  it,  was  already in existence ever  since  the

P.A.P.  declared its economic policy in 1959. I  think

that is a very long time ago.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I might remind Opposition

Members that they have saved half an hour of good time.

It  looks  as though they are throwing away that  time.

Dr Goh Keng Swee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, after hearing from two

medical  practitioners, I think the people of Singapore

really should thank their lucky stars that doctors  are

not in charge of financial and economic policy. Sir,  I

had a talk with my colleague, the Minister for Culture,

and  I said that I had gone to great lengths to explain

the   Singapore  River  project  to  Members   of   the

Opposition  and  why the original  plan  could  not  be

carried  out. It is obvious that all my work  then  was

wasted.  I said to him that I had spent so much  effort

in  trying to put across a message to human beings whom

I  thought  to  be  in possession of  their  faculties,

reasonably  intelligent, but I found the  whole  effort

was  wasted. He assured me that if a person were  short

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>



normal  intelligence, he might be  able  to  comprehend

about 15 per cent of what a normal man is trying to get

across.  In the case of the Barisan Sosialis, there  is

no  hope  at  all because their powers of comprehension

are extremely limited. Therefore, all that I can do  is

to  recapitulate the things I have said before. I  hope

this  time they will understand how it is not  possible

for  any  organisation to spend $40  million  in  three

months,   unless,  of  course,  it  is   a   charitable

organisation which is prepared to dish out money to all

and sundry.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that before you can set up an Economic

Development  Board, you must first make a comprehensive

study of what the potential is for industrial expansion

in Singapore. Singapore is a trading centre. There is a

small manufacturing class, but they are not capable  by

themselves of mounting the effort.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was necessary to seek advice from experts

outside Singapore. That is why we approached the United

Nations  to  send two special missions  to  advise  the

Singapore  Government  on its industrial  programme.  I

think this may be the proper occasion for me to give an

account   of  the  principal  findings  of  these   two

industrial  missions.  I know, of  course,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, what I say will be completely lost to the

two  doctors  on  the Barisan Sosialis benches.  It  is

quite  evident  that  it  is  beyond  their  powers  to

comprehend   the   most  elementary   propositions   in

economics.  Nevertheless, for those who  takes  a  more

serious  view of our economic future, I intend to  give

an  account  of  the  main  findings  of  the  team  of

industrial  experts  whom the United  Nations  sent  to

Singapore.  The  U.N. team recommended two  courses  of

action.   Firstly,  a  10-year  industrial   programme;

secondly, a crash programme to mop up -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - the large numbers of unemployed

persons now in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  They estimated that to contain the  problem

some  78,000  jobs must be created in the manufacturing

industry in the next 10 years. To achieve this, a total

capital of about $800 million will have to be invested.

The  United  Nations team went at length  into  certain

policy   matters  of  how  the  industrial  effort   in

Singapore  should  be  mounted.  But  I  will  not  say

anything  today  because, on various occasions  in  the

past,   I   had  referred  to  some  aspects   of   the

industrialisation policy. But I would  like  to  inform

the  House of some of the specific proposals which  the

United  Nations industrial mission made in  respect  of

establishment  or  expansion  in  certain   fields   of

industry.  The  mission was divided into  a  number  of

experts,  each  making recommendations in  his  special

field.   First,  we  had  the  experts  on  metal   and

engineering  industries.  They  calculated   that   the

projects  they  thought  feasible  of  introduction  in

Singapore would involve a total -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order. If it is

going  to be a long statement, could the Minister  give

us a ministerial statement instead?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

so.  The  reason is this. The Barisan Sosialis, whether

in  jest or not, have thought that the Government  have

made  a  poor  show because they failed  to  spend  $40

million  in  the brief three months that  the  Economic

Development Board was in existence, and therefore -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister gives way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not so much their failure to

spend  the  money  as  the  deception  that  has   been

practised in putting the money as having been spent  or

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>



to  be spent, when it is not going to be spent and  has

not been spent, and is merely a paper transfer. That is

the point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are discussing the Economic

Development Board's estimate and it is proper  for  the

Minister to give details because the Opposition Members

have asked for them. It is also proper for the Minister

to  explain  the functions of the Economic  Development

Board.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I have already said that the

money  has  been spent by the Government.  $40  million

worth of assets have been transferred -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not enough!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - from the accounts of the

Accountant-General  to the Economic Development  Board.

And  there is that foolish young man from Choa Chu Kang

who  expects  results in Industrialisation  in  two  or

three months! Sir, is this the sort of intelligence  we

expect  from the Barisan Sosialis? Everyone knows  that

industrialisation is not a process that you complete in

two  or three months. We are extremely lucky if we  can

complete this process in two decades, let alone two  or

three  months. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have  the

disadvantage of trying to put before this House and the

people of Singapore a serious problem and to explain to

them  the manner in which we are tackling it.  In  this

very  serious attempt (and this is vital - the  happiness

and  welfare  of the people will depend on  whether  we

succeed   or   not  in  our  effort  to   industrialise

Singapore), I find that Members on the other  side  are

incapable  of  grasping the most  elementary  statement

that  I make. They treat this whole subject as a  joke.

Why they do so, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know.

The only comment I can make is that it is an indication

of  the  absolute immaturity and childishness of  their

approach to national problems. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

if  I can enlarge on this point; I mean, it pains me to

have   to   lecture   to  adults  who   claim   to   be

representatives of the people. When they are faced with

a  serious problem, and when the Minister in charge  of

this problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>



wants to give a serious exposition of how it is solved,

they do not meet it with seriousness. They laugh it off

as  a  big joke. Do they think this is the way in which

affairs of State are conducted? Perhaps the Member  for

Choa  Chu Kang would like to explain. If he does, I  am

prepared to give him two minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I am not an economist. But from the

Development Estimates produced by the Government, it is

quite  clear that the House has approved 350  days  for

the  Government  in which to develop the  country,  but

instead  what do we have? Only 25 per cent performance.

Now,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, this  is  commonsense.

These are facts and figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  heard  the very capable Minister  for  Finance

mention  just now that I had alleged that the  Economic

Development  Board  had  not  made  progress   in   its

performance.  He  termed  me a  fool  for  not  knowing

certain economic facts. According to the explanation of

the  Minister  for  Finance, the  Economic  Development

Board was established only in September this year.  But

in  the 1961 Budget, there was provision made amounting

to  $40  million for the Economic Development Board  to

use.  In other words, provision was made for the  Board

to  loan  to those industrialists who wanted to develop

any  industries in Singapore. We as an Opposition Party

do  not  oppose this economic development plan  of  the

Government. We deem it to be a rather good  plan.  This

is  what the P.A.P. promised to the people in 1959. But

what  is  now  before our House? We can  see  from  the

figures  envisaged  that there is a  provision  of  $40

million.  How much benefit have the people of Singapore

gained?  In  other  words,  how  much  money  has   the

Government loaned from this provision for the promotion

of  industries?  We know that one of the  jobs  of  the

Economic   Development  Board   is   to   industrialise

Singapore  and  to  give  pioneer  status  to   pioneer

industries. In other words, it is in order  to  provide

more  employment  opportunities through  this  kind  of

industrialisation. In the past two years, the  Minister

for   Finance   has  issued  several   pioneer   status

certificates to a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>



industrialists.  This is quite  all  right.  The  best

performance  of the P.A.P. in 1959, according  to  the

Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech,  was   that   the

Government  intended  to issue,  pioneer  status,  $10

million  to  the Shell Company, and the  Minister  for

Finance for the first time used an axe to cut  down  a

tree. At the same time, the Minister officiated at the

opening  ceremony.  I  was  in  attendance  then.  The

Minister for Finance can proudly say that in one  year

there was a very great oil refinery established in Sin

gapore.  He was extremely glad about this achievement.

But  let  us  see.  The Minister  said  that  the  oil

refinery could employ 200 people. In other words, this

could solve the unemployment problem for 200 people in

Singapore.  This  was a grand achievement,  but  then,

according to the information received by me, what  has

been  the  result? The oil refinery employed only  one

new worker, and he was a technician. The other workers

were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>



transferred   from   other  old   establishments   and

installations  in  various islands  belonging  to  the

Shell  Company.  That  is the  so-called  $10  million

investment.    The   Minister   promised    employment

opportunities for 200 people -
