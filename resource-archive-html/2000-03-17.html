<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100."  -  [Dr Wang Kai Yuen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan Boon Wan is not here. Dr Jennifer

Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, when parents

express  dissatisfaction with the education system, I  expect

that  part of the problem may lie with the system,  but  part

arises from parents' own response to the system.  It seems to

me  that if we could engage parents in the education process,

share information with them about policies and how they work,

the reasons for them, the benefits and good outcomes, and the

misperceptions  and misconceptions that  they  may  have,  we

could   go  some  way  towards  gaining  the  awareness   and

understanding  and  alleviating the angst that  many  parents

feel.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example is information that the Minister shared

at the recent sitting that 60% of our school leavers actually

make  it  to  our  local universities and polytechnics.   The

implication  of 60% making it to tertiary education  is  that

parents  do not have to move heaven and earth to try and  get

their  children's performance to the top few percentile  and,

in  fact,  fairly average children will be able  to  make  it

through tertiary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how many parents were or even now are

aware  of that statistic, but certainly information  of  that

nature would give them significant comfort.  And I think that

we  could do more in getting parents involved in this process

and give them this kind of understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hospitals, we find that time invested upfront in

communicating  with  parents of young  patients  yields  much

dividends  in  gaining their understanding and tolerance  and

reducing anxiety in the subsequent interactions in the course

of  their children's care and management.  I am acutely aware

of  the  House having just discussed on Wednesday  about  the

burdens  of the workload that our teachers face, but I  think

that  time spent with parents explaining policies and sharing

information would be well worth the investment.  And  I  hope

that  the  Ministry will be on the look out for opportunities

to  share  useful information with parents and  engage  them,

wherever possible, in the education process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, we often read in the

Straits   Times   of  delinquent  school   children.    While

discipline  is  an  age-old problem,  it  seems  from  recent

reports that disciplinary  problems are on the rise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the constituency level, I often receive complaints

from  residents of students who misbehave themselves  outside

school.  It seems that students and perhaps even some schools

operate  on  the principle that what the students do  outside

the school is not the concern of the school and should not be

within the school's control.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we receive reports of students loitering at

the  void  decks and engaging in such anti-social  activities

like  smoking,  littering and vandalism.  To  be  fair,  some

schools have resorted to ensuring that their students do  not

engage  in such activities by sending members of their  staff

on patrol in the neighbourhood.  I am not sure if all schools

have  such a practice.  On the other hand, it seems that  the

schools  can only intervene in a limited manner,   as  beyond

that  I am not sure whether all schools have the practice  of

checking  on  the  behaviour and conduct of  their  students.

Certainly, when children misbehave themselves, it  gives  the

school  a rather bad name.  Needless to say, it is imperative

that   we  continue  to  ensure  that  our  students   remain

disciplined,  as  this may impact on our  population  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the Ministry has a system in place

called  the  behavioural tracking and  analysis  system  that

tracks  the  number of delinquent cases in schools.  I  would

like to ask the Minister whether or not disciplinary problems

have  been on the rise and what additional measures, if  any,

the Ministry is going to take in dealing with the problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, there have been

many   reports   in  the  media  these  days  regarding   the

deterioration of family values.  There have been  reports  of

acts  of  atrocities between teenagers, gang  fights  amongst

teenagers, abandonment of babies by teenagers and so  on.   I

know that families have the responsibility to imbue the right

values  in  their  children  and  to  discipline  them   when

necessary.   It is acceptable to argue that the  teachers  in

schools  can  only  do so much.  However,  I  would  like  to

beseech  the Minister for Education to reassess this area  to

see  how the Ministry of Education could chip in here and nip

the problem in the bud before things get out of hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the school's main task is to impart skills

towards academic achievement, all the efforts will be  wasted

if  moral values deteriorate further.  I hope the Ministry of

Education will consider the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2433</b></font><br><br>



teaching and observance of moral and good values in  life  as

an  integral part of education.  The teachers in schools  are

in  an extremely good position to diagnose early symptoms  of

delinquency in many cases, as students do spend a lot of time

in  school.  There are many full school days, especially  for

secondary students, and the teachers are in a lot of  contact

with  their students.  The schools should be able to identify

at-risk  children  and  either alert their  families  or  any

organisation or community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason for the deterioration of family values

in  many  instances  is due to underlying faults  within  the

family  unit or to lack of discipline at homes.  These trends

may  be  on the increase with more broken homes and increased

divorces.  The lack of discipline is compounded by  the  norm

of  the  dual income families of Singaporeans with  two-child

families  or  less.  Has the Ministry of Education  done  any

studies  on these problematic students thus far, to find  out

the  underlying  problems in them?   Could  the  Ministry  of

Education  help those students who are predisposed  to  these

problems  and take a  more proactive approach to prevent  the

ill effects?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that every Singaporean counts.

This  being  so and since some kids need more attention  than

others,  would the Ministry of Education not have to allocate

more  time and effort for these high-risk students?  It would

be  good if the Ministry of Education could collaborate  with

parents,  voluntary welfare organisations,  self-help  groups

and more professional counsellors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Minister for Education whether he

needs  to review the discipline meted out by schools in  view

of  the  increased  rate of offences committed  by  secondary

school  students, especially female school students?   Should

the  schools not use more mentors and role models to lead the

pupils?  Could the Minister consider self-esteem courses  for

secondary school students?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be good to teach children how to empower

themselves to succeed in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2434</b></font><br><br>



life through a correct understanding of one's self worth  and

through one's core values.  A lot of delinquency and gangster

issues  stem  from  lack of self esteem.  Gangs  provide  the

security and status that the delinquents do not have  due  to

their family situation.  Employment of external organisations

to  facilitate this may be helpful. I know that some  schools

have  engaged outside parties for this purpose.  Perhaps this

should be put in as a core non-academic curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Education could enlighten

me on these issues I have raised.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, the three

Members  have  raised various issues concerning our  students

and  the  role  of parents.  May I take this  opportunity  to

enlighten  Members on some of the efforts undertaken  by  the

Ministry to achieve some of these improvements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, holistic education of a child, we believe,

cannot  and  should  not fall squarely on  the  shoulders  of

schools.  Parents and the community have a role to play.   In

this case, I agree with both Mr Sin Boon Ann and Dr Lily  Neo

that  we  need  to  get our children to  believe  in  and  to

practise the good values taught in our schools.  Parents  and

community   too  help  in  moulding  the  child's  character,

building  up  his  inner motivation, developing  a  sense  of

belonging,  spirit of service to the community, and  also  in

creating the environment to help the child learn better.  The

leverage comes from parents, community and schools working in

tandem   to  nurture  our  young.   Also,  where  one   faces

constraints,  the  others can rise to the call  and  help  to

address the need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main reasons why the Ministry of Education

is  now  stepping  up  its  efforts  in  strengthening  these

partnerships.  The first is to recapture some of  the  spirit

of  community  service or gotong royong  for  schools.   This

spirit  used  to  come  about almost naturally  in  the  past

because schools then were mainly set up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2435</b></font><br><br>



by  the  community.  But today, with education being seen  as

the responsibility of the Government, there is a need and  we

must try our best to rekindle the bonding, loyalty and mutual

sense of responsibility among schools, parents and community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the changing structure of our society and

homes.   Dr Lily Neo mentioned that in many households,  both

parents  work, and therefore they have less time to  interact

with   their  children.   Parental  expectations  have   also

increased.   And this is natural for every parent would  want

his child to succeed and thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At MOE, we realise that we need to put in place a

framework for schools to engage parents and the community  in

our  children's  education, and at a  level  where  there  is

mutual understanding of the fundamental purpose of education.

Every  child has talent and ability, and MOE aims to  develop

to  the  fullest each child's potential, so that he  acquires

the values, instincts, attitudes, skills and knowledge to  be

a  useful  and responsible individual and citizen.   In  this

respect, we have set up the Community and Parents in  Support

of Schools (COMPASS).  COMPASS is a national advisory council

to  advise  the  Ministry on ways and means  to  promote  and

strengthen school-home-community collaborations. COMPASS  has

and  will continue to solicit feedback and ideas from parents

and   the   community.   It  will  then  develop   a   common

understanding  about  what are the  different  roles  of  the

school,  the  parents and the community in the upbringing  as

well as the education of our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, many of our schools have built up strong

traditions and alumni.  In 1998, MOE announced that  children

of former students would be given higher priority for Primary

One  registration if their parents were also members  of  the

school alumni association.  Since then, the number of primary

schools  with  affiliated alumni associations  has  increased

around 50%, from 33 to 48.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the School Advisory and Management

Committees  that  give members of the community  and  parents

opportunities  to  be involved in school governance  and  its

activities.   Our  schools also conduct meaningful  Community

Involvement Programmes that help students build up a sense of

responsibility, belonging and commitment to the community and

country by way of rendering service.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation now is that there is great diversity in

the  way  our schools, on their own, involve the parents  and

the  community.   Some organise seminars  for  parents  while

others  conduct computer courses for parents as well  as  for

community  leaders  and  they  tie  up  with  companies   and

industries  for  student  work attachment  programmes.   What

works best in a particular school might not meet the needs of

another.  Therefore, MOE encourages schools to try out  their

ideas.   In  doing so, they will go out to reach out  to  the

community and along the process we will gain some experience,

and we will build upon it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for her suggestion to

network  with  parents and external agencies, especially   to

help some of our at-risk students.  This is what we have been

doing  and  will  continue to strive to do even  more.   Many

schools   engage  the  services  of  part-time   professional

counsellors,  link  up  with  self-help  groups,  MCD,  VWOs,

neighbourhood police posts or police centres, work  with  the

Police  and  Central Narcotics Bureau to  conduct  talks  and

programmes.  As for mentors, not only do our schools  tap  on

older  students and ex-teachers in the school, but  also  ex-students,  tertiary  students,  parents  and  other   working

adults.  Many have come forward to help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still more that can be done to strengthen

the  links  between parents, the schools and the community  .

COMPASS is actively encouraging parents and the community  to

partner schools to bring up our young.   Over the past  year,

COMPASS have visited schools, received

briefings on programmes in schools, and attended a seminar on

school-home  collaboration conducted  by  an  expert.   These

activities  gave COMPASS the background and understanding  of

the  issue  to  work  out  what  we  call  the  stakeholders'

statements   and   the   models  of   effective   school-home

collaboration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stakeholders' statements are student-centred and

outline the roles and qualities we expect of each stakeholder

in  helping  the child to learn and grow.  At  the  heart  of

these statements is the ultimate aim of achieving the Desired

Outcomes  of Education.  These statements should be ready  by

sometime next month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, COMPASS will be formulating various models of

effective  school-home-community collaborations so  that  our

schools  can adopt the good ideas.  This should be  ready  by

the end of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the efforts of COMPASS, there will be more frequent

and  higher  quality interactions among parents, schools  and

the  community. In this way, we hope we can better align  our

efforts  to  develop our young into robust,  industrious  and

morally upright citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further encourage partnerships between schools and

the  community, MOE decided also to take a wider view of  our

co-curricula  activities (CCAs).  Previously CCA  marks  were

only  awarded for activities offered by schools.   From  this

year,  CCA marks are awarded to students in secondary schools

for  their representation in an approved organisation or  for

their  contribution of at least 30 hours of community service

beyond   the   six  hours  under  the  Community  Involvement

Programme.   The  scheme  has also been  extended  to  junior

colleges and centralised institutes.  This will encourage our

students  to widen their social circle and interact with  the

community beyond the school.  We hope to start them young  in

forging strong links with the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee will be pleased to note that our schools

engage  not  just the parents but the community  in  the  two

areas of communication and partnerships.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2438</b></font><br><br>



I  had described a little bit about partnerships.  Now I will

discuss a little bit about communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our principals and teachers do plan various

opportunities  like  the  meet-the-parents  sessions,  school

newsletters,  parent-teacher associations, prize-presentation

events and these are used to explain changes in our education

system.  They describe how the school programmes develop  our

children holistically and discuss the progress of each child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of MOE, we ensure that all major changes to

the  education system and their rationale are also  announced

through  the media and our website.  But we also need parents

to  do  their  part  by  attending the school  functions,  by

reading  the school newsletters and also hopefully by keeping

up with the news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also asked about discipline matters in our

schools.  I would report here that the state of discipline in

our schools is generally good.  This has been found based  on

a  research done earlier.  The great majority of our students

are  found  to  be hardworking, well-behaved and responsible.

Serious   cases  of  breach  of  discipline  are   infrequent

occurrences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Committee on the discipline of female pupils was set

up  sometime  in  1998 chaired by Dr Aline Wong.   They  have

looked into the matter and found out that generally there has

been some increase, but not alarming.  The Committee has also

made recommendations ranging from preventive measures such as

peer support as well as various other programmes intended  to

achieve what Members asked for, ie, to nip the problem in the

bud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to urge the hon. Members in the

House, as leaders in their community, to lead their people to

support  the  schools in their constituencies.   We  can  all

treat  the children as our own.  Get involved in their  lives

and engage their parents, and involve them in the life of the

community.   If  we can work hand in hand to  jointly  assume

responsibility for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2439</b></font><br><br>



our young, the Ministry  is confident that we will be able to

help  our  young  develop  to  their  full  capabilities  and

contribute positively to society.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask whether the Ministry of

Education would have any more steps taken to further  improve

the  moral  and  good values of our students?   Secondly,  is

there  any  system in place in the school where the  teachers

are able to actively diagnose high risk students?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Other than civic and moral

education  that is already in place, we also engage  students

through  the Community Involvement Programme.  This is  where

we  plan  to internalise the concept of good moral values  in

the children.  They visit homes and engage with the homes  to

do  some community service.  This will hopefully help them to

have  good moral values.  There are other efforts that we  do

through the schools to help especially those who are at risk.

Thus  far,  we  have trained at least two teachers  in  every

school to become teacher-counsellors.  In other words,  if  a

child,  through  our behavioural tracking  system,  which  is

already  installed in every school, were found to  have  some

problem and is likely to become a discipline case, he will be

referred to the teacher-counsellor.  In some schools, we have

the Special  Constabulary officers who are also helping us to

deal  with  some cases of discipline among our children.   So

there are such cases.  Other than counselling, the school has

also  the  right to impose stricter disciplinary measures  if

they  find  it  necessary.  This will  hopefully  reduce  the

incidence.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Has the Ministry done any studies on

problematic  students in Singapore because such studies  will

help  us  in planning for the future policies and  preventing

us from having such children?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> I do not know whether we can

prevent  our country from having such children.   But  it  is

normal to have in our schools cases of discipline.  In  fact,

hon. Members should not be surprised that in some schools the

number

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>



may increase.  What has happened, as had been explained by my

Minister earlier, is that our school system is now carrying a

lot   more   students  than  in  the  past.   What   happened

previously, especially before we started streaming  in  1980,

was  that  many  of these children would be  outside  of  the

school  system.   Therefore, they were not  captured  by  our

behavioural tracking system or whatever scheme that  we  have

in  the schools. What we have done since then is that we want

to allow them an opportunity to continue to study.  We expect

that  some  of them may come to school with some  behavioural

problem.  The  school has a system in place to help  them  so

that  they can continue to study and not cause any disruption

to  other students and, where we can, we will do our best  to

help  them  to be more disciplined.  Hopefully,  with  better

exposure  at  secondary school, these children can  later  on

continue with further education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a special study just to find out

how we can stop children from misbehaving in our schools, but

there  is a system in place to track them and try to identify

them early so as to reduce the problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the published

criteria for university admission by the various faculties in

NUS  and  NTU  are  actually the minimum  standard  where  an

application  will  be considered.  However,  practically,  no

student  with  that  level of minimum standards  is  admitted

today.  As in the COE system, applicants to the faculties are

stack ranked by their "A" level results and then based on the

vacancies available, a line is drawn.  Those above  the  line

are  admitted  and those below are not.  It is as  simple  as

that.   Except  for  the  Medical  and  Law  faculties  where

interviews  are  part of the admission process,  very  little

weightage is given to other attributes of the candidate.   In

fact,  for  the  Faculties  of Medicine  and  Law,  where  we

actually  have a limited number of vacancies available,  they

are  turning  away candidates who would otherwise  be  highly

sought after in other universities.  Notwithstanding my  hon.

colleague, Dr Jennifer Lee's comment,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2441</b></font><br><br>



I believe that it is not true that parents are not aware that

more  than  60%  of  the  cohort is  admitted  into  tertiary

education.   It is which faculty they get admitted  into.   I

doubt  increasing the percentage will help  the  problem.  So

long  as  we  have  a  quota system for  the  more  desirable

faculties, the competition for more "As" and the pressure  to

acquire higher academic result will not go away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can conclude is that university admission

criteria  strongly influence the behaviour of  our  students.

No  amount  of exhortation will change the behaviour  if  the

bottom line is whether they get admitted into the faculty  of

their  choice depends on their "A" level results.  I am aware

that  a  tentative step has been taken to include Scholarstic

Aptitude  Test (SAT)  results as an additional criterion  for

admission into SMU as well as into NUS and NTU.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know how would the Ministry prevent this

from becoming an additional burden on the students on top  of

their  commitment  to  "A" level studies.   Furthermore,  how

would  that  contribute to greater involvement in  other  co-curricular  activities?   Perhaps,  can  we  take  one   step

further?   Some  parents have suggested that if  we  set  the

threshold  for  the  number  of distinctions  that  would  be

considered  for admission into the university and  that  more

than  this threshold, the additional distinctions will  carry

no  weight,  might  we  be  able to change  the  emphasis  on

examination results?  Perhaps if we put more weightage on co-curricular  activities,  such  as  participation  in  sports,

especially  participation in a national team,  more  students

might  be  encouraged  to spend time  in  healthy  activities

beyond burying their nose in books.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the next subject under university education, I

would  like  to touch on  the linkage between the  number  of

student intake of the various faculties and the projection on

manpower needs in the economy.  In fact, I recall that at the

depth  of our recent recession in 1998 and 1999, around 9,000

tertiary  educated  persons  were  unable  to  find  suitable

employment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2442</b></font><br><br>



Perhaps  by now, this number has dropped to a number that  is

less  worrying. What is disturbing to me is that even in  the

depth  of  the  recession, we were indeed short  of  computer

professionals,  web designers, and other IT professions,  and

yet,  on the other hand, there were graduates unable to  find

jobs.   In  other  words, we are not just  having  structural

unemployment  problems  amongst our older  workers  but  also

amongst our young graduates.  Fortunately, Sir, this state of

affairs  is only transient, it is temporary.  But  are  there

any  lessons  we  can learn from this?  At first  glance,  it

would  imply  that  the universities are  not  adjusting  the

enrolment  mix  quick  enough to  meet  the  demands  of  the

economy.   For many days now in this Chamber, we  have  heard

how  the  new economy is moving at Internet speed.  Yet,  for

students  deciding on their majors, they need to spend  three

to  four years in that particular major before they come  out

to  the job market.  Because of this time lag, it is becoming

all the more important that forecasting of manpower needs  be

taken  seriously.   Sir, I would like to find  out  from  the

Ministry   how  quickly  we  are  adjusting  the   university

enrolment in the face of a fast changing job market.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakruppan is not here. Dr Tan Boon

Wan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, going to university

is   a  major  decision.   It  often  means  sacrifices   and

commitment  by  the students and their families.   It  is  an

investment for the future.  The students would therefore want

to  study a course that is useful to help him find a job.  To

decide  on  a course, a student would want to know  how  many

Singaporeans are already taking the course.  The GPC Chairman

(Education),  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen, has just said,  despite  the

fact  that  in  the  depth of recession, some  students  were

unable to find jobs, yet the industries were calling out  for

graduates  of particular disciplines, such as IT, which  they

required.  So there is, in fact, disparity in the demand  and

supply in the various courses.  If students know exactly  who

are studying what courses, this information

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2443</b></font><br><br>



will  allow  our  people to better allocate  their  time  and

resources in pursuing their courses of study.  Right now,  it

appears  such  information  as  available  is  partial,   not

complete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans can take three major routes to obtain a

university   education.   They  can  study   in   the   local

universities.  They can study at distance learning outfits in

Singapore,  or  they can study in oversea  universities.   We

have  information  on the local universities.   Recently,  we

obtained  information on the number of  people  studying  for

university  degrees  through  distance  learning  outfits  in

Singapore.   We  know  that there are about  22,800  pursuing

their  degrees  through  this  route.   Many  of  these  long

distance  learning students are doing business and management

courses.   What we still lack is information on  Singaporeans

studying overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if it is now time for the Ministry to collect

information  of  our  people who are  studying  overseas,  in

particular  the courses they are studying and the  number  of

students  studying them.  Besides, this information  is  also

useful for national manpower planning.  If we know the amount

of  manpower we will have in each area or expertise,  we  can

then  encourage  more  to study in areas  where  manpower  is

scarce  and  discourage others from studying  in  overcrowded

areas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, under this cut, I

would  like  to  speak  on university education  for  working

adults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from the Finance Minister and the Manpower

Minister  that a key priority of the Government  is  manpower

training.  Resources are amply provided to train and  upgrade

the  850,000 adults, above the age of 40, who have less  than

secondary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding this, we should not forget and

ignore  the  need of working adults who have  received  their

secondary and post-secondary education and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2444</b></font><br><br>



wanting  to  further their studies to obtain their  diplomas,

degrees  and  even higher degrees.  Continuing education  has

become  necessary and essential to work and live  in  today's

knowledge-based and digital age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a brochure here, "Singapore's Snapshot - Facts At A Glance", and there is this heading "Education".

Besides describing the two universities and polytechnics,  it

states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Working adults can enrol in the Open University Degree

Programme offered by the Singapore Institute of Management."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good and right to publicise what we are doing

for  the  working adults.  Therefore, I am quite disappointed

that the overall expenditure budgeted for the Open University

Degree Programme has been cut by 86% for FY2000.  Even if one

can  explain  that  the  bulk of the Development  Expenditure

projects has been completed, the running costs should not  be

reduced by as much as 56%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that there has been a drastic decline

in  the  demand  for  Open University and  distance  learning

places.   If anything, the demand has gone up, as evident  by

the  increasing number of overseas universities  and  private

institutions setting up shop in Singapore to tap the  growing

demand for undergraduate and postgraduate education.  What is

disturbing is the wide variation in the quality and standards

of   the  overseas  universities  and  institutions  offering

courses here.  This has resulted in graduates having spending

vast amounts of time and money and later finding out to their

disappointment that they are not able to secure good jobs and

their qualifications are not as well recognised by employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities and polytechnics should be made more

accessible to the working adults who want to take courses  to

upgrade  themselves.   Many courses offered  today  were  not

available in the past.  For example, Computer Science and  IT

subjects  are  new  courses offered by the  universities  and

polytechnics only recently.  The new job opportunities in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2445</b></font><br><br>



the  knowledge-based  economy are  very  different  from  the

employment   opportunities  available  in  the  past.    This

requires  our  Singaporean  managers  and  professionals   to

constantly  upgrade and develop themselves.   Our  executives

and  managers need to learn and acquire new knowledge, skills

and  competencies to remain employable and be able to perform

effectively in their work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will become a truly learning nation only if

our  people  are given free and open access to  new  learning

opportunities.   Our institutions of higher  learning  should

open  their  doors to meet the new educational  and  learning

aspirations  of  our adult population.  I hope  the  Minister

would  provide more funding to boost the educational standing

of  the  older generation of Singaporeans.  The more educated

and   enlightened  Singaporeans  are,  the  more  they  would

contribute to a stable, cohesive and gracious Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I agree with

Dr  Wang  Kai Yuen that as long as there is this high  demand

for  faculties  of  choice like medicine,  law,  accountancy,

business  and  computer science, the anxiety of  parents  and

students will always be there and even if they know that  60%

do  make  it  to tertiary studies.  In line with  helping  to

release  the  pressure,  actually having  more  faculties  of

choice  would  be  a good solution, and I think  along  these

lines,  it  is  good  news that the  NTU  is  thinking  about

introducing medicine.  But, in this case, the medicine taught

there would be to orientate the students not to practise  but

to channel their talents to the life sciences and research.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SMU becomes operational this year and that will

be  another way to relieve the pressure.  More places will be

given  for  business.   In line with its  name,  there  would

certainly  be more degrees and courses in various aspects  of

management from this University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMU is also a city university. In line with city-based universities around the world and taking advantage of

its location in the civic district, it would be good if the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2446</b></font><br><br>



University  goes  on to non-management courses  relevant  and

related to the city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have in mind degrees such as urban architecture,

management and conservation of heritage buildings,  political

science,  law,  history or historiography or archaeology  and

such  like  studies.  The city provides the  environment  for

learning  these  subjects and live case studies  are  readily

available.   Preserving our culture and heritage, discovering

our  past  and  drawing  lessons from these  for  the  future

require  special skills which are currently not taught  in  a

deep way in our universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as law is concerned, we need not worry about an

over-supply of lawyers either.  Like the suggestion  for  the

NTU  medicine courses, the students who graduate from the SMU

law  courses  need  not  be  given  the  right  to  practise.

Instead,  they  could  combine their studies  with  politics,

management or business studies so that they can serve  better

in  Government,  in  the  diplomatic corps,  professions  and

industries  where  law is increasingly complex  and  problems

multi-disciplinary in nature, and a knowledge of law would be

an advantage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more radical suggestion to make sure that there

is  no  over-supply of lawyers practising would be to  follow

the  lines of what the Law Minister has mentioned many  times

in  this House, that is, we could increase the quality of the

lawyers  that come out.  Perhaps in both the NUS  Law  School

and  the SMU Law School, if ever there is one  -  only  those

who  qualify with a Second Lower Honours and above  would  be

given the right to practise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final advantage of having such courses as I have

mentioned  in  SMU is that it would avert some of  the  brain

drain  and  the  outflow  of  funds  that  we  are  currently

experiencing as Singaporeans send their children overseas  to

pursue such studies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, from the

experiences  of  many people who have been  involved  in  the

setting up of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2447</b></font><br><br>



technology-based  industries  in  Singapore,  the   important

lesson  that  all of us have learned is that we have  serious

weaknesses in the overall industry infrastructure as  far  as

the  protection of intellectual property is concerned.  While

in  Singapore, we do produce a number of lawyers,  there  are

too  few  specialising in this area of intellectual  property

protection.   So  if we are serious about promoting  the  new

economy,  especially focusing in the info-com area, we  would

need  to  build  up our strength in the area of  intellectual

property protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the best intellectual property lawyers are

those who have some form of technical training as their first

degree; like engineers and scientists, who subsequently  take

on  law  as  a  second degree, they are the best lawyers  who

actually promote such an industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three questions for the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, of course, can the universities in

Singapore focus on producing more lawyers whose expertise  is

in the area of intellectual property protection?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can we allow some flexibility in the admission

criteria  in our universities where we allow people who  have

had  a  first degree, preferably a technical degree and  have

had a number of years of experience and who subsequently want

to  have  a  change  in career, to take  on  law?   Will  the

university criteria be modified to allow such people to  take

a  second  degree  in  law?  I am sure there  will  be  other

Members who will ask for many other areas for a second degree

but since we are talking about promoting this knowledge-based

economy, my interest is to ask for a second degree in law for

the protection of intellectual property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, perhaps maybe a part-time law degree or Masters

in Law for people who have had a first technical degree would

be  useful.   I think, at this moment, many of  us  and  many

people  in  this  industry are turning to  lawyers  from  the

United States

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2448</b></font><br><br>



or  many other countries to file intellectual property issues

for  them, because not enough of our lawyers in Singapore are

capable of doing it.  So I think this is an urgent issue that

needs to be looked into.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, there are many foreign

students  studying in our midst. Most of them will return  to

their home countries eventually. When they do, they could  be

serving  in  important positions in business and  government.

Many  will remain friends of Singapore for the rest of  their

lives.  Some will stay in Singapore and enrich our lives  and

our talent pool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have spent a lot of money to partially or fully

finance  their studies here, many of them are  made  to  sign

bonds that they will work in Singapore for a number of years.

To  ensure  that the bonds are taken seriously,  the  foreign

students are asked to get guarantors for their bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some strange reason, these bonds are signed not in

their  home  countries before they come to  Singapore,  where

their  friends and relatives could be roped  in   -   but  in

Singapore.   The result is that the students will  ask  their

lecturers or fellow students, both foreigners and locals,  to

be guarantors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the foreign student disappears after graduation, the

guarantor  has  to  pay  damages.   There  is,  in  fact,  no

incentive  for  the  foreign  student  to  stay  on  as   his

guarantors are nothing more than strangers to him most of the

time.   The  guarantors, who are students, do not  understand

the full legal import of their guarantees. In practice, I  am

told that the education administrators even tell them it is a

mere formality and they will come to no harm by signing these

guarantees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very bad practice. Such guarantees,

besides  being  difficult to enforce, make a mockery  of  the

whole  process  because  of the way it  is  lightly  treated.

Surely, there is a better way to ensure that foreign students

serve their bonds.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a separate matter, could the Ministry update us on

the  number  of  such foreign students who  are  studying  in

Singapore  on Singaporean scholarships, bursaries  and  other

types  of  financial assistance?  How many of these  students

remain in Singapore and how many break their bonds? For those

who  stay,  is  there any record of how many actually  settle

down  in Singapore or at least of the average length of  time

they stay to work in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, for our universities to achieve

world-class  status,  it  is  important  that  they  have   a

conducive   environment  and  ample  resources  to   recruit,

motivate  and retain the top talents to conduct research  and

teach in our universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Management University Bill was passed in

Parliament  recently to set up SMU as a private company  with

its   own   Memorandum  of  Understanding  and  Articles   of

Association.  SMU  is  given  greater  autonomy  to  run  its

enterprise as deemed fit. Also, the University of Chicago and

INSEAD  will  soon  be  starting  their  MBA  programmes   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These developments have implications for the two

Singapore  universities,  NUS and NTU,  especially  in  their

business  faculty.  How should our universities  respond?   I

suppose they have no choice but to join in the race.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, there was the re-titling of

designations   of   university   academics   into   Assistant

Professors, Associate Professors and Professors.  May  I  ask

the  Minister how successful has the re-designation  been  in

fulfilling the needs of the university academics?  What  more

can  and should be done to improve the attractiveness of  the

university to attract our bright young graduates to  take  up

academic  careers in the backdrop of abundant employment  and

career opportunities for talented young graduates? How can we

induct   more   internationally   reputed   and   established

researchers and academicians to tenure in our universities?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2450</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister what is in the pipeline to

review the employment and terms and conditions of service  of

university academics.  How prepared are we to be flexible  to

pay  competitive  remuneration packages to  compete  for  top

talents  in  our universities? Are our university  professors

confident  enough in their ability to perform on a  sustained

basis in making valuable contributions in their work for  the

benefit  of society, university and the students?   Will  our

university administration be able to cope and operate in  the

changing  environment with dramatically different  employment

and reward systems for academic staff?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's world, in-depth knowledge provides the

competitive  edge  for the economy.   We  have  to  spur  our

universities  to  strive and pursue academic excellence.  The

status  and  performance of our universities have bearing  on

the  kind  of  graduates  we produce, thereby  affecting  the

future  progress and development of Singapore.   I  hope  our

universities will take the bold step forward to  the  highest

level  to match the best universities in the region  and  the

world.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, yesterday, the Straits

Times  reported  that  the National University  of  Singapore

would  be  investing an estimated $200 million in  an  office

building  in  downtown Raffles Place,  Hitachi  Tower.   This

decision  of  the  university has raised some  eyebrows.  The

question is: why is NUS taking on such a high exposure  to  a

single  piece  of property for which it appears  to  have  no

direct  use  for its pedagogic purposes? The  NUS  should  be

commended  for  being proactive in wanting to obtain  greater

returns for the excess funds that it has.  Indeed, if  it  is

successful  in  its endeavour, it will help reduce  fees  and

make  available  more  resources for  better  programmes  and

facilities in the university. But the question really is  the

method  used  by  the university in this regard.   Could  the

university  administration have chosen to deploy these  funds

in  investment  assets through fund managers?  Alternatively,

if  the university's finance committee felt that the property

sector offers attractive investment asset classes, why not do

so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>



through  property funds or real estate investment, investment

trusts  or  other investments in property counters themselves

to  allow  itself  a  greater spread, in terms  of  risk  and

diversification?   This  investment  decision  certainly   is

unorthodox  and  the question may particularly  be  pertinent

because   the  university  does  receive  public  funds   for

operating expenditure, development expenditure and  also  has

matching grants for its endowment fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore ask the Minister whether there are any

policies   or  guidelines  that  govern  the  deployment   of

investible funds, which our universities have? Sir, this also

raises  a broader question of whether our universities  might

be  better  off if they were truly private institutions.   We

are  compelled to ask and raise these questions because  they

are receiving public funds and entrusted with proper usage of

them.   The SMU appears to offer a different model, in  terms

of being a private company.  The question then is: could this

be  used  as a model for other faculties in the universities,

if  not  for  the entire university itself? It seems  to  me,

other  than  the  greater flexibility  it  would  afford  the

institutions, in terms of how they manage their resources, it

can  also allow them to be closer to the private sector, both

in  terms  of cooperation with corporations, as  well  as  in

rewarding  their staff at market rates.  We could start  with

the  faculties that are most amenable to privatisation,  such

as  the  business  faculty, where students  who  go  in,  for

example,  for MBAs will be in a reasonably good  position  to

ascertain  the potential economic value of their  degree.   I

would  appreciate  it  if the Minister  could  address  those

questions.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,

once again, I would like to thank Members for their questions

and interest in university policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our two public universities, NUS and NTU, aim for

excellence  in education, research and contributions  to  the

community.  They have initiated a number

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2452</b></font><br><br>



of    innovative   programmes,   including   broadening    of

undergraduate  education, introduction of a core  curriculum,

collaborations    with   top   foreign    universities    and

establishment  of  inter-disciplinary research  centres.  The

universities  are also building niches of excellence  in  key

areas  where they can achieve global prominence.  Steps  have

also  been taken to enhance the vibrancy of campus  life,  by

attracting  foreign  students.  A  new  university  admission

system will be introduced in 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall come back to some of these points in

greater  detail later, but first, let me talk about  how  our

universities can be more innovative and entrepreneurial.  For

example, whether we should privatise NUS and NTU, or  certain

facilities  in NUS and NTU, as some Members suggested  during

the  debate  on the SMU Bill, or as suggested by  Mr  Iswaran

today.   I take it that when Mr Iswaran said to privatise the

universities,  he  does not mean that the  Government  should

stop  funding them, except that we should let them spend  the

money the way they think they ought to spend the money.  That

is quite different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In academic matters today, the universities already have

a  considerable degree of autonomy.  While the Ministry  sets

the   overall  level  of  public  funding  and  spending   on

development  projects,  as  statutory  boards,  NUS  and  NTU

already  have  a  fair  degree  of  operational  autonomy  in

financial and personnel matters.  The internal allocation  of

resources  is  largely  left to the  two  universities.  They

decide for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry and the universities are currently

conducting  a review on university governance and funding  to

encourage  NUS  and NTU to be more innovative and  nimble  in

responding to global competition, which is what Mr  Loh  Meng

See referred to. The review will identify changes, either  to

promote  innovation  and enterprise in individual  staff,  or

faculties and the university as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the Government wants to provide more

autonomy and flexibility to NUS and NTU, the Government has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2453</b></font><br><br>



no  plans  to  privatise  NUS and NTU.   The  launch  of  the

Singapore Management University, on the other hand,  provides

us  with  an  opportunity to try out a  different  governance

framework. This will allow the governance experiences of  NUS

and  NTU on the one hand, where they are governed in slightly

different ways and SMU, on the other hand, to be compared and

best practices to be applied, where appropriate, in all three

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address this issue of endowment fund. First of

all, what is an endowment fund? An endowment fund is a sum of

money  or some asset, which is put aside in order to generate

a  continuing  stream of income.  The endowment  fund  itself

ought  not  to be seen as assets which the university  should

consume  for  current expenditure.  Some comments  have  been

made  that the monies in the endowment fund can be  used  for

the  operating  expenses  for  universities.  That  would  go

against  what an endowment fund is for.  The income from  the

endowment  fund would help the universities.  I will  explain

how a little later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what fund is this that we are talking about?

This fund, which the NUS has used to make this investment, is

called  the  General  Endowment  Fund.   How  did  this  fund

originate? This fund originated from public contributions  to

finance  the University of Malaya's development in the  1940s

and  1950s. A princely sum of $3.342 million of this  General

Endowment  Fund was used in the 1950s to purchase residential

properties  in  the Bukit Timah area for  use  as  staff  and

student  housing.  These were subsequently  acquired  by  the

Government  in  1996  and the proceeds  amounting  to  $242.4

million was credited to the General Endowment Fund.   How  to

invest  this endowment fund in order get the best  continuing

returns  in the long term for the university is a matter  for

the  university to decide. It has a finance committee and  an

investment  committee  and  they make  these  decisions.   Mr

Iswaran  is right. There is really no need for us to question

how  they make these decisions in Parliament because  I  have

some confidence that the members of the investment committee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2454</b></font><br><br>



will   decide,  in  the  best  long-term  interests  of   the

university, to get both capital appreciation, as  well  as  a

continuing stream of income.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The university has other endowment funds, including the

NUS  Endowment  Fund, for which the Government  provides  the

matching  grants and some special endowment funds of  smaller

quantities. The whole idea of these endowment funds comes  to

the question of what do we use these endowment funds for. The

whole  idea  of  these  endowment  funds  is  to  allow   the

university to use these funds for projects and activities  in

line  with  the university's mission and which contribute  to

its  long-term  development,  but  which  are  otherwise  not

available from the budget, from Government grants or from the

fees  paid by students.  The whole idea of these funds is  to

provide  the  university with the flexibility to  do  things,

which  it thinks it wants to do and for which we may  not  be

able  to  completely  agree on.  So, the  whole  idea  is  to

provide the university with some flexibility and autonomy  in

its  operations in the areas of research and development, and

perhaps student enrichment and so forth, which it wants to go

into.   So  we  are quite happy to see these endowment  funds

develop  and provide the university with a continuing  stream

of  income  for which it can develop its resources.   By  the

way,  some  of  these  funds can only be  used  for  specific

purposes,  because  donors,  when  they  donated  the  money,

specified its purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the story on the university endowment funds and

how  the  monies are invested.  Incidentally, in the case  of

the  NUS,  the  decisions are made by the finance  committee.

The   finance   committee  reports  to  the   Council.    The

university's  annual  reports are  audited  by  the  Auditor-General  or  commercial auditors recommended by the  Auditor-General, and the accounts are presented to MOE as well as  to

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, autonomy alone is not going to guarantee

excellence. Mr Loh Meng

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2455</b></font><br><br>



See   has   rightly  identified  remuneration   and   service

conditions  of academic staff as an important factor  in  the

whole equation.  The university could only flourish if it has

capable and committed staff of high quality who can make  use

of this autonomy to bring the university close to its goal of

attaining  world-class  standard.   The  NUS  and  NTU   must

therefore   place  priority  on  recruiting  and   developing

excellent  staff.   The  existing remuneration  and  benefits

scheme  in  NUS and NTU is modelled after the civil  service.

There  is  some  flexibility in deciding  salaries,  but  the

flexibility  is  still constrained by the salary  scales  for

different grades of staff.  As an interim measure,  a  market

adjustment  allowance has been provided to staff  in  certain

disciplines,  eg,  medicine and  in  business.   The  current

review  of  university  governance  and  funding  will   give

universities greater flexibility in remunerating staff.   The

ideas being studied include the injection of more performance

based and market components into the remuneration system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh has also asked about recruiting good foreign

staff  to teach at our universities.  NUS and NTU have indeed

been recruiting overseas staff for many years and, currently,

more  than  20%  of  the academic staff are  foreigners,  not

including Singapore permanent residents.  So, Sir, the number

is actually higher than 20%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS and NTU are keenly aware that they need to cast

their  net  globally and already have plans to step  up  such

efforts.  When looking for outstanding staff, whether locally

or globally, to take our universities to greater heights, the

universities  must be able to provide a remuneration  package

that  is  globally market competitive.  However, remuneration

is only half the story when recruiting and retaining staff of

high  quality.  The reward system needs to be supported by  a

rigorous  appraisal system, so that there  is  a  clear  link

between  performance and remuneration.   The  rigour  of  the

appraisal system signals that the university is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2456</b></font><br><br>



serious  about quality, and it is such a university that  can

attract and retain people of high calibre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effective appraisal system serves three purposes.

First,  it  encourages desired behaviour by setting  out  the

expectations for the staff in the areas of teaching, research

and  service  to  the  universities.  Second,  the  appraisal

system  helps  the  universities assess how far  expectations

have  been met and what improvements need to be made.  Third,

the  appraisal  system  allows staff  to  be  recognised  and

remunerated  according to performance and/or potential.   The

review  committee will come out with recommendations  on  how

the  current appraisal systems can be strengthened,  so  that

this  most  critical resource in any university, its  people,

can  be  better managed.  And only then can rewards  be  more

meaningfully targeted and help to attract, develop and retain

staff of high quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn from staff of universities to

students.   Prof.  Toh  See Kiat has expressed  some  concern

regarding the bond that foreign students need to sign.  Prof.

Toh  is  right.   Foreign students studying in  our  tertiary

institutions, including permanent residents, benefit  from  a

considerable subsidy, and that is why in return,  after  they

graduate,  they have to work in Singapore for  a  minimum  of

three  years.   Prof.  Toh asked how  many  there  are,  they

currently constitute 20% of our undergraduate intakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry acknowledges that it is inconvenient for

foreign students to get guarantors, usually their parents  or

relatives who are based overseas, to sign the bonds.   Hence,

from  this year, foreign students can send the tuition  grant

deeds  overseas for their guarantors to sign in the  presence

of  a notary public in their home country, rather than having

to travel to Singapore to sign the papers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being a guarantor is a serious matter and

guarantors should be aware of their legal obligations.  I  am

not  aware of the kind of poor advice that is provided by  my

Ministry officials.  This is a serious

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2457</b></font><br><br>



matter,  and  if the Member has knowledge of specific  cases,

please let me know and I will advise my officers.  As far  as

I  know, these legal obligations are made known to them by my

officials at the point of signing the deed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh would also be pleased to know that after

serving their three-year obligation, a good number of foreign

students continue to work in Singapore or Singapore companies

in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked about training of lawyers well

versed  in  intellectual property protection.  The  NUS'  LLB

curriculum  has a number of subjects relating to intellectual

property  laws,  eg, copyright and patents  which  attract  a

large number of students, and as Mr Singh has correctly said,

this is an area of growth.  So our budding young lawyers have

an  interest  and  they are quite quick to  spot  the  market

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the information technology law course deals

extensively  with  intellectual property issues  relating  to

computer  technology and Internet.  Many  practising  lawyers

register  for  LLM  or  diploma courses   at  NUS.   And  the

intellectual  property law courses at these levels  are  also

heavily subscribed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also asked about a second degree. He will be

happy to know that this avenue is already open.  In 1998, NUS

launched  the approved graduate programme whereby  candidates

with a first degree can complete their LLB programme in three

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion to have a part-time law degree, NUS

will consider it if there is sufficient demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Loh Meng See asked about university education

for  working adults and about the reduction in budget funding

for  the open university.  The reduction in budget allocation

for  the  open  university  is not an  indication  of  future

student  numbers.  The OUDP has been taking in an average  of

14,000 students per year in the past three years.  There  are

no plans to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2458</b></font><br><br>



reduce  this  number.   In  fact, OUDP  is  a  self-financing

institution  run by a private organisation.  It  is  free  to

increase  those  numbers if it wants to and  if  there  is  a

market  demand.   From  the  start  of  the  programme,   the

understanding  was quite clear that OUDP funds the  operating

cost,  while  Government would fund the  initial  development

cost,   including  the  cost  of  land,  buildings,  computer

systems,  consultancy  by the UK Open University  for  course

development.  I think with the bulk of development coming  to

an end, the budget allocation has also fallen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree completely with Mr Loh Meng See regarding

continuing education opportunities for working adults, but it

should  not  be confined only to universities.  I  understand

that we are talking about universities here, but most working

adults  really require upgrading opportunities,  not  at  the

university  level  but  at  the  polytechnic  level  and   at

certificate level.  And the polytechnics and ITE have  really

been  providing quite a lot of opportunities  here  as  well.

Continuing  education  really  is  the  next  major  wave  in

education   -   from  mass primary, mass secondary  and  mass

further   education  and,  I  think,  now   mass   continuing

education.  No country has yet worked out a complete doctrine

or  system for this.  The Ministry of Manpower, Members would

have  heard  from Dr Lee, and the Ministry of  Education  are

currently discussing how we can put such a system in place in

Singapore which will provide Singaporeans the opportunity  to

carry on with continuing education and learn throughout their

lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh has asked about the course offerings in SMU.

SMU  was  set up to focus on serving the business and finance

sectors  and SMU will start offering its Bachelor of Business

Management programme this August.  Although it is  likely  to

expand  its  degree offerings to other related  courses  like

Economics,  it  will  continue to maintain  its  focus  as  a

management university.  There are therefore no current  plans

for SMU to offer courses in disciplines removed from business

management,  especially courses requiring heavy equipment  or

heavy capital investment.  Perhaps the proposals

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2459</b></font><br><br>



that Prof. Toh made are certainly things which I am sure  SMU

will consider.  The President of SMU is herself a lawyer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Dr Tan Boon Wan have asked about

manpower forecasting and how many places we allocate to  each

discipline  in the university.  I agree with Dr Wang  and  Dr

Tan  Boon  Wan  that more forecasting and more data  will  be

useful.  But I am not optimistic that students and parents at

the  point at which they enter university will make  sensible

long-term choices for themselves, because, as Dr Wang and  Dr

Tan  have  pointed out, there is a considerable  market  lag.

And  what  looks reasonable now may not be right at the  time

that  the students graduate.  For example, students  tend  to

move  away from architecture and civil engineering when there

is  a  downturn in the construction cycle.  That may well  be

the   best  time  to  start  taking  architecture  and  civil

engineering because by the time they finish in four  or  five

years' time, that is when the boom may start again.  So it is

a  bit difficult to predict because there are long leads  and

lags  in the system.  And also we are talking about education

for a lifetime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While more forecasting may be useful. I think we should

really  be  looking at the longer-term trends and hence,  for

example, in our tertiary institutions, we have placed a  high

emphasis on science and technology.  Because we think that in

the  long  term, good foundation and training in science  and

technology  will  actually provide our students  with  a  big

advantage  in  being  able to shift  into  other  areas,  and

because  science  and technology is one  of  the  fundamental

drivers of the future world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why there are limited places for some courses,

these  are  guidelines that were drawn  up  by  the  National

Manpower  Committee, and we want to make sure  that  what  we

expect  the economy will require is reasonably balanced  with

the  output  from  the various faculties.  We  also  have  to

recognise  that  certain  faculties do  have  more  demanding

requirements at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>



entry for the students than others.  So not all students  who

go  to  university may be able to go to these courses because

some  of the courses simply have more demanding requirements,

and that is a reality which we have to accept.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has suggested that we cap the number of

distinctions.   In  fact, it is capped.   Under  the  current

university  admission  system,  we  count  three  "A"   level

subjects.   So a student who takes more than three "A"  level

subjects  and scores distinctions for his five,  six,  seven,

eight subjects, if a student has the energy to take that many

"A"  level  subjects, is not going to have those counted  for

university  admission.   In fact, weightage  is  provided  in

other areas, like GP and mother tongue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new university admission system, as Dr Wang has

suggested,  we  will be providing weightage to  co-curricular

activities as well.  In order to de-weight the "A" levels  so

that students do not become overly obsessed with scoring that

last  mark  in the "A" level examination, we have  introduced

SAT or a SAT-like test which gives us a different view of the

student's  abilities and readiness to undertake a  university

course.  This is a test which a student can take a number  of

times. So the preparation level and so forth is not quite the

same  in  intensity  as taking the "A" levels.   The  content

knowledge  that  is required for a test like that  is  really

something  which  a student should already  have  if  he  has

completed something like his "O" levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out at this point that while

we  have  spent some time on university education,  there  is

really a wide range of high quality further education that is

available  and, as Dr Jennifer Lee has pointed out,  we  have

actually  one  of  the  highest  rates  of  higher  education

participation in the world.  We have over 20% in  university,

40%  in  the  polytechnics.  Even beyond  that,  for  further

education, we have the Institute of  Technical Education.  Mr

Peter  Chen  has  asked  for  this  booklet  on  ITE   to  be

distributed because over the last few months and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2461</b></font><br><br>



years  he has got questions even from Members of this  House,

which revealed quite a high level of ignorance as to what ITE

is  today.  People still think that it is characterised by  a

vice on the table with people filing away in semi-darkness on

a  greasy  table.   It is quite a different institution  from

that today.  The students who go to ITE are highly motivated,

having finished four years in a secondary school, with a good

grounding   in  computers,  languages  and  Mathematics   and

science.  They are quite well prepared for the future  world.

It will be quite a revelation and, if Members are interested,

I  am  sure  Mr Peter Chen will be happy to take  them  on  a

visit.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I had participated in several

dialogue  sessions  on  compulsory education  both  as  Vice-Chairman  of  the Feedback Panel as well as a member  of  the

Committee on Compulsory Education. As we are aware,  the  CCE

has  yet  to  complete  its task  and  I  think  it  is  only

appropriate that we wait for the findings of the Committee to

be published before we spend too much time on this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, judging from the number of cuts on this

topic,  it  is obviously one of public interest.   With  your

indulgence, Sir, I thought it might be appropriate  to  share

some  of  my  observations,  in  particular,  those  of   the

participants  in  the  dialogue  session  organised  by   the

Feedback Unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many Singaporeans are surprised that we have

not already made education compulsory in Singapore.  It would

seem logical for a country like Singapore with its high level

of education and standard of living and where our  Government

does  not  hesitate to influence people's behaviour,  through

compulsion.   Most agree with my hon. colleague,  Mdm  Claire

Chiang's compassionate plea in Parliament that one child  not

educated  is  one too many.  Majority polled also  felt  that

four  years' compulsory education is too low a number.   Many

felt  that  six years is the minimum with 10 years the  ideal

duration.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, among those participants who expressed strong views

in  these forums are the parents who strongly supported  home

schooling.   While  I  do not necessarily  agree  with  their

assertions  about  our education system, I  do  admire  their

dedication   and   commitment.   They  hold   the   following

principles to be true, which I thought are useful  to  repeat

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, they support compulsory education, ie, the

State has a right to intervene to ensure the child's right to

an  education. At the same time, they are also  adamant  that

the   parents'  right  of  choice  for  their   children   is

inalienable.  They are quite insistent that this right is not

taken away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that so long as the child is educated to an

agreed standard, the goal of compulsory education would  have

been  met.  Compulsory education legislation  should  provide

options  to  allow this.  They do not accept that  compulsory

education  means  attending  the  national  education  school

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, most people regardless of their ethnic

or religious background will support those views.  After all,

giving parents the choice cannot be all that bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the course of deliberation in such dialogue

sessions,  when these arguments were pushed to their  limits,

most  participants  ultimately  changed  their  views.   They

quickly   realised  that  it  is  possible   that   different

communities  in Singapore could set up their own  schools  to

educate  their  children along their own  ideal  concepts  of

social  and  religious values.  Today, there is  actually  no

legal  barrier  for any group to do so.  The main  hurdle  is

primarily   financial.   Yet,  Muslim  parents  are   already

prepared  to  pay more when they send their children  to  the

Madrasah.   As  Singaporeans  become  better  off,  financial

burden  would become less of a hurdle.  Assuming that is  the

case  in the future, then it is possible, as an example, that

the  Catholics  would  set up their  own  schools  to  impart

Catholic  religious values, the Buddhists would do  likewise,

and so on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a multi-racial and multi-religious society like

Singapore,  this  would plant the seed  of  potential  future

racial  and  religious conflicts.  Once this possibility  was

highlighted,  most  participants in this session  would  move

away  from  their idealistic position towards a more  central

position.  They accept that it is important for all  children

to  have a common educational experience so that the risk  of

fragmentation  would be minimised.  Thus,  I  would  conclude

that  most  Singaporeans would accept the twin goals  of  our

national  education system, namely, to impart  knowledge  and

skills  so  that  young Singaporeans would become  productive

citizens in the future knowledge-based economy and, secondly,

to develop a common experience to bolster national cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants would come to accept that if we were to

introduce compulsory education, then we might as well  ensure

that  the  child is enrolled in the national school education

system.   If  this means usurping the choice of the  parents,

most  would  consider it a price worth paying so that  future

generations of Singaporeans can live in peace and harmony.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak) (In Mandarin) :</b> Sir, the

Member  for Bukit Timah GRC, Dr Wang Kai Yuen, mentioned  the

Feedback  Unit's  dialogue session on  compulsory  education.

The  people  who  attended his session were  mainly  English-educated.   I have also conducted a similar feedback  session

in   Chinese  for  the Chinese-educated.  The attendees  were

mainly school principals, teachers  and community leaders.  I

made a survey.  Their views on compulsory education came to a

total  of  three 100%.  Firstly, 100% of them  supported  the

view of the Prime Minister to introduce compulsory education.

Secondly, 100% of the attendees did not agree that compulsory

education be implemented up to Primary 4 only. Thirdly,  100%

of  them  held the view that compulsory education should   be

implemented  up  to at least Primary 6, that  is,  PSLE.   In

fact, about 65% proposed that compulsory education should  be

implemented up to "O" levels.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These participants support compulsory education because

they  are  concerned that some 1,000 students have  not  been

admitted  to  schools  despite all the counselling  and  home

visits to the parents to send their children to school.   The

Ministry  of  Education  cares for  these  children.   It  is

something  we  must  commend.  Some parents  persist  in  not

sending  their  children  to  school  and  the  Ministry   of

Education  cannot  take  any  action  against  them.    These

children  will then be sacrificed as they would  have  missed

the  best gift society can give to them in their whole  life.

If there is compulsory education, then we can ensure that all

children of school-going age will go to school because  young

children  cannot decide their own fate.  It is only  the  law

that  can  give  them the protection and  the  safeguards.  A

compulsory  education system has already been established  in

the Philippines and the European and Asian countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory education is good for Singapore. But in

implementing the system, the Ministry of Education must  also

conduct  a  study into those parents who do  not  send  their

children to school to find out why they have chosen not to do

so.  Is it because of poverty or because of family disharmony

or  because the parents themselves have low educational level

so that they do not care about their children's education?  I

think   the  Ministry  of  Community   Development  and   the

Community  Development Councils should help these parents  to

solve  their problems.  We all know that compulsory education

up  to primary four is not so ideal because at  primary  four

the child is only 10 years old.  The children are still young

and  they  do  not  know  the consequences  of  not  studying

further.  They would not have enough grounding in English and

their  mother  tongue  to survive in the new  knowledge-based

economy.  For Mathematics, they would be even worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are developing the regional economy and high-tech economy, the children must learn information technology

so  that they can prepare themselves for the future and  earn

their livelihood. It is a common view that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2465</b></font><br><br>



compulsory  education must be implemented up to  primary  six

or,  better  still,  secondary four.  As for  those  who  are

mentally handicapped  and unable to make the grade,  MOE  may

treat them as special cases, and deal with them on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When compulsory education is introduced, how do we

ensure that the students do not absent themselves from class?

This  is important.  I wonder if MOE has considered  engaging

counsellors  to  help  the student and, when  necessary,  the

teachers  and parents must also be counselled to ensure  that

compulsory education can be implemented properly.   According

to  my  understanding, counselling is normally  done  by  the

teachers.  We all know that the teachers have already  had  a

very  heavy workload. Do they have enough time and energy  to

counsel the students and their parents effectively?  I  would

therefore   suggest   that   MOE  should   consider   getting

professional counsellors or engage retired teachers  to  work

as  counsellors.  In this way, counselling would  work   more

effectively.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, there is a

Chinese  saying that when drops of water fall on a  piece  of

granite  long  enough a dent will be made  on  that  granite.

Sir,  this  analogy is like my quest for compulsory education

in this House.  Members will know that I have brought up this

subject  of  compulsory education year after year during  the

Budget  debate  in  the  Committee of  Supply.   There  is  a

reporter  in the Straits Times who likens me to an old  horse

that trots old ground all the time.  I hope that the reporter

has  already  taken note that the old horse trotting  on  old

ground in regard to compulsory education has been successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, agrees with me.

PM  Goh  announced  last  year  that  Singapore  is  to  have

compulsory education.  When he made that announcement  I  was

in  Parliament  and I was really elated.  However,  I  was  a

little bit disappointed that there was only going to be  four

years  of compulsory education. From an educational point  of

view, four years' compulsory education is definitely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2466</b></font><br><br>



not enough.  Most of those skipping school in the first place

normally  come from poor families or parents who are probably

themselves illiterate or lowly educated.  Most likely,  those

children  are slow learners or have some kind of  a  problem.

Therefore, four years of compulsory education is not  enough.

Even  the  Jesuits require six years to train a child  to  be

what you want the child to be.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, six years of compulsory education would probably be

the  minimum  period to keep a child in school to  make  sure

that  he learns the 3Rs.  I believe that from the educational

point  of  view, the child is best kept in school  for  eight

years.  Eight years would certainly give a better chance  for

an  average or even below average child to learn the 3Rs.   I

personally  favour eight years' compulsory education  to  let

the child stay in school up to age 14.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1973, I had the opportunity to teach in a school

in  London for a very short period of time.  I was posted  to

take  care of 15-year olds.  At that time, England had a  10-year  compulsory  education  programme.   They  forced  their

children  to remain in school up to age 16.  I can  say  from

experience that 10 years' compulsory education does not work.

It  is  a complete waste of time and money.  What happens  is

that those pupils in their last year of school at age 15 just

refuse  to  learn.  They know they want to leave school,  but

they  are not allowed to.  They know that they are forced  to

be  in school by law.  They are restless.  The teacher cannot

teach  them  anything.  So they are brought to  the  hall  to

watch movies on social issues.  But as soon as they return to

the class, they are noisy and rowdy.  It is difficult to keep

them  occupied.  Maintaining discipline is a problem.  We  do

not want such a situation in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that a Committee has been set up

to look into compulsory education.  I hope that the Committee

shall  not  recommend  four years but  at  least  six  years'

compulsory education and eight years, if possible.  I believe

that eight years of compulsory education is the best

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2467</b></font><br><br>



because  then  the children shall be given a real  chance  to

master the basics in reading, writing and arithmetic.  For 10

years,   I   have  mentioned  the  problems.   If  compulsory

education is fixed at only six years, I am afraid that  there

may be wastage.  Money is spent on keeping children in school

but  they learn nothing when they leave school at the end  of

the six years in school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also hope that the Committee shall recommend to

the  Ministry to set up a section to monitor the children who

have not been attending school to find out their problems and

try  to assist them to ensure that they do go to school.  The

mode of operation for this section in the Ministry should  be

based  more  on  counselling  rather  than  on  threats   and

punishment.   Therefore, the Government needs to  train  good

counsellors to deal both with family problems and truancy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, after listening to Mr Chiam, I am

not  so sure whether he is arguing against himself that there

are  problems  in  compulsory education,  regardless  of  the

length of time, and therefore should it be made compulsory at

all.  Because if you have problems with 10 years, you suggest

eight;  and  you have got problems at eight years,  you  move

down  to six; then to four, what have you got left?  So I  am

not very sure whether if you have difficulty, you should make

it compulsory at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of compulsory education first arose in

this  House  when  some  Members learned  that  a  number  of

children  were  not  attending school  because  of  financial

hardships and parental neglect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, a formal Committee has been set up. Dr

Aline  Wong has been appointed as the Chairman. The scope  of

study  has  now widened.  It has now to define  clearly  what

compulsory education should entail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If compulsory education is intended to ensure that every

child is taught and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2468</b></font><br><br>



prepared for later adult life, it is an easy matter  to  deal

with.  However, if compulsory education is to include how the

child should be taught and have the effect of insisting  that

every  child must attend formal schooling in our schools,  it

is a different matter.  We know how delicate and sensitive it

is  if we were to require students currently studying in  the

Madrasah to switch to our national schools.  However,  should

we  continue to segregate these students from the  mainstream

educational  system?   For  what they  are  learning  in  the

Madrasah, are the students well prepared in the long term  to

work and live in a multi-racial Singaporean society?  If  the

decision  has  to  be made for the long-term  good  of  these

Madrasah  students, then a way has to be found to  handle  it

carefully  by persuading the parents concerned and the  Malay

leaders  and community to have them switched to the  national

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a small number of parents who believe in

teaching  their own children themselves in the home  setting.

They  have their own reasons for deciding that their children

are  better taught and brought up themselves.  Some of  these

parents are themselves well educated with strong academic and

professional qualifications.  They feel that the  educational

system  does  not  tailor to the gifts  and  needs  of  their

children.   The question I wish to ask is whether  we  should

insist  that parents could no longer be given the  option  of

home schooling for their children.  From time to time, we  do

hear  university professors having a child prodigy and making

geniuses  out of their children, and one child not  attending

school  against another child prodigy that you can  bring  up

differently.  I think there is also this consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many children with disabilities and in need of special

education are not attending school for a variety of  reasons.

By  making education compulsory, the beneficiaries  would  be

the  disabled children.  In so doing, adequate resources will

be  provided.  The parents will have to be assisted  to  send

their children to school and not lose out the opportunity for

special education.  With compulsory

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2469</b></font><br><br>



education,  is  the  society ready to deploy  proportionately

more   resources  to  equip  these  children  to  cope   with

independent living?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans are working overseas, and with each

change  of posting there are disruptions to the education  of

their  children.  With compulsory education, we  must  ensure

that our schools cater to these students who receive part  of

their education overseas and in institutions with a different

educational  system from ours.  How do we ensure  that  these

children  who  are  brought  up in  a  different  educational

environment are accommodated into our system?  Otherwise,  we

run the risk of losing these children who might not return to

Singapore for their education.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, in the early days of nation

building,  the  majority of our people were  poor.   Families

were  large.  Children, when enrolled into Primary  One,  had

few if any pre-school education.  As a result, we all learned

our ABC together.  Today, the situation is quite different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every child at the entrance to Primary One would have

taken  at  least two years of kindergarten; majority attended

the  PAP Community Foundation (PCF) kindergartens.  For those

who  attended non-PCF kindergartens, they would have attended

programmes based on other pedagogical principles.   Thus,  on

one  end  of  the scale, we have children who are  very  well

schooled  in reading and writing; on the other end,  children

who have very little basis at all.  This state of affairs was

reported in the Straits Times recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Ministry is: How does the school

cater  to  different capabilities of the children at  Primary

One?   How  does the school assign them to different classes?

Do they go through a grading process?  What is the assumption

of the education level of the children at entry to P1?  Is it

pegged too low or too high?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that most children have attended two years

of PCF kindergarten.  Presumably, the PCF has a common set of

curriculum for all its kindergartens.  Thus,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2470</b></font><br><br>



once the PCF kindergartens are brought to a set of consistent

standards,  it  would  appear that the problem  of  different

standards  of various kindergartens would have by  and  large

been contained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some educationists consider pre-school to be

just as important, if not more important, than the first  few

years of primary education.  For some higher income families,

parents would have sent their children to private pre-schools

where  more individualised attention is possible.  Of course,

these   parents  are  prepared  to  pay  for  the  privilege,

sometimes  ranging from $300 per month upwards.   I  remember

several parents who approached me expressing fear that  their

children are so far advanced that they would be bored and de-motivated  if  their children are enrolled into Primary  One.

They  would  prefer to have their children  enrolled  into  a

higher level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our education system is built on an egalitarian

principle that all children, rich or poor, must be given  the

same educational opportunity.  Yet, it is beginning to emerge

that  not  all children beginning their Primary One education

are  studying  from  the same starting  line.   If  we  truly

believe  in  giving  children the same headstart,  we  should

start  thinking about subsidising pre-schools so that quality

teachers can be hired and engaged for these programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also aware that MOE has given up the idea of

extending primary school into pre-primary after experimenting

with it several years ago.  However, I would like to find out

from  the Ministry whether it is prepared to draft a  set  of

curriculum  for  all pre-primary schools and our  pre-schools

and  provide  some sort of subsidies to all these pre-schools

that conform to the curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving from pre-school to primary school, in terms of

school   fees,  today  the  child  pays  $12  per   year   as

supplementary  fees for primary schools.  For  those  parents

who  have  been  paying more for their children's  pre-school

education, I believe many would not mind continuing to pay at

that level.  Yet, because they do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2471</b></font><br><br>



not have to do so, they continue to spend the same budget  on

additional enrichment programmes and engaging private  tutors

once  their  children  enter primary  school.   This  is  not

necessarily  desirable  as  the  children  end  up   spending

additional time in private tuition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: Is it possible that our primary school

system   has  become  too  egalitarian?   There   were   some

preliminary discussions on allowing a few selected schools to

go  independent.  I would like to find out from the  Minister

whether this scheme has moved one step further.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, pre-school education is not

funded by the Government.  Though the Government is providing

$39  million  in  FY2000  for the  development  of  childcare

centres  through  the Ministry of Community  Development  and

Sports, no significant amount is provided for by the Ministry

to spend on pre-school education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small mention under the Education Programmes

Division  stating that it plans, monitors and regulates  pre-school  and  special  school  education.   If  anything,  the

workload  and  performance  indicator  shows  a  decline   in

commitment for pre-school education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure this is not reflective of the intention of the

Ministry of Education.  The moulding of the child starts at a

very  early  age.   It  is important  that  the  infants  and

toddlers are well taken care of and be properly prepared  for

formal schooling when they enter primary school.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Community Foundation is the largest provider of

kindergarten education in Singapore. We, PAP MPs,  are  proud

in  making  kindergarten  education affordable  to  the  vast

majority of HDB residents, especially the children from lower-income  families.   Of course, times have  changed.  We  have

introduced  computer  courses and music in  our  kindergarten

curricula. At times, it is a challenge to convince

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2472</b></font><br><br>



parents of the change and that education is an area best left

to the educational experts and professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because of the pace of growth and development

in  Singapore,  and  the expectations of Singaporean  parents

have gone up manifold, it is time that we reviewed how we can

upgrade and develop pre-school education to higher levels  of

performance.  It is now time for the Education Ministry to be

proactive to ensure that the desirable outcomes are spelt out

and   accomplished  for  children  going  through  pre-school

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now a wide variety of sources and institutions

providing   early  childhood  education.  Should  not   these

establishments be properly certified with stringent standards

imposed? Should not the Ministry be interested to ensure that

only good teachers are teaching in these institutions for pre-schoolers?    Our   review  would   have   the   benefit   of

strengthening the delivery system of pre-school education  in

Singapore  for  the  benefit  of  our  children  in  the  new

millennium.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, a recent report in the

Straits  Times  showed  that there  is  a  disparity  in  the

standards   of   pre-school  education  in  Singapore.   This

disparity  is  most evident in the extent to  which  children

have  been  prepared  for formal education  in  schools.  The

report  indicated that some children have already  covered  a

major  part  of  their primary 1 syllabus by  the  time  they

entered  school.  On the other hand, some children  are  just

beginning to get down to the basics of their English Language

at  primary  1,  even  though they have  attended  pre-school

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite naturally, some concerns arose in relation to the

divergence  of standards amongst pre-schoolers in  Singapore.

The  Education Ministry said that they were looking into this

area   by  specifying  clearer  indications  on  the  desired

outcomes of pre-school education here. For the moment,  I  am

given  to understand that our Government's position has  been

to  leave pre-school education to the private sector, and not

to take over this task. As a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2473</b></font><br><br>



result of leaving it to the private sector, standards for pre-school  education vary, not just to the extent of the ability

of the child on entering primary school, but also the quality

of  pre-school education and the teachers. Besides, the  fees

also  differ from kindergarten to kindergarten.  Despite  the

differences  in standard, I accept that pre-school  education

should,  at  the moment, continue to remain with the  private

sector. There is no reason why the Government should now step

in  to  take over that responsibility.  Besides, there is  no

real  evidence that kindergartens are generally not doing  an

adequate job of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is, however, something to be said of the role

of  Government in setting clearer guidelines and standards in

this  area. The Government's guidelines should cover not only

teaching methodology and curriculum, but also the standard of

administration, recruitment and training of teachers. In  the

final  analysis,  I am not too confident  that  even  if  the

Government were to set clear guidelines on what the child  is

expected  to know from pre-school education, there would  not

be  differing abilities among children in primary 1.  Parents

often contribute to the intense competition by wanting to  be

ahead  of  their  peers in schools. The  common  response  of

parents   from  recent  interviews  states  that  primary   1

standards  are tough and for that reason, their children  are

over-prepared  for  primary school.  I am  afraid  I  do  not

follow the logic of that reasoning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If primary 1 standard is tough, how does over-preparing

help?  Should  not  the approach be to mentally  prepare  the

child to deal with the tough syllabus ahead by cultivating  a

more enquiring mind? Setting expectations of the abilities of

children  on  entering primary school  is  not  the  same  as

requiring   them  to  cover  the  primary   1   syllabus   in

kindergarten.  Unfortunately, that is the  expectation  of  a

fair  number  of parents. Somehow, there is a sense  of  one-upmanship  for  parents whose children are able  to  do  book

reviews  at primary 1.  Is this ability really necessary  and

expected of a child at that level, or is it to give the child

or the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2474</b></font><br><br>



parents a certain sense of superior ability over the rest?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, I would like to say something of the

work  of  the  PCF.   We know that the PCF is  presently  the

largest provider of pre-school education in Singapore.  Since

its   inception,  the  PCF  has  provided  Singaporeans  with

affordable   pre-school  education.   Many   generations   of

Singaporeans  benefited greatly from it.   By  all  accounts,

there  is  no reason to believe that PCF does not  adequately

prepare  the child for primary education, although  I  cannot

quite  say that they prepare the child to write book  reviews

at primary 1 too. The Government believes that they are doing

a  good  job. At my PCF centre, we track the progress of  our

children  at primary 1 as of this year.  I have no reason  to

believe  that the children are not doing fine.  The PCF  even

has   its  own  training  institute  to  prepare  and   train

kindergarten  teachers.  PCF  centres  are  generally   well-managed,  and  I would say that they are even better-equipped

than  some  of the privately run kindergartens in  Singapore.

Many PCF centres undergo constant upgrading and renovation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, PCF suffers from the effects of snob

appeal.   Many up-only mobile parents do not think  that  the

PCF  is  good  enough  for their children.   I  suspect  this

prejudice may have to do with the fact that the PCF is rooted

in the HDB heartland or maybe because the PCF is not charging

exorbitant  sums to have that gilt-edge or maybe it  is  true

that  the  PCF  does  not teach the children  to  write  book

reviews.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to be realistic. At the end of the day, one has

to  ask  the  question  whether pre-school  education  is  to

prepare  a child to undertake primary education or is  it  to

ensure  that  he  or  she  is  ahead  of  his  peers  at  the

commencement  of school.  If we honestly ask  ourselves,  the

answer  is obvious. Even if the Government clearly  sets  the

expectations  of desired outcomes in preparing  a  child  for

school,  there will be many, many kiasu parents who  want  to

play the one-upmanship game. When it comes to this, I am sure

that there are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2475</b></font><br><br>



many centres who will continue to respond to their demands.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, allow me to share my experience as the

father of a child about to enter pre-school education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is literally a bewildering array of options open

to  parents. There is something for every budget, from a  few

tens  of  dollar a month up to a thousand dollars or  more  a

month  and, at the higher end, it is, in fact, more expensive

than  university education in some cases. There is  something

for  every form of pedagogic persuasion.  There are some  who

emphasise the traditional 3Rs, that is, reading, writing  and

arithmetic. There are others who propose and propagate  self-directed learning. Some emphasise more on the mother  tongue.

Others  emphasise more on the English language. In  terms  of

facilities,  the  array  is  again  quite  vast.   You   have

kindergartens  in  void  decks, you have  them  in  converted

landed  properties  and you have some customised  facilities.

Such  diversity is desirable for it gives parents  a  choice.

But  the  process  of analysing this information  and  making

informed decisions is worthy of a thesis in my view.  Because

parents in general have some difficulty in ascertaining  what

exactly is desired in pre-school education.  I for one do not

want  to  subject  my child to the rigours  of  writing  book

reviews,  if  that  is  not necessary,  and  indeed  that  is

something  that  the child will acquire in  the  fullness  of

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if this is a requirement or there is

some  expectation from the primary 1 school  level  that  the

child  should have certain minimum capabilities in this area,

I  would  wish  to  know about it because  that  would  be  a

criterion in deciding which centre I choose for my child.  My

purpose here is not to absolve parents of decision-making  on

the all important choice of where to send their child for pre-school  or,  for  that  matter, primary or  secondary  school

education.   My purpose is more to ask whether  the  Ministry

can be more proactive and helpful to parents in making those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2476</b></font><br><br>



choices.   My  colleagues, who have spoken  before  me,  have

highlighted several of these points.  I wish to add a few key

points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, basically, to know what is the desired outcome of

pre-primary education. If we know what the hurdle is, then we

know how hard to train to clear the hurdle.  Second, can  the

Ministry  be  less reticent about what form of curriculum  it

thinks will best serve that desired outcome? I think it would

not be unappreciated by parents if they have an idea from the

Ministry of Education on what curriculum structure it  thinks

will meet the basic requirements in preparation for P1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Ministry go a little bit further and in fact

undertake  certification to reassure parents that  regardless

of  where  the school or the kindergarten resides, regardless

of  the  teacher-pupil ratio and regardless of the  pedagogic

method,  a  certain minimum standard is being  met  and  that

parents can confidently enrol the child there without concern

that the child may not be getting what is appropriate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, can the Ministry allocate more resources

towards  research in this area, in order to ascertain clearly

in  our minds the value of pre-primary education and if it is

found to be valuable, then let us take a step further and say

we will accord adequate public funding to ensure that this is

done properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to that is the question of the training of

our teachers. The quality of pre-school teachers is extremely

wide. These issues come to the heart of one main problem that

a lot of parents face, which is, the contrast is stark in the

terrain  between pre-primary education and primary education.

Once  we  enter  primary school, the choice is quite  simple.

You  choose the school, but you know in general that they are

within  certain  boundaries and your child is being  prepared

for  the  Primary School Leaving Examinations. But  when  you

enter  pre-primary education, it is not very clear  what  you

are preparing the child for.  You know that there is this  P1

hurdle  but  we  do not know what exactly it  represents.   I

would be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2477</b></font><br><br>



grateful  if  the Ministry could comment further  on  how  it

proposes to assist parents in this regard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just ask hon. Members to try to

shorten their speeches because we still got a lot of speakers

on  this amendment and we have three other amendments to take

before we reach "guillotine" time, which is slightly over  an

hour away.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

share  some  of the views by Mr Iswaran and I would  like  to

think  that  adopting a more national standard in pre-primary

education would be one answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to raise two concerns of mine here

today.  First,  as Members have spoken, leaving  the  current

system  of  pre-primary  education entirely  to  the  private

sector  has brought about some vastly different outcomes  and

it  certainly  must be the case as reflected in some  surveys

and articles in the Straits Times.  Because different schools

adopt  different teaching methods and the philosophy  towards

learning,  have  different curriculum and facilities,  charge

different   fees,  provide  different  moral  and   religious

foundation.    Some   provided   more   enjoyable    learning

experience, while others put children through a more rigorous

preparation  for  primary 1 with examinations,  homework  and

tests.   Certainly, these different exposures and experiences

will  produce different outcomes.  Yet, they are all expected

to go to primary 1 where the students will be introduced to a

more  standard national education programme and I think  more

can  be  done  to  ensure  a  smoother  and  more  consistent

transition from pre-school to primary 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and this is my deep concern, I observe a growing

trend  of  religious and ethnic based organisations providing

pre-primary  education, either as a  social  service  or  for

commercial purposes.  Most parents have legitimate reasons to

want  to  send their children to such schools.  They want  to

give their children a very strong foundation in religious and

moral

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2478</b></font><br><br>



education  from the very young.  However, others,  especially

Malay    and   Indian   parents,   quite   frequently    cite

unavailability of Malay and Tamil as second language in  some

kindergartens  as  one  of  the  reasons  for  sending  their

children  to  a  school  run by ethnic  and  religious  based

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reasons, these are worrying trends because

the  very  success of this may result in, and hopefully  not,

pre-primary  education  being delivered  predominantly  along

ethnic  and  religious lines.  I fear that even at  the  very

young  and  early  age, this may result  in  children  having

conflicting  perceptions  of values,  cultures  and  separate

groups.   Should we not plant a strong foundation  of  multi-cultural education beginning at pre-school education?  And as

this  would  involve parents also, I think a more  culturally

integrated  pre-school  programme  can  help  develop  better

awareness  of  cultural perceptions, biases,  prejudices  and

stereotypes, even amongst parents.  I am therefore asking the

Minister  to  really consider a national  standard  for  pre-primary education.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while running kindergartens can be left entirely to

the  private sector, they should not be left entirely to  set

their  own  standards  and agenda.  A recent  Straits  Times'

survey shows that while more than 60% of parents do not  want

Government to take over pre-school education, amongst  Malays

and  Indians,  more preferred that the Government  made  pre-primary  education part of the national education system,  as

they feel that the Government would be the best placed agency

to  make this a more level playing field.  Otherwise, we will

continue with the perception that the better schools charging

higher  fees  provide  a  better  system  of  education   and

therefore if you have more money, you can better prepare your

children for primary one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, we must maintain flexibility and variety that

the  private market offers.  There will always be better  and

more expensive schools which parents can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2479</b></font><br><br>



choose  from.  But the bottom line must remain that  even  if

parents  can afford only the cheapest, they must and  can  be

assured  that all schools have the resources and  ability  to

adequately prepare children for primary one education.   This

is  an assurance that we can give to all parents.  But to  do

that, we need to ensure standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can think of a few areas where the Ministry can

enforce  standards to conduct audits and ensure that  schools

are  meeting  the  requirements.  One,  for  example,  is  in

qualification and competency of teachers.  The  Ministry  can

decide what are basic skills that teachers should have,  what

are  the  minimum requirements before someone  can  become  a

teacher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I can now address the Minister of State on

this matter, as I notice the Minister has left.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zulkifli, could you continue?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Second, is on syllabus and

curriculum, whether the syllabus has the right combination of

academic content, play and creative aspects, social skills to

build  confidence.   We can provide a basic  core  curriculum

that  must be very important, but I think we can also provide

flexibility  where schools can be left to  choose  their  own

elective subjects.  Thirdly, is racial composition.   I  come

back to this point again.  I think this is so very important.

And  the  survey shows that parents do not rank  mixing  with

other  races  as  very  important, but  it  is  important  to

Singapore.   It  is important to us that we cannot  leave  it

completely  to  free choice.  And if it has  to  be  ensured,

encouraged  or  enforced, then we have to do so.   So  nobody

should  just  set up a school predominantly for a  particular

ethnic group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the teaching of second language, this is quite

serious  sometimes, because what do you do when you have  one

Indian or Malay student in the school?  Do you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2480</b></font><br><br>



employ  a  Malay teacher and say, "Fine, it is  going  to  be

expensive to teach you."  Or you invest and say, "Fine,  this

is   something  you  are  committed  to.   Let's  find  other

students."  Or send them to some nearby schools without  much

of  a problem, but still assure them that they can get second

language education, even in pre-school.  I think here I  feel

a  more  coordinated effort can better address this.  My  own

vision  really,  if I could share with this  House,  is  that

perhaps  with CDCs wanting to take more and more  roles,  the

CDCs  could provide the facilities where these various ethnic

groups can provide education under one roof.  They can go  to

their  ethnic-based  schools, but when  it  comes  to  common

subjects, whether to share computers, playground, music, they

can  have common experiences.  And then they can go  back  to

their  own respective class where they can have religious  or

language education.  But at the end of the day, we can and we

should  provide,  even at the very young, a  very  integrated

experience,  so  that  our  long-term  objective  of   racial

integration   cannot  be  hampered  by   racial   or   ethnic

tendencies.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of State for

Education,  Dr  Aline  Wong, had,  in  a  recent  sitting  of

Parliament,  spoken about the cross curricular approach  that

the  Ministry takes for the delivery of sex education in  our

schools.   Dr  Wong mentioned that the schools  tap  resource

speakers  from  external  agencies,  such  as  MOH  and   the

Singapore  Planned Parenthood Association, to conduct  talks,

courses   and   seminars  relating  to   the   subject.    My

understanding,  however, is that the  primary  responsibility

still  lies with teachers assigned to the subject in schools.

Many  of  these  teachers  are most uncomfortable  with  this

assignment.   May I ask the Minister if it  might  not  be  a

better  approach to source out the teaching of sex  education

altogether  in an organised and structured way with  a  well-defined curriculum to agencies or organisations who would  be

able  to assign trained and qualified instructors, who  would

be far more comfortable and skilled in undertaking this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Sir, let me reply to those points on pre-school

education  first.   The  recent surge  of  interest  in  this

sector,  shall we use the abbreviated form of  PSE  for  pre-school  education,  has come about partly because,  over  the

last  decade or so, there has been some research,  especially

brain   research,   which  suggests  exciting   possibilities

especially   in   non-cognitive  development   and   language

acquisition  that  PSE  can bring  to  children.    This  has

prompted the public as well as the press and parliamentarians

alike to urge greater MOE involvement in this sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On past occasions, I have stated in this House my

position on PSE.  I think it must be cautioned that, taken as

a  whole,  the  findings are by no means  conclusive.   While

there  is  some  evidence that PSE provides a learning  head-start, there is also countervailing evidence showing that the

benefits  wear off after some time.  In fact, it  is  unclear

today  whether PSE brings sustained benefits, ie,  well  into

elementary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been calls in the press for MOE to pump

in  more  money into this sector.  But I think simply pouring

money  into PSE will not raise quality automatically.  It  is

better for us to carefully decide how to deploy resources  so

that most children can get the most value out of PSE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is my Ministry's response to the research

findings?   We  will  look at them more closely  and  explore

their  relevance to the local context.  In MOE's Addendum  to

the  President's Address last year, we announced that we will

be  more involved in PSE, paying particular attention to high

leverage   areas   like   defining  outcomes,   designing   a

developmentally-appropriate  curriculum,  training  teachers,

conducting research and improving our regulatory framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step must be to delineate the outcomes desired

of  PSE, in order to lend focus to our efforts and direct our

attention  to  what is most crucial.  Mr  Loh  Meng  See,  Mr

Iswaran and Mr Zulkifli

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2482</b></font><br><br>



Baharudin have all asked what MOE wants to achieve by PSE.  I

am  glad  to inform the House that the Steering Committee  on

PSE, which I chair, has come up with the Desired Outcomes  of

PSE.   It is a comprehensive, yet succinct, list of the  end-objectives  of  PSE  and  this  has  been  put  together   in

consultation  with professionals, practitioners  and  policy-makers.    May  I  ask  the Clerk of Parliament  to  help  me

distribute the sheet of paper containing the Desired Outcomes

of PSE.  [Document distributed to hon. Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice that the Desired Outcomes of PSE

closely  mirrors MOE's desired outcomes of education for  the

other levels, ie, primary, secondary and JC levels.  This  is

deliberate, so as to ensure a continuity of focus from PSE to

primary  one.   After all, learning is  a  continuum.   As  a

statement  of  outcomes  reflecting  values,  attitudes   and

skills, there is no mention of specific competencies  in  the

3Rs   -   reading,  writing and arithmetic.  Again,  this  is

deliberate, as we want to emphasise that PSE should be  about

preparing  children for life-long learning, and  not  just  a

preparation for primary one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current practice of some kindergartens offering

parts of the primary one curriculum needs to be re-looked at.

I am not saying that we should not teach the 3Rs.  Indeed, it

is  most unnatural to designate the first day of primary  one

as   the   beginning  of  reading,  writing  and   arithmetic

education.  What I am saying is that there are important pre-reading,  pre-writing and pre-arithmetic skills to be  learnt

before a child can read, write and do sums.  We need to  give

adequate attention to these critical fundamentals.  Moreover,

a  child's  motivation  and  interest  in  learning  must  be

nurtured  from  this tender age.  We must fire his  curiosity

and  his  sense of wonder.  He needs to learn  in  fun  ways,

through  play, art, music and movement.  Feeding him  with  a

curriculum that he is not ready for may raise his performance

in primary school or at primary one, but this may also dampen

his  love for learning which will severely affect success  in

school in the long term.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The press recently reported the case of one primary

school  requiring  children  entering  primary  one  to  have

already  learnt to read and spell about 100 words.   I  would

like  to  assure the House that this is an extreme case,  and

that  the practice is not widespread.  MOE's policy  is  that

schools  will take in primary one pupils with varying degrees

of  readiness and teach them from there.  In regular meetings

with principals, MOE has reminded schools of this policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desired outcomes will be translated into a new

curriculum  which  will  provide  age  appropriate   learning

activities  in  five  domains, ie, moral, cognitive,  social,

emotional and physical domains.  This new curriculum will  be

ready  in  about  half  a year's time.   We  will  teach  the

children  what  is  right and wrong.   Cognitively,  children

should   learn   through   discovery,   experimentation   and

observation.   Language learning will  focus  on  aural,  ie,

listening,   and  oral,  ie,  speaking,  skills.    Socially,

children  will  learn to listen attentively, share  and  work

together.  Emotionally, they will develop self-confidence and

be  able  to relate to others, to their peers and to  adults.

Activities will also help children develop their physical co-ordination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that the new curriculum

will  help  to ensure a smooth transition for young  children

from  pre-school to primary one.  In designing the curriculum

for  primary one, MOE will start from the desired outcome "Be

able  to  listen and speak with understanding".  There  is  a

language  focus  in  primary one,  particularly  in  English,

because  this is the medium of instruction and the  means  by

which  students  access  most  subjects  in  the  curriculum.

Pupils entering primary one do differ in English proficiency,

because  of  their different abilities and backgrounds.   For

those with basic oral and aural proficiency, the primary  one

curriculum  will  build on that.  For those with  no  English

facility, schools will focus on the development of the  aural

and   oral  skills  first,  and  early  reading  and  writing

activities will be gradually phased in.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have remarked on the different standards of

various PSE centres.  I think this is natural, given that the

community   and  private  sectors  provide  PSE,  and   MOE's

regulatory  role is in setting guidelines on  curriculum  and

teacher-training.  Many people want MOE to bring children  to

the  same starting point at primary one.  While this is well-intentioned,  in  reality, it is impossible.   Children  have

different abilities and aptitudes, and their home backgrounds

vary.   It  is unrealistic to expect that they will turn  out

the  same  just because they have been through the same  pre-school  programme  for  one  or  two  years.   Even  students

attending exactly the same pre-school class will come  to  P1

with  different levels of preparedness and proficiency. Also,

as  Mr  Sin  Boon  Ann has put it so eloquently,  there  will

always  be parents who try to give their children that  extra

head-start in PSE over their peers.  Children, especially  at

this  age  of  rapid growth, are different. They  develop  at

different  rates and in different ways. We cannot  "equalise"

everyone after two years of kindergarten.  We cannot even  do

that  after  10  years  of general education.   In  fact,  as

education is about enabling each child to achieve, given  his

own combination of talents and abilities, it must show up  in

the  end  the  diverse  achievements of people  in  different

areas.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSE can, and should, bring children to an adequate

level  of  school readiness.  It cannot, and  should  not  be

expected  to  "equalise" every child by Primary  1.   The  P1

programme and P1 teachers recognise that pupils are different

and they will adapt strategies that are appropriate for them.

Actually, our schools already have programmes that  cater  to

these   differences.   For  example,  the  Learning   Support

Programme is designed to help P1 and P2 children who have not

yet  attained  a  sufficient level of English proficiency  to

improve  quickly.  This programme has proven to be successful

and has greatly helped the children improve their reading and

writing skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recap, school readiness is not about mastering some

of the P1 curriculum by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2485</b></font><br><br>



day  one  in  primary school.  It is also  more  than  having

adequate  language facility, important though it is.   School

readiness  is  about  being eager  to  learn,  able  to  make

friends,  take  turns  and share, pay attention,   and  enjoy

learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have rightly identified teacher quality as the

key  to  raising  the quality of PSE.  This  point  has  been

raised  by  Mr  Iswaran  and Mr Loh Meng  See.   My  Steering

Committee  on  PSE  has set up a  task force  comprising  MOE

officials  and  representatives from NIE  and  other  service

providers  in order to study the matter.  It will  look  into

the  teacher-training  curriculum  for  different  levels  of

qualification, as well as an accreditation framework, and map

out  progression  routes for PSE teachers  to  attain  higher

qualifications.   The  task force will  also  study  how  PSE

teachers  can participate in continual education and training

in  order  to  develop better practice and  keep  abreast  of

professional developments in their field.  At present,  there

are a number of agencies providing PSE teacher-training.  The

task  force is looking into how MOE can assure standards  and

rationalise  the  provision of teacher  training  among  such

agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for research, I have earlier explained the need to

establish the long-term value of PSE.  I also made a case for

carefully  determining the optimal investment in PSE,  should

it  be shown that it plays a significant part in raising  the

overall  capacity of our people.  MOE intends to achieve  the

above  through  a  pilot  research  programme.   This  is   a

longitudinal  study to ascertain the long term cognitive  and

non-cognitive  benefits of PSE.  In particular,  we  will  be

studying  the impact of teacher-training and a new curriculum

on children's intellectual and social growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full details of the pilot research, such as the number

of   children   involved,  participating  centres,   research

methodology and funding will be announced later.   The  pilot

research  will  yield useful insights into  the  training  of

teachers and the development of instructional materials.  The

aim  is  to  see  how  we can raise the  quality  of  PSE  in

Singapore, and what level of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2486</b></font><br><br>



Government  investment  is  justifiable.   A  full   research

programme with longitudinal studies indicating the effects of

different pre-school strategies is likely to take many years,

perhaps  up to seven.  MOE will carry out a pilot study,  and

is  prepared to proceed on a wider scale on the basis of  the

preliminary  results of this study after two to three  years,

if  the preliminary results indicate that longer term results

are likely to be good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, I want to emphasise that MOE will not take

over  PSE.   The provision of PSE will remain firmly  in  the

hands  of the private and people sectors.  There is merit  in

allowing  different centres with different  philosophies  and

schools  of thought to offer different types of PSE.   If  we

look at the range of opinions offered by the press interviews

just two days ago, some parents do not want the Government to

step  in  at  all.  They want choice. They want  variety.   I

think  leaving it in the private and voluntary  sectors  will

encourage creative innovation, as each centre strives to meet

the needs of its unique pupil profile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge parents to work hand in hand with the

centres,  and  later  on with schools, to  provide  the  best

learning opportunities and experience for their children.  It

must be remembered that PSE is only one factor of success  in

learning.  Home support for children is equally, if not more,

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our eagerness to promote PSE, we must not think that

early  childhood education is just done in or by PSE centres.

I  should  add  that  the  recent  spate  of  press  reports,

interviews and comments have shown that parents have  a  very

wide  range of views on the issues.  This is to be  expected.

However,  if  these reports have raised a lot of expectations

and  anxieties among parents regarding PSE, maybe this is  an

unintended  result, it is still not very helpful.   It  would

not help matters.  MOE will take the approach of tackling the

issues  step  by  step.  This will ensure  that  any  further

Government investment in this sector will be worth the monies

spent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2487</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on to compulsory education, I would like

to respond to Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin's point regarding the

segregation  of  children  in  ethnically  run  or  religious

affiliated  centres.   The  PCF  centres  which  provide  the

largest  proportion of pre-school education  to  children  in

Singapore are open to everybody.  In fact, many of them  have

Malay  teachers.  They offer classes in Malay language  as  a

second  language.   Yes,  there  is  some  problem  with  the

offering  of  Tamil  language and they are  trying  to  group

together to send children to certain centres that have  these

classes.  Mr Zulkifli said that the Government should perhaps

come in and integrate the different ethnic groups in the  PSE

centres.   But if there are some parents who prefer  to  send

their  children to religiously-affiliated centres that  teach

not  just  PSE  but  religious education, I  think  there  is

nothing very much the Government can do about that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have addressed most of the points raised by

Members  on  PSE.   Let  me move very quickly  to  compulsory

education as time is running out.  I would like to  thank  Dr

Wang  Kai  Yuen for calling us to focus on the twin goals  of

our  national education system. To reiterate, the  two  goals

are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to give our children a common core of knowledge

and  skills,  which  will  provide a  strong  foundation  for

further  education  and  training  that  would  prepare   our

children for a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to give our children a common educational

experience which will help build national identity and social

cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the range of views that we have been hearing at

our  feedback  sessions, and from the press as well  as  from

Members of the House, I think it is important for us to  keep

constantly in mind these two main objectives of our  national

school  system.   In  deciding on whether or  not  compulsory

education should be introduced and the form and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2488</b></font><br><br>



duration  by  which it should take place, we must  constantly

bear  in  mind  these  two major objectives,  which  are  the

reasons why MOE has done its best to bring most children into

our national school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Committee on Compulsory Education is still in the

process of gathering feedback and studying the experience  of

other countries, I do not think I should take up the time  of

the  House  much further.  We will study the issues  and  the

feedback raised by Members of the House very carefully before

we make our recommendations and put up a report by the second

half of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is not here. I think he said something about

the  duration of compulsory education.  I would also consider

his views together with the other Members' when we decide  on

the duration of compulsory education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me respond very quickly to Dr Jennifer Lee's

questions on sexuality education.   She asked whether or  not

we  should  source  out the teaching of  sexuality  education

because most teachers who are entrusted to teach this subject

find  it uncomfortable to do so.  This is indeed one problem,

but  sourcing out is not the solution because there are  very

few  agencies  out  there which have the  expertise  and  the

inclination  to do so.  What we plan to do is that  we  would

like  to get the support not just from the teachers but  also

from  members  of  the  community and,  where  necessary  and

possible,  even  volunteer parents,  to  help  us  teach  the

subject.  Bearing in mind that not all teachers may have  the

background  or  inclination to conduct lessons  in  sexuality

education,  we will be providing the schools with  a  set  of

criteria  for  the  selection  of  appropriate  teachers  for

sexuality education. We will give them the adequate training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing up the criteria, we have consulted

psychologists, social workers and other professionals in this

field  from organisations such as the Institute of Health  in

the  Ministry  of Health, and Family Service  Centres.   They

have been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2489</b></font><br><br>



involved in the development of the selection criteria.   They

will  also be involved in the training of teachers,  and  may

act as advisers to schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are presently developing a more holistic approach to

sexuality  education, building on what is already covered  in

the  existing  curriculum and bearing in mind  the  different

needs   of   the  students  at  different  stages  of   their

development.   A multi-media package is being produced  which

will examine concepts and attitudes in sexuality education in

a  structured  manner.  This will be used  as  an  additional

resource   for   guided  discussions  about   responsibility,

consequences and choices with respect to one's sexuality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality education has been, and will continue to be,

carried out alongside civics and moral education because  MOE

always  believes in imparting the  right moral  values.   But

MOE  is  aware  that  the subject of sexuality  touches  very

deeply  held  beliefs  which may differ  between  people  and

across  communities. As such, we will consult  various groups

before  deciding  on  whether this  additional  component  of

sexuality   education  should  be  built  into   the   school

curriculum  or  be  left as an optional  programme.   Let  me

assure Dr Jennifer Lee that we are working on the subject.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, technical education as provided

by  ITE  is  not  considered high in the  aspiration  of  our

secondary school students, neither do parents encourage their

children  to  take  this  up  as  a  career  choice,  thereby

relegating  it to a choice of last resort.  As  the  Minister

has  already  pointed  out earlier,  the  perception  of  ITE

education  is  that it is still a career choice resulting  in

getting one's fingers greasy.  This is unfortunate as  it  is

natural  in the human population that individuals are endowed

with   different  abilities  and  talents  across  the  whole

spectrum.   Every  Singaporean  counts,  and  each  must   be

educated  and trained to the best of his ability.  Thus,  ITE

caters  to those for whom the academic progammes of  the  "A"

level  would  not  be suitable.  Furthermore,  ITE  graduands

would play meaningful roles in our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2490</b></font><br><br>



society.   Hence,  the  negative  perception  regarding   ITE

training should be changed and this job should not be left to

the Government alone.  All of us must play our part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that the various Community Development

Councils  are  already  doing  their  part  by  inviting  the

advisers  to  hand out Edusave bursaries to ITE  students  at

public functions.  From time to time, we also read about  the

success stories of ITE graduands in striking out and starting

their  businesses.  More could be done.   I  would  urge  the

Ministry  to do more in promoting the image of ITE  education

among Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, four out of every 10 students do

not  go  to the polytechnics or the universities.   They  are

encouraged  to go to the Institute of Technical Education  to

acquire  skills  that will fit them into  the  factories  and

offices.   As  Singapore globalises and our  industries  move

into  high-tech, it is important that we train all our people

at  every level to the best of their capability.  This is one

of  the reasons for starting the Normal (Technical) stream to

cater  to students who are not academically strong.  By  now,

several Normal (Technical) stream cohorts have graduated.   I

wonder  if  the  Minister  would share  with  the  House  the

performance of the Normal (Technical) students to-date.   How

many  just  stopped  after  they  completed  their  secondary

education?  How many of them proceeded to the ITE?  How  many

managed to transfer to a Normal (Academic) stream?  Among the

latter, how many went on to take the "O" level examinations?

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are fast transforming into a knowledge-based

economy.   I  am  sure  that  the training  that  the  Normal

(Technical) students are getting at the ITE is preparing them

for  such a future.  We should therefore get as many of  them

as we can to go to ITE.  What more can we do to achieve this,

so  that  more students can participate in the very  exciting

and challenging future before us?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Sir, I would like to thank Dr Wang and Dr Tan for

their interest in Technical Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their interest is well-placed because our technical

institutions  have been tasked to provide technical  training

for  secondary  school leavers, so as to meet  the  economy's

demand  for  technicians and skilled manpower.   The  concern

about ITE's image is understandable, given that the number of

students entering ITE constitutes a significant 25%  of  each

cohort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang believes that technical education deserves a

much  higher  profile and reputation, an  image  that  people

should  have  in their mind.  I fully agree with  him  and  I

would substantiate this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the establishment of ITE in 1992, concerted

efforts  have been made to improve the public perception  and

image of ITE.  There are many parties to thank for.  Firstly,

the  Government has invested, on average, $170 million a year

over  the past five years in ITE to expand campuses and build

modern  facilities.  ITE students now study  in  a  conducive

environment and have access to the latest high-tech equipment

and information technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the quality of teaching has improved. The

care  and  concern  shown by ITE teachers have  helped  boost

students' self-esteem, confidence and motivation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the media has been most supportive of ITE. In

1999  alone,  there  were 284 favourable  mentions  in  media

coverage in the form of press reports, TV exposures and radio

broadcasts.  This is a 21% increase over 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more and more ITE graduates make some headlines with

their successes, ITE has found it useful to consolidate these

success  stories as an encouragement to staff,  students  and

parents.  I have given to Members of the House here a copy of

an  annual  publication  by ITE titled  "I  did  it  my  way"

[indicating].   The  title is reminiscent of  the  well-known

song by Frank Sinatra, but it has a ring of confidence and a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2492</b></font><br><br>



certain pride in it.  The current publication features 23 ITE

alumni  who are now successful professionals or entrepreneurs

and  also  those who have excelled in the pursuit of  further

studies  in  polytechnics  and  universities.   It  gives  an

account  of  how  ITE has given students  a  headstart  to  a

worthwhile career by providing a technical education and  how

teachers, through their enthusiasm in teaching and  faith  in

these  students,  have  inspired learning  sometimes  against

seeming odds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, ITE is a reputed post-secondary educational

institution  with  a network of 10 modern  and  well-equipped

institutions,   offering  a  wide   range   of   engineering,

technical,   business  studies  and  service  courses.    ITE

students   are  proud  to  be  in  such  a  vibrant  learning

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premium placed by employers on ITE education did not

come  about just by better packaging and selling.  The latest

employment  survey  conducted by ITE  showed  that  the  mean

monthly  gross  salary of ITE graduates  had  increased  from

$1,321  in  1997  to  $1,469 in 1998.  This  is  despite  the

economic  downturn.  The employment survey also  reflected  a

strong  industry  demand for ITE graduates -  92%  of  1998's

graduates were employed and 87% of them obtained their  first

jobs within three months from graduation.  In short, there is

real substance in an ITE graduate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that ITE students are practice-oriented

and  are  quick at assimilating hands-on training.  There  is

nothing wrong in being practice-oriented, especially when you

are good at it.  But there are also many who are academically

inclined  -  they  may develop this trait a  bit  later  than

others.   About  15% of ITE students move on to  polytechnics

and  2%  go  on to complete their university education.   The

statistics  also  suggest that ITE graduates  who  go  on  to

polytechnics  are likely to do well there.   Generally,  they

achieve  a higher pass rate than other non-ITE graduates  and

in most instances, the pass rate was 100%.  Also, a higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2493</b></font><br><br>



percentage  of them achieve Diplomas with Merit, as  compared

to non-ITE graduates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan has asked whether ITE education prepares the

young for a KBE.  I  would like to stress that ITE has always

made it a point to stay relevant to the needs and development

of  the  economy  by regularly reviewing its  curriculum  and

programmes.    Employability  skills  such  as  communication

skills,  mathematics,  IT,  industrial  studies  and   social

studies  are taught to ensure that students will be  able  to

cope  with  demands beyond their own areas of specialisation.

ITE  has  also  introduced four courses during the  last  two

years  in  response to the growth in IT and chemical  process

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must recognise that with the rapid pace of

technological developments, knowledge and skills will  become

obsolete  very  quickly.   The  only  way  to  ensure  skills

relevance  is  through  training  and  retraining.   In  this

regard,  ITE  will gear up in terms of training capacity  and

programmes  so that more ITE graduates and the  workforce  in

general  can  upgrade  and  renew  their  skills  to   remain

employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE's intake comprises mainly three levels of

students   from   secondary  schools:   first,   the   Normal

(Technical), Normal (Academic) as well as the `O' levels.  Dr

Tan  has  specifically  asked about the  performance  of  the

Normal (Technical) stream students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members recall, the Normal (Technical) course was

introduced  in  1994  to  allow  the  more  practice-oriented

students to go through 10 years of general education,  before

undergoing technical training.  To ensure that these students

can  learn at a comfortable pace, they were given a different

curriculum which focused on the teaching of English  Language

and  Mathematics  and  a  practical,  hands-on  approach   in

learning, so as to prepare them for a technical education  at

ITE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made significant progress in achieving these

objectives.  Since the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2494</b></font><br><br>



introduction  of  the Normal (Technical)  stream  course,  an

additional 10% of the Primary 1 cohort has completed 10 years

of  education.  The first three cohorts of Normal (Technical)

stream students have completed their secondary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has provided them with the necessary foundation in

language  and mathematics for a technical education  in  ITE.

Three  quarters  or  more of the Normal (Technical)  pool  of

students are enrolled in ITE each year.  ITE will continue to

encourage even more to enrol.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to report that our Normal (Technical)

students have done well in their ITE training.  Of the  4,033

Normal (Technical) stream students who have enrolled for full-time  ITE training in January 1998, 2,204 have graduated with

NTC-2  qualifications and 1,013 with Certificates  in  Office

Skills,  marking  a success rate of 80%.  The  percentage  of

Normal   (Technical)   students   who   have   been   awarded

Certificates  of Merit is also comparable to those  from  the

Normal (Academic) students who enrolled in ITE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said enough about the benefits of ITE

education.   How can we spread this message even further?   I

believe  our  school  teachers can  help  to  encourage  more

students  to  further  their  education  at  ITE  with  their

counselling on career development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE's next target would be the teachers who can help to

make  things  happen.   ITE  is  planning  to  introduce   an

Immersion Programme to strengthen the information network and

rapport between ITE and schools.  The programme will serve as

a platform for secondary school teachers to experience first-hand  the  improved teaching environment in ITE, to find  out

about  the different courses and modes of training available,

talk  to ITE students and obtain feedback on the progress  of

their   ex-students   and   their  strengths   and   learning

difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme will include in-house briefings, workshops

and  sharing  sessions, as well as tours of  companies  which

offer apprenticeship training to ITE

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2495</b></font><br><br>



students.  The apprenticeship training scheme allows students

to  work to earn some income as they continue their education

at  ITE.   The  tours will help teachers  to  gain  a  better

understanding of the career prospects of ITE students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE has really come a long way. We are encouraged

by  ITE's  achievements  and the positive  change  in  public

perception.  We hope Members of this House and the public can

continue  to  support ITE in creating a fruitful  educational

experience for our students.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

hope  that the Ministry of Education would review the  school

admission  system.   Let  me give you  an   illustration.   A

mother  looked at the plot of vacant land near her HDB  flat.

Words  got  round that the Government was going  to  build  a

primary school there.  She was full of expectations.  "Good,"

she  said,  "next time, my boy can just walk to  school.   No

need  to  take a bus.  Save time, save money."  Soon,  piling

works  started.  Noise, dust, and all sorts of inconvenience.

Never  mind!   Suffer  a  bit  now,  but  think  of  all  the

conveniences  next time.  It is worth it!  More  noise,  more

dust,  and  the  children suffered plenty of  mosquito  bites

because of the patches of water at the work-site.  Endure  it

silently.   Finally,  the  building was  completed,  and  the

school  began to enrol its first batch of students. Now,  the

boy was all geared up to go to school next door.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When registration started, the boy was eligible under

Phase   2(c).   Alas!  When  it  was  time  for  Phase   2(c)

registration,  the  school was fully enrolled.   Registration

closed.  No more place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, mother brings her son downstairs to take the school

bus to a school which is one hour's ride away.  She looks  at

the  brand-new school building, and all the cheerful boys and

girls  running and playing away.  Flag-raising ceremony,  and

the  National Anthem is sung. She clutched her fist and  held

it  against her chest.  Was she singing the National  Anthem?

No,  she

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2496</b></font><br><br>



was singing the pop song: "You are my pain in the heart"!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Education can understand the

predicament  of  all these young couples who  stay  near  the

neighbourhood  schools, yet cannot find  a  place  there  for

their  children.  Can  the  Ministry  of  Education  consider

allowing  the neighbourhood schools to have more  flexibility

in  implementing the one-kilometre radius priority rule,  for

the benefit  of all those who live within walking distance of

the  school?  Perhaps we should bring these cases forward  to

Phase 2(a) instead of Phase 2(c).

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

annual  Primary  One registration exercise is something  that

parents  are  most concerned about.  As a parent,  I  do  not

agree  with  sending  my  children to the  so-called  branded

school.   I can fully understand the eagerness of the parents

to send their children to these branded schools, because they

have  high  expectations for their children.  Therefore,  the

number  of children seeking admission into these schools  has

increased over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Ministry that "seeded"

primary schools be given greater autonomy by allowing them to

set  their  own  entrance test for the purpose  of  admitting

Primary  One  children.   Although the  prospective  students

should  not  be  subjected to a written entrance  test,  they

should  at  least  be  tested  on  their  conversational  and

counting  skills.   This is better than  the  present  system

where  children are admitted in Phases 2(a), 2(b)  and  2(c).

The  majority of schools, such as neighbourhood  schools  and

non-SAP schools, can retain the existing admission procedures

for children who do not want to take such an entrance test.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, children enjoy priority in

selection  when they register at a primary school within  two

kilometres  of  their  home.   This  makes  sense   as   this

arrangement  reduces  the distance and  the  amount  of  time

needed for them to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2497</b></font><br><br>



commute  between home and school. Therefore,  ideally,  every

home  should lie within the two-kilometre radius of a primary

school.   But  this  is not always the case.  Some  of  these

exceptional houses are in Nee Soon South, the ward that I  am

in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a request to make to the Minister. Would he

consider  allowing  children from  such  houses  anywhere  in

Singapore  to enjoy priority selection at the nearest  school

to their homes as it is for such children, the nearest school

is  already far from home?  If these children do not study in

the nearest school, they will have to travel to a school even

further  away. Hence, compared to a child that  lives  within

two  kilometres  of  a  primary school,  these  children  are

disadvantaged twice over.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> As time is running out, I thought I

should  come  in  now and at least respond  to  some  of  the

questions that Members have raised in case I do not have time

to answer afterwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P1 registration system balances many different

considerations, including previous loyalty and  contributions

to  the school as well as proximity to the school.  Proximity

to  the  school  is actually one of the considerations  which

receives  quite a lot of weight because there is a  limit  to

previous  connections with the school after the old  boys  as

well  as  siblings have been taken into account. Whatever  is

left  is divided into two, half of that goes to students  who

have  previous connections with the school and the other half

to  those who are living within the proximity of the  school.

There  are many ways to divide proximity and we have  decided

to  treat those within two kilometres as one group and  those

within  one  kilometre  as another group.  It  will  be  very

complicated to go down any further than that. We  can  assure

Mr  Yeo that all students will be able to get a place in  the

school within their DGP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also consider what Dr Tan has raised, which is,

what  happens  if  students do not have a school  within  two

kilometres. We will see whether we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2498</b></font><br><br>



devise  a  system  for that.  As for having  schools  to  set

entrance examinations, written or otherwise, I am really  not

in   favour  of  that.  We  already  have  quite  a  lot   of

examinations and pressure for students in school. But I  must

agree  with  Mr Peh though that whatever primary school  that

our students go to, the quality is generally quite good.   As

we can see, students who come from very neighbourhood schools

can  do very, very well.  And when we have students who  have

come  from  neighbourhood primary  schools,  at  the  end  of

Primary 3, they do have an opportunity to take the evaluation

for the Gifted Education Programme and some of them do go for

the  Gifted Education Programme and they transfer schools  in

the  process. We have also seen that students who have stayed

on  in  their own primary schools have done very  well.   For

example,  one of the top students in the PSLE last year  came

from  one of our neighbourhood primary schools, and I imagine

that  in  future,  we  will continue  to  see  some  of  this

happening.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, there is no doubt

that  the  responsibility for guiding and establishing  right

values  in  children  lies with parents. This  responsibility

cannot  be  delegated  to others, such  as  school  teachers,

social workers, etc.  Yet, if there are children who are  not

receiving  the right nurturing, or perhaps none at all,  what

should  be  done?   Should the void be  left  alone  and  the

development of such children be left to chance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dual-income families, single parents, or

circumstances  where parents are unable,  unwilling  or  just

unknowing  about how to go about bringing up their  children,

there  is  a need for support from the community or even  the

system.  Every child has the potential to become a successful

individual  with the proper guidance and help.  I  am  urging

the  Ministry  of Education to consider setting  up  boarding

schools  to  supplement those which exist in  Singapore.  The

track record for properly operated boarding schools has  been

good  in Singapore and elsewhere. There is a long history  of

such successes in other countries, especially in England.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, the fear that parents would be

encouraged to take the easy path and send their children  off

to  boarding schools, instead of making the effort  to  bring

them  up  themselves. This is a valid fear and no  doubt,  it

will  be  the  motivating reason for some parents.   However,

whatever, the underlying reason for the children to  be  sent

to  a boarding school, at least these children can be assured

of  guidance  and assistance. At least as a  nation,  we  are

assured  that our precious children are being cared  for  and

not neglected.  For every Singaporean to matter, our children

must  be given a fair chance at life. We must make sure  that

they  have  a fighting chance of becoming successful  adults.

Their success will be the nation's success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boarding schools provide the vital environment to help

children through the difficult stage of teenhood. Proper care

is  always  at  hand. In the boarding school, their  time  is

organised  and they only have to concentrate on learning  and

developing.  Boarding  schools can  be  the  alternative  for

parents who cannot cope with their parental role.  I urge the

Ministry to consider this.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, while Mr Ee has quoted one

particular tenet of S21, there is also another tenet of  S21,

which  I consider equally important, and that is, the  family

as  the  basic unit of society. I would not want to undermine

that   by  creating  boarding  schools  so  that  dual-income

families can discharge their responsibility to their children

by  placing  them  in boarding schools.  In other  countries,

there   are  quite  different  circumstances.   For  example,

boarding   schools   in  England  were   the   places   where

colonialists who came out to the Far East and elsewhere, sent

their children back home to get an education. That is quite a

different  environment.  In fact, one of  our  objectives  of

having  boarding  schools in Singapore is really  to  provide

places for Singaporeans who go overseas and work overseas and

who  may  want to have their children come back to  Singapore

for secondary education, and we provide for that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country. Children do not live very

far  away  from  their schools and the boarding  schools  are

expensive. I would not want to spend educational resources on

providing  boarding schools for children when  I  think  they

will  be much better off spending time at home.  Rather  than

taking  them away from their parents who are busy by  putting

them  in  boarding  schools, I would  prefer  them  to  spend

whatever time that they have with their parents at home.

Development Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code LB

5100.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was envisioned that information technology would

alter  the face of education, especially it would drastically

change the way that instructions are delivered and this would

reduce  the  number of teachers needed in  our  schools.   An

example  is  the  use of on-line courses or  e-learning.  The

instructions are computerised and automated. It is done once.

It does not depend on the number of students or the number of

batches of them. Thereafter, every student is brought through

the delivery process by the computer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has used IT in our schools for teaching and

learning  for several years.  I have a few questions  on  the

impact that IT has made on our schools so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2501</b></font><br><br>



far.  Have we taken sufficient advantage of the potential  of

IT in the delivery of lessons in our schools? How is IT being

used  in  the delivery of lessons?  Has it since reduced  the

number of teachers needed?  If so, how many less? What is the

saving  in manpower cost from these reductions?  And finally,

what further impact and role will IT make in the delivery  of

education in our schools in the future?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, the purpose of introducing

information  technology  in  schools  was  not   to   replace

teachers.  That was not the intention at all. In fact,  as  I

have  said many times in this House, teaching is a completely

human  enterprise and the purpose of introducing  information

technology  in  the  schools is  to  give  the  teachers  and

students  quite another tool in which to pursue teaching  and

learning.   I am unable to answer some of the questions  that

Dr  Tan brought up because that was not the objective at  all

of  introducing  information technology  in  schools  and  if

introducing  information technology in schools was  for  that

purpose, I will not agree with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other matters which Dr Tan has raised

regarding  what  we  have done for teacher  training  and  so

forth,   I  believe  my  colleague,  Mr  Chen  has  given   a

comprehensive reply on Wednesday.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply and

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Mr Low.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L of the

Development  Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect  of  Code

LF5200.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) When did the Government decide to provide the grants to

PCF and on what considerations that Government so decided?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2502</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How much grant has been disbursed to PCF so far

since the scheme started?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Does the Ministry assess the effectiveness of

application of the grants, and if so, what improvements  have

been  made by the PCF in terms of its curriculum or upgrading

of  its facilities, and whether these improvements are across

the board of all PCF education centres or only in PAP wards?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Does the Ministry impose any guidelines on

operation  of PCF education centres, for example, whether  we

allow PCF to admit students based on political affiliations?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I believe Mr Low Thia Khiang is talking

about  the  disbursement to the PCF under the  capital  grant

scheme  which was implemented from 1991 to help kindergartens

in   the   private  and  community  sectors   upgrade   their

facilities.  If the Member will remember, in the early 1990s,

as  part  of  the  MOE's  review of its  role  in  pre-school

education (PSE), it was decided that provision of PSE  should

remain  in  the hands of the private and people  sectors.  So

this  capital grant scheme was implemented.  In fact, Mr  Low

himself  asked  a  question of Mr Lee  Yock  Suan,  the  then

Minister for Education, in a Parliamentary debate sometime in

1992.  He was aware of the implementation of this project  in

1992.

The  disbursements under the scheme are given under a set  of

criteria. Applicants must be registered with MOE.  Applicants

must   offer   a   good   two-year  kindergarten   programme.

Applicants  must have a good track record and  must  be  non-profit  bodies.  They  must submit the  detailed  development

proposal which has been approved by the relevant authorities.

To  safeguard  public  funds,  kindergartens  in  receipt  of

capital  grants  should  abide by the  following  conditions,

failing  which,  they  should refund  Government  the  entire

capital  grant. The applicants must apply the money  for  the

purpose for which it is given and they should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2503</b></font><br><br>



complete the project within a stipulated period of time, keep

proper  accounts and support claims for grants  with  audited

statements of accounts and so on.  The applicants  must  also

operate  the  kindergartens for a period  of  at  least  five

years.   They  should  adopt  the  education  programme   and

curriculum  materials which meet the Ministry's standard  and

they  should  admit all members of the public, regardless  of

race,  language  or  religion.  It is never  meant  to  admit

people  with  political affiliations.  In the  event  that  a

kindergarten  fails to operate within the minimum  stipulated

period  of  five  years,  they will have  to  refund  to  the

Government  the  capital grant on a pro-rated  basis  on  the

balance  of  the  five-year period.  Any  kindergarten  which

fulfills the above criteria is free to apply for the  capital

grant.   To answer Mr Low, this capital grant scheme  is  not

confined to the PCF.  Any charitable organisation which meets

these criteria is free to apply for the capital grant.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards how much money has been spent so far under

this  scheme,  to-date,  a total of $19.4  million  has  been

released  to  the PCF, and 116 centres  have benefitted  from

this capital grant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also asked whether this scheme has been effective

in  helping to raise the quality of pre-school education.   I

think  so.   If  Members  remember, before  this  scheme  was

instituted,  the quality of the programmes being  offered  in

the  non-public sector, including the PCF centres, left  much

to  be  desired.  Ten years back  - and we are talking  about

1991    -    the  cohort  participation  rate  in  pre-school

programmes  was  not high, not as high as  today,  especially

among the lower income families.  Even among the children who

attended pre-school programmes, a significant proportion were

attending programmes for only two hours a day or for only one

year.   PCF  already  was  the major provider  of  pre-school

education at that time, and they were willing to come forward

to put in resources and efforts.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2504</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital grant scheme allows MOE to fund only up to

90% of the capital or renovation cost.  The centre itself has

to  come  out with the balance of 10%.  The PCF was the  only

organisation  that met the criteria and was willing  to  come

forward  to  put in resources and efforts to help  raise  the

standard  of  pre-school education in Singapore.   Ten  years

later,  ie,   now,  PCF  centres,  particularly  those  which

benefitted  from the capital grant scheme, have benefitted  a

great  deal.  And enrolment at these centres is often  up  to

the  brim.  The scheme has worked to help upgrade the quality

and accessibility of PSE, especially to lower income families

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also asked whether this grant has been given to

PSE  centres across all wards, and not just PAP wards.  As  I

said,  the only organisation which met the criteria to  apply

for  this grant and willing to come forward has been the PCF.

But I must also inform him that not all PCF centres are using

this  grant.   There  are some which have  not  utilised  the

grant,  as  I  think they are providing a different  kind  of

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether there are guidelines to admit students

based on political affiliation.  I have already informed  him

that this is not in the guidelines at all.  No distinction is

made  between children who have or who do not have  political

affiliations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I read the Hansard and

understand  that  Mr Chiam complained in the  past  that  PCF

officials  had  indeed  asked whether  or  not  students  who

requested for admission belonged to any political party.   Is

this correct?  What is the Senior Minster of State's view  on

this?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, maybe Mr Low would like to ask Mr

Chiam to repeat his question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have told the House that one of my

grassroots helper's  child was not allowed to study  for  the

second  year  in  the Potong Pasir Kindergarten.   After  the

first  year, he was not allowed to study there in the  second

year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2505</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, may I inform Mr Chiam that this is

actually not under the purview of MOE.  PCF is an independent

charitable organisation.  But as far as I remember,  I  think

there was a time when a PCF kindergarten had to close because

of  its own reasons.  Therefore, that child was informed that

he  could  not  carry  on, because the centre  would  not  be

opened.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, one of the kindergartens in

<div align="center"><b>AGRI-FOOD AND VETERINARY AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>3.44 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government intends to restructure the Primary

Production  Department (PPD) into a statutory  board,  called

the  Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), on  1st  April

2000.   The proposed Agri-food and Veterinary Authority  Bill

2000  is  to  provide  the  legislative  framework  for   the

formation of the new statutory board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now explain the rationale for the new

statutory  board.  The PPD was formed in 1959 to develop  and

regulate   the   local   farming   industry.    Through   its

agricultural development and health programmes,  PPD  ensured

that   local  farms  produced  safe  and  quality  food   for

consumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gradual shrinking of the agricultural sector

over   the   years,  PPD's  role  and  focus  also   shifted.

Currently, PPD ensures the safety of primary food

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2509</b></font><br><br>



imports,   which  include  meat,  fish,  eggs,   fruits   and

vegetables.  It also prevents and controls animal, bird, fish

and  plant  diseases,  promotes animal welfare,  as  well  as

develops  the agricultural industry and facilitates trade  in

agriculture produce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in October last year, in my Addendum to the

President's  Address,  I informed this  House  that  we  will

diversify  our sources for the supply of safe foods  to  meet

the  needs  of our growing population.  We will also  upgrade

our  food  inspection and surveillance systems and laboratory

services to further improve on food safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, local farm production supplies only 1.5% of the

poultry,  10%  of the fish, 30% of the eggs  and  6%  of  the

vegetables  consumed in Singapore.  The bulk of  our  primary

food  requirements comes from overseas sources.   This  heavy

dependence  on  primary  food  imports  has  made   Singapore

vulnerable  to  disruptions in primary food supplies  due  to

unforeseen  circumstances  at  the  sources  of  supply.   We

therefore need to continually identify new sources of  supply

so that we can maximise food security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our heavy reliance on food imports also makes us

vulnerable  to  outbreaks  of  food-poisoning  and   zoonotic

diseases,   in   other  words,  where  animal  diseases   are

transmitted  to  humans.  In recent years,  there  have  been

disease outbreaks, such as the Mad Cow Disease, Avian Flu and

the  Nipah virus. It is vital for us to maintain a high level

of integrity in our food safety system to detect, prevent and

control emerging diseases and food hazards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is now timely to restructure PPD into a

statutory board. The board will have a mandate to ensure  the

safety  of  Singapore's primary food needs. It will  also  be

responsible  for animal and plant health, animal welfare  and

the   agricultural  industry,  all  of  which  are   integral

components of a food safety system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a statutory board, AVA can leverage on its expertise

in agriculture and veterinary science to offer consultancy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2510</b></font><br><br>



services  to the food and agriculture industries in Singapore

and  the region. This may enable more overseas farms to  meet

our  food safety requirements and enable them to export their

food  to Singapore. AVA can also provide consultancy services

to  assist  our  local farmers to set up farms,  as  well  as

facilitate the setting up of overseas food producing projects

for supply to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA finally can look into making Singapore an

agricultural hub and distribution centre in the region.  This

will  increase the trading of agricultural and food  products

through  Singapore,  and enable us to  have  access  to  more

varieties of food.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA will plug into the relevant international networks

to  monitor  closely  the  global spread  and  incidences  of

potentially  dangerous diseases. It will also maintain  world

class diagnostic and testing laboratories. Resources are  now

being put in place. Two new laboratories are being set up and

these  will  be  ready  by 2002. They will  have  the  latest

equipment  and instrumentation for the detection  of  disease

agents  and  harmful food contaminants as well as genetically

modified foods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the main features

of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill gives the short title and

interpretation  of  the  Bill.  Part  II  provides  for   the

establishment,   incorporation  and   constitution   of   the

Authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III spells out the functions and powers of the

Authority.   These are essentially the same as those  already

vested  in  PPD,  either  administratively,  or  through  the

various  existing Acts administered by PPD. It will  also  be

able to form companies, joint ventures or partnerships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts IV and V of the Bill relate to staff and financial

matters.  In  particular, clause 16  includes  provisions  to

protect  the Authority from liability in respect of  products

or  processes which have been deemed to have conformed to the

Authority's requirements. This is required

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2511</b></font><br><br>



as  the  AVA  will be involved in formulating  standards  and

issuing  certificates, brands or other marks related  to  the

agri-food and veterinary sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI comprises the transitional provisions relating

to  the  transfer of property, assets and liabilities of  the

PPD to the AVA.  Under clause 31, all persons employed by PPD

shall  be  transferred  to AVA. The terms  will  be  no  less

favourable  than  those enjoyed by the  officers  immediately

prior  to  their transfer. The pension rights  of  Government

employees  would  also be preserved under clause  32  of  the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII of the Bill covers the miscellaneous provisions

such  as  the  Authority's symbol, powers of enforcement  and

power  to  make regulations under the Bill. These  provisions

will help the Authority to carry out its functions. This Part

also includes the list of consequential amendments to be made

to  other legislation which are currently administered by the

PPD  and  to  any other legislation referring to PPD  or  the

Director of Primary Production.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that we are now facing

new  challenges  in ensuring the safety of our  primary  food

needs and in dealing with threats from emerging diseases  and

harmful food contaminants.  The restructuring of PPD into AVA

will  allow  us  to have a statutory board  to  work  towards

managing these challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I support

the  Agri-food and Veterinary Authority Bill which  basically

establishes  a  statutory  board  for  the  current   Primary

Production  Department.  As we all know,  a  statutory  board

gives  greater  autonomy  to  the  Authority,  both  in   the

employment  and  deployment of staff and  greater  speed  and

effectiveness  in  carrying out its  functions.   Even  as  a

department today of the MND, it is already doing a good  job,

as can be seen in the way it has dealt with several

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2512</b></font><br><br>



crises  recently,  for example, in the Mad Cow  Disease,  the

chicken flu and the pig diseases of Malaysia.  If anything, I

think  the PPD has always been very fast and too conservative

in  the way they have dealt with food crisis.   In this case,

I am not complaining and I think we should continue to remain

conservative whether the PPD remains a Government  department

or  statutory board.  The PPD has always been seen more as  a

regulator  than  as a promoter of domestic  food  production.

Given  our limited land resources, it is understandable  that

most  of our food products would be imported.  However,  with

new  technology, new food production may take up a  lot  less

space  or  land.  With the PPD becoming a statutory board,  I

would like to urge the new Authority to be more proactive and

take  more initiatives to make Singapore more self-sufficient

in our food supplies, in addition to its role as a regulator.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a few specifics of the Bill.

In  clause 31 regarding the transfer of employees, it  states

here  that "all persons employed immediately before that  day

.  shall  be  transferred to the service of the Authority  on

terms   no  less  favourable  than  those  enjoyed  by   them

immediately prior to their transfer."  The Bill does not seem

to  address  any  of  its  structuring,  rationalisation  and

possible redundancies that may occur in the process.  I would

like   to  ask  the  Minister  whether  there  will  be  such

redundancies and, if so, how will these be addressed  by  the

Authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 regarding powers of enforcement states that

any  person  found guilty of an offence shall  be  liable  on

conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment

for  a term not exceeding six months or to both.  My question

to  the  Minister  is: have these powers of enforcement  been

increased  as a result of the establishment of the  Authority

or have they remained the same?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 46 there is a reference made to the Director

of  Primary Production Department and it says that it  should

be  read  as  Director-General of  Agri-food  and  Veterinary

Services.  Actually, I am a bit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2513</b></font><br><br>



confused  whether  this  job is the same  job  as  the  Chief

Executive  of  the  Authority or will  this  be  a  different

person.   I am not very clear about this. This is not  stated

very clearly in the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Primary

Production  Department  (PPD)  will  be  converted   into   a

statutory board on 1st April 2000.  The main concern  of  the

affected officers is the terms of transfer of employment.  As

many  as  333 non-pensionable officers crossing over  to  the

statutory  board  will lose their option to convert  back  to

pension  upon  retirement under section 6(d) of the  Pensions

Act.   They  are  mainly worried about their post  retirement

medical benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, the Amalgamated Union of Public

Employees (AUPE) had several discussions with officials  from

the Ministry of National Development and PPD over the details

of the conversion exercise and hoped to resolve this issue of

perceived inequity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6(d) of the Pensions Act allows any non-pensionable officer in service before 7th December 1984 to

return  his  excess CPF contributions at  the  point  of  his

retirement from the civil service and claim pension  benefits

from   the  Government.   However,  in  December  1984,   the

Government acted to contain its liabilities by restricting it

to  serving officers only.  Thus, officers affected  in  this

exercise  have no choice but to cross over and, in so  doing,

lose  the option.  The option has become more attractive with

the rising medical costs.  Pensionable officers crossing over

to  a statutory board get to retain their pension benefits in

full.  This is the perceived inequity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad that the new statutory board intends to make

it  attractive to the employees concerned to join the  board.

We welcome PPD's initiative to offer an attractive package to

solve this problem for those who convert.  I understand  that

this  offer  is now pending approval from PSD or MOF,  and  I

urge the two departments to be supportive as it will be a win-win   solution  for  all.   With  this  offer,  the  affected

employees can decide what they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2514</b></font><br><br>



want  to  do  with  the money.  One way is for  them  to  buy

medical insurance to cover for their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Government is likely to conduct more such

conversion exercises in future, each conversion exercise will

affect  an increasing number of older workers who,  in  turn,

would  feel  a greater need for medical benefits.   And  each

time   a   conversion   exercise  takes  place,   unhappiness

associated  with  the loss of option would arise.   This  has

been  so  for the exercises involving TAS, NParks,  Singapore

Power, SBA and LTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gesture on the part of the PPD to offer an

attractive package is appreciated.  It can serve  as  a  good

reference  for  future conversion exercises.  It  also  shows

that  the  Ministry concerned needs to be careful  to  ensure

equitable treatment between different groups covered  by  the

same  exercise.   In  this case, it is a  comparison  between

pensionable and non-pensionable officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the profile of our workforce is changing, aging, in

particular,  will  increase the desire for  medical  benefits

over time.  Hence, rules that impinge on such privileges will

increasingly become a cause for anxiety among the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Public Service Department

to  be more pragmatic and creative in interpreting rules  and

regulations   with  its  sophisticated  software,   expensive

hardware  and the much needed "heartware" under the Singapore

21  vision.  Policies and rules cannot always be mechanically

applied, following precedent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to

support  the Bill.  In doing so, I acknowledge the importance

of the work performed by the PPD in its past incarnation, and

look  forward  to this new statutory body.   The  supply  and

safety  of  food in Singapore is, of course, very  important.

If Singaporeans enjoy their food, as we all know they do, the

fact  that  they  can  enjoy with  safety  and  health  is  a

testimony  to  the  PPD's hard work.   This  is  particularly

because of the surrounding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2515</b></font><br><br>



circumstances.  When we take food from other places,  whether

it  is the Nipah virus or whether it is the Mad Cow diseases,

there  are  increasing  strains  on  the  global  system   of

supplying safe and healthy food.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new agency, therefore, is very welcomed in being

able to be more autonomous and, hopefully, more efficient and

effective in its functions.  However, when I look through the

functions  in  clause 11 and the powers of the  Authority  in

clause  12  of the Bill, my first thought is that  we  should

take  this  occasion to make this new agency no longer  under

the  MND  but,  with  due respect, under his  colleague,  the

Minister  for the Environment.  Because when I look  at  this

Bill,  I  understand  that the powers of  the  Agri-food  and

Veterinary  Authority  will  increasingly   be  about  public

health  and safety.  This ties in very much with the Ministry

of  the  Environment's  own  concern  of  hawkers  and  other

suppliers  of food to the consumer.  The present  arrangement

of  having  it under MND has been, according to my  research,

more   a  historical accident of where the Ministers were  in

the former Cabinet than a matter of administrative logic.   I

think  that  the  public health expertise and  focus  of  the

Ministry  of  the  Environment will actually  make  a  better

context for this new entity.  I also believe the Ministry  of

the Environment will be better plugged into the international

community   and  steps  in  the  direction  of  international

standards of environment and health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my next point. And this is that the

international  community is moving quite rapidly  in  certain

areas.   One of them is the question of genetically  modified

organisms  (GMOs)  or  GM foods.  This has  been  brought  up

several times in the debate in the Committee of Supply, and I

would  not  actually repeat the arguments  already  made.   A

number  of  PAP  Backbenchers have called for  labelling.   I

think  the  Government's response can be summed up as  being,

"we  should  not panic the public and we will however  follow

international  standards."   And  I  applaud  this  approach.

Certainly, Singapore, as a country that does not produce

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2516</b></font><br><br>



our  own  food,  should not create a stampede mentality  that

suspects that perhaps everything is tainted.  That is not our

intention.   And certainly, it is good to reassure  ourselves

that  we will follow, as we have before, the highest possible

international standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is uncertainty at present, and therefore there is

no  need to actually move.  And there is also the possibility

of protectionism.  Countries that develop GMOs, like the USA,

have  tended to be quite reluctant to see labelling or  other

measures.   Countries  that do not produce  these  GMOs  take

reverse  position.   The  dispute  between  the  US  and  the

European Union over the Bee-hormone case is typical of  this;

that   your  science  follows  your  political  and  economic

interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I think Singapore must note that there are

emerging  international standards that we  can  follow.   The

Biosafety  Protocol of the Convention of Biological Diversity

has  been  passed in Cartagena after various  discussions  in

Montreal  and  elsewhere.  And this sets up an  international

framework with very important principles for us.  One of  the

principles  was of advance informed agreement.   That  is  to

say, not that you ban the import but simply that you are told

what  it  is that you may be importing.  The second principle

is  something called the precautionary principle.  I  do  not

want to go into all the details of this concept after so many

days  of  debate in this House, but basically this  puts  the

onus  on safety.  It asks us to act prudently rather than  to

wait  for the last bit of scientific evidence to be in place.

This is important because, as I have said, it would be in the

interest  of  certain  countries to  pooh-pooh  questions  of

safety  and security.  It is a bit like, again, the  mad  cow

disease.  In that case, the British scientists were the  last

to  see  any  problem.  Similarly, in the  Nipah  virus,  the

problem was probably detected for some time or observable for

some time before authorities in that country finally acted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is important to note that international standards

are  coming  to  place  which  suggest  a  certain  level  of

prudence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2517</b></font><br><br>



This,  I  should  tell the Minister, is  congruent  with  our

existing trade rules.  We want to observe international trade

regime.   It  is  therefore important to note  that  the  WTO

agreement on sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards does allow

a  country  to  take   provisional  measures,  if  there  are

possible  dangers  to  public  health.   So  I  respect   the

Government's  position that we should wait for scientists  to

set  heart on this point, but I would urge prudence,  as  has

befitted  the PPD's past, and I hope the AVA's  future.   Due

precaution  and prudence in importing and exporting  food  is

really  primary to Singapore's health and safety record,  and

the  fact  that other parts of our industries are  developing

life  sciences  should  not obscure this  first  and  primary

concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make is that I have noticed

in the press and from the statement of Mr Lew Syn Pau, Member

of  Parliament for Tanglin-Kreta Ayer, before this, that  PPD

might  be  taking  initiatives to  increase  agro-technology.

This  is  with  the  aim of intensifying farming.   This  may

possibly involve the high level use of chemicals.  The aim is

to  supply  them  to our own local market.   If  we  want  to

compete in this local market, I would imagine that this would

be  at fairly low prices, that is, Singapore would try to use

technology rather than land space, but to enable it  to  sell

fairly low price goods that would compete with others in  the

region.  So we can  produce some of its own products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is right to secure our food sources. But I

am  not  sure  it  is  right to take this  approach  of  high

technology and, possibly, high chemicals.  After all, we  are

a  very  small  and  densely populated  country.   Our  water

sources  are  very  important.  For this  reason,  we  should

always  be  very  careful in protecting our environment.   We

should  also try, on the other hand, to produce higher value-added goods, rather than to try and match Indonesia, Malaysia

or Thailand for low price market value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, my suggestion is that the AVA should

consider  encouraging and promoting organic  food  production

rather

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2518</b></font><br><br>



than  agro-technology.  Organic food production  involves  no

chemicals and therefore no danger to the environment.  It  is

also,  by  and large, higher value-added.  Organic vegetables

fetch  relatively high prices.  I think, in  this  sense,  it

fits  more  into  our strategy of protecting the  environment

while seeking economic gain.  Reliable certification is  also

very hard to ensure, and here Singapore's reputation of being

a hard-task master of certificates you can rely on, will come

into play.  This would allow a balance against this promotion

of  GM  foods.  When there is uncertainty, as it is now,  the

urge should be to diversify our approaches.  It is observable

that  America  while  it  is,  on  the  one  hand,  promoting

genetically  modified food, it is also setting standards  for

organic food certification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion I have to make is that in deciding

what to do with some agricultural land, we should revisit the

idea  of  encouraging some level of citizen farming.  Systems

of  allotment in other cities and countries are quite common.

And  I  think it may be important to help city dwellers relax

and connect to the land, and this has a value, in addition to

dollars for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, is on animal control and welfare,

which is part of the PPD's mission.  It is often said that  a

mark  of a civilised life is not only how we treat our fellow

citizens  but how we treat our pets.  There have been  recent

reports  of animal abandonment and abuse in Singapore.   This

has been brought to court and cases have led to a very strong

signal that animal abuse in Singapore would not be tolerated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control of stray population of animals is, of course, an

important  goal  that  PPD has been pursuing.   However,  the

question  is  how  we try to achieve that  goal  and  how  we

balance this with allowing ownership and responsibility.   In

this  regard,  I understand that the PPD's existing  policies

are  quite  unfavourable  to household  cats.   For  example,

compared  to dogs, cats cannot be licensed.  And if cats  are

tagged with proper information about who they belong to,  who

to contact,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2519</b></font><br><br>



they  can  still  be rounded up and taken off and  eventually

gassed, without reference back to the owner who is the person

identified on the tag.  I think that this might show a little

too  much  efficiency in trying to keep the streets  free  of

stray  animals.   While I agree with the  goal,  our  efforts

should   be  conducted  quite  humanely.   There  should   be

reference  back  to the owners when cats are  taken  off  the

street.   After all, while animals and pets may seem a  small

thing  to  us,  for  many people they are a  source  of  very

domestic   pleasure  of  having  these   animals   in   their

households.   This particularly, Sir, is when the  cats  have

been  sterilised and tagged and I think they pose very little

risk   of   creating  a  large  and  disproportionate   stray

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we make a Government department to a statutory

body, we often wish to give it more greater flexibility.   In

many   cases,  profit  making  or  cost  recovery   is   also

emphasised, with the promotion of commercial aspects.   There

is nothing wrong with this.  But in the case of the AVA, they

will have to deal with safety and public health, what we eat,

how  we connect to the land, and how we relate to animals and

pets.   These  are aspects of humanity that I hope  would  be

observed and strengthened in the new entity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to, first

of all, thank all the Members who have spoken.  They have all

supported  the Bill.  They have also raised several questions

which I would like to take this opportunity to answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Lew asked about the transferred

employees,  whether  there  will  be  any  restructuring   or

redundancies.   The  idea  is for  us  to  transfer  all  the

employees  to  the  new statutory board because  all  of  the

officers involved are needed to allow the new statutory board

to  exercise its functions and responsibilities.  So there is

no  plan to do any restructuring or have any redundancies  at

this point in time, because, as I said, all the officers  are

needed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2520</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think it is correct for me to say that as the

statutory  board evolves, looks at its various functions  and

responsibilities, vis-a-vis other Government  departments,  I

think  there will be opportunities for the various Government

departments to come together and to see how they can actually

improve  their coordination and their workflow.  So  if  that

opportunity does arise in the future, the new statutory board

should take advantage of  that and improve its organisational

structure  in order to provide a better level of  service  to

the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in time, I would also like to address Mr

Simon  Tay's point about where the new statutory board should

reside,  whether  it  should be in the  National  Development

Ministry  or  whether  it  should be  under  the  Environment

Ministry.   I  think my colleague here has just  given  me  a

signal  that he does not think that it is a good  idea.   The

fact of the matter really is that food safety and control  of

public  safety are inter-related issues.  I do not think  any

one  agency can do justice to the very broad range of  issues

that  need  to  be looked at and resolved.  So, for  example,

when you are talking about food safety, we have the PPD which

is  involved in the control of safety of foods and  assurance

of  safety  of  primary foods.  We have the Ministry  of  the

Environment which looks at the safety of food at  the  retail

end.  We also have Ministry of Health which also looks at the

food safety and communicable diseases and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these agencies have their own areas of expertise and

responsibility  and together, whenever there is  any  danger,

whenever  there is any sign that we are going to be  affected

by some major outbreak of disease, as what happened last year

when  the  Nipah  virus outbreak took place, then  all  these

agencies come together.  We form an Inter-Ministry Task Force

and  we  fight the problem together.  I think this has worked

well in the past.  I do not see why it would not work in  the

future  with the AVA.  And I would suggest that  we  look  at

this  particular modus operandi and improve upon  it,  rather

than to try and establish a neat solution

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2521</b></font><br><br>



whereby everything comes together under one agency, and  then

we try and decide where to put that agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this particular point in time, we would not make any

changes  to  the  different responsibilities of  the  various

agencies  involved.  But down the road, I think it is  proper

for  us,  as  we work together, to decide how we  can  either

apportion  or  re-apportion responsibilities or  indeed  even

amalgamate some of them.  But I do not see the time where all

these  particular responsibilities will come  under  one.   I

think the range of expertise required is simply too great.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew also asked whether the powers of enforcement have

been increased or remained the same.  Yes, the answer is that

they  have remained the same.  He asked whether the  Director

of  Primary Production Department is the same person  as  the

Director-General of Agri-food and Veterinary Authority.   The

answer is yes, he is the same person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong asked about the transfer of officers

to  the  new  statutory  board.  As I  have  said,  the  Bill

provides  for  the  transfer  of  these  officers  from   the

department, a Government department, to a statutory board  on

terms no less favourable than what they are getting today.  I

realise  that  some  of  the  officers  today  who  are  non-pensionable will lose the option to convert if they  were  to

transfer over to the AVA.  My officers have been looking into

how  we  can provide a package which would allow the transfer

to  take  place  without  adversely  affecting  the  officers

concerned.   I  understand the concerns of the  officers.   I

understand the concerns of the union who represents them,  as

articulated by the Member just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say that at this point in time, we are

actively  exploring various options to try and tide over  the

officers  when  they  transfer  from  the  Department  to   a

statutory board.  Of course, we will certainly look into  his

suggestion of ex-gratia payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to Mr Simon Tay's point about GMO and the

biodiversity protocol.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2522</b></font><br><br>



As  far  as GMOs are concerned, I think he is right in saying

that  we should not panic the public.  The media has given  a

lot  of  attention  to GMOs in recent months.   Some  of  the

reporting  has been quite sensational; some of the headlines,

for example, Frankenstein food, and so on, and given rise  to

a  lot  of anxiety.  But the fact of the matter is that there

are  genetically modified foods currently on our  shelves  in

the  supermarkets. But these have been determined to be  safe

for  us  to eat. There is no reason for us to suddenly confer

upon  such foods monster status.  We have been eating it  all

this  time. PPD monitors the food very closely, in line  with

the  trends  in the world. We take the necessary precautions.

Food,  which is not approved in other countries, will not  be

allowed  into Singapore. Foods which have been identified  as

not  safe, we will take immediate action to remove them  from

the shelves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very new field. There is a lot of discussion

going  on now. What we have done in Singapore is to  try  and

follow the discussions that are going on in the international

arena.  We  have  formed in Singapore what is  known  as  the

Genetic   Modification   Advisory  Committee   (GMAC)   which

includes,  PPD,  ENV, National Science and Technology  Board,

universities  and  so  on.   We are  trying  to  establish  a

procedure  and  a protocol whereby we can also  label  foods,

track them, monitor them and assess whether they are safe  or

not,  etc.  This is an on-going process. We will continue  to

monitor  how other countries tackle the issue. We will  abide

by what is international practice in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the biosafety protocol, the Cartegena Protocol

that  the Member mentioned just now, I should inform him that

the lead agency for the bio-diversity protocol is NParks, not

PPD, because it goes beyond GMOs. It also talks about the bio-diversity in various countries. Having said that, we are also

following  the  discussions  in the  Cartegena  process  very

closely.  He  is correct in saying that there  is  a  lot  of

politics  involved  in the discussions. Countries  which  are

producers  of  one particular type of food obviously  have  a

certain point of view. Countries which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2523</b></font><br><br>



are   net   consumers  have  a  different  point   of   view.

Ultimately,   at   the  end  of  the  day,  invariably,   the

discussions go beyond just the science of it but go into  the

political  arena.  We  are  not producers  of  the  food  but

consumers,  and we will have to take an appropriate  position

commensurate with our own interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as agri-technology is concerned, the point that

Mr  Simon  Tay  made  that we should try  and  restrict  high

technology  farming because it may involve the  use  of  high

chemicals,  let  me  assure him that high technology  farming

does  not necessarily equal high chemical farming.  In  fact,

the  PPD  is extremely strict about the level of contaminants

and the use of pesticides in our food. First of all, we do  a

very  stringent test on all the primary foods like vegetables

and  so  on  that  are  prone  to high  pesticides  and  high

contaminants  and having tested them, we are  not  averse  to

destroying those which contain a very level of pesticides. We

go  in  further to the extent of banning imports  from  those

particular farms. All those actions demonstrate that we  take

the  issue  of pesticides and contaminants in our  food  very

seriously.   It would be ironic for us to do  so  and  be  so

specific  and so tough on food being imported, and yet  allow

high-tech farming in Singapore which makes use of these  high

pesticides.  It does not make sense and we certainly  do  not

intend  to  take such an approach.  I would like to  reassure

him  on  that.   The  fact  is yes, where  we  can,  we  will

encourage organic farming and some farms are already pursuing

this option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on citizen farming. I am not sure

exactly what he means by citizen farming. If he means that we

set  aside plots of land for people to go and farm, that  is,

hobby farm, there are farms in Singapore located in the agri-technology parks which allow the city dwellers to go there to

see  what  a vegetable looks like when it is growing  in  the

ground and not in the supermarket.  There are also farms that

allow  children to visit them, to look at the animals and  so

on.  If that is what he means, then that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2524</b></font><br><br>



has  been  provided for.  But if he is talking about  setting

aside  land  around HDB estates for people to  go  there  and

farm,  that  is  pretty  difficult  for  us  in  land  scarce

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is about cats and dogs. I must confess

that  I  am not familiar with the issue of whether  we  treat

cats  more favourably than dogs.  If he would like to file  a

question, I can give him a more intelligent answer.  At  this

stage,  I must confess I do not know about that.  I  think  I

have answered all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, on the question regarding the

Director of Primary Production, I think I should make  myself

a  bit  clearer because under clause 46 of the Bill, it  says

that  any  reference  made  to  this  person  is  actually  a

reference  to the Director-General, Agri-food and  Veterinary

Services.  Under the new statutory board, there  is  actually

the  position  of  the Chief Executive.  But  today,  if  the

Director  of Primary Production is the Chief Executive  of  a

department,  my  question is:  is he, under this  new  title,

also the Chief Executive of the new statutory board?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I may not have made myself clear. The

Director-General, Agri-food and Veterinary Services, who  has

been appointed under the Animals and Birds Act, is the person

who  exercises the responsibilities of the previous Director-General of the Primary Production Department.  Yes, he is the

same  person.  But  we  have provided for  a  post  of  Chief

Executive Officer. So the Chief Executive Officer may be  the

same  person  as  the Director-General of the  Agri-food  and

Veterinary Services as stated in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.  -  [Mr Mah Bow Tan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE CHAIR</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I am

sure  all  of us have been waiting for this moment.  After  a

long  10 days of exhaustive debate, we have all heard enough.

It  now just leaves me to thank you, Mr Speaker, on behalf of

all  Members, for your patience and thank them also for their

contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before we do that, maybe I could just say a

few words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>, we have come to the end of a long sitting.

If  we  were  to take into account the sitting days  of  late

February, we would have, in the past month, actually  sat  in

this  Chamber for half that time. During this time, my Deputy

and  I have heard something like 630 speeches. I made a quick

count  a  while  ago,  and that did not include  the  answers

during Question time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the extended sitting hours, Members know too

well  that  we just do not have enough time to make  all  the

points  that  we  want  to  make, but  there  will  be  other

occasions.   Of course, for some Members, there  will  simply

never be enough time.  Be that as it may, we have to move on.

So  for  those of you who have had the "guillotine" inflicted

upon  you unceremoniously, may I just remind you, as  I  have

said so in the past, that your suffering was actually for the

good of all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I thank you for the cooperation that you

have extended to me and to my Deputy.
