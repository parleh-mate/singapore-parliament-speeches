<div align="center"><b>RESTRICTED PASSPORTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Discontinuation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what  is  the reason for discontinuing  the  use  of

restricted passports for travel to Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the

reasons  for  phasing  out the Singapore Restricted  Passport

have  been  widely  reported  in  the  local  newspapers  and

broadcast  media.   In brief, the Restricted  Passports  have

been phased out due to falling demand, and because it is  not

cost-effective to continue issuing them.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Did I

hear  the Minister say that it is not cost-effective  because

there  was  a  falling demand?  I thought that a  great  many

Singaporeans  were crossing the Causeway.  That  is  what  we

hear  every  day. Is the Minister saying that the number  has

dropped to an extent that it is no longer productive for  the

Ministry to produce the Restricted Passport?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I gave two reasons.

First,  it  was the falling demand.  Second, it is not  cost-effective to continue issuing them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister keeps repeating his answer.

May  we  have an answer to my question?  Is there a  drop  in

Singaporeans  crossing into Johore every  day  or  weekly  to

justify  discontinuance of the Restricted Passport?   May  we

have an answer to that question?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, there has been a falling

demand  because, based on the 10-year period,  from  1988  to

1998, the number of SRPs issued annually has dropped by  56%.

So,  it is a very clear indication, and not by the number  of

Singaporeans crossing the Causeway, because you can cross the

Causeway by using also the SIP.  But by the actual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



number of passports that have been issued over time, there is

clearly a falling demand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether money was

an important factor? The Singapore International Passport,  I

am  told, costs $70, whereas the Restricted Passport used  to

be  only $30.  Was that a factor -  that the Government could

get more revenue?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam knows that

the  Government does not operate this way. We  do  not  raise

fees  just  to get more revenue. The cost-effectiveness  part

comes in due to the new security features which have made our

passport  so much more secure.  If we had continued producing

the   Singapore  Restricted  Passport,  then  the   cost   of

production for both the Singapore Restricted Passport and the

Singapore  International Passport would have been  equalised.

In   other  words,  we  would  have  to  charge  Singaporeans

something  similar, whether we issue them a SRP or  SIP,  and

that  does  not  make  sense  because  now,  for  $60,  if  a

Singaporean  applies by post, he gets a passport  (96  pages)

that would enable him to travel to more than just one country

and with added security features at a one-time cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> For those

regulars  travelling  between both  sides  of  the  Causeway,

either  for  work or business, is the Government  considering

issuing a Smartcard to facilitate travelling?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> This is already being done.

A  pilot  has  been  done  to issue  those  who  are  regular

travellers with a Smartcard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Can the Minister tell

us whether the use of the Restricted Passport is a unilateral

initiative  on  the  part  of Singapore  or  do  we  need  an

agreement with Malaysia to use our Restricted Passport?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the issuance of a

passport is a sovereign act,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



so  we  need  not,  for example, get the  permission  of  the

Malaysians for us to take this move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> The Smartcard is being used in the

airport, but is it also being used at the Causeway?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> A pilot has been done for

frequent  travellers, for example, for those  Malaysians  who

work in our factories who come across regularly.  In fact, it

is   an   advanced  technology  where  you  just   use   your

fingerprint.   So  over  time, travel between  Singapore  and

Malaysia would definitely be facilitated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister of State tell us how

much  it  cost the Government to produce a single  Restricted

Passport? What was the cost per passport?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I do not have the figure

here.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>SALE OF HELLO KITTY DOLLS IN FAST FOOD OUTLETS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment whether fast food outlets like McDonald's will be

allowed to continue to sell toys like Hello Kitty dolls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry does not regulate  what  can  or

cannot  be  sold by McDonald's, or any other  shop  for  that

matter.    We are only concerned with the hygiene and  safety

of food sold at food retail outlets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the large gathering at McDonald's, we stepped in

to deal with the littering problem that occurred.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I am surprised

to hear from the Minister that his Ministry does not regulate

this  matter but I read in the newspapers that the Ministry's

spokesman  was  quoted as saying that it was  all  right  for

McDonald's to sell dolls at the same time. Can I take  it  to

mean that other shops, for example, a shop selling dolls  can

also at the same time sell McDonald's food?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> My point is that we are basically

concerned only with the hygiene and littering.  In fact, when

the  question  was  directed to me,  I  was  wondering  which

Ministry really decides what to be sold and where.  If it  is

in  HDB  shops,  I suppose HDB will have a say  and  Building

Control Division will say where you can have retail sale  and

so forth.  But really it is not under my purview.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>SALE OF HELLO KITTY DOLLS IN FAST FOOD OUTLETS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what  steps  the Police will take  to  prevent  ugly

scenes from happening again in respect of people queueing for

Hello Kitty dolls.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, after huge crowds and long queues formed on

the first 2 launches on 1st and 6th January 2000, McDonald's,

on  Police advice, employed CISCO and private security guards

to  regulate  queues for subsequent launches. However,  these

proved  to  be inadequate.  McDonald's was particularly  ill-prepared  for the large crowds which turned up overnight  for

the  27th  January 2000 launch. Some radio stations regularly

reported  the  size  of  the queues,  leading  to  even  more

Singaporeans rushing to join the queues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the 27th January 2000 launch, on Police

advice,  McDonald's came up with a system  that  extends  the

period  of sale, and which ensures that all demands  for  the

last  pair  of  Hello Kitty dolls would be  met.   The  final

launch on 3rd February 2000 under this new system took  place

without incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizers of promotional events that are likely to

attract  large  crowds should act responsibly by  putting  in

place  arrangements and procedures to ensure that their event

does not lead to law and order problems.  They should also be

adequately  prepared for the various contingencies  that  may

arise and be ready to handle them properly.  They should hire

security  guards  to  maintain public  order.   Police  would

consider charging the organizers for the cost of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



deployment  should the private event lead to severe  law  and

order  problems due to a lack of careful planning and despite

Police  advice that they should hire adequate security guards

for the event.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general public participating in such events also

have  an  important  role to play.  They should  queue  in  a

patient  and orderly manner, and not breach the  peace.   The

mass  media can also play their part by not creating a  sense

of panic among interested participants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police takes a serious view of any breaches

committed by individuals and will not hesitate to take action

to arrest and prosecute persons who by their behaviour incite

public disorder or break the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, did the Police

anticipate  that  law and order could be a problem  with  the

sale of Hello Kitty dolls at McDonald's?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I have said, the first two

launches were relatively incident-free.  The first launch had

one  incident  where  a doctor and three other  persons  were

involved  in  the  queue, but that was within  the  premises.

After  the two launches, Police, in fact, spoke to McDonald's

and  advised McDonald's to hire security guards at  the  five

drive-in  outlets.  But, of course, ultimately, on the  fifth

launch  on  27th January, nobody anticipated that the  crowds

would swell up to about 200,000.  But I think along the  way,

McDonald's, on the advice of Police, had taken precautions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I wonder why the Police failed to

anticipate  the  law  and  order  problem  created   by   the

McDonald's sale of Hello Kitty dolls.  But I understand  that

the  Police  could well anticipate that any  public  speeches

made  by  Opposition Party members may cause social  law  and

order  problem  and thereby it denies the issue  of  permits.

Would the Minister of State explain why the Police had failed

to  anticipate  in this case, but yet could  anticipate  what

will  happen  if an Opposition politician makes a  speech  in

public?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Does an Opposition party

member  who  makes a speech in public also sells Hello  Kitty

toys  that would arouse that passion?  I think the point here

is  that  the two events are quite different.  In  the  Hello

Kitty  sale,  it  was  a promotional event  and  queues  were

anticipated.   But in Singapore, we do have long  queues  and

other  events  where large crowds gather,  but  if  there  is

adequate  security,  there are no problems.   In  this  case,

McDonald's, in fact, employed about 150 security  guards  for

the  outlets  but  despite  that precaution,  problems  still

arose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, when there are big crowds of

course it is good publicity to a commercial firm but I  think

the  issue here is whether or not such an event would  breach

the  peace and cause disturbance and hurt to members  of  the

public.  The breach of peace in fact ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, can you ask your

supplementary question?  You are making a speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> All right. Did the Police advise

the  commercial firm causing these problems to  change  their

method  of  distribution of the Hello Kitty dolls to  prevent

breach of peace and injury to members of the public?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, in fact, this is what

exactly happened. It was because of Police's consultation and

advice that the final launch on the 3rd of February was  done

differently.  Otherwise, it would have been done the same way

and there would have been problems.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN MAIDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Provision of safety harness)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap</b> asked the Minister for Manpower, in

view  of the many fatal accidents happening to foreign maids,

whether  he will consider making it compulsory for  employers

to   provide  safety  harness,  similar  to  that   worn   by

construction workers, when the maids are asked to do cleaning

work in high-rise buildings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, my

Ministry  had studied various options to check the  spate  of

accidents  involving foreign domestic workers (FDWs)  falling

from high-rise windows.  While the use of safety harness  was

a  possibility, we concluded that it is not the best  way  to

resolve the problem of foreign domestic workers falling while

cleaning  windows  in high-rise buildings.  Safety  harnesses

are  used  when workers have no option but to work in  places

where  there are no secure foothold or handhold and the  risk

of  falling is high.  Foreign domestic workers should not  be

required to carry out any work under such risky conditions at

all.  If they are required to clean windows, they should  use

appropriate cleaning equipment with extended handles to reach

the difficult spots.  They do not have to stand on chairs  or

stools  or  climb out of the building to clean windows.   The

requirement  for the use of a safety harness is  also  not  a

fail-safe  measure as evidenced by the number of construction

workers  who suffered injuries or died from falls.  A  safety

harness  must  be worn and secured properly in  order  to  be

effective.    Employers   and   foreign   domestic   workers,

unfamiliar  with  the use of safety harnesses,  may  endanger

themselves.   In  fact, its use may create a false  sense  of

security  with  more employers asking their foreign  domestic

workers to do dangerous work leading to accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem is best addressed through proper public

education  and  raising awareness among employers  and  their

foreign domestic workers of the danger of cleaning windows in

high-rise buildings.  Most foreign domestic workers come from

rural areas and are thus not familiar with working and living

in  an urban environment.  Employers should ensure that their

foreign  domestic workers are properly oriented  and  trained

when  performing household duties.  Singaporeans  who  employ

foreign   domestic   workers   have   a   moral   and   legal

responsibility to ensure that their foreign domestic  workers

work   safely  and  securely  in  their  homes,   free   from

unnecessary risks, harassment or physical abuse.  Employers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



should  not  compromise on the safety and  welfare  of  their

foreign domestic workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help raise the awareness of our employers of the

likely  hazards of household work, my Ministry had in October

last  year,  sent  a  circular to all  employers  of  foreign

domestic workers to remind them to exercise greater care when

assigning household cleaning duties to their foreign domestic

workers.   Early last year, we had issued an information  kit

to   all   employers  of  foreign  domestic   workers.    The

information   kit   highlighted  the  employers'   role   and

responsibility   and  includes  a  training   checklist   for

employers  to  discuss  potential  safety  hazards  that  the

foreign  domestic  workers  may  encounter  while  performing

household chores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also produced an orientation video for

new  foreign  domestic workers coming to  Singapore  for  the

first  time.  Amongst other things, the video advises foreign

domestic  workers to lock the window grilles before  cleaning

high-rise  windows, and not to climb out  of  the  window  to

clean the windows or to retrieve objects that may have fallen

onto the window ledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to educate and raise the awareness of

employers  and  their  foreign domestic  workers.   The  Work

Permit  Department is currently working on a new  information

kit  that will be issued to foreign domestic workers in their

own  language.  The kit will also draw the attention  of  the

foreign  domestic workers to the precautionary measures  that

need  to  be taken when they perform various domestic chores.

We  believe that our effort will minimise risk and  accidents

involving foreign domestic workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, does the

Minister  really expect that just by educating the  employers

so  that  they could teach their maids how to clean high-rise

windows, it would be effective?  Secondly, the Minister  said

that  the  maid  is not supposed to do such a dangerous  job.

But I think we all know that we cannot prevent employers from

instructing  their  maids to do such a chore.   Thirdly,  the

safety harness is not really that difficult to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



use.   Apart from a safety harness, can the Minister  suggest

something concrete, apart from just advising the employers to

ask  their maids to be more careful?  Is there any other  way

that can ensure the safety of the maids?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the answer to the Member's first

supplementary  question  is  yes,  we  believe  that   public

education will be effective in minimising such accidents.  It

will  raise the awareness among employers that in fact  there

are  safer ways to clean windows, and there is really no need

for  them  to  ask  their  foreign domestic  workers  to  put

themselves in such a dangerous situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether foreign domestic workers are supposed to

clean  windows, I think cleaning windows is, of course,  part

of  domestic  chores.   But it is  the  way  they  clean  the

windows.   As  I  have  said in my answer  earlier  on,  most

windows  in  high-rise  buildings  and,  in  fact,   in   HDB

apartments  where most of our people live  in,  the  HDB  has

assured  us that the windows can be cleaned using  the  right

cleaning implements without having to climb out of the window

or  to  expose yourself to any danger of falling out  of  the

window.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that the safety harness is not difficult to use.

It  still requires a certain amount of training.  It requires

the  installation of the appropriate anchor points  for  such

safety  harnesses.  Safety harnesses have got to be inspected

regularly  to  ensure  that they are not  subject  to  damage

through wear and tear.  I am just quoting to the Member  what

we  have to do in the construction industry, and despite  the

elaborate  and  very massive efforts, we still  do  encounter

accidents  of  foreign  construction  workers  falling   from

heights.   In fact, it is probably one of the biggest  causes

of accidents in the construction sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us not assume that just by requiring the foreign

domestic  workers  to  use a safety harness,  we  would  have

eradicated the problem completely.  In fact, my fear,  shared

by  the  officers  in  the Ministry when we  considered  this

problem last year was that if you require



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



a  safety  harness, it would give people  a  false  sense  of

security.   They would just give the foreign domestic  worker

any old safety harness they come across, tie it to any anchor

point and say, "Now, you climb out of the window and do  this

dangerous work."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that cleaning a window from the outside of a

building  is  not  a domestic task.  It requires  specialised

window  cleaners  who  are trained  to  do  such  work.   Any

employer who does so and force the maid to climb out  of  the

building  to clean the windows is obviously out of his  mind.

Would  the employer himself or herself do such a thing?   And

if  you are not prepared to do it, why would you get somebody

else, who is totally untrained and unfit for this task, to do

so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job is to educate our people and say that you must

not  adopt  such  a  callous  attitude  towards  the  foreign

domestic   workers.   They  deserve  your   care   and   your

protection.  They have come from a far off country to work in

your home.  You should look after them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to point out that every case of a foreign

domestic  worker falling from a high-rise window and  getting

injured  or dying as a result will be thoroughly investigated

by  the police.  I just want to repeat that the police  will,

in  fact,  investigate thoroughly into the  cause  of  death,

including whether there was any criminal negligence involving

the  employer or any other person.  If there is evidence that

criminal  negligence  is  involved   -   I  understand   that

criminal negligence is an offence in the Penal Code  -   then

I  can  assure  Members  that the police  and  the  Attorney-General's Chambers will not hesitate to act according to  the

law.   So  it  is not as if we are totally powerless  against

unscrupulous   employers  who  deliberately,   wilfully   and

unfairly  force their foreign domestic workers  to  undertake

such  a dangerous and hazardous task.  There are already laws

which  cover such a situation.  If the investigation  reveals

such  evidence,  we  can already proceed under  the  existing

laws.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it is life that we are talking

about,  although they are foreign maids.  And I am  surprised

that  the  Ministry  of Manpower is not taking  any  concrete

steps, as Mr Kenneth Chen has said.  I disagree that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can I ask you to ask your

supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, could the Minister ask his

Ministry  to  think over and implement the use  of  a  safety

harness  for foreign maids when they clean windows?   Instead

of  giving them a false security, in fact, it will make  both

the employers and the maids aware that it is a dangerous task

and  to take precautions.  The fact that a safety harness  is

to be used, they will probably be aware of the danger at that

point of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards criminal law, as far as I know, no employer

has  been  prosecuted for criminal negligence for asking  the

maid  to clean windows.  I am not aware of any case where  an

employer  had  asked his maid to climb out  of  the  windows.

Normally,  they  clean  the windows at  the  edge.   Do  they

require the maids to climb out of the window?  If an employer

requires  his maid to climb out of the window, then there  is

probably a case of criminal negligence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to

belabour  the  point  about  the  use  or  misuse  of  safety

harnesses.   We  have  been through that  already.   We  have

examined this proposition.  We have concluded that it is  not

the  best  way to deal with the problem.  We will proceed  on

the  basis  that  continuing education of  the  employers  of

foreign  domestic  workers is the best way of  tackling  this

problem  at  source.   If  we  require  the  use  of   safety

harnesses, then we are telling the employers that,  in  fact,

please  go  ahead  and  put their maids  into  all  kinds  of

dangerous  situations.  Just have them use a  safety  harness

and  they will be fully protected.  It will be all right  for

them  to do so.  I think it is totally unjustified for us  to

expect these women coming from a village in Indonesia or  the

Philippines to suddenly climb out of a window or to stand  on

the window ledge on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



25th  floor of a building to clean the window.  It is out  of

this  world.  How can we imagine that they should be  put  in

such  a  position just because we have given  them  a  safety

harness?  I think it is wrong to take such a position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should take the position that no employer on his own

would  want  to  ask the maid to do such a task.   There  are

already   existing  equipment.   One  can   walk   into   any

supermarket  or department store and maybe for  $10  or  even

less, he could buy himself a cleaning device that allows  him

to  reach every part of the window.  Then why are we  talking

about having to have safety harnesses and so on and so forth?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his other point, I thank the Member for his

contribution   that   if  there  is  evidence   of   criminal

negligence, then a prosecution can be sustained.  Even though

no employer had been prosecuted in the past, it does not mean

that  no employer will be prosecuted in the future.   If,  in

fact,  police  investigations  reveal  evidence  of  criminal

negligence, as I have assured Members earlier on, I  have  no

doubt  that  the  police and the Attorney-General's  Chambers

will proceed according to the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, can the Minister

consider publicising the punitive measures which can be taken

against employers?  Sometimes the maid has no choice when she

is  instructed by the employer to clean windows.  But if  the

employers know that if they do that and the penalty  is  very

severe, then they will not ask the maid to do it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will certainly ask

my  Ministry  to  do that and to continue to  reinforce  this

message.   We have been doing so, as I have mentioned  in  my

earlier answer, and we will update  the information kit  that

we issue both to the domestic workers and to the employers to

caution them on this particular aspect of domestic work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Maybe the Ministry should consider

conducting  a short course to educate foreign domestic  maids

on   the   proper  ways  of  cleaning  windows  in  high-rise

buildings, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



there are certainly other safer ways to clean windows.  But I

think  many  a  time, these maids, on their  own  initiative,

climb out of the windows.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the training of

foreign  domestic workers, whether it is before they come  to

Singapore or after arriving in Singapore, is a matter that is

best  left  to the private sector.  There are already,  if  I

remember  correctly, nearly 1,000 employment agents  involved

in recruiting such domestic workers.  I think we can leave it

to  them  to  provide the appropriate level of  training  for

these  domestic  workers.  In fact, some of the  training  is

done  in  the  home  country before they actually  leave  the

country.  In some other cases, community organisations,  such

as  the  Marine  Parade  CDC had offered  such  training  for

domestic workers. This is all to be supported.  We can  leave

it  to  the employment agents and the community organisations

to  run  such courses rather than asking my Ministry  or  the

Work  Permit Department to conduct such courses.  I think  it

is  more appropriate for a wide variety of suppliers for this

service  to run the courses and to train the maids  according

to  the  needs of the employers.  Members have to  understand

that some people employ foreign domestic workers not just  to

look  after children or clean windows.  Some employ  them  to

look  after  the  aged.   So what particular  aspect  of  the

training should we focus on?  I think we should leave  it  to

the  private sector.  They know what the customer  wants  the

foreign  domestic worker for.  Therefore, they would  provide

the right level of training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I understand that there are about

50,000  maids in Singapore and that 86% of Singaporeans  live

in  highrise flats and many of them employ foreign maids.   I

would  think  that probably, taken from just pure statistics,

there  will   be  one  or  two more maids  falling  from  the

windows.   Under what sort of circumstances will the Minister

do something concrete for maids?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, we are already taking concrete

measures to improve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



the  situation by way of educating the employers of  domestic

workers.  Mr Chiam is quite wrong there.  There are more than

50,000  maids.   We  have more than 100,000 foreign  domestic

workers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether another accident will happen or not, my

sincere and earnest hope is that it will not happen again  as

a  result of this widespread publicity on the dangers of such

window  cleaning,  and  our educational  effort  to  get  the

employers  to be more careful and conscientious  in  the  way

they  treat  their domestic workers and the way  they  assign

duties  and chores to them.  But accidents may still  happen.

We cannot rule out accidents completely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If the Minister is not going to do

anything concrete, maybe I would ask the Minister to  provide

the information kit and the video that he talks about to Town

Councils  so that Town Council staff could study or  look  at

them, and maybe pass the message over to the residents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, all our information kits are sent

directly  to the users.  The video is sent to the  employment

agents because they are the ones responsible for bringing  in

the  foreign  domestic workers into Singapore  in  the  first

instance.  Their responsibility is to show the video  to  the

foreign domestic workers upon arrival to orientate them.  All

our other information materials are sent to the employers  of

the  domestic  workers  or  to the foreign  domestic  workers

themselves at their place of work.  If the Member for  Potong

Pasir  wants  to  have a set of it, I see no difficulty.   We

will be very pleased to extend a set to him.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> I am trying to find out why

Mr  Chiam wants to blame the Ministry for the problem because

it  is a problem of human failing.  The Ministry is trying to

educate  the families in terms of how to deal with the  maids

as humanely as possible.  I do not understand why he wants to

impose on the Ministry.  It is a personal problem.  It  is  a

problem dealing with the families and the maids.

<div align="center"><b>MEDISHIELD SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Opting out)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

how many Singaporean workers have opted out of the MediShield

scheme, and what steps his Ministry is taking to help workers

understand the benefits of the scheme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 31st December

1999, the total MediShield membership was 2 million, of which

1.6  million  CPF  members and their dependants  are  insured

under  Basic MediShield Scheme, and 400,000 are insured under

MediShield  Plus.   The  total number of  CPF  members  using

Medisave  to  pay  for  coverage under  the  IncomeShield  or

Managed HealthCare System was 200,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the Basic MediShield Scheme in

1990,  about  230,000  members had  opted  out  and  did  not

participate  in  any  health  insurance  schemes  using   CPF

savings.   Such persons could have their own health insurance

coverage  or  felt  that they were adequately  covered  under

their   employers'  healthcare  benefits.   Another   337,000

members had opted out of the Basic MediShield Scheme in order

to  join  MediShield Plus, IncomeShield or Managed Healthcare

System.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board recognises that there could still be some

members who may not have healthcare coverage.  Therefore, the

Board  carries  out regular programmes to promote  MediShield

cover.   These  include sending to all  new  CPF  members  an

information  package on MediShield, and providing information

on  MediShield  in  the CPF Newsline in all  the  four  major

language  newspapers regularly.  The CPF Board  also  jointly

organised talks on MediShield with the trade unions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



community clubs, public libraries and schools to help members

of the public understand the benefits of the Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the CPF Board has been actively promoting

the  MediShield/MediShield Plus Schemes to households and  to

parents through schools.  Since 1996 a total of about 420,000

direct  mail  packages have been sent out to  households  and

through  schools.  We have received a good response of  about

130,000  applications as at 31st December  1999.   The  Board

will  continue in its efforts to educate the public  and  its

members on the MediShield/MediShield Plus schemes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, would the Ministry

allow  for all those who have opted out of the scheme to  opt

in  again?  Would the Ministry also take action to  help  the

public  to  understand the risk that they take by opting  out

from such a scheme?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, we will consider the request of

members who had previously opted out and now want to opt  in.

Of   course,  you  must  understand  that  MediShield  is  an

insurance  scheme.  Therefore, once you opt out,  to  rejoin,

you  will  have to satisfy the conditions as a new applicant,

which  may well include medical examination and a ruling  out

of  coverage for prevailing or pre-existing illnesses.   That

is why it is beneficial for CPF members to remain a member of

MediShield   or  some  other  insurance,  such   as   Managed

Healthcare  System or IncomeShield or MediShield  Plus  right

from  day one.  In which case, as a young and healthy worker,

he  would be fully covered.  In most cases, there will be  no

pre-existing  ailments to be excluded.  So they could  remain

covered  for  the rest of their lives.  We are continuing  to

explain  this  to all CPF members and MediShield  members  to

ensure  that they stay insured throughout their working  life

time.

<div align="center"><b>PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



there  has  been a review on early education  for  the  young

under  6  years  of age; (b) what are some  of  the  critical

findings; (c) what areas in our pre-school education  require

improvement; and (d) whether the Government will  set  up  an

Inter-Ministry  Research and Action Task  Force  to  identify

changing  needs  and programmes in safeguarding  quality  and

consistent  standards among all pre-schools, irrespective  of

whether they are run by the Ministry of Community Development

or by the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

Steering Committee which is chaired by myself was set  up  in

November  last  year to study how the quality  of  pre-school

education  in  Singapore can be improved while retaining  its

provision  in  the  hands of the private  and  the  community

sectors.  As part of the review, a study will be conducted to

ascertain the long-term impact of pre-school education on the

future learning outcomes of a child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review on pre-school education has only just begun,

and no findings are available yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few high-leverage areas in pre-school

education  that have a significant impact on future  learning

outcomes.  These include defining clear objectives  for  pre-school   education,  research,  curriculum  development   and

teacher-training.  The Steering Committee  will  examine  how

MOE  can  make  judicious investment in these areas  to  help

improve pre-school education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steering Committee on Pre-School Education is an

inter-Ministry  Committee,  comprising  representatives  from

MOE,  MCD,  as  well as the National Institute  of  Education

(NIE).



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Two

supplementary  questions.  Looking at the figures  that  were

given  to  me in a written answer by the Minister  yesterday,

the  teacher-student ratio in MOE kindergartens is 1:51.   In

the  MCD  childcare  centres, it is 1:12.   Is  the  Minister

addressing this uneven ratio?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



What measures can be adopted to improve the quality of care?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: MCD has announced a higher

requirement for childcare personnel in October last year.  Is

this   requirement   applicable  also  to  MOE   kindergarten

personnel?   The Minister has said that she has  just  led  a

Steering   Committee  on  teacher  training   programme   and

accreditation matters.  Why are there two sets of guidelines?

For  the  purpose of efficient management and consistency  of

standards  in  pre-school education, is it  not  possible  to

envisage  setting up an agency with an over-arching authority

to  look  into  matters of child education so  that  all  the

childcare centres, whether it is under MOE or MCD, will  have

a  consistent  standard?  Why set up an  Inter-Ministry  task

force?   Why  not  have one agency that is  the  over-arching

body?



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are aware of the

teacher-student ratio in pre-school centres being not at  the

optimal.   One of the tasks of the Steering Committee  is  to

look  at how to improve pre-school education, where possible,

by reducing class size.  But I must emphasise that class size

is  not  the  only  factor that goes into what  defines  good

quality  pre-school  education.   We  will  take  a  holistic

picture  of  the  problem.   Yes, MCD  has  announced  higher

qualifications  for its childcare centre  supervisors  to  be

effective  within  five  years.   So  part  of  the  Steering

Committee's work is also to look into how we could raise  the

qualification  requirement  for  kindergarten  teachers   and

supervisors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to her question whether there should be one single

agency  to  be  in charge of childcare as well as  pre-school

education,  for the moment I cannot think of an  agency  that

should  have such a narrow portfolio.  It is best for  us  to

work  closely  in coordination with MCD to see  how  the  two

sectors  can  be  interlinked in a much more satisfactory  or

seamless  manner.  But I must also say that the  requirements

for   childcare,   even   the   training   requirement,   the

philosophical and develop-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



mental  aspects of children aged from 18 months to  3  years,

are somewhat different from the requirements of children aged

3  years  to  6  years.  At the moment, these are  under  two

different  Ministries.   We  are  looking  into  how  we  can

coordinate and synchronise matters better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, with regard to pre-school

education,  has  the  Ministry found the  need  to  establish

neighbourhood  libraries for pre-schoolers to teach  them  to

read at an early age?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is there a problem in the teaching of English

to children from non-English speaking families?



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, I think the question of

neighbourhood libraries has been raised by Mr Chiam over  and

over  again  in  the House.  These are an  extension  of  the

National Library, and they are not exclusively for pre-school

children.   They  are  the combined effort  of  the  National

Library together with the Community Development Councils.  So

it  is  not  really  within the purview of  the  Ministry  of

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Mr Chiam's question whether there is any

problem  of  teaching English to children  coming  from  non-English  speaking homes, given the linguistic  background  of

the  population,  where  some  children  come  from  English-speaking  homes, and others from non English-speaking  homes,

there will always be a problem either way.  As I said, one of

the  terms of reference of the Steering Committee is to  look

into  the  curriculum development.  So we will  see  how  our

bilingual teaching can be improved in pre-school centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am not bringing up this issue

of  neighbourhood library to score a political point.   I  am

talking strictly from the educational point of view.  Has the

Ministry  discovered  from  the  educational  point  of  view

whether there is a need to establish libraries that are close

by and accessible to pre-schoolers to teach them to read?  Is

there such a finding?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I understand that many children from non

English-speaking  families still do not  master  the  English

language at the end of their education in school.  So this is

a problem.  Has the Ministry found out such a problem?



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> From the Ministry of Education's point

of  view, libraries, of course, are good things for children.

We  have  not  found  out, in the sense  of  making  in-depth

studies, the language learning difficulties faced by children

at  the pre-school age.  Hitherto, this sector has been under

the  private  sector and the community sector.  But  this  is

also  one  of  the issues the Committee will be  looking  at,

through a pilot research study, and if Members are interested

to  know  about  this study, they could file  some  questions

during the Committee of Supply.

<div align="center"><b>INCREASED INTAKE OF FOREIGN STUDENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether the increased intake of foreign students will in  any

way  reduce  the  absolute numbers of  the  intake  of  local

students.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker, the intake of foreign students into our schools  and

junior  colleges does not reduce the absolute numbers of  the

intake  of  local students.  All eligible local students  are

assured  of  a  school place in our educational institutions.

For primary, secondary and pre-U institutions, local students

are given priority in placement over the foreign students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Singaporean students who qualify for admission to

our  institutes of higher learning (IHLs) will  also  not  be

deprived of a place at our IHLs.  The increase in the  intake

of  foreign students constitutes part of the IHLs'  expansion

plans,  and  is  not  at the expense of our  local  students.

Between 1990 and 1999, the number of university places  given

to  local  students  for undergraduate study  increased  from

6,600  to 8,600.  Similarly, the number of polytechnic places

given to local students rose from 9,100 in 1990 to 15,900  in

1999.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



By  1999,  there  are sufficient places for 21%  of  the  age

cohort to enter university and 39% to enter the polytechnics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1990 and 1999, we were able to create another

1,500  university  places and 1,200  polytechnic  places  for

foreign  students  over this 10-year period.   These  foreign

students  were  admitted on top of the local student  intake.

The  IHLs have been careful to ensure that the quality of the

foreign  students admitted is on average higher than that  of

the  local  students,  so that their  presence  adds  to  the

vibrancy of the academic environment and increase the quality

of education at the IHLs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like

to  find  out  for  the institutes of higher  learning,  what

percentage  of  these foreign students come  from  the  first

world and the rest of the world.  That is the first question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this. I understand that the

Minister  of  State  said  that  60%  of  the  cohort  go  to

institutes  of  higher learning.  I want to find  out  if  we

include  our  students  that  go overseas,  what  would  that

percentage be.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I am sorry I do not have the figures or

the  breakdown  of  the  country of  origin  of  the  foreign

students.   But  I would say the majority of  them  are  from

countries like China, India and the ASEAN countries.  As  for

his  question  about  the cohort participation  rate  in  our

institutions of higher learning, if we include those  who  go

overseas,  I  think the figure would be anything between  25%

and  27%.   But  please note that we do not  have  the  exact

figures  on those who go overseas to study because  they  are

not obliged to tell us.

ranked  "lower  than  expected"  in  a  "pilot  environmental

sustainability index" (PESI); and (b) what measures  will  be

taken to improve on the range of environmental indicators  in

the index.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I have permission to answer Questions 8 and

9 together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The "Pilot Environmental

Sustainability  Index" or PESI has been designed  to  measure

environmental sustainability on a pilot basis.   It  attempts

to    measure   the   ability   of   economies   to   achieve

environmentally  sustainable  development.    The   inaugural

report on the index was released at the World Economic  Forum

at Davos, Switzerland on 31st January this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The index comprises five components: (i) Environmental

systems;    (ii)   Environmental   stresses;   (iii)    Human

vulnerability  to  environmental  impacts;  (iv)  Social  and

institutional capacity; and (v) Global stewardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The score for the `environmental systems' component is

determined  largely  by  urban air  quality,  water  quality,

surface and ground water resources and biodiversity.  We  are

strong in urban air quality and water quality, but as a small

city  state,  we are not endowed with plentiful  surface  and

ground  water  resources nor able to support  wide  areas  of

biodiversity, and was rated below average in this component.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The score for the component on `environmental stresses'

is  determined  by  the  amount of air and  water  pollutants

discharged,  waste  production,  consumption  and  population

growth  relative  to  land area.  With  our  high  degree  of

industrialisation  and high population  density,  we  do  not

expect to be rated highly for this component.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The score for the `human vulnerability to environmental

impacts'  component is determined by the success in providing

basic  sustenance  such as safe drinking  water  and  a  high

standard of public health.  Singapore has fared well in  this

component, coming in third after Iceland and Germany.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The score for `social and institutional capacity'

component   is  determined  by  the  science  and   technical

capacity, environmental regulation and management, the  means

to track environmental conditions and eco efficiency in terms

of  energy  efficiency  and  the  use  of  hydroelectric  and

renewable  energy.   Our score for this component  was  above

average.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The score for the last component `global stewardship' is

determined  by our contribution to international  cooperation

such  as  our membership in Forest Stewardship Council  (FSC)

and the status of national biodiversity strategies and action

plans.    The   FSC   is  an  international  non-governmental

organisation  that promotes sustainable forestry  management.

The  component  also includes an assessment of  forest  areas

certified by the FSC as well as carbon dioxide emission.  The

low score given to Singapore for this component is attributed

to  factors  such  as  our  relatively  high  carbon  dioxide

emission  as we are fully dependent on fossil fuel,  and  our

lack of forest areas that could be certified by the FSC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inaugural report released in Davos took care to

highlight  an anomaly in the case of Singapore, namely,  that

we  scored  far  lower  than expected in  the  `environmental

stresses'  component.  The report explained that the  anomaly

for Singapore was:  `probably a function of the fact that, as

a   city   state,  it  possesses  a  qualitatively  different

environmental context than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



the  other  economies, all of which possess more conventional

mixes  of  urban and rural areas and a greater  diversity  of

ecosystems'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The variables for the `environmental stresses' component

are  largely  based  on  land area.   For  example,  for  air

pollution, the variables express industrial emissions and the

number  of  vehicles in terms of per unit of land area  of  a

country.   Likewise, for water pollution,  the  variable  for

industrial  organic pollutants is expressed in terms  of  per

unit  of  land  area.  This puts countries such as  Singapore

with  small  land  areas  and intensive  use  of  land  at  a

disadvantage under the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inaugural report stressed the preliminary nature of

the  pilot  effort  and  added  that  the  methods  used  are

experimental.  It also added that considerable work is needed

to produce a more refined index.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will provide the originators of the pilot

index   with  more  information  concerning  our  environment

protection efforts to assist in refining the index so that it

is  more  applicable to small, industrialised countries  like

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that over the years,

Singapore  has  received  many  international  accolades  for

having  managed our living environment well in spite  of  our

limited   resources,   and   considerable   pressures    from

urbanisation and industrialisation.  My Ministry's programmes

will  ensure  that  Singaporeans will  continue  to  enjoy  a

quality  living environment with clean air, clean  water  and

high standards of environmental public health.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, does the Minister see

the  Environment  Council  playing a  collaborative  role  in

<div align="center"><b>ENFORCEMENT OF VEHICLE PARKING TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

if  he  will  give  an  update on the privatised  scheme  for

enforcement of vehicle parking traffic violations.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, a total

of  12,135 parking violation notices were issued in  November

and  December under the Traffic Warden Scheme, which has been

in  operation  for  about three months now.   Traffic  Police

assesses that the illegal parking problem in the 38 locations

covered by the Scheme has improved.  Traffic flows better  in

most  areas, as many motorists are deterred from waiting  and

parking  in  these  areas  by the  presence  of  the  traffic

wardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public concerns, when the Scheme was first

launched, over the competence and objectivity of the  traffic

wardens  have  been allayed.  The traffic wardens,  who  were

trained by Traffic Police, have performed up to expectations.

They  are  responsible for serving parking violation notices.

Traffic  Police  continues to issue the summonses,  determine

the fines and hear appeals.  Traffic Police will continue  to

monitor  the  performance of the wardens closely and  conduct

monthly  audits of the scheme with CISCO to ensure that  high

standards are maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Warden Scheme will be extended to more

locations if it sustains its promising start.  This will help

free up precious Police manpower and enable Traffic Police to

devote more resources to act against moving traffic offences,

which  pose  a  greater threat to public safety  than  static

offences such as illegal parking.

<div align="center"><b>LAWS TO GIVE PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether the Government intends to pass laws  giving

protection to consumers such as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



the  Fair  Trading Act 1986 and the Consumer  Guarantees  Act

1993 of New Zealand, and, if so, when.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's approach to consumer

protection is to educate consumers while enabling the  market

to  operate as efficiently as possible, regulating only where

necessary.  Encouraging competition and increasing access  to

a  range of goods and services enable consumers to make their

own  decisions from a menu of choices.  This is the best  way

to increase consumer welfare.  The policy has served us well.

In  areas  where  protection is necessary,  for  example,  to

safeguard health, safety or public morals, there are  already

existing  legislation.   Specific offences  of  cheating  and

certain  forms of fraudulent trades are also covered  in  the

Penal Code and other legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must avoid over-regulating. First, legislative and

regulatory  requirements  on  businesses  carry   with   them

compliance   costs.   This  will  increase   business   costs

generally  that would ultimately be passed on  to  consumers.

Second,  we must also avoid excessive dependence by consumers

on  Government regulation.  Otherwise, legislation would have

to keep expanding in scope and coverage to cover all possible

cases  of  cheating and unfair trade practices.  In the  end,

the best principle must be let the buyer beware - this is the

caveat emptor principle.

<div align="center"><b>MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN CRIMINAL MATTERS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, globalisation has produced immense benefits and

rapid  development to countries around the  world.   However,

one side effect is that serious crimes are no longer confined

within   national   boundaries.   The  reduction   of   trade

restrictions, the increasing ease with which people and goods

cross    national    borders,    the    global    reach    of

telecommunications  and  financial  systems,  all  of   these

present opportunities to criminals to extend their activities

beyond  national borders.  The same forces that make possible

today's  rapid international trade can be exploited  and  are

exploited  by  criminals to extend their criminal  activities

and influences across countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an effective network of international

cooperation in the war against transnational crimes, criminal

organisations  will  be able to exploit the  differences  and

dislocations  caused by national borders to  their  advantage

and  defy  the individual efforts of national authorities  to

deal  with  them.  This Bill before the House  today  signals

Singapore's  commitment to be part of the wider international

network of cooperation in combating crime on a global scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that we have enacted legal

provisions  for international mutual assistance  in  criminal

matters.    In   1993,  we  enacted  the   Drug   Trafficking

(Confiscation  of  Benefits) Act with mechanisms  for  mutual

assistance   built   in  to  help  in   the   fight   against

international drug money-laundering.  Last year, Members will

recall we extended that legislation scope to cover laundering

of the proceeds of other serious crimes and we renamed it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



the  Corruption,  Drug Trafficking and Other  Serious  Crimes

(Confiscation  of  Benefits) Act.  With  that  extension,  we

widened the scope of the mutual assistance provisions in  the

Act  to  cover  mutual assistance in the context  of  serious

offences other than drug trafficking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us today builds on these previous

efforts  by  consolidating  the  existing  mutual  assistance

provisions   and  providing  for  more  forms  of  assistance

currently  not available under our laws.  It follows  closely

on  the  heels of the amendments last year, as  part  of  the

Government's  progressive  move  towards  building  a   wider

framework  for international legal assistance  in  the  fight

against  crime.   There is an increasing international  trend

towards   enacting  comprehensive  mutual  legal   assistance

legislation.  We see this in the laws of the United  Kingdom,

Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, to name but a few.   In

fact,  during the Plenary of the Financial Action Task  Force

last  year,  Singapore was encouraged to  enact  a  dedicated

mutual assistance law.  It is in keeping with our role  as  a

member  of  the Financial Action Task Force to  act  on  this

suggestion and to propose this Bill to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill not only facilitates the provision of legal

assistance by Singapore to foreign authorities, it will  also

enhance  the  legal  arsenal  at  the  disposal  of  our  law

enforcement  agencies in fighting transnational  crime.   For

example, our law enforcement agencies have in the past  faced

problems  in  getting witnesses from other  jurisdictions  to

come  to Singapore to give evidence. This has hampered  their

investigations in some cases.  The Bill before us will  allow

them  to receive such assistance.  It will help to facilitate

the work of our enforcement agencies.



<br><br><i>Overview of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now take the House through the main

provisions  of  the Bill.  The Bill has four parts.   Part  2

deals  with the requests for assistance made by Singapore  to

foreign  countries.   Part  3 deals  with  the  requests  for

assistance to Singapore by foreign countries.  Parts 1 and  4

deal with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



general issues which are common to both requests by Singapore

to foreign countries and foreign countries to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill marks out the extent and forms of assistance

which Singapore is prepared to give, the pre-conditions to be

met  before  such  assistance is given,  and  the  conditions

governing the rendering of such assistance.  It also provides

the  legal  framework  for Singapore to request  and  receive

assistance from other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill does not deal with extradition. All requests

for  extradition and assistance leading to extradition,  will

continue   to  be  handled  under  the  provisions   of   the

Extradition Act.  Clause 5 of the Bill makes that very clear.

The  Bill  will  also  not  affect  the  system  of  informal

cooperation  currently existing between our  law  enforcement

agencies  and  other  law enforcement  agencies  as  well  as

international organisations, such as Interpol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance under the Bill may be obtained or provided

for  criminal investigations, criminal proceedings in  court,

and  seizure or confiscation of proceeds or instrumentalities

of  crime.  The Bill imposes no restrictions on which country

Singapore may request assistance from.  When it comes to  the

provision  of  assistance  to  foreign  countries,  the  Bill

distinguishes between assistance involving coercive measures,

such as, for example, search warrants and those not involving

coercive   measures,  for  example,  service  of   documents.

Assistance  which does not involve coercive measures  may  be

provided to any country.  On the other hand, assistance which

involves coercive measures may only be provided to a  country

which  has  a mutual legal assistance treaty with  Singapore.

For  these  measures, the Bill merely lays down the framework

for  Singapore to enter into a mutual legal assistance treaty

with   other  countries  for  the  provision  of  assistance.

Therefore, whether assistance can be provided will depend  on

the  existence  of  a  treaty.   Just as extradition  is  not

automatic  but  is  conditional  on  the  existence   of   an

extradition  treaty, it is also consistent with international

practice to condition the use of a State's coercive powers on

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



existence  of  a  mutual legal assistance  treaty,  sometimes

referred  to as MLAT in short.  The requirement for a  treaty

will  allow  Singapore  to  set  conditions  for  giving   of

assistance  and  provide safeguards against abuses  by  other

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out at this stage that there is one

exception  to  this  distinction between  coercive  and  non-coercive  measures.  This relates to the provision on  taking

testimony  in Singapore courts for use in foreign proceedings

(clause  21).   This is because this form  of  assistance  is

already   currently  available  under  section  43   of   the

Extradition  Act,  without the requirement for  mutual  legal

assistance  treaty  and we do not wish to  upset  a  practice

which has been in place for many years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the list of offences for which assistance may be

obtained  or provided for under the Bill is the same  as  the

list   currently   applicable  under  the  Corruption,   Drug

Trafficking   and  Other  Serious  Crimes  (Confiscation   of

Benefits) Act (or CDSA for short).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that the Attorney-General will be the

authority for requesting assistance from other countries  and

receiving requests for assistance from other countries.



<br><br><i>Request by Singapore</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as requests by Singapore are concerned, under the

Bill,  Singapore can ask for a number of different  forms  of

assistance  from  a  foreign  country.   The  first  form  of

assistance involves obtaining of evidence - that is, asking a

foreign  country to take evidence in that country,  including

obtaining  the  testimony of witnesses  as  well  as  seizing

physical evidence, photographs, documents, and transmit  them

to  Singapore for use in legal proceedings.  The second  form

of assistance is in arranging for the voluntary attendance of

persons in Singapore as witnesses in legal proceedings or  to

assist  in  criminal  investigations.  Clause  11  gives  the

assurance that a person who comes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



to  Singapore under this provision will, during the period of

his  stay  in Singapore for the purpose requested, be  immune

from prosecution or civil suit for anything which he has done

before leaving the foreign country to come to Singapore.  The

third  form of assistance is to request a foreign country  to

enforce  a Singapore confiscation order.  Fourthly, a request

could  be made to a foreign country to assist in locating  or

identifying  a person who could be of assistance in  criminal

investigations  or proceedings or who could  be  affected  by

such  investigations or proceedings.  Finally, a request  can

be  made to a foreign country for service of Singapore  court

documents in that country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the existence of these provisions in our law

does  not mean that any foreign country will be automatically

obliged  to  accede  to our requests.   Whether  the  foreign

country  will  accede  to  our request  will  depend  on  the

provisions  of that country's laws.  Just as we  require  the

existence   of  a  mutual  legal  assistance  treaty   before

providing some forms of this assistance, the country to which

we  make  a  request  may  similarly impose  a  condition  of

rendering assistance upon the existence of prior arrangements

or  understanding  with  Singapore  concerning  mutual  legal

assistance.  Essentially, Sir, what these provisions do is to

establish  that the Attorney-General has the legal  authority

to make such requests on behalf of Singapore.



<br><br><i>Request to Singapore</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to requests which may be made by foreign

countries  to  Singapore,  the  forms  of  assistance   which

Singapore can request are also the forms of assistance  which

Singapore  can  provide  under  the  Bill.   As  I  explained

earlier,  some  of these provisions of giving  assistance  by

Singapore,   like  those  concerning  search   warrants   and

production  orders,  are only enabling  provisions.   Whether

assistance can be invoked in any particular case will  depend

on  whether there is a mutual legal assistance treaty between

Singapore and the requesting country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the various forms of assistance which Singapore can

provide,  assistance  concerning  production  orders,  search

warrants  and enforcement of foreign confiscation orders  are

already  provided for in the CDSA.  As I mentioned just  now,

these  mutual  assistance provisions  in  the  CDSA  will  be

repealed and moved into this Bill.  Assistance in the  taking

of  evidence is also not new, as it is now provided for under

section  43  of the Extradition Act.  Similarly,  section  43

will  be repealed and moved into the Bill as clause 21.  This

consolidation  will now provide a convenient one-stop  source

of  reference  of  the  provisions for mutual  assistance  in

criminal matters in our law.



<br><br><i>Safeguards built into the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the safeguards which have been built into

the  Bill.   While  we are willing to provide  assistance  to

foreign  authorities in appropriate circumstances,  obviously

there  must be safeguards in place to prevent abuses  of  our

willingness to assist and to prevent unnecessary intrusion by

foreign  authorities into the privacy of our  businesses  and

individuals.   Many safeguards are therefore built  into  the

Bill.  I shall briefly explain the main safeguards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first safeguard of course is the limited list of

offences  for which assistance is available.  As I  mentioned

before,  this list is tied to the list of offences under  the

CDSA.  Limiting the list of offences for which assistance can

be  provided  ensures that assistance is given only  for  the

offences  which are considered to be sufficiently serious  in

nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second safeguard is the requirement for mutual legal

assistance  treaty for certain forms of assistance,  which  I

have  already mentioned, and can be described as coercive  in

nature.   A  related  safeguard is that  a  request  will  be

declined if it does not comply with the conditions laid  down

in the applicable treaty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that requests are not made unnecessarily, it

is  provided  that  the Attorney-General will  not  honour  a

request if the thing requested is not of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



sufficient  importance  to  the  investigation  of   criminal

proceedings, or could reasonably be obtained by other means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid information or evidence obtained pursuant to a

request  from being used subsequently for other purposes,  it

is provided that a request will be declined if the requesting

state  fails to give an undertaking that the thing  requested

will not be used for purposes other than those for which  the

request was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is a general power to decline a request

if  the  provision  of  assistance could  prejudice  a  local

investigation  or criminal proceeding or would prejudice  the

safety  of any person or if it is not in the public  interest

to provide the assistance.



<br><br><i>Miscellaneous amendment to CDSA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, I should mention that the Bill also seeks

to  insert a new section 39A into the CDSA. This will empower

Suspicious  Transactions Reporting Officers in the Commercial

Affairs   Department  to  share  information   with   foreign

financial  intelligence units.  Safeguards  have  been  built

into  section  39A  such that the sharing of  information  is

conditional  on  there  being  an  arrangement  between   the

financial  intelligence units of Singapore  and  the  foreign

country.



Conclusion



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that this Bill will

enhance  the legal arsenal at the disposal of law enforcement

agencies.  It will also enable Singapore to play its part  in

the  wider  international  efforts  to  combat  transnational

crimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I rise to

support  the Bill.  In preface to that, I am sure Members  of

this  House  will remember that the whole world  was  waiting

with  bated breath on the eve of the New Year, 31st  December

1999, when we thought that if the millennium bug did not  get

us, the other viruses will.  In the end, happily, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



was  a  non-event,  though  many,  especially  those  in  the

computer departments must have thought that there were better

ways to spend the millennium eve than to sit in one's office,

watching computer screens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this example shows how we entered this new

millennium, this new century, feeling very vulnerable.  Crime

knows  no  borders and criminals these days are as much  into

globalisation  as any self-respecting industry.   It  is  the

same  for those who are engaged in other crimes and  who  use

computers,   for  example,  to  facilitate  their   nefarious

affairs, such as money laundering and the like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore imperative that we have in place

legislation  that  would allow our prosecutors  to  cooperate

with  their  counterparts  in other countries.  Indeed,  such

legislation is not just timely, but overdue.  Be that  as  it

may, we observe the rule of law and once this Bill is passed,

we  will have in place the legislation needed for us to  seek

assistance  from  others in a variety of ways  -  to  collect

evidence,  to  look  for witnesses, to  enforce  confiscation

orders and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have several issues that I hope the Minister can

clarify in this debate.  The first has to do with the  effect

of  this  Bill  on the process of extradition.  According  to

clause  5, the Bill does not authorise extradition,  and  any

arrest  or  detention associated with it. At the  same  time,

Part  III  of  the Bill, which the Minister has referred  to,

deals with requests made by other countries to Singapore  for

assistance.   This  may conceivably be used  to  request  the

attendance of a person from Singapore and if that person were

to  go,  he may find himself subjected to other charges  that

neither  the Attorney-General nor he was informed  about.   I

should like to ask the Minister to confirm to the House  that

the  safeguards provided in this Bill would not be used as  a

back  door  to extradition, and that adequate safeguards  are

indeed in place to prevent this.  Would he also confirm  that

extradition  remains the main process through  which  alleged

criminals are extradited to other countries?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I have concerns the use of evidence,

once  obtained from abroad. Clause 8(3) allows evidence  from

abroad  to be admitted, subject to the Evidence Act  and  the

Criminal Procedure Code. Such evidence may include, according

to  the  clause,  things  or  photos  or  copies  of  things.

However, unlike statements contained in things, there  is  no

provision  on how to authenticate and evaluate this evidence.

If a statement is involved, then the Court is under a duty to

see  whether  it  is possible to challenge the  statement  by

questioning  the  maker.  It is also  to  take  into  account

whether  legal representation was available to the  maker  at

the  time the statement was made.  One example of the problem

could be in relation to the case of things or objects.  It is

usually  required in Singapore that the person  adducing  any

thing or object should show the "chain of evidence" from  the

time  the  object was seized to the time it was  produced  in

Court.  Thus, for example, if a packet of heroin was  seized,

say,  in  Jakarta,  and if that packet were  to  be  used  in

evidence here in Singapore, there should be a record from the

time  it  was seized to the time it was produced in Court  to

avoid  the  danger of fabrication or misuse of  evidence.   I

hope  that the Minister can confirm that the Attorney-General

and  other prosecuting authorities would take the utmost care

in  using evidence obtained from abroad in Singapore  courts.

It  must satisfy the rules of production in Singapore courts,

and  that  this  clause does not, without more,  justify  the

admission of evidence without proper authentication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third issue relates to the immunities and privileges

of a person whose presence is requested through the Bill.  It

is  whether  the  immunities and privileges  go  too  far  in

certain respects, and not far enough in others.  Under clause

11(a),  the person whose presence is required shall  not  "be

detained, prosecuted or punished in Singapore for any offence

that  is  alleged  to  have  been  committed,  or  that   was

committed,  before the person's departure  from  the  foreign

country.". So a person who has committed a crime in Singapore

flees to another country, and then requested to come back  to

give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



evidence,   say,  against  his  accomplice,  would   not   be

prosecuted while he is returning under this provision.  Could

the Ministry clarify that this is indeed the position?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to clause 11(2) which withdraws the

protection  under  subclause  (1)  if  the  person  has  left

Singapore  or  the person has the opportunity  to  leave  but

remained in Singapore for a purpose unrelated to the  purpose

for which his presence was required. Thus, if after the case,

the  person were to stay back a day to catch a later  flight,

and  at  the  same time, do a bit of shopping, it seems  that

technically,  it  would  be  regarded  as  having   had   the

opportunity  to  leave,  but has remained  in  Singapore  for

another  purpose,  and  therefore, the immunities  no  longer

apply.   I  bring  out this somewhat casual  example  to  ask

whether  in such instances, we intend to stick to the  letter

of  the  law, or its spirit.  Could we expect other countries

to  be  also  flexible in their approach, and not apply  such

technicalities  when  it  comes  to  Singapore  persons   who

voluntarily go to the country requesting their presence?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I refer to the wide authority of the Attorney-General to request the presence of a person in Singapore from

a  foreign country. Clause 9 states that the Attorney-General

may  make a request to secure a person's attendance if "there

are  reasonable grounds to believe that a person in a foreign

country  is capable of giving evidence or assistance relevant

to  a  criminal matter involving a Singapore offence."   Does

this  broad authority extend to helping defence counsel,  for

example,  in  procuring alibi witnesses?  Or is it  the  case

that the procedures under this Bill would only be used to aid

in prosecutions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I refer to the wide discretion given to

the Attorney-General to delegate his powers under the Bill to

any  public  officer under clause 43.  I  wonder  whether  in

relation to such serious matters, the discretion should be so

wide.  Surely, it would have been more appropriate  to  limit

the  delegable  authority  to someone  who  is  in  a  senior

position in the Legal Service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate that I do support the Bill, and that

it   marks   a   significant  step  in  the   fight   against

international crime.  I hope, however, that the Minister  can

assure  the  Members of this House that such powers,  as  are

conferred by the Bill, would be properly used, and that  care

will always be taken when the life, liberty or property of an

individual, whether foreign or local, is at stake.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I thank you

for allowing me to seek clarifications from the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I support the Bill and since there is

globalisation, crime has also globalised, I think  this  Bill

is  very  useful.  However, I just want to ask  whether  this

Bill  will  be  used  in the case of trafficking  in  people,

especially women and children.  There is an increase in these

crimes worldwide and will this Bill address that problem. And

secondly,  will this Bill be used even in cases  where  there

are  unscrupulous employment agents who, we know that happens

in  Singapore,  also  bring in foreign workers  illegally  on

promises  of  employment here? Will these  be  classified  as

serious crimes and will this Bill be applicable?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank Prof. Chin Tet Yung and

Mr  Thomas Thomas for their support of the Bill.  Let me take

the  questions which they pose. First, I will deal  with  the

questions raised by Prof. Chin Tet Yung.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about extradition and whether this

could  be  used as a back door route of extradition.   He  is

right  in  pointing  out that this Bill does  not  deal  with

extradition,  as I have stressed in my speech.  All  requests

for  extradition and assistance leading to extradition  would

continue   to  be  handled  under  the  provisions   of   the

Extradition Act.  This is made clear in clause 5.   In  fact,

let me point out that in respect of requesting the assistance

of   people  to  come  from  foreign  countries  and  foreign

countries regarding assistance from Singaporeans to go  there

to  give  evidence,  the  Bill makes  it  clear  that  it  is

dependent on their consent. So, this Bill therefore does  not

deal with compulsory handing over of witness or person who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



can give assistance.  And it also has not got anything to  do

with charging a person for any offence in this country or the

other country with respect to mutual assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked if we could compel the attendance of a

person as a way of obtaining extradition by the back door.  I

do  not think there is any scope for achieving extradition by

the  back door.  Under clause 26, it makes it clear that  the

Attorney-General would not arrange for the  attendance  of  a

person  overseas unless the foreign authority gives  adequate

undertakings   to  the  Attorney-General.    One   of   these

undertakings,  and it is spelt out in clause 26(3)(a)(i),  is

that that person will not be charged for any offence which he

may  have committed before he leaves Singapore for a  foreign

country.  This will ensure that a person who travels overseas

and  has agreed to travel overseas under clause 26 would  not

be  charged for any pervious offence while he is in a foreign

country.  That is an important safeguard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about immunity. If you look at clause

11, it is clear that for the whole time that a person is here

in Singapore, pursuant to a request under clause 9, he cannot

be  charged for any offence he had committed before  he  left

the  foreign country to come to Singapore and I confirm  that

that  is  the  intention.  Let me give  an  example  so  that

Members  will understand the purport of such a safeguard.   A

person  may have committed an offence in Singapore some  time

ago and may be living in a foreign country. If we need him to

come  to  Singapore to help with the investigation of another

crime,  or to give evidence in a trial concerning some  other

accused,  naturally, he will be reluctant to do so, for  fear

that he would be prosecuted for his previous offence once  he

comes  to  Singapore.   This may not serve  the  interest  of

justice  as  this  witness' evidence could  be  valuable  and

another  criminal  could walk free if  we  fail  to  get  his

assistance.  When the Bill becomes law, the witness  will  be

willing  to  come  to Singapore as clause 11  will  give  him

immunity if he comes at the request



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



of  the Attorney-General, but the immunity is only temporary.

Once a witness leaves Singapore, the immunity ceases to apply

and  we could prosecute him if he comes back again on his own

volition.   Of course, if there is an extradition arrangement

in  place,  we can also ask for his extradition  at  a  later

time.  The key is that during the period, he is here for  the

purpose  of which assistance was sought and he had agreed  to

come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also clarify that the immunity only applies to

offences committed by the person before he begins his journey

to  Singapore.  If he commits a crime when he is in Singapore

during  that  period to give assistance, it  is  a  different

story and the immunity will not apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked a related point, about the point

of  time  when  the  immunity is deemed withdrawn.   He  gave

examples.   He is supposed to leave but he goes shopping  and

so  on.   Let  me  say  that all these provisions  on  mutual

assistance will work only if the countries concerned exercise

them  in  good  faith and some common sense.  Because  if  we

apply   these   provisions  in   a   very   unrealistic   and

unreasonable  manner, then, of course,  since  these  matters

depend  on  reciprocity, we can expect that  other  countries

also  not to act in good faith.  So, international assistance

and  cooperation  in  legal and law  enforcement  matters  is

predicated  upon countries working in good faith.  Otherwise,

international cooperation will break down.  So I guess if  it

is  one  day's shopping, our law enforcement authorities  are

not  going  to  unreasonably pounce on him for  his  previous

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked a point concerning the reliability

of  evidence received from overseas, and the example he  gave

about scrutinising chain of evidence, packet of heroin seized

in another country and so on.  I think it goes without saying

that  all  evidence received under clause 8 will have  to  be

assessed   by   our   court  for  relevance,   admissibility,

reliability and weight.  All evidence received from overseas,

therefore,  will  have to be subject to  the  same  rules  of

evidence as evidence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



obtained  locally,  a point which Prof.  Chin  was  concerned

about.   It is not the intention that evidence received  from

overseas  authorities will be scrutinised any less critically

than evidence obtained locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that a statement can be used against a

witness only if it is inconsistent with the testimony of  the

witness.  If the statement is inconsistent with the testimony

of  the witness and the intention is not to use the statement

against  the  witness, then the Bill neither  authorises  nor

prohibits its use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke about the ambit of the Attorney-General's

discretion to make requests to other countries, and he  asked

whether  this would include accommodating requests by defence

counsel in various cases.  He is right that the Bill provides

that  only  the  Attorney-General can make  a  request  to  a

foreign  country for assistance.  Let me say that the primary

intention   of   this   Bill   is  to   facilitate   criminal

investigations  and the prosecution of offenders.   In  fact,

this  is so for legislation enacted by other countries  also.

That is the primary intention.  Having said that, let me  say

that there is, of course, nothing in the Bill to prevent  the

Attorney-General from making a request to obtain evidence  in

the  aid  of the defence in a particular case.  In answer  to

Prof. Chin's question, let me say that I am sure the Attorney-General  will  give  due consideration to  any  request  from

defence  counsel to invoke the Attorney-General's  discretion

to  request assistance from a foreign country.  But I do  not

wish  to  give the impression that defence counsel should  be

freely  making  such  requests, or that the  Attorney-General

will  frequently  agree  to all these  requests  to  approach

foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say that? It is because I foresee that even

requests  in  aid  of  the  prosecution  will  be  made  very

sparingly,  because  in mutual legal assistance  arrangement,

such  requests are not routinely made.  They are made in very

serious cases, because a lot of effort on the part of the law

enforcement authorities and quite a lot of resources have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



be  spent  to  accommodate the request of a foreign  country.

So,  each request which Singapore makes to a foreign  country

does  impose  a strain on the resources of a foreign  country

and  vice  versa.  Just as we have given the Attorney-General

the right to decline to deal with trivial, unsubstantiated or

unnecessary  requests from foreign countries, I should  think

that we ourselves would not want to make  such a request in a

routine  manner.   Otherwise, we  may  lose  credibility  and

goodwill  internationally, and other countries may  not  deal

with our requests promptly or seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also dealt with power of delegation. It is

obvious that there has to be a power of delegation.   And  if

we look at the destination table of the different models from

which  we  have  borrowed  some  of  these  provisions,   the

Australian legislation has power of delegation.  Let me  say,

in  answer to his concern, that delegation will be made  only

to  officers  of  sufficient seniority  to  make  appropriate

decisions.   As  to  why it is not confined  only  to  senior

members of the legal service, as he knows, in our system,  we

have  the legal service, the police, the CID, maybe CPIB  and

others.   Many  law enforcement agencies are involved  and  I

think  we  should give the discretion to the Attorney-General

in  a  particular  case  to  harness  the  resources  of  the

appropriate department, other than the legal service itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in answer to Prof. Chin's request for an

assurance, I do wish to assure him that the powers under this

Bill,  of  course, will be properly used,  and  that  is  our

intention  to do so.  Our main objective of this Bill  is  to

facilitate obtaining of evidence and testimony from  overseas

with the objective of assisting the efficiency of our own law

enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecution.   In

doing  so,  there  is  no  intention whatsoever  of  lowering

standards  or to allow unreliable evidence to be used.   Just

as  we  are  interested  in  securing  the  conviction  of  a

criminal,  it  is  equally important that we  avoid  wrongful

conviction of innocent people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank Mr Thomas for his support of

the  Bill.   He had two questions.  First, whether this  Bill

would  enable  us  to request mutual assistance  from   other

countries  in tackling offences on trafficking in  women  and

children.   Upon  perusing the list of offences  namely,  the

list  in  the CDSA, I note some of these offences are clearly

listed,   such   as   offences  relating   to   prostitution,

trafficking in women and girls, importation of women or girls

by  false  pretences,  causing and encouraging  prostitution,

intercourse with indecent assaults.  They are covered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point is whether the Bill also enables mutual

assistance  in prosecuting unscrupulous foreign  agents  with

respect to foreign illegal workers.  My quick perusal of  the

list  does  not show that this specific offence  is  covered.

Why?  I think the answer is that our Penal Code and our other

legislation  have  hundreds of offences.   Usually,  when  we

devise  a  list of offences for the purposes of  extradition,

confiscation  orders or mutual assistance, we  will  have  to

narrow  them  down to offences which are very  likely  to  be

considered as serious offences in other countries.  This does

not  mean that we view the offence of exploitation of workers

by foreign employment agencies to be any less serious, but we

have  to be selective.  I think not all other countries  view

the  problem with the same gravity as Singapore.  So they may

not  list  it as an extraditable offence or as an offence  in

their mutual legal assistance.  Of course, these matters  are

not  cast  in  stone.  Situations may vary.   More  and  more

countries may face the same problem and it could well be that

this  could be a candidate for mutual legal assistance  at  a

later date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.  -  [Prof. S. Jayakumar].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENTAL INVESTMENT FUND BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to establish a

Developmental  Investment  Fund to  facilitate  developmental

investments  by  the  Government.  It  also  seeks  to   make

consequential amendments to the Development Fund Act and  the

External Loans Act.



<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has identified the need to strengthen

Singapore's competitive position to meet the challenges posed

by  a  rapidly changing global competitive landscape. Towards

this  end, capabilities in the more knowledge-intensive parts

of  the value chain have to be developed. Our human resources

must   be   enhanced   and  our  science  and   technological

capabilities upgraded to allow us to achieve our objective of

becoming  an  advanced  and  globally  competitive  knowledge

economy within the next decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has, over the years, been undertaking a

host  of developmental investments aimed at enhancing, either

directly  or  indirectly,  the  economic  growth,  employment

opportunities and general welfare of Singapore. An example of

such  developmental  investments would be  the  US$1  billion

Technopreneurship  Investment Fund (TIF) announced  in  April

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, only investments made with the primary

purpose  of  deriving  some interest, income  or  profit  are

permissible under the Financial Procedure Act. As  a  result,

investments  with developmental objectives such  as  the  TIF

have  to be funded under the Development Budget and therefore

treated  under  the  Government's cash accounting  system  as

expenditure, rather than investments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has thus decided to establish a new fund,

the   Developmental   Investment  Fund   (DIF)   to   finance

developmental  investments. This would allow  the  investment

nature  of  these developmental investments  to  be  properly

reflected.  The investments will not be treated  as  straight

expenditure,  which  would be the  case  if  the  investments

continue  to  be  funded through the Development  Fund.  This

would  allow the better accounting and management  of  public

moneys invested by the Government for developmental purposes.

The  DIF  will  be limited to investments where  returns  are

clearly required and expected. Normal development expenditure

and  development loans will continue to be funded through the

Development Fund.



<br><br><i>Specific provisions of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now proceed to explain the specific key

provisions of the Bill, which are:



<br><br><i>Clause 3: Sources of funds for the DIF</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DIF shall receive capital sums mainly out of

transfers  from the Consolidated Fund which are  approved  by

Parliament, or through loan proceeds.



<br><br><i>Clause 4: Purposes of the DIF</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DIF can only be used to form companies, acquire

securities   in   public  authorities  and  corporations   or

otherwise  invest,  for any developmental  purposes.  Section

7(3)  of  the Financial Procedure Act will not apply  to  the

developmental investments made under the DIF.



<br><br><i>Clauses 5 and 6: Responsibility for the DIF</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general responsibility for the DIF will rest with

the  Minister  for Finance. Other Ministers may  be  assigned

responsibility over accounts within the DIF, but the Minister

for  Finance will remain overall responsible for the control,

supervision and management of the DIF. All the Ministers will

have  to  establish  and  adhere to investment  policies  and

standards  that  a reasonable prudent person would  adopt  to

reduce risk, ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



reasonable   returns   and   the  achievement   of   specific

developmental objectives.



<br><br><i>Clause 10: Raising of loans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance will be empowered under the DIF

Act  to raise loans of a sum not exceeding in the whole  S$10

billion.   Parliament  may  by  resolution,  and   with   the

President's concurrence for the resolution, raise  this  loan

limit.



<br><br><i>Clause 18: Financial Statements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual financial statements of the DIF will have to be

prepared at the end of each financial year, and submitted  to

the  Auditor-General.  The audited financial  statements  and

auditor's report will be presented to Parliament.



<br><br><i>Clause 21: Consequential Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes the following consequential

amendments  to the Development Fund Act (Chapter  80  of  the

<br><br>1995&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised Edition) and the External Loans Act (Chapter 102

of the 1985 Revised Edition):



<br><br><i>Amendment  to the Schedule to the Development Fund Act  (Cap.80)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amendment, investments in securities for

developmental purposes will cease to be annually appropriated

from  the Development Fund by Parliament as expenditure in  a

Supply  or  Supplementary  Supply  Bill.   Funding  for  such

activities  will  instead be met from the  new  Developmental

Investment Fund.



<br><br><i>Amendment to the External Loans Act (Cap. 102)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment will allow loans to be raised outside

Singapore for purposes of the Developmental Investment Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would just like to have some

clarification from the Minister.  Would the Minister  explain

what does he mean by "developmental purpose"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



and  what  sort  of investment is considered  investment  for

developmental purpose?



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> As I have explained, we have

special funds assigned to the Economic Development Board, the

Cluster   Development   Fund,   and   the   Technopreneurship

Investment  Fund.  These are monies invested in companies  or

individuals which have a purpose of developing new industries

or  new  companies to generate future profits for  Singapore.

These  are  monies  which will be spent for  the  purpose  of

developing  a  particular  activity  which  is  expected   to

generate returns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the normal Development Fund in our Budget, the

development  expenditures would be monies which are  expensed

in  the  current  year,  like  expenditures  in  building  up

infrastructure, buildings and so forth which have  value  but

not spent specifically for purposes of generating profit.  So

we   want   to   separate  the  two  types   of   development

expenditures.   The  development  investment  type  would  be

financed over a period of time depending on the nature of the

activity.   On  the other hand, development  expenditure  for

basic infrastructure, such as monies spent on reclamation  of

the foreshores of Jurong Island, is expected to provide basic

infrastructure for use in Singapore in the future  and  these

would  be  charged against the development fund and  expensed

the year in which it is spent.  That is the basic difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> A further clarification. In other

words,  we  would be expecting a reasonable return  from  the

developmental investment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes, indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>2.24 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Trade Unions Act (Cap 333) and its Regulations

provide  for  the  registration  of  trade  unions  and   the

regulation  of their activities, including prudent management

of  union  funds  and  the free and fair  election  of  union

officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill before the House today

seeks to amend the Trade Unions Act to improve and update its

provisions  so  that  unions can carry out  their  roles  and

responsibilities  more efficiently.  The amendments  and  new

provisions  in  the Bill will enhance unions' decision-making

procedures   to  enable  delegates  in  unions   with   large

membership  to  make prompt decisions and  also  ensure  that

union  appointments  will better safeguard  the  interest  of

members.   Recognising  the  widespread  use  of  Information

Technology,  provisions  will also be  introduced  to  enable

trade   union   records  to  be  submitted   and   maintained

electronically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last major review of the Act was carried out in

1982.   The  1982 amendment created the framework  for  trade

unions  to  play a more constructive role by working  closely

with  employers  and the Government towards  the  raising  of

productivity and the promotion of economic growth.  This  has

benefited   our  workers,  employers  and  the   economy   of

Singapore.   The  active  engagement  of  trade   unions   in

strengthening  our  economic  competitiveness   has   brought

enormous  benefits to workers and contributed to  their  high

standard of living and a better quality of life.



<br><br><i>Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill, 2000</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The views of the National Trades Union Congress and the

Singapore National Employers' Federation have been sought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



and, where appropriate, they have been incorporated into  the

amendments in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the details of the proposed amendments are covered

in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill.  I will now address

the key features of the Bill.



<br><br><i>Delegates System</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the delegates system. Sir, the trade

union movement in Singapore has bucked the worldwide trend of

declining union membership by being able to maintain a steady

growth in membership throughout the years.  Over the last  10

years,  union membership rose from 212,874 in 1989 to 289,707

in 1999, an increase of 36%. This increase did not come about

by  chance.  The trade union movement under the leadership of

the  National Trades Union Congress works very hard to ensure

that  it  stays relevant to meet the changing  needs  of  the

workforce,  and  to  recruit and retain members  through  its

vigorous recruitment campaigns.  Smaller unions have reviewed

their  ability to expand membership and to serve the changing

expectations  and  needs of members.  Many  have  decided  to

merge  with  other  unions to achieve critical  mass  and  be

transformed into more effective organisations to better serve

the  needs of their members.  For example, the merger of  the

Jurong  Shipyard Employees Union and Shipbuilding and  Marine

Engineering   Employees  Union.   As   companies   merge   or

restructure  to enhance their competitiveness,  their  unions

will  also  have to take similar actions.  For example,  when

the  Post  Office Savings Bank was merged with DBS, the  Post

Office Savings Bank Employees Union and the Development  Bank

of Singapore Staff Union merged into one union. This trend of

mergers  is  likely to continue in order to expand membership

base and to better serve workers in related industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions with large membership often provide in

their  union  rules  for the delegates to decide  on  various

matters, as it would be inefficient and cumbersome for  every

such decision to be taken by all the members. These delegates

are elected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



by  the  members of their union through a democratic  process

and  have  the  confidence  of  members  to  safeguard  their

interest and well being.  In these unions, decisions such  as

the  election  of  union officers and the amendments  to  the

union rules are taken by the delegates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larger trade unions face administrative difficulties in

the  implementation of existing sections 33, 34  and  section

47(2)  of the Act.  Under these provisions, the trade  unions

are required to seek the consent of their union members on  a

change  in  the name of the trade union, which is covered  by

section  33; amalgamation with other registered trade unions,

which is covered by section 34, and the change in the use  of

union  funds, which is covered by section 47(2). There is  no

provision  in the law to allow decisions on these matters  to

be  made by the delegates.  In other words, the existing  law

requires  that  these  three areas be  decided  upon  by  the

general membership of each trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the system of empowering delegates to make decisions

on  other  affairs has worked well, we propose to extend  the

delegates'  power  to include decisions in  the  three  areas

which  I  have just mentioned.  Hence, clause 2 of  the  Bill

provides for a delegate system, including the definition of a

"delegate" and how "requisite consent" can be sought to allow

the  delegates  to make decisions on such  matters.   When  a

decision  is  made  by  the delegates, the  number  of  union

members  involved  in the process would  inevitably  be  much

smaller  than  having  to convene a general  meeting  of  the

members of the unions.  Hence, it would not be too onerous on

the  trade  unions  to  require two-thirds  majority  when  a

decision is made through a vote by their delegates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, clause 8 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts

sections 33 and 34 of the Trade Unions Act to allow  a  trade

union  to  seek the requisite consent from its  delegates  to

change  its name or to amalgamate with other unions.  Clauses

9 and 12 will introduce consequential amendments arising from

the  introduction of the new provision to allow decisions  to

be taken by delegates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are similar provisions in clause 2 of the Bill

governing decisions made in these areas by a person,  who  is

elected  or appointed as a delegate to attend and vote  at  a

meeting  of a federation, on behalf of any of the constituent

trade unions.



<br><br><i>Appointment of Union Officers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the years many trade unions have

built  up  strong financial reserves as a result  of  prudent

investments of surplus union funds in union co-operatives and

other  investments  that  are  authorised  by  law  for   the

investment of trust money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade union funds and assets actually belong to the

members  of  the trade unions and it is important  that  they

continue  to be managed prudently by officers of the  unions.

It  will  therefore  not  be desirable  for  an  undischarged

bankrupt  to become a union officer and manage the  financial

affairs of the union.  Clause 7 of the Bill amends section 30

of  the  Trade  Unions  Act  to  disqualify  an  undischarged

bankrupt from acting as a union officer.



<br><br><i>Appointment of Union Trustees</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, all union properties, either movable or

immovable,  have to be controlled and vested in the  trustees

for the use and benefit of the union and its members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment or election of the trustees and the

filling of these vacancies are determined by the union rules.

As unions accumulate financial reserves and other assets, the

responsibilities  of  union  trustees  have  become  heavier.

Clause  13 of the Bill amends section 43 of the Trade  Unions

Act  to  disqualify  an undischarged bankrupt  and  a  person

convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty or  any

other  offence, which renders him unfit from  being  a  union

trustee.  We should ensure that only persons of unimpeachable

character and integrity hold such important position  in  the

unions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Freeze on Union Funds</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the existing Act, the Minister is empowered

to  direct  in  writing  a freeze on union  funds  during  an

investigation by a public authority into the improper use  or

misapplication  of the funds of a trade union  under  section

16.   However,  the  existing provision does  not  take  into

consideration   funds  that  are  kept  in  other   financial

institution besides banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill addresses this inadequacy by

amending  section 16 of the Act to replace  the  word  "bank"

with  the words "financial institution".  The term "financial

institution"  has  been defined to mean "a  bank,  a  finance

company  or any co-operative society carrying on the business

of  managing and investing funds."  It will ensure that  when

the  situation  calls for a freeze, all of a  union's  assets

will be protected.



<br><br><i>Purchase of Land and Building</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 46 of the Trade Unions Act allows a trade union

to purchase or lease in its trustees' name any land exceeding

4,047  square  metres in size provided it  has  obtained  the

approval  of  the  Minister.  There is no  compelling  reason

today for us to restrict purchases of land based on its plot-size.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, clause 14 of the Bill will repeal and re-enact

section  46  of  the  Act  to  remove  the  requirement   for

Minister's approval in the purchase of land where  the  plot-size  exceeds 4,047 square metres.  It will also allow  trade

unions  to  purchase  or lease any land or  building  outside

Singapore  provided  the  union has  obtained  the  requisite

consent of its members or delegates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for the union to obtain a clear mandate

before  the  purchase  of  an overseas  property  as  such  a

purchase  may carry a certain amount of risk due to  economic

and  political  uncertainties  apart  from  foreign  exchange

fluctuations.



<br><br><i>Application of Union Funds</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, section 47 of the Act prohibits a union

from using money received from its members or (in the case



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



of  a federation) its constituent trade unions, for a purpose

other  than the purpose for which it is given.  Clause 15  of

the  Bill amends section 47 of the Act to provide that it can

do  so where the requisite consent has been obtained from its

members or delegates.  This will provide greater scope for  a

union  to  utilise  its  reserves  without  compromising  the

interest of its members.



<br><br><i>Penalties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it may sound a bit jarring in the light

of  peaceful industrial relations climate and the  close  co-operation prevailing between the tripartite partners, namely,

the  trade union representing the workers, employers and  the

Government, for us to talk about enhancing penalties  imposed

under  the  Trade Unions Act.  However, we feel  that  it  is

timely  for  a thorough review so that the penalties  imposed

under the Act would reflect the severity of the offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have lived through the difficult periods of

the  50s  and  60s would recall that strikes  were  prevalent

then.   This  resulted in the loss of thousands of  otherwise

productive  man-days.   The  social  disorder  crippled   the

economy   and  caused  tremendous  hardship  to  the  people.

Although  we have been almost strike-free for more  than  two

decades,  we  should constantly guard against this  brand  of

trade unionism so as to avoid its damaging effects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties imposed under the Act had remained

unchanged for many years and are now no longer comparable  to

those  for offences of a similar nature found in other  laws.

Take,  for  example, the offence under section 27(3)  of  the

Trade Unions Act where any union member who takes part in  an

illegal  industrial action shall be guilty of an offence  and

shall  on  conviction  be fined a sum not  exceeding  $1,000.

This  offence is no less severe when compared to the  offence

under  section  5(1) of the Trade Disputes  Act  (Cap.  331).

Under  this provision, ie, the Trade Disputes Act, any person

who participates in an illegal industrial action can be fined

a sum not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



exceeding  six  months  or  to both.   So  you  can  see  the

discrepancy  -  a  union member taking  part  in  an  illegal

industrial  action  only  faces a penalty  of  a  maximum  of

$1,000, whereas any other worker, meaning a non-union member,

who  takes  part in an industrial dispute illegally  faces  a

much  more severe penalty which may or may not include a term

of   imprisonment.   Hence,  we  have  to  rationalise  these

differences.   Clause 6 of the Bill therefore  increases  the

fine  for  this  offence  from  $1,000  to  $2,000  and  also

increases  the fines for other offences under section  27  of

the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, clauses 10, 16 and 18 to 21 of the Bill seek

to  increase the amount of fines spelt out in sections 37, 53

and 56 to 59 of the Act respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 of the Bill introduces a new section to grant

discretionary  powers to the Registrar  to  accept  from  any

person  or the trade union reasonably suspected of committing

an  offence a compound fine for a sum not exceeding $200  for

every  offence.  The offences where a compound  fine  can  be

imposed will be prescribed by regulations.



<br><br><i>Electronic Register and Electronic Filing of Documents</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 7 of the Trade Unions Act, the Registrar

of  Trade Unions is required to maintain a register of  trade

unions.  Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 7 of the Act  to

enable the written copy of the register to be replaced by  an

electronic register kept on the computer.  For the purpose of

maintaining   and  updating  the  electronic  register,   the

Registrar may call for information that is deemed necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 of the Bill seeks to amend section 55 of the

Trade  Unions Act to empower the Minister to make regulations

to  allow  for  the  manner  in  which  applications,  forms,

notices,  requests or returns required under the Act  can  be

filed  electronically.  It will also provide for the  payment

of  the prescribed statutory fees by electronic means.   This

amendment  will facilitate the submission of such information

by electronic means and enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



unions to move to a paperless mode of record keeping.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the amendments proposed in the Bill

will  ensure  that  the  Trade Unions Act  will  continue  to

promote the development of an effective and responsible trade

union movement in Singapore.  They will also enable our trade

unions  to  respond  to  changing  environment  and  to  take

advantage of information technology to better meet the  needs

of their members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, over the past one year, from the newspapers and

the  television, we read and heard a lot of news of companies

involved in mergers,  restructuring or  buying over.    These

mergers, restructuring and buying over  will affect not  only

the  workers  but  also the structure and operations  of  the

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past one year, many trade unions were also

amalgamated or in the process of amalgamation.  As a  result,

these unions will have to change their names to reflect their

new  status,  otherwise  the  old  names  may  no  longer  be

relevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the NTUC supports this amendment,

particularly the repeal and re-enactment of sections  33  and

34  of  the Trade Unions Act.  Under the existing provisions,

the  consent  of  two-thirds of the total membership  of  the

union  is  required  if it wants to change  its  name.   Just

imagine,  if  you have a union with 6,000 members,  you  will

need  to  have 4,000 members voting in favour of the proposed

change.  With so many workers needed to go to the ballot, the

factories  may  have to shut down, and many production  hours

will  be  lost.  At the same time, if the unions were  to  be

amalgamated,  you need 50% of the members to vote,  of  which

60% must vote in favour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



So  if you have 6,000 members, you would need 3,000 people to

vote. This is certainly a waste of resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many unions have adopted the delegates

conference   system   whereby  the   ordinary   members   are

represented  by  their branch leaders  as  delegates  in  the

unions'  conferences where resolutions can be carried   by  a

simple majority for decisions to be made.  As such, with  the

new  sections  33  and  34,  the delegates  can   attend  the

meetings on behalf of the general members, and decisions such

as  amalgamation or change of name can be made  by  a  simple

majority of votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 43 of the principal Act

concerns the appointment of the trustees of trade unions.  We

all  know  that  the  trustees of the trade  unions  have  to

safeguard  not only the interest of the workers but  also  to

protect   the  assets  of  the  trade  unions.   Under   this

amendment, undischarged bankrupts are not  allowed to  become

trustees.   The National Trades Union Congress supports  this

amendment. I do not think anyone would oppose this amendment.

Those  who  are undischarged bankrupts are unable to  resolve

their own financial problems.  How would they be in the right

frame  of  mind  to safeguard and protect the assets  of  the

union?   In  addition,  under the amendment, anyone  who  has

been  convicted of an offence involving fraud  or  dishonesty

shall  be  disqualified as a trustee of the  union.  This  is

obvious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC supports the spirit of this amendment because

firstly  it  safeguards the assets of the trade  unions  and,

secondly, it upholds the reputation of the union leaders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

present,  undischarged bankrupts can  hold  office  in  trade

unions.   Apart from the requirement of age and  nationality,

the  only  other restriction imposed on any office holder  is

that  he  should  not  have  any prior  criminal  conviction,

especially  those  involving  criminal  breach  of  trust  or

criminal intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendment of sections 30 and 43 to

disqualify  undischarged bankrupts  from  holding  office  in

trade unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



or being appointed as trustees to the union.  This is in line

with  other  legislation, such as the Companies Act  and  the

Societies  Act,  which impose similar restriction  on  office

bearers.   Our  trade union movement supports this  amendment

which  arose  partly because of our own request made  in  the

past.  It gives greater protection of trade union funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the current provision, any union that wishes

to  buy  or  lease any land which is more than  4,047  square

metres  must  first obtain the consent of  the  Minister  for

Manpower.   With  the new amendment, there is no  restriction

imposed  on unions on the purchase or lease of local land  of

any  size.   However,  for  purchase  or  lease  of  overseas

property,  the consent of the union members or  delegates  is

now  required.  Although this is a new restriction,  it  will

accord  better  protection  to members  from  risky  overseas

investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the labour movement, I also welcome the

amendment  on  change in application of  union  funds.   This

amendment  allows the trade unions to use the money  received

from  compulsory contributions for purposes other than  those

originally intended.  To make such a change, unions need only

to  seek the consent of their delegates, instead of having to

get  all  members'  consent as is currently  provided.   This

amendment  was  made  at  the  request  of  NTUC  as  it   is

administratively more convenient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also allows unions to change their

financial year to coincide with the calendar year rather than

stick rigidly to the current financial year from 1st April to

31st  March.  The labour movement supports this change as  it

affords more flexibility into the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also allows for the register of trade

unions to be kept and maintained in an electronic form.   The

labour  movement supports the change as this facilitates  the

global  trend  towards data entry and captured in  electronic

form rather than in paper form only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the review of penalties is long overdue as the

existing fines imposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



have  not been reviewed for more than 30 years.  However,  by

looking  at purely the rate of increase, which in some  cases

by  100%,  it is a significant jump.  And I hope the Minister

could clarify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, these proposed amendments

merely make technical modification to refine the system.   It

provides  greater flexibility for unions with  these  changes

and should therefore be supported.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take

the Chair again at 3.15 pm.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><h4>TRADE UNIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, this Bill updates the regulation

of  trade  unions.  I agree with the Minister that this  Bill

will  make  it easier for unions to operate.  Unionists  must

therefore  welcome  the amendments as they  reflect  changing

times and ensure the quality of the movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of changing times are the use of IT to maintain

records  and  union register; reflecting the  new  investment

climate  of opportunities in the greater flexibility  in  the

application  of union funds, more leeway in the  purchase  of

land  and building; and also to make it easier for unions  to

change  names or amalgamate, just as corporations  do.   This

Bill will enable unions to respond more quickly to changes in

their operating environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also support the increase in fines, because it

also reflects changing times, and it is just like keeping  up

with  times.  The quality of the movement would also  improve

the  imposition of additional disqualifications on those  who

want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



hold  union  office  or  become trustees.  I  do  not  intend

specifically  to go through the details of the Bill,  because

it was adequately covered by the previous two Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation has increased the power of management

relative  to  labour on a world scale.  Management  seems  to

have more options whilst labour has a smaller voice globally.

Unless  trade  unions can remain an effective voice  for  the

small  man, frustration in the workplace can threaten  social

cohesion  in the long run.  Strong trade unions are therefore

good  for the country.  In this context, I wish to thank  the

Minister for acknowledging the contribution of unions in  the

economic and social progress of Singapore, as well as  saying

that in the long run, he supports the growth of a responsible

and  strong  trade union movement in Singapore.  I  therefore

support  these  moves that would strengthen the  trade  union

movement  and  therefore also support the amendments  in  the

Bill.   However, my only complaint is that I wish there  were

more   amendments,  which  reflect  the  changing  employment

patterns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, a "normal" employment relationship involved

a full-time job with a specific employer and usually had some

long-term stability.  We saw attempts in the past to  promote

company   loyalty,  a  closer  nexus  between   workers   and

employers, and even a shared common destiny. Therefore,  this

"normal"  worker was also a normal union member or  a  normal

potential union member, and he was a full-time employee whose

employment relationship was not casual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, things have changed so much. It is recognised

that atypical employment situations are increasingly becoming

typical.   Part-time work, short-term and casual  employment,

agency  work, self-employment, work from home, contract  work

and, of course, unemployment, are all now more common.  Down-sizing  and  structural shifts in sectoral  and  occupational

distribution, changing technologies and increased use  of  IT

have added to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



these  changes.  The net result is increased uncertainty  and

ambiguity for the worker.  The contract of service, which  is

used in the Trade Unions Act, to define a worker is more  and

more  being  substituted in the workplace with  contract  for

service,  as employers seek to lower cost with less manpower,

to  save  on  CPF  contributions, fringe benefits  and  other

benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to illustrate this point. The New York Times of

16th  February carried an article entitled "Who is the  boss?

Who  is a worker?", reported some interesting cases. One  was

of  temporary workers successfully suing and getting benefits

of  full-time  workers. Another was that the New  York  State

Attorney-General is trying to force Manhattan food stalls  to

pay  minimum  wage to delivery people employed  from  another

company.   There is even debate on whether health and  safety

standards  for  offices should apply to home offices.   These

cases, as illustrated, show that United States laws have  not

kept up with changes in the workplace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore too, there are many workers with a contract

for  service instead of a contract of service working for one

employer. The work they do can be considered an integral part

of  the  business  and  the employer is able  to  discipline,

dismiss and give them incentives.  In the United States, non-governmental organisations, with the support of trade unions,

are  emerging  as  champions for  the  cause  of  workers  in

atypical  employment.   The  question  I  ask  is:   who   in

Singapore  should  represent this growing group  of  workers?

Should  they  bring their problems to Court  and  let  Judges

decide?   In  that  case, do we want to see  an  increase  in

litigation,  or  do  we want to see NGOs agitating  on  their

behalf?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all these, I would therefore like to ask the

Minister  to  take some proactive steps to enable  the  trade

union  movement to cover this type of workers.   By  bringing

them within our existing industrial relations system, it will

reduce  social  tensions and enhance  social  cohesion.  This

would  also  ensure  that our tripartite  system,  which  has

served us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



very  well  in  the  past, will stand the test  of  time  and

continue  to  serve  in the best interests  of  workers,  the

employers and their unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I join

my former colleagues from NTUC in supporting this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister had pointed out earlier, a major review

of  the  Trade Unions Act was carried out way back  in  1982.

Although  this  Bill should have been introduced  some  years

ago,  it  is,  nevertheless, timely  that  the  Ministry  has

brought to the fore some major amendments to the Trade Unions

Act,  especially  because in the last few years,  there  have

been  significant  changes and this changed circumstances  in

the administration of trade unions in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to touch on two or three key points in

this  amendment Bill. First, the delegate system, as  pointed

out  in sections 33 and 34.  As Mr Seng Han Thong has pointed

out,  many unions, for many years now, have been facing  this

problem   of   having   annual  ordinary   members   meeting,

particularly unions like AUPE, UWEEI, SMMWU, SEAHSU and  many

others.   They have as many as 30,000 members,  and  to  have

30,000  members to come for a meeting is an impossible  thing

in  Singapore.  Even the World Trade Centre conference  halls

cannot hold these people.  Therefore, they had to work within

their  union  constitution to come  out  with  this  delegate

system,  and  I  am  very  pleased  that  the  Ministry   now

recognises  this  delegate system and has actually  empowered

more provisions through this delegate system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking broadly, globally there have been tremendous

changes,  particularly  in  the  corporate  world  -  company

globalisation, corporate restructuring, together with some of

the  changes  in  Singapore, for example, corporatisation  of

statutory  boards  and other Government  bodies,  going  from

corporatisation to privatisation like PSA. All these have led

to  major  impacts on the way the unions organise  themselves

and  has therefore made it a necessity to have a major  union

restructuring through either dissolution of some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



of  the  older unions, or having amalgamation of unions,  new

statutory board employee unions and also the registration  of

new unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore appropriate that the delegate system is

being  recognised  and extended to simplify  vote  taking  by

allowing decisions on the change of union names, amalgamation

of  unions  and in the change of use of union  funds.   I  am

confident that the larger unions particularly will find  this

a more efficient and effective means for decision-making.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question I have in this regard to ask the

Minister is:  why is there a provision to say that there is a

need  for  a two-thirds vote delegate system, while a  simple

majority  is  needed  for an ordinary  members'  meeting?   I

recognise  that  it  is  a form of safeguard,  especially  in

today's context where most unions are well-run, but you never

know  something in the future.  But I want to know  why  this

magic number of two-thirds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, all these changes have come about

because of the changing corporate manpower landscape  due  to

globalisation, technology and corporate restructuring and  so

on.  But these changes and response, while it is necessary, I

think  it  is  not  sufficient.  I  feel  that  corresponding

changes  that relate to the unionisation of a wider range  of

employees  to join rank-and-file unions may be necessary  and

the  Nominated  Member of Parliament, Mr Thomas  Thomas,  has

touched  on  this  point.   I think  the  Ministry  needs  to

examine,   for  example,  section  16(3)  of  the  Industrial

Relations  Act  and look at a major review of  this  section.

And the reason is as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Thomas has pointed out, changing job designations,

job  re-designs,  job enrichment and many other  changes  for

employees necessitate a complete review as to who  can  be  a

union  member. Sir, with the advent of the knowledge economy,

or  knowledge-based economy, as we call it in  Singapore,  it

has blurred the distinction between a worker and a manager in

today's context.  I remember the Trade and Industry Minister,

BG



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



George  Yeo,  had  some two or three years  ago,  at  a  NTUC

Ordinary  Delegates Conference, made a keynote  address.   He

had  said  that in the knowledge economy, everyone, including

managers,  and  even  the CEO, is a  knowledge  worker.   So,

everyone is a worker.  So, who can join a union?  And in this

context  of a rapidly changing knowledge economy, and  it  is

something  that  we ourselves are very much involved  through

Singapore 21 and many of the moves that Dr Tony Tan  and  his

committee are looking at, we would certainly need to take  it

a  step to the unions to see how union membership has  to  be

extended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may still sound like a unionist who had spoken

for  workers  many  times in this House, though  I  have  now

returned back to the corporate world.  This is because of the

impact  that  NTUC had made on me during my  stint  there,  a

certain  sense of passion for helping workers and unions.   I

want  to  use my personal experience, both in the  union  and

management, to contribute in whatever small way to building a

stronger tripartite model in the new knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I want to make here is that union

membership  and  collective  bargaining  rules  have  to   be

revamped  in  this context, and union membership  has  to  be

broadened   through  legislation,  not  just  by  convenience

through  union constitutions or rules.  I therefore call  for

further  amendments to the Trade Unions Act, as well  as  the

Industrial Relations Act, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember some years ago, the Secretary-General of NTUC

had made this call to broaden union membership by proposing a

80-20  rule,  meaning that in any organisation,  80%  of  the

employees  should be unionised.  This point has been  brought

up many, many times in various forums where even the Minister

himself  was present and he felt at that point of  time  that

there  was no need to legislate.  But some years have  passed

and I think with these amendments and with the change that is

taking place in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



economy, I think it is time to look at the legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move on to some other amendment in

this  Bill   -   purchase of property.  Section 46  has  been

repealed and re-enacted to give greater flexibility to  trade

unions  to  directly purchase properties  while  also  making

possible  for  decision making through the  delegate  system.

This  change  will  certainly be welcomed by  the  unions,  I

believe,  for at least two reasons.  Firstly, it  gives  them

the   direct  opportunity  to  own  and  develop  their   own

buildings,  to  give  unions a status  symbol  and  a  public

recognition that they truly deserve.  Secondly, it also gives

all  their members more facilities within their own  premises

for  their  members  and  their  members'  families  to  use.

Therefore,  it  takes  away the need to  work  through  other

labour institutions or labour foundations to achieve this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, in conclusion, I am generally pleased with

the  amendments put forth by the Minister for Manpower on the

Trade  Unions  (Amendment) Bill, though I feel  more  can  be

done.   Some time ago, I made a call to the then Ministry  of

Labour,  the  new Ministry of Manpower, to play a  more  pre-eminent role in labour related issues as NTUC had done.  I am

very  happy to note and acknowledge that during the past year

or   so,   the  Ministry  of  Manpower  has  launched   major

initiatives and charted new directions for Singapore  through

Manpower  21  and Construction 21 and many other  initiatives

like  that.   These have become blueprints for  our  workers'

future  and  for  the  future of all  Singaporeans.   Sir,  I

congratulate the Minister and the Permanent Secretary and his

team for a job well done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

just  one  simple  clarification to seek from  the  Minister.

This  is  on  the  amendment to section 43.   This  amendment

excluded  two classes of individuals from holding  office  of

trustee   of  a  trade  union.   One  group  is  undischarged

bankrupts.   The  second  group is individuals  convicted  of

fraud, dishonesty or any other offence which the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



considers  them unfit to be a trustee.  Yet, for  the  second

group of individuals, there is a clause which says, "with the

approval  of the Minister."  My question to the Minister  is:

why  are  undischarged bankrupts considered more  undesirable

than  other  individuals who have been  convicted  of  fraud,

dishonesty  or other offences which render them unfit  to  be

trustees?

<div align="center"><b>TRADE UNIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like

to  thank all the Members who have spoken, in particular,  Mr

Seng  Han  Thong,  Mr  Yeo  Guat  Kwang,  Mr  Thomas  and  Mr

Sinnakaruppan,  for their strong support  of  the  amendments

introduced in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said in my Second Reading speech, this Bill

had  gone  through  a  long process of  discussion  with  the

National  Trades  Union Congress and the  Singapore  National

Employers' Federation.  So it is not a unilateral decision on

the  part  of  the  Ministry to make these  amendments.   The

amendments were arrived at after a thorough discussion and in

consultation  with  all  the parties  that  are  involved  in

forging  a stronger, more cooperative, more productive,  more

fruitful industrial relations in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked for some clarifications with

regard  to the penalties.  He generally supported the  review

of  penalties.  He said that the review of penalties is  long

overdue, but he saw the increases in some cases going  up  to

100%  and  he  felt that there is a need to  clarify  why  we

actually have to make such a steep increase in the penalties.

Let me reiterate that most of these penalties in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



the  existing  Act were set long ago, even  before  the  1982

review  of  the present Trade Unions Act.  Some of them  date

back  to  1952.  I have given an example in my Second Reading

speech   about   union  members  participating   in   illegal

industrial  action  paying a much  smaller  fine  of  $1,000,

compared  to  another  worker  who  participates  in  illegal

industrial action and being charged under the Trade  Disputes

Act having to pay a much heavier fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members some other examples of why this long

overdue  review of penalties justifies raising some penalties

by  more than 100%.  For example, the penalty of giving false

information  relating  to  trade  unions.    This  is   under

existing section 53(6).  It is a fine not exceeding  $200  or

an  imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both

fine  and imprisonment, in other words, basically, $200  fine

and  maybe  imprisonment.  But in the case  of  the  existing

Societies  Act, the fine for furnishing false information  is

$1,000.   In the case of the Employment Act, an employer  who

furnishes  false information would be subjected to a  maximum

fine  of $1,000 and/or up to six months of imprisonment.   In

the  case  of the Factories Act, a similar offence of  giving

false  information carries a maximum fine of $2,000 and/or  6

months of imprisonment.  So we have to look at the review  of

the  fines  in totality of the legal framework.  We  have  to

look  at  other legislation and see what level of  fines  are

being  imposed, and not just look at a particular offence  in

the Trade Unions Act and see whether this penalty of $200 has

now   been  increased,  as  in  the  case  of  giving   false

information.   We are proposing under clause  16(c)  of  this

Bill  to  raise the fine from $200 to $2,000.  It looks  like

percentage-wise, it is a very steep increase indeed,  but  we

have  to look at it historically.  The $200 fine was set  way

back  in  the  50s  and today, the overall  climate  and  the

overall  level  of fines in other legislation  would  justify

such  an  increase to $2,000 for giving false information  to

the Registrar of Trade Unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas supported the amendment including the increase

in fines which reflects the changing times.  I agree with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



him.   That  was  what I have just been explaining.   But  he

asked  whether  we  could, in fact, make more  amendments  in

order  to  widen the reach of the Trade Unions Act,  a  point

which  Mr  Sinnakaruppan also made.  Specifically, Mr  Thomas

mentioned that in the past the trade unions drew its  members

from  the  pool  of  perhaps  mainly  full-time  blue  collar

workers,  and  this is changing.  There is  emerging  in  the

workforce  part-time workers and there is  increasing  highly

skilled  technical  and  also more white  collar  work  being

generated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that there is a change in workers'

profile.   As  to whether we should, in fact, now  widen  the

Trade  Unions  Act to cover non-employees,  in  other  words,

people who are not working under a contract of service,  this

is  something that at this juncture, we feel that it has  not

reached  the  stage  and it is not necessary  to  extend  the

coverage  in this manner.  The Trade Unions Act will,  as  it

stands,  cover persons who work under a contract of  service.

In   other   words,   there  is  a  direct  employer/employee

relationship.   Mr   Thomas referred to a group  of  contract

workers because companies are increasingly out-sourcing  some

of  their  services to outside providers  of  labour.   While

there is no existing contract of service relation between the

worker  and  the  ultimate employer,  there  may  well  be  a

contract  of  service relation between  the  worker  and  the

organisation  that provides the out-source service.   So,  in

fact, such workers can also be covered if they have an actual

contract  of  service  with  their  employers  in  the  first

instance.   It  is  not  as  if  this  group  of  workers  is

completely omitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on part-time workers. Part-time

workers  can also become union members, as long as they  have

an  actual contract of service.  For instance, there are many

part-time  workers in the catering and food service industry.

There  are  part-time workers in the departmental stores  and

supermarkets.  There are even part-time workers in hospitals.

As long as they have a contract of service, there is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



employer  and employee relationship between the employer  and

the  worker, they come under the ambit of the existing  Trade

Unions  Act,  and they can become a full member  of  a  trade

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan's point is about expanding the outreach

and  who  can be a member.  The answer is that, in fact,  all

workers,  as  I have just explained, who have a  contract  of

service  with  the employer can be a union member,  and  that

covers nearly everyone, including executives.  Executives can

become members of a trade union.  The only restriction is the

restriction  which  exists in the Industrial  Relations  Act,

which  seeks to avoid a conflict of interest where executives

or management staff of a company join the rank-and-file union

of the same company.  In fact, executives can all form unions

of  executives  and be full members of unions of  executives.

We  have to be careful when executives join the rank-and-file

union, because there is always this potential of conflict  of

interest.   In  fact,  this is an area that  my  Ministry  is

actively studying.  We have established a committee  to  work

together  with  NTUC  and the Singapore  National  Employers'

Federation to look into how we can widen the definition,  how

we can amend section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations Act to

ensure  that  we  only exclude that group of  executives  who

genuinely face the possibility of a conflict of interest, and

that  we  do  not just bluntly exclude a large group  of  the

middle level executives from joining the rank-and-file union.

The  committee is, in fact, in progress.  They  are  studying

this  issue.   I  hope  that they will be  able  to  reach  a

consensus and make their recommendations for consideration by

my  Ministry.  And in due course, we may well have  to  amend

the Industrial Relations Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 80:20 rule, we have discussed this before. It

depends  on  the nature of work of the company.   If  we  are

talking of a company that is very labour intensive, then   it

may  well go beyond 80:20.  It may well be 90:10.  But  in  a

company   that  is  less  labour  intensive,  more  knowledge

intensive,  we may end up seeing a situation  of  40:60.   So

fixing it at 80:20 is introducing an element of rigidity,  my

view has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



been that we will continue to assist NTUC to reach out to all

workers  and companies and assist NTUC in its effort to  seek

recognition,  and  to represent as many workers  as  possible

without  having to adopt a fixed rule of whether it is  80:20

or  whatever it is.  I think we have to look at each  company

on  its own, the profile of its workforce, and therefore  try

to  recruit  as  many  of the workers  who  are  eligible  as

possible  to  join  the union, rather than  set  ourselves  a

target, which may not be representative or reflective of  the

profile of the workforce in that particular company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to refer to Dr Wang's query. This

is   clause  13  which  amends  section  43  to  exclude   an

undischarged  bankrupt from being appointed or serving  as  a

trustee  of a trade union.  In the case of a person  who  has

been  convicted of an offence, there is a provision here that

allows  the  Minister to exercise judgment.  In  some  cases,

some  people  may  have  a very old  conviction  and  in  the

intervening  years since his conviction he has shown  himself

to  be  an  honest, upright citizen, somebody  who  has  been

reformed  and who can now be trusted to serve a  trade  union

and  its  workers  in this capacity as a trustee.   It  is  a

provision  to  ensure  that we do not just  bluntly  adopt  a

position  against people who have an old criminal  conviction

for dishonesty or fraud.  So we give people a chance.  If  he

makes  a  genuine  effort to reform and  not  commit  further

offences in the intervening years, we may not want to hold it

against him, unless the offence, in the first instance, was a

very  serious  offence which raised strong doubts  about  the

person's   character.   So  we  will  need   to   have   this

flexibility, otherwise it is too rigid. Somebody with an  old

offence going back 25 years and we say, "No, you cannot be  a

trustee."  In the meantime, he has risen through his  effort.

He  has  become  a successful and prosperous businessman  and

contributed  both to union and community work.  And  now  you

say  he  cannot be a trustee because of this old offence.   I

think that will be a bit too rigid.  Whereas in the case of a

bankrupt,  of  course,  we are saying,  he  is  a  discharged

bankrupt.  The moment he has discharged his bankruptcy, he is

no longer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



caught  by  this  particular section  43(1A).   I  hope  that

clarifies the position for Dr Wang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, can I just clarify as well as

seek  clarification?   When  I  talked  about  expanding  the

definition  of  workman,  in the present  Trade  Unions  Act,

"workman" is somebody who enters or works under a service  of

contract  or  apprenticeship.  That is all.  But  before  the

1982 amendment, the definition was slightly wider.  It talked

about  any workman who had entered or worked under a contract

with  an  employer, whether the contract was  a  contract  of

service  or  a contract personally to execute any  work.   In

other  words, during those times, around 1982,  most  of  the

regular  sort of employment relationship existed  but  before

that,  there  were  many  people who were  self-employed  but

actually  worked for just one employer.  I am trying  to  say

that  in  downsizing  and outsourcing, there  are  also  many

people  who actually just work for one employer, and who  are

not  in a position of bargaining and they sometimes need  the

collective  power  of the trade unions to  ensure  a  bit  of

equity  in  the labour market.  There are such categories  of

people.   It could be the couriers and taxi drivers,  and  we

also need to reach out to those groups of people.  I ask  the

Minister  to understand this position as well as to  look  at

the law to bring these people in.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is correct that

prior to 1982, the Trade Unions Act allowed non-employees  or

the  self-employed to become members of a union.   Precisely,

this  situation  was not tenable that in  1982  the  law  was

amended to define a workman as a person who has entered  into

a contract of service with an employer regardless of how this

contract of service was written up and what are the terms. As

long  as  there is employer/employee relationship,  he  is  a

workman, he can join a union or form a union. During the 1982

debate  on the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill, the reason  was

provided for this exclusion.  I think the reason still exists

and  it  is  still  relevant in today's  situation.   In  the

absence of an employer/employee relationship, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



no   collective  bargaining  between  the  employee  and  the

employer,  between this worker who is actually a  free  agent

working on a contract for service with a particular company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas mentioned the example of a taxi driver. Who

is  the  employer in this instance?  Is it  COMFORT?   Is  it

TIBS?   There  is no employer/employee relationship  in  that

sense  because  the  taxi  driver hires  the  taxi  from  the

company.   Is the taxi driver himself an employer?  It  could

well  be, by his definition, because part of the time he gets

a relief driver to drive his taxi. So does that mean he is an

employer?  We can see that if we adopt that approach, we will

reach very difficult and unsustainable positions.  So we have

decided that, as a rule, as long as he does not have a  fixed

contract    of   service,   where   there   is    no    clear

employer/employee relationship, he should not be covered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. Even if we want to include the

self-employed, they would not be able to avail themselves  of

a  conciliation  on  any trade dispute or reference  to  IAC,

because  there is no employer/employee relationship on  which

they  can  refer  the  matter to the  Industrial  Arbitration

Court.  Each one is a free agent working on his own and  with

his  own  terms and conditions.  The employer exercises  very

little  supervision  or  disciplinary  proceedings  over  the

worker.   So it is very difficult to try to attempt to  cover

this  group.   In fact, it confers upon them no advantage  to

bring them in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in 1982, it was argued that we should exclude

them. We have since then maintained this position.  I do  not

think the situation has changed so much between 1982 and  now

that  we  should go back there and re-examine  this  area  to

bring  in the self-employed within the coverage of the  Trade

Unions Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. First, I

would like to thank the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



for  his  reply to my questions.  I am very pleased  to  hear

from  him  that  he  would look at reviewing  the  Industrial

Relations Act and that a Review Committee has been formed  in

his  Ministry.   Sir, I am, as he has said,  fully  aware  of

executive  unions and executives are able to  form  and  join

unions.  All I am saying is that because of the change in ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sinnakurappan, you are embarking on a new

speech.  Could you ask your question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> The question is this: in his Review

Committee, I would like them to consider the executives being

part of the rank and file union.  The leadership question  is

an  important question to unions because today's trade unions

in  Singapore  are  a  model for the  world  because  of  the

leadership  that we have in our unions.  I think this  should

continue  and, therefore, I would like to request  that  this

Review Committee ensures that there are sufficient executives

who are part of this rank and file union.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Precisely. In fact, the Committee

that  is  working  on it is looking at the ways  of  enabling

executives of companies to join rank and file unions.   As  I

said  earlier on, we have to address not just the concern  of

NTUC in wanting to reach out to a wider group of workers  but

also  the  concerns of employers over this potential conflict

of  interest.   The Committee will certainly consider,  where

there is no real potential for conflict of interest, allowing

executives  to  join the rank and file unions  and  even,  if

necessary, where they have sufficient support, to  serve  the

union in a leadership position.

<div align="center"><b>ENDOWMENT SCHEMES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>3.58 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has decided to introduce a new

endowment  fund  to  finance operating subsidies  to  nursing

homes  run by Voluntary Welfare Organisations, or VWOs.  This

Bill  is  to repeal the Medical Endowment Scheme Act and  re-enact  it  as the Medical and Elderly Care Endowment  Schemes

Act, to set up this new endowment fund.



<br><br><i>Need for step-down care increases as population ages</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our population is rapidly ageing. Today, we have about

220,000 people aged 65 years and above, making up about 7% of

our  population. By 2010, we will have about 312,000  elderly

persons, comprising 8% of our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most elderly persons will remain healthy and

independent. However, it is estimated that about 3% of  those

aged  65  and  above do acquire severe disabilities  and  are

unable  to  go  about their daily lives without  considerable

nursing  care, medical attention or assistance. Yet,  at  the

same time, their conditions are not severe enough for them to

be warded in acute hospitals. These elderly persons should be

looked  after in their own homes, or if residential  care  is

required, in "step-down" facilities such as nursing homes. As

our  population ages, the demand for nursing home  care  will

rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, some two-thirds of our nursing home beds are

in  VWO-run  facilities. VWO nursing homes receive assistance

from  the  community,  in  the form of  volunteers  and  cash

donations.   Community   assistance  thus   supplements   the

patients' payment for their share of the cost of care. At the

same  time, the Government also provides financial assistance

to  keep  nursing  home care affordable to those  from  lower

income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



households.  Nursing homes that are funded by Government  now

receive  capital funding of up to 90% of the cost of building

and   equipping  the  homes.  In  addition,  Government  also

provides full subsidy for land rental and input GST.  At  the

same time, Government also funds 50% of the recurrent cost of

providing  care to patients with immediate family incomes  of

less than $2,000.  Patients on public assistance receive  75%

subsidy.



<br><br><i>Higher  proportion  of  Singaporeans  will  be  eligible  for subsidy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing

Population,  in  its  report released  late  last  year,  had

recommended  that  the  Government  consider  expanding   its

operating subsidies to VWO-run nursing homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered this recommendation and

decided to implement a three-tier subsidy of 75%, 50% and 25%

for  VWO  nursing  homes this year.  The highest  quantum  of

subsidy will be given to those with the least ability to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that subsidy goes to those who most deserve

them,  the introduction of the new subsidy structure will  be

accompanied  by  refining the means  test  conducted  in  VWO

nursing  homes.  In addition to the financial  means  of  the

immediate family, it will also take into account the size  of

the immediate family.  This is fairer because larger families

would  necessarily require a larger income to live on.   VWOs

will  also continue to take into account the patient's assets

in evaluating his financial circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-tier subsidy will result in higher funding

support  by  the  Government to the VWO  nursing  homes.   In

addition  to  patients  on  public  assistance,  those   with

immediate  family per capita incomes below $300 will  receive

75%  subsidy.  Those with per capita incomes between $300 and

$500  will  receive  50% subsidy.  Further,  those  with  per

capita  incomes  between  $500  and  $700  will  receive  25%

subsidy, where they now receive none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this three-tier subsidy framework, therefore, a

higher proportion of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  will  be eligible for subsidy.   The  financial

burden  on low- and lower-middle income households supporting

disabled elderly family members who require nursing home care

will be considerably lightened.



<br><br><i>Need  to  safeguard affordability of care in future,  against shrinking tax base</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having decided on this subsidy framework, we need to

consider  how best to finance it.  Sir, our population  today

is still relatively young.  Many of us are able to contribute

actively  to  the economy and help generate  tax  revenue  to

finance   Government   programmes,  including   health   care

subsidies.   However,  this will change.   Not  only  will  a

rapidly ageing population require more step-down health  care

services such as nursing home care, it will also result in  a

shrinking  tax  base where a smaller working population  will

find  it  harder and harder to pay for health care  subsidies

consumed by a larger ageing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these subsidies, health care for the future

elderly may not remain affordable to individuals from low and

lower-middle income households and their families.   Yet,  at

the   same   time,   we   need  to  preserve   our   economic

competitiveness in an increasingly globalised economy,  where

countries   maintain  competitive  tax   rates   to   attract

investments.   Hence,  it would not be realistic  for  us  to

continually  count on taxpayers to pay for the  subsidies  to

our nursing homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure the affordability of nursing home care

in future years.  Instead of continuing with today's practice

of  paying subsidies to the VWO nursing homes directly out of

the  Government's budget, the Government will  establish  the

alternative mechanism of an endowment fund.



<br><br><i>Purpose of ElderCare Fund</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed endowment fund will be called ElderCare

Fund.  We will gradually build up a large enough capital  sum

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



the  ElderCare Fund, so that the interest income can be  used

to fully finance the subsidies for patients who are cared for

in VWO nursing homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By setting aside funds now while we can afford it, we

will  ensure  that  funding of subsidies for  step-down  care

facilities for the elderly of the future can be sustained  in

the long term.



<br><br><i>Top-ups of capital sum during budget surpluses</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ElderCare Fund will start off with an initial

capital  injection of $200 million.  During years  of  strong

economic growth, the capital sum can be topped up with budget

surpluses, so as to generate more interest income.  Only  the

interest income can be used to finance the nursing homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial years, subsidies to VWO nursing homes

will  be  partially funded from the interest  income  of  the

Fund,  and  partially  funded direct  from  the  Government's

budget.  The goal is for the Fund to reach a capital  sum  of

$1 billion by the year 2010.  By then, the capital sum should

be  large  enough for subsidies to VWO nursing  homes  to  be

completely financed from its interest income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, ElderCare Fund will provide subsidies only

to VWO nursing homes.  Other kinds of step-down care provided

by  VWOs  and supported by the Government, such as  community

hospitals,  will  continue to be funded from  the  Government

budget.   However,  when ElderCare Fund has  more  resources,

extension  of  its coverage to other kinds of step-down  care

services can be considered.



<br><br><i>Endowment fund will not replace community support</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned that VWOs fund their operating

expenditure  through community donations,  patient  fees  and

Government  subsidies.  The introduction  of  ElderCare  Fund

will  not displace the role of community donations in helping

the  poor to pay for VWO nursing home care, as this  is  part

and  parcel of the community support structure.  This  spirit

of community help must be preserved and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



encouraged.  Hence, VWOs should continue to raise funds  from

the  community  and do their part in helping  the  needy  and

indigent  patients foot their share of the charges using  the

donations raised.



<br><br><i>No change to administration of Medifund</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also proposes some amendments to the

existing   provisions  on  Medifund.   Today,  each  approved

hospital  sets  up a Hospital Medifund committee,  comprising

persons   of   standing  with  grassroots  or   social   work

experience, to consider and approve applications  from  needy

patients.   Funds  are  then paid  out  from  the  hospital's

Medifund  Account  to  defray the  charges  incurred  by  the

applicant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this system has worked well, we need to build

in  greater flexibility for the administration of the  scheme

to  adapt to changing circumstances, so that patients'  needs

will  continue to be well served.  For instance,  instead  of

setting   up  one  Medifund  committee  for  every   approved

hospital,  it might be more desirable in future for community

organisations  to be responsible for disbursing  Medifund  to

needy  residents  living  in  the  community.   The  proposed

amendments to the existing provisions on Medifund will  allow

for such alternative arrangements to be made, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, however, no changes will be made to the

administration of Medifund.  Singaporean patients in B2 and C

class  wards  of public hospitals and subsidised  outpatients

who  face  financial difficulty, and are unable to pay  their

charges, can continue to apply for Medifund assistance at the

hospitals.  Their applications will continue to be considered

by the hospital Medifund committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to support the Medical and Elderly Care Endowment

Schemes  Bill.   In fact, I am very glad that the  Government

has come up with yet another provision to cope with our fast-increasing population of elderly and an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



ever-increasing  ratio of non-working to working  individuals

in  the  near future.  It is good that there is now a  scheme

that gives Singaporeans further peace of mind in their golden

years.   I  would, however, like to add that this  Government

must continue to promote and encourage some of the very basic

values  that have served us well all these years.   Sir,  the

need for self-sufficiency and looking after one's own kin and

families   in   our  Asian  values  should   be   emphasised.

Otherwise, the two endowment funds which are to serve only as

safety  nets  for those really in dire need,  will  be  found

lacking through callous and overwhelming demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ElderCare Fund, like the Medifund, will be for the

nursing care of our needy elderly in future.  As announced by

the  Minister  for  Health  in his introductory  speech,  the

Government  will build up the ElderCare Fund with an  initial

capital   injection   of  $200  million.    Further   capital

injections  will be made when budget surpluses are available.

Only  the interest income of the ElderCare Fund will be  used

to  fund  the  operating subsidies to VWO nursing  homes  and

extension to other kinds of step-down care services  will  be

considered when the ElderCare Fund has more resources.   Sir,

in  order  to  build up the ElderCare Fund faster  so  as  to

extend  the  other  services  sooner,  would  the  Government

consider  accepting  donations  from  private  organisations,

philanthropists or even grassroots organisations?  Would  the

Government  also  encourage donations with  an  incentive  of

three-to-one  matching grant, similar to that  given  to  the

CDCs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Ministry of Health

devise  a  plan  for  the approval and  disbursement  of  the

Medifund  and  ElderCare  Fund via  "local  councils".   Such

"local  councils" could be the CDCs.  The authority to assess

eligibility and to approve the use of these Funds can then be

devolved.  The Ministry will, hence, need less administrative

manpower.  Each CDC could be made to raise some of the  money

so  that  it will have more authority to disburse the  funds.

It  is  likely that the CDC, through its closer rapport  with

the constituents and with the liberty to decide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



whom  to  help  in  its ward, will allow for  more  effective

disbursement  of  the funds.  The CDC will also  become  more

relevant  to the people.  Sir, as Members of Parliament  have

closer contact with their residents and also have the help of

the  grassroots  workers, they would know the  needs  of  the

residents  better.  They could be advisers  to  these  "local

councils".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like now to comment on the

following  clauses of the Medical and Elderly Care  Endowment

Schemes Bill.



<br><br><i>Clause 6</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act to be repealed specifies that the Advisory

Council  should contain not less than five and not more  than

nine  members.  The Bill does not provide for any minimum  or

maximum number and is left to the discretion of the Minister.

Is there any reason for this?



<br><br><i>Clause 25(6)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is any suspension, the approved provider

shall  not be regarded as one.  What happens to its  patients

in the interim?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Health could enlighten me on

these points.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill although I

would like to propose an amendment to one clause of the  Bill

at the Committee stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population headed by

Minister  Mah Bow Tan presented its report to the  Government

in  November  last  year.  One of its key recommendations  is

that  community  based step-down care  services  need  to  be

strengthened to support the family in its role of caring  for

elderly members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Elderly Care Endowment Scheme to be introduced

and  the ElderCare Fund to be established under this Bill can

be  seen as Government's response to the recommendations.  It

is  in  line  with  the  principle  of  promoting  individual

responsibility.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Committee, launched by Prime Minister

Goh in 1997, was tasked to look into the challenges faced  by

Singapore  in  the  21st century.  One of  the  dilemmas  the

Committee dealt with is that of taking care of the  needs  of

senior  citizens versus the aspirations of  the  young.   The

idea  is  that we need to promote strong family ties so  that

the  needs of the elderly can be taken care of by the family.

But  the community and the Government will help if the family

is  unable to handle the problem.  The ElderCare Fund  is  in

line with this idea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I support the setting up of the ElderCare

Fund,  may I seek clarification from the Minister as  to  the

interpretation of the step-down care.  Clause 2 of  the  Bill

defines  step-down care as "accommodation, personal care  and

health  care  for  persons suffering or recovering  from  any

sickness, disability or injury."  Could the Minister  clarify

whether  the  elderly who are "frail" and need some  form  of

supervision but not sick, disabled or injured, fall under the

category  and can qualify for step-down care?   We  know  the

figure of Liang Po Po.  Just imagine that one day Liang Po Po

gets  older, cannot even "ho, ho, ho", and becomes frail  but

she  is  not  sick, disabled or injured.  As  our  population

ages, there will be more of such groups who are able to carry

out  their  daily needs or daily routine but are  frail.   In

fact,  the  majority of the NTUC Day Care patients are  frail

but not sick, disabled or injured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister may also clarify whether the provision

of elderly services at the space designated for such communal

services   at  the  HDB  apartments  qualifies  for  approved

provider  premises status under clause 22  of  the  Bill.   I

raise  this because it is foreseen that there will be a  need

to  provide such services at the void decks of HDB  flats  in

future as our population is ageing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 26(4) refers to "relevant patient" to be a

person  who,  in the opinion of the Minister, requires  step-down  care and is assessed by the Minister to be "financially

disadvantaged".   May  I  propose that  in  arriving  at  the

definition,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



the Minister will consider the predicament of the elderly who

belong  to the "sandwiched" group, that is, the middle income

group  who  cannot  afford the fees charged  by  the  private

organisations  and, at the same time, not  eligible  for  any

subvention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to declare my interest as the

Chairman  of the Medifund Council since it was set up.   Over

the  years, the Medifund has helped many thousands of  people

to  meet their hospital and medical expenses.  It worked well

because  of  the  flexibility built into the  rules  for  the

Medical  Endowment Fund.  With a basic set of rules supported

by  guidelines,  Medifund committees were  able  to  exercise

judgement,  especially  in  border  line  cases,  to  balance

between  the  resource available and the  help  that  can  be

provided.   And I am happy to see that even more  flexibility

is  being  considered  under the  reconstitution.   The  same

spirit  of  flexibility is being suggested for the  ElderCare

Fund.   It  is certainly timely to establish such a  fund  to

provide subventions to approved providers of step-down  care.

It  will  be a great help to existing providers of  step-down

care  who  qualify as well as encourage the establishment  of

newer facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two areas that I would like to seek

clarification.   One in particular relates to  the  ElderCare

Fund.   The  definition of "step-down care"  suggested  means

"accommodation,  personal care and health  care  for  persons

suffering  or  recovering  from any sickness,  disability  or

injury; personal care and health care during the day for  any

such  persons;  or such other forms of health  care  or  care

arrangements".   If  I look at the definition  of  "step-down

care",  I  do  not  see  it  as something  that  is  strictly

restricted  to  the  elderly.  It  could  well  be  something

beneficial to someone that is young.  So I am not sure why we

are  restricting ourselves to the elderly.  It could be  just

to  start it off and as the Fund builds up, maybe it will  be

expanded.  In which case then, by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



calling  it  the  ElderCare Fund, are  we  placing  a  mental

ceiling  and  whereby even if the Fund  builds  up,  we  will

continue  to  restrict step-down care only for  the  elderly?

Perhaps,  the  Minister could let us know the  rationale  for

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next concern is the sweeping exclusion from the

definition  of  "step-down care" of medical  or  health  care

provided  in any maternity homes or premises used or intended

to  be  used  for the accommodation of pregnant women  or  of

women immediately after child birth.  I can accept that post-natal  care  is  excluded from the definition  of  "step-down

care".   However,  I  am  sure there is  a  range  of  health

complications arising from pregnancy which can be  adequately

dealt  with  by  the  professionals at a  maternity  home  or

similar premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern arises from the first-hand knowledge of a

lady  who suffered from a stroke whilst pregnant.  The health

insurance policy taken out for her covered medical  care  for

strokes,  but  because her stroke was deemed to  have  arisen

from her pregnancy, she found that her medical costs were not

covered.   A less sweeping exclusion directed at medical  and

health care for normal pregnancy, including Caesarian births,

would  be  preferable.  This would ensure that only  premises

set aside to deal with special pregnancy cases would qualify.

Larger  families  are being encouraged  in  the  light  of  a

rapidly  ageing and shrinking population.  No one would  wish

for  a  complicated pregnancy.  The medical cost for a normal

pregnancy is sufficient financial burden to many.  Some  help

is  well deserved by those playing their part in replenishing

and expanding our major resource, our citizens.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.   My

comments are directed largely to Part III of the Bill on  the

ElderCare  Scheme.  The Bill seeks to establish a  Government

fund   to  subvent  the  recurrent  cost  of  step-down  care

providers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to commend the Ministry of Health

for moving so expeditiously on the recommendation of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on the Ageing Population to

make  provisions for the funding of step-down care.  The  IMC

had  observed that while the provision and financing of acute

health  care services for the elderly in Singapore are pretty

much  adequately  taken  care of,  the  step-down  care  and,

primarily,  the  community-based  services  still  need  much

strengthening.  The Ministry has in fact started  to  address

those  areas  under  its purview.  The  recent  announcements

relating to allocation of land for private nursing homes  and

changes  in  eligibility  for subsidy  of  new  residents  in

Government-funded VWO-run nursing homes and, now,  this  Bill

to  set  up  the  ElderCare Fund, are  all  directed  towards

facilitating  the  provision of step-down  care,  encouraging

appropriate  usage  and assisting in the financing  of  these

services.  This is certainly moving us in the right direction

in   preparing   for   our  growing   population   of   older

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have a concern, however, that our attention

continues to be much more heavily directed towards  the  very

visible problem related to institutional care and not  enough

towards  the  not  so  visible, but  equally,  if  not,  more

important, educational, preventive and rehabilitative aspects

of  the  whole picture.  The Bill has defined step-down  care

very broadly to cover both accommodation and day care, and to

cover both health and personal care as well as other forms of

care  arrangements.  This is good and necessary as it is  not

only more places for institutional care and nursing homes and

in  day  care centres that are needed, but even more  so  the

provision of home care services, medical and nursing services

and  simple home-help services in which a large gap currently

exists.   But  step-down care, as its  very  name  indicates,

addresses  the situation after the damage has been  done  and

seeks the solution from the acute care institution's point of

view  of how to get the senior citizen who has needed  to  be

hospitalized back in various stages to the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have defined in our vision of successful ageing for

Singapore that, at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



the  individual level, we aspire to have healthy  and  active

older Singaporeans who lead independent and fulfilling lives.

To  achieve this, there is a chasm we have yet to  bridge  in

mindsets  and attitudes, both in the value that we  currently

place on the advanced years of an older person's lifetime  as

well  as in the importance of paying attention to the  simple

daily  routines in preventive health care to ensure that  our

senior citizens continue to stay fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, it is not infrequently that I have heard stories

of  older  persons who have not had treatment for correctable

conditions simply because the family had not thought that, at

their  age, the expense would be worth it.  Just recently,  a

colleague who does voluntary work in the community shared  an

account  of  an elderly woman who was house-bound because  of

failing  eyesight due to cataracts.  The family felt that  it

would  not  be justified to dig into the family reserves  for

the  thousand  dollars that they took for  the  operation  to

correct  the problem, and that was because she was  70  years

old.   But  for this lady, she has five more years,  10  more

years, maybe even more, house-bound and unable to see.  It is

the  attitude, I think, of after a certain age, it  does  not

matter  so much.  But our life expectancy is now pretty  high

and  I think we need to put more value on the quality of life

for the older Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Survey conducted by the Ministry in

1995 discovered a high occurrence of high blood pressure  and

diabetes  in  our population.  These medical conditions  will

increase in incidence with age.  High blood pressure that  is

not managed well will predispose to strokes and diabetes that

is  not well treated may very well lead to amputations.  Poor

eyesight  and frailty result in falls.  All three  result  in

drastically  reduced  mobility for the  older  persons.   The

quantum leap in care needed when an older person suffers loss

of  mobility and the impact on her or his quality of life  is

horrendous.  Very often, people will scrimp on or ignore what

they feel to be small things - good, effective control of low

grade chronic illnesses or exercise and rehabilitation to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



maintain fitness, not paying attention until what could  have

very  easily  been  managed on an  outpatient  basis  in  the

community becomes a hospitalisation for a major health event.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while the provisions in the Bill for financing and

subsidy  of  step-down  care are most  welcome,  I  urge  the

Minister  to  put aside enough resources towards  encouraging

and  facilitating the development of strong programmes in the

community for health educational and preventive services,  to

re-orient  our perspective so that what drives the system  is

how to prevent the strokes, the amputations and the fractures

that  give  rise to the need for the step-down  care  in  the

first place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services to meet the needs of the frail, ill and

disabled  elderly  are  currently  provided  by  a  range  of

agencies  under the umbrellas of the Ministry of Health,  the

Ministry of Community Development and the National Council of

Social  Services.  As the Health Ministry proceeds to  refine

its  existing criteria for susbsidy of nursing home residents

to  ensure the appropriate use of facilities and services and

to  enact  and  implement  regulations  to  ensure  that  the

ElderCare Fund to be established is drawn upon prudently  and

appropriately, there will be a shift in the mix of  residents

that are presently being looked after by the nursing homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has recently announced that it will no

longer subsidise new incoming residents who need only varying

levels  of  assistance in their routine activities  of  daily

living -  I think these are referred to as Category 1  and  2

patients  - as these persons should not be cared for  in  the

nursing  home,  but  rather  in  their  own  homes,  in   the

community,   or   perhaps  in  the  homes   for   the   aged.

Unfortunately, at the moment, the homes for the  aged,  which

come  under  MCD, are not geared up to deliver this  care  as

they are actually meant for the well elderly.  And there  are

insufficient  VWOs providing community services  and  support

that   would  be  available  to  help  families  and  elderly

individuals to cope at home.  So, as the nursing homes resist

taking in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



Category  1  and  2 patients because they no  longer  receive

subsidy  for  them, where will these people go to?   In  this

interim,  there  will be tremendous pressure on  families  to

cope.   Is there some way perhaps the Minister could look  at

some resources towards helping bridge this interim gap, until

such  time  as MCD and VWOs are able to provide the  services

that  will enable these categories of residents to  be  taken

care of at home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the various agencies will move at different speeds in

undertaking their part of the work that needs to be  done  in

moving  towards our desired destination of successful  ageing

in  Singapore, much coordination is required to ensure  that,

for all our good intentions, we do not in fact exacerbate the

problem in the meantime.  I trust that the Minister will take

the  points  raised into consideration as  he  moves  to  put

together the policies, initiatives and legislation to provide

for  and finance appropriate health and personal care for our

growing senior citizenry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we treat the sick and old is a strong signal on how

we  recognise  their  contributions to the  success  of  this

nation.   It  is part of strengthening the software  to  look

after  the  old  and the sick.  Today's old  was  yesterday's

young  who  contributed  to the success  of  Singapore.   And

today's  young who is presently contributing to  our  success

will be tomorrow's old.  I do not wish to go through all  the

many  things  in  the  Bill because it has  been  covered  by

previous  speakers.   However, I have two concerns  regarding

elderly  care.   First,  in  promoting  step-down  care,  the

private  sector would be playing a role.  The private  sector

is  primarily  profit-motivated, and there is  nothing  wrong

with  that.   But, Sir, the question we ask is:   should  the

question  of elderly care be subjected to too much of  market

forces?   And as a follow up, is it not better to  serve  the

needs of the elderly through the VWOs and cooperatives?   The

setting  up of cooperatives would have social objectives  and

they could give the elderly care and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



those  who  need  it better value for money.   Moreover,  the

surpluses of cooperatives, which are run on commercial  line,

belong to members and will go back to the people who need it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make is about home care.

While  we  promote institutional care, I think we should  not

neglect  home  care.   The  report of  the  Inter-Ministerial

Committee  on  the Ageing Population had a whole  chapter  on

enabling families to care for the elderly.  It primarily says

that the care of the elderly by the family is the best avenue

as  they also need to talk about physical need as well as the

emotional  and social needs.  And it is also in keeping  with

our value of filial piety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support step-down care and institutional care

for  the  elderly,  I ask that we do not neglect  home  care.

Home  care  is also the desire of most of the elderly.   They

like  to  be  near their children and grandchildren,  and  we

should  say  that it is part of the value for the  family  to

take care of them. Towards this end, I would like to ask  the

Minister  what  steps are going to be taken to  promote  home

care  so  that  more and more people will  look  after  their

elderly at home.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I would first like to thank the

Members  for their contributions to this debate.  This  whole

issue  of looking after the aged sick is a very big challenge

for  us. This is not the first nor the last time that we  are

going  to  discuss  on  how we are  going  to  approach  this

challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I would like to say that I agree entirely

with  Dr  Lily  Neo  and Mr Seng Han Thong  that  our  entire

approach  must  emphasise  the  personal  responsibility  for

looking  after  one's  health and  also  counting  on  family

members to look after you when you grow old or when you  fall

sick.  I think these are two pillars that would not change  - personal responsibility and family support.  But at the  same

time, there would be this small percentage of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



the  elderly who would fall sick.  This elderly sick is quite

well-defined in medical terms.  This is defined through  some

criteria  of how a person can go about his daily living  with

different  levels of assistance.  For those  categories  that

require  a very high level of nursing care, what we designate

as  Categories  III  and IV, the medical conditions  of  such

people  would  affect approximately 2% to 3% of  the  elderly

above  65 years old.  So, what we are discussing today  is  a

fairly  well-defined group of about 2% to 3% of  the  elderly

above  65  years old.  Of course, this is part of  the  whole

issue  of  how  you  address  the  challenge  of  the  ageing

population and many issues have been raised by Members.   But

I  just want to concentrate Members' minds that the ElderCare

Fund is set up to target at this 2% to 3% of the 65 years and

above  who  fall sick, categorised as Categories III  and  IV

under  these medical conditions, and who require care  in  an

institution or in a home setting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first definition is the medical condition of

the person that requires such care.  As Mr Seng Han Thong has

asked, this is addressed in the definition in the Bill and it

does not cover the elderly frail.  Elderly frail, who are out

of  this  3%,  would not be covered by this  ElderCare  Fund.

Having defined this group whose medical condition requires us

to look after them, then it really does not matter whether we

look  after  them  in an institution setting  or  in  a  home

setting.   But  for  purposes of implementing  the  financial

support,  we  are  saying  that  we  start  off  first   with

supporting  the  nursing homes run by VWOs.   This  would  be

extended in due course in future to nursing homes run by  the

private  sector  when  we  are  familiar  with  running  such

financial  support.   The  subsidies  are  meant  for  people

meeting  the  medical condition, and passing the means  test.

In  future,  we  can also extend to other institutional  care

settings,  whether it is a community hospital,  chronic  sick

hospital  or such facilities set up in the void decks.   When

we are able to develop home care facilities and services in a

better way, such financial support would also be extended  to

home care services for this 3% of elderly sick.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we start off with this category that requires

the medical attention and financial support.  As a start,  to

implement this programme, my Ministry suggests we do it first

with  the  nursing homes run by VWOs, develop some expertise,

and  then  we  can  systematically extend  it  to  widen  the

coverage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked does the ElderCare Fund only cater

for  the elderly? The answer is no.  It is mainly the elderly

who would require such nursing home care, but there would  be

others who would also require such rehabilitative and nursing

home  care, for example, the case that he cited of a pregnant

lady  who  suffered  a stroke.  In the  first  phase  of  the

sickness,  she  would  be  cared for  in  an  acute  hospital

setting.  Then  later,  when she is  more  stable,  when  her

recovery  is  better, we would probably  transfer  her  to  a

nursing home. And when she is in a nursing home, and  if  she

belongs  to  the  low  and  lower-middle  income,  then   the

financial  assistance would kick in.  We  call  it  ElderCare

because the vast majority of the people who would enjoy  this

funding  would  be the elderly.  But it is not restricted  to

just the elderly.  People whose medical conditions satisfy or

require us to provide medical and nursing care, ie, those  in

Categories  III and IV, would be eligible for  the  financial

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having defined the medical condition and the premises,

we  can  now  define  the  relevant  patient,  that  is,  the

different  categories  of people who  deserve  the  different

levels  of financial support.  Mr Seng Han Thong made a  plea

for  the  sandwiched  group,  the middle-income  group  whose

income is too low to afford private nursing home and too high

to  enjoy  the  subsidies.  We try to take care  of  this  by

having  a  three-tier  framework.  Previously,  it  was  only

either  above or below $2,000 household income.  Now we  have

three  tiers, so it is no longer a sandwich.   It  is  now  a

three  layered nonya cake.  But of course, there would  still

be  people who fall outside the criteria.  I do not think  we

need to go into a kueh lapis, with so many layers, but we can

obviously extend the layers and provide more assistance  when

we build up the fund and when we build up the experience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would turn to the specific suggestions and points

raised.    Dr  Lily  Neo  asked  whether  we  accept  private

donations. The answer is yes.  All donations and bequests can

be  paid  as  capital  monies  into  both  the  Medifund  and

ElderCare Fund. She asked whether the Government would give a

matching  grant of 3 to 1. At this moment, I do not  see  the

need  because  the Government is pledging  to  build  up  the

ElderCare Fund to the tune of $1 billion.  That is a  lot  of

money,  so there is really no need to have further incentives

to  ask the private sector or the individuals to donate.   In

fact,  I  would  urge the private sector and individuals,  if

they   want  to  make  donations,  not  necessarily  to  make

donations  to  the ElderCare Fund because the  Government  is

going  to  build  it up to $1 billion, but to make  donations

directly to the VWOs, because they need the donations to help

pay for the patients' portion of their bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked whether we can work through local

councils  like  the  CDCs.  This is  something  that  we  are

thinking  about  and this is one of the reasons  why  we  are

making  some of the amendments, in particular, the  amendment

to  section  6  where  we  did not stipulate  the  number  of

advisory  councils.   This is to give us the  flexibility  to

appoint  enough  people to match the CDCs, depending  on  the

number  of  members  in the CDCs.  So, the  intention  is  to

involve the community in the form of the CDCs.  They are  the

people  who  know  the  residents  on  the  ground  and   can

understand  their  needs and make sensible decisions  on  who

qualifies for Medifund assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked what happens to the patients if we

have  to suspend a nursing home. That really depends  on  the

reasons  for  suspending the nursing home.   We  may  suspend

nursing  homes for several reasons.  The most drastic  reason

is  when we have to remove the licence from the nursing  home

because  it  does not meet the medical criteria of continuing

to  run  the  nursing  home. Under  such  circumstances,  the

patients  will have to be taken care of in other homes.   But

if the nursing home continues to meet the medical criteria of

running a nursing home, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



gets  suspended  for  other reasons,  for  example,  for  not

keeping  good  accounts  or  for whatever  reasons,  then  of

course, it would not affect the patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked why we exclude facilities meant for

pregnancy,  etc.  As I explained, complications arising  from

pregnancy  will  be dealt with either in the  acute  hospital

setting  or  if  it is something that requires  nursing  home

care, then it will be dealt with in a step-down nursing  home

care  facility.  Under the latter circumstances, the  patient

will qualify for ElderCare funding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee made several very good points. I just

want  to  say  that  all  these are  very  important.  We  do

recognise the full range of the challenge facing  us.   As  I

said,  the Bill tackles 3% of the elderly who require nursing

home  care.   My Ministry, working together with  MCD,  would

also  look  at the other very important areas.  I agree  with

her  entirely that we first have to set up the framework  for

preventive  care so that as few as possible  of  our  elderly

actually  fall into acute or chronic problems. So  preventive

healthcare  and public education are very important,  and  we

are also working on programmes that will address this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Jennifer Lee and Mr Thomas also talked about the

very important role played in home care facilities.  This  is

a  tremendous challenge.  It requires a lot of resources.   I

can  assure  both of them that both MCD and my  Ministry  are

working to improve the home care facilities and services that

we have in Singapore but Members have to give us some time to

work on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular problems of Categories I and II, I think,

require  a joint effort between MCD and MOH to deal with.   I

do  not  want to give the impression that because we come  to

this House on our plans for setting up nursing homes and  our

financial  arrangements for the ElderCare Fund  that  we  are

giving focus or attention to institutional care, and not to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



the other aspects of the problems confronting our aged. As  I

said,  this would not be the first or the last time  that  we

would  be  talking about the issue.  I am  sure  we  will  be

addressing it. Members can have my assurance that my Ministry

and  MCD will tackle this problem systematically, and we will

come  back  to the House for support for the other components

of looking after the elderly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister said earlier that the

ElderCare  Fund will also go towards the recipients  of  home

care.  I want to ask him how would this work and who will  be

eligible for this ElderCare Fund.  Will the recipient be  the

beneficiary or the carer of the recipient?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Dr Lily Neo is always moving at the

speed  of  a  train.   I said that we start  off  first  with

nursing  homes run by VWOs.  We build up the experience  and,

in future, we can extend the scope to the next step, which is

nursing homes run by the private sector.  Then we can  extend

it  to another step, which is other types of homes, not  just

nursing  homes,  but community hospitals, chronic  sick,  and

also facilities in the void decks.  We can also extend it  to

home care.  I know the real challenge and the difficulties of

providing subsidies or financial assistance to home care, the

very  issues  that  the  Member raised,  whether  it  is  the

provider or the recipient; who gets, who approves.  It  is  a

huge  problem.  I prefer to go about it systematically.   Let

us start with the easy part first, which is nursing homes run

by  VWOs.  Then we extend it systematically, but I can assure

Members that we will reach home care in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> When will that be?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my reason for proposing the deletion is that it

sounds  too harsh, as it gives an absolute discretion to  the

reason.  Secondly, the deletion will, in a way, leave a  room

for the Minister to give reason if any applicant attempts  to

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House seeks, inter-alia, to amend

the  SAF  Act  to  rationalise the  disciplinary  powers  for

dealing  with officers of the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel  and

above,  and  to  establish a new scheme of  service  for  SAF

military Warrant Officers and Specialists.  The new scheme of

replace  the  current  Pensionable,  Full  CPF  and  Contract

schemes of service.



<br><br><i>Summary Trial System for Senior Officers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to highlight the key aspects of the

Bill.  Clauses  1 to 10 propose refinements  to  the  summary

trial  system  for  SAF  senior officers  by  empowering  the

Service  Chiefs to summarily try errant officers of the  rank

of  Lieutenant-Colonel.  Correspondingly, the jurisdiction of

the  Chief  of  Defence  Force and  the  Senior  Disciplinary

Committee should be realigned.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.55 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF (Amendment) Act 1994 was passed by Parliament on

26th February 1994.  One of the amendments empowers the Chief

of  Defence  Force to summarily try officers  of  Lieutenant-Colonel rank and a Senior Disciplinary Committee to summarily

deal with officers of Colonel rank and above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has, since then, further rationalised the

summary  trial  system for its senior officers.   It  is  now

proposed that the Service Chiefs, ie, Chief of Army, Chief of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



Air  Force  and  Chief  of Navy, be  vested  with  powers  to

summarily deal with officers of Lieutenant-Colonel rank,  the

Chief  of  Defence Force be empowered to deal summarily  with

officers   of  Colonel  rank,  and  the  Senior  Disciplinary

Committee  be  given  the authority to  summarily  deal  with

officers of the rank of Brigadier General rank and above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have been very few cases of officers of

the  rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and above who have had to  be

summarily  dealt with, the proposed amendments  will  provide

Service  Chiefs and the Chief of Defence Force an appropriate

and  responsive means of dealing with offences  committed  by

their senior officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to approve the amendments.



<br><br><i>Premium Plan and  SAVER-Premium Fund</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the amendments concerning the Premium

Plan  and the SAVER-Premium Fund.  The subsequent clauses  of

the  Bill seek to establish the legislative framework for the

implementation  of  the  Premium Plan  for  military  Warrant

Officers  and  Specialists.  Provisions  are  also  made  for

consequential amendments to the Pension Fund Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to briefly explain the rationale for the

introduction of the Premium Plan, and how it relates  to  the

SAVER Plan for military Officers which the House had endorsed

in March 1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is the guarantor of our

national security. The SAF is a credible deterrent because of

the  dedication  and professionalism of  its  personnel.   To

maintain  this  edge, the SAF must be able to recruit,  train

and  retain  enough  quality Officers, Warrant  Officers  and

Specialists  who  are  able to meet  its  high  standards  of

commitment and professionalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this objective in mind that MINDEF formulated

the "New Partnership" programme for our military Officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



in  1997.  The "New Partnership" programme is a total  revamp

of   the  manpower  management  system  of  the  SAF,  making

fundamental  changes  to  the career structure,  remuneration

package  and career management and performance management  of

our  personnel.  As part of the "New Partnership",  in  1998,

MINDEF  implemented  the  SAVER  Plan,  which  replaced   the

Pensionable,  CPF  Plus and Contract schemes,  for  uniformed

Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not enough to revamp the manpower management

system  of  the  Officer Corps alone.  The SAF requires  good

people  at  every  level to ensure that it  can  continue  to

perform its role effectively.  The non-officer corps is  just

as  important, as it forms the backbone of the SAF.  A review

was  therefore  commissioned in 1998  to  revamp  the  career

structures  and  remuneration mechanisms of military  Warrant

Officers and Specialists.  As part of this review, MINDEF has

developed  a new scheme of service, to be called the  Premium

Plan,  to  support the career structures of military  Warrant

Officers  and  Specialists, in the same way  the  SAVER  Plan

supported the career structure for military Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Premium Plan will meet the needs of Warrant Officers

and  Specialists at different stages of their careers.  Under

the  Premium  Plan, MINDEF will provide a  gratuity  for  the

serviceman  after  his 10th year of service,  and  thereafter

contribute an amount, based on his monthly salary,  into  his

Premium Plan accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the objectives and mechanisms of the SAVER and

Premium  Plans are broadly similar, funds in both Plans  will

be  pooled  and  invested  as a joint  "SAVER-Premium  Fund".

Investment returns from this Fund will be credited into  each

serviceman's  individual accounts.  The Fund  would  adopt  a

similar  structure  of  governance  and  the  same  Board  of

Trustees as the existing SAVER Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated balance in the Premium Plan accounts

will  be  given   to  the servicemen when they  retire  after

serving  a full career with the SAF.  Those who leave earlier

will get a smaller sum, depending on their length of service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this Bill also empowers the Armed Forces

Council  to make provisions for loans and other benefits  out

of  both  the  SAVER Plan and the Premium Plan.   This  would

include the provision of flexible benefits for servicemen and

their families under the Premium Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF intends to implement the Premium Plan on 31st

March  2000  for  all  newly-enlisted Specialists.   Existing

Warrant Officers and Specialists will be offered an option to

convert  to  the  Premium Plan, and transfer the  accumulated

benefits  from their current schemes of service  to  the  new

Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quality manpower is a key pillar of the SAF's

defence  capabilities.  The Premium Plan aims to attract  the

quality manpower that the SAF needs, by providing first class

careers in the SAF that are both challenging and rewarding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr David T. E. Lim].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of

Government  of  the foreshore and seabed at  Pulau  Ubin  and

Pulau  Tekong containing an area of about 3,310 ha  as  shown

coloured  pink  on LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN  NO  1/2000,

which  is  deposited  in  the  Land  Office,  Singapore   and

consequently  approves modification of the  boundary  of  the

reclamation previously approved by Parliament on 16th January

1992 of 657 ha of foreshore and seabed as shown edged red  on

the same plan.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 16th January 1992, this House approved the

reclamation of 657 ha of foreshore and seabed at  Pulau  Ubin

and Pulau Tekong as shown edged red on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



`LAND  OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN 1/2000'.  A copy of this  plan

is  displayed in the Library of this House for the  reference

of  hon. Members.  The reclamation was to be carried  out  by

the   Housing  and  Development  Board  (HDB)  as  agent   of

Government.   However,  this  was  not  carried  out  as  the

Ministry of National Development subsequently redirected  the

Urban  Redevelopment Authority (URA) and HDB  to  review  the

reclamation  profile  with the objective  of  increasing  the

amount  of  land that can be reclaimed and to  optimise  land

use.   The  study  has been completed.  HDB now  proposes  to

reclaim a revised area of 3,310 ha of foreshore and seabed as

shown coloured pink on the same plan.  A copy of this plan is

displayed  in the Library of this House for the reference  of

hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reclaimed, the land would be kept as contingency

land for urban development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation works will commence in October 2000 and

will be completed by 2008.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of

the Foreshores Act (Cap 113), approves the reclamation by the

Government  of  the foreshore and seabed at  Pulau  Ubin  and

<div align="center"><b>LAWS TO GIVE PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether the Government intends to pass laws  giving

protection to consumers such as the Fair Trading Act 1986 and

the  Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 of New Zealand, and, if so,

when.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's approach to consumer protection is to

educate  consumers while enabling the market  to  operate  as

efficiently  as  possible, regulating only  where  necessary.

Encouraging competition and increasing access to a  range  of

goods  and  services  enable  consumers  to  make  their  own

decisions  from a menu of choices.  This is the best  way  to

increase  consumer welfare. The policy has  served  us  well.

In  areas  where  protection is necessary,  for  example,  to

safeguard health, safety or public morals, there are  already

existing  legislation.   Specific offences  of  cheating  and

certain  forms of fraudulent trades are also covered  in  the

Penal Code and other legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must avoid over-regulating. First, legislative and

regulatory  requirements  on  businesses  carry   with   them

compliance  costs.   This will increase business  costs  that

would ultimately be passed on to consumers.  Second, we  must

also  avoid  excessive dependence by consumers on  Government

regulation.  Otherwise,  legislation  would  have   to   keep

expanding  in scope and coverage to cover all possible  cases

of  cheating and unfair trade practices.  In the end, let the

buyer beware - this is the caveat emptor principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that a better approach is to educate

consumers  and make more information available, so that  they

can  make good choices.  The Government will continue to work

with CASE on such efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE has also informed that it will be putting up a

proposal  for  a  Fair Trading Act for Singapore.   They  are

studying,  among others, the two Acts cited by Mr  Chiam  See

Tong  and will be incorporating the elements which they  deem

appropriate  for  Singapore.  MTI will study CASE's  proposal

when it is ready, but our preference is for a minimalist Fair

Trading Act, should one be deemed necessary.
