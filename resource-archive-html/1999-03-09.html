<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [26th

February, 1999],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government for the financial year 1st April, 1999 to 31st March,

2000."  -  [Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Government responded to the regional economic

crisis  with  two cost-cutting packages last year to  boost  the

economy.  One was a $2-billion off-budget package announced last

June,  and  the other a $10.5-billion cost-cutting supplementary

package announced last November.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this year's Budget has adequately and

reasonably  taken  care  of  Singaporeans  of  different  income

groups.  I am glad that the largest allocation of the Budget has

gone  to  Defence   -   at  25%  of total  Government  spending,

followed by Education at 19%.  National defence is one area that

the  Government  has  always emphasised.  In  times  like  this,

Singapore  is  a small country and when there are social  unrest

and  chaos  in  some other countries, we need to  be  even  more

prepared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on education is also appropriate. Singapore

is a small country with no natural resources.  Human resource is

what we depend on most for our success.  As economic competition

intensifies in the region and in the world, it is necessary  for

Singapore  to move into a knowledge-based economy  in  order  to

survive  and  continue to grow.  The second largest spending  on

education therefore should help develop our human resources

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>

for  this  challenge.  However, I urge the  Government  to  also

support  training and retraining programmes for our semi-skilled

and unskilled workers, because they will remain in the workforce

for at least another 20 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area that I want to give special attention to is the

10% personal income tax rebate that the Budget provides for this

year, up from 5% given in the last financial year.  Though  only

35% of the taxpayers enjoy this 10% rebate, the remaining 65% of

the  population  have  also not been forgotten,  as  the  Budget

provides for rebates in rents and conservancy charges for  those

staying in rented and owner-occupied HDB flats.  The amounts  of

these  housing rebates range from two months' net rent and three

months'  net  service  and conservancy (S&C)  charges  for  one-roomers to one month's net S&C charges for the 5-roomers.  It is

right  that due emphasis and consideration be given to the lower

and  middle income groups.  This approach certainly deserves our

applause.   It  shows that the Government is able to  present  a

budget for everyone during this crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, due to the prudent fiscal policies,

Singapore is able to enjoy budget surpluses.  This has helped to

build  up surplus funds that can be used during difficult times.

From  the  Budget,  one can see that the projected  expenditure,

which will lead to an operating deficit of $5.1 billion or  3.5%

of  GDP for FY99, is drawn from the accumulated surpluses.   The

Government  has  no need, at this moment in  time,  to  use  the

country's  reserves to help Singapore to tide over this  crisis.

This   is   another  area  that  we,  as  Singaporeans,   should

appreciate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the Prime Minister and his team will be

able  to  lead  Singapore out of the regional financial  crisis.

But  we  should unite together to fully support the Government's

efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 10% across-the-board income tax cut

will help to cushion the impact of the CPF and wage cuts for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>

workers.  However, the workers would like to ask if it  will  be

enough  to carry them through this year if the economy registers

a  negative growth.  If the economy goes into a recession,  does

it  mean  that workers will have to go through another round  of

CPF  and wage cut?  Besides, when will the workers know if  they

have to bite the bullet again to help the economy to pull out of

the  recession?  When will these workers be able to know whether

the cost-cutting measures announced last year are working?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement has yet to provide answers to these

questions uppermost in the minds of the ordinary workers.  It is

time  now for them to have a clearer picture of what is in store

for  them this year.  It is only fair that they be warned  early

of the painful adjustments, as in the last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Budget Statement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

the  major cost-cutting package announced last November, it  was

not  expected that there would be anything spectacular about the

Budget.   True  enough, the Budget contained few surprises.   As

expected,  there  was an income tax rebate and  rebates  on  HDB

rentals  and S&C charges; and sector-specific fiscal incentives.

I  am  glad that spending on education has increased to  19%  of

total  Government spending or just under 4% of  GDP.   Preparing

the  young  for  their  future is  one  of  the  most  important

challenges that we face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only aspect that I think is insufficiently covered is

expenditure on the upgrading and retraining of workers.   In  my

view,  this  is  a  task of some urgency.  The transfer  of  $79

million   for  the  Skills  Redevelopment  Programme   in   FY98

notwithstanding,  surely  more  than  $150  million   could   be

allocated  to  the  Ministry  of Manpower  this  year  for  this

purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projected deficit is $5.1 billion. The majority view

expressed  yesterday  was  that this  deficit  was  appropriate,

citing  as a reason the increase in development expenditure.   I

share this view.  I would also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>

like  to  add  that  the  deficit is  well  within  the  current

Government's  means.   After taking  into  account  the  overall

projected deficits in FY98 and FY99 - the technical term is  net

receipts  in excess of outlays  -   there is still an  estimated

$2.6  billion  left in Government reserves during this  term  of

government.  The actual budget surplus in FY97, the  first  year

of  this  current government, was $5.25 billion,  which  is  not

sufficient to cover the combined budget deficit in FY98 and FY99

of  $5.5 billion.  However, the receipt in excess of outlays  in

FY97,  which  includes land sales, was $13.5 billion,  which  is

$2.6  billion  more  than  the net outlays  in  FY98  and  FY99.

Hence, in terms of the Government reserves, the Government would

not  be  drawing  down on past Government  reserves.   The  $5.1

billion  deficit therefore, in my view, is entirely  appropriate

in  a  time  of  crisis and, in short, I support  the  financial

policy of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the remainder of my speech, I would like to focus on one

aspect  of  the  economy  that  deserves  particular  attention.

Compared  to  other countries in the region, Singapore  has  not

been  as badly affected by the financial crisis.  This, in large

part,  has been due to the sound economic structure and  capable

economic  governance,  including the  series  of  decisive  cost

cutting   measures,   the  proactive  drive   towards   building

capabilities for the future, and the promotion of innovation and

entrepreneurship,  particularly  technopreneurship.   In  short,

during  this  period  of crisis, the macro  framework  has  been

refined and updated in order to sustain economic growth, both in

the immediate future as well as in the medium term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the macro-economic aspects of economic governance are well

in  hand,  I  believe that it is now time to examine the  micro-economic aspects of economic governance.  What I have in mind is

a   comprehensive  and  systematic  review  of  the   regulatory

environment in Singapore, to serve two objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first objective is cost. Regulations can, inadvertently or

otherwise, contribute to cost.  The second objective is to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>

examine  whether regulations inhibit the flexibility and freedom

required for creativity and entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three categories of regulations which I have in mind.

The  first  category comprises regulations which,  because  they

discourage  competition, either do not allow prices to  fall  as

much  as  they can, or do not provide sufficient incentives  for

suppliers to offer better quality products or services.  What is

needed, in this instance, is to examine whether deregulation  or

liberalisation   will  be  beneficial  to   consumers,   without

affecting the financial viability of existing suppliers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of regulations comprises those which have

been  introduced  for perfectly good reasons in  the  past,  but

which could be rendered outdated and obsolete today, because the

reasons for which they were introduced may no longer be valid in

today's changed environment.  However, because these regulations

are  still in place, there is an added cost of compliance  which

may be an unnecessary burden on businesses and consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of regulations are what I call kiasu

regulations.  These are regulations which have the objective  of

protecting  the consumer or general public, but because  of  the

fact  that  they  are overly protective, they may  inadvertently

hinder entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twin objectives of lowering cost and encouraging

entrepreneurship   should  be  readily   accepted.    In   fact,

regulatory reform is precisely what has been occurring in  three

sectors  in Singapore today  -  finance, telecommunications  and

electricity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the financial sector, we are all aware of what is amounting

to   a   paradigm   shift   where  a  wide-ranging   series   of

liberalisation  and  promotional  measures  have  already   been

announced,  including the demutualisation of the stock  exchange

and   SIMEX.    These   are  designed  to  enhance   Singapore's

competitiveness  and to further promote Singapore's  positioning

as a financial centre.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the telecommunications sector, we have witnessed how the

entry  of  additional  suppliers in  various  telecommunications

market has resulted in dramatic reductions in cost of service to

the  consumer.   For example, the launch of the  third  Internet

service  provider,  Cyberway, in 1996, led to  the  offering  of

attractive   price  packages  by  the  three  Internet   service

providers.  Till this day, both SingNet and PacificNet  continue

to  take full-page advertisements to advertise innovative offers

to  attract  new  customers.  Similarly,  in  the  mobile  phone

market,  Mobile One and SingTel continue to engage in aggressive

price  competition,  much to the satisfaction  of  mobile  phone

users.   In  the  fixed  line segment of the  market,  a  second

operator, Starhub, is due to start operations next year.  I look

forward to likely reductions in price when this occurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson we learn from this is that in industries where there

are  few, or even one supplier, a monopoly situation, the  entry

of  new  operators will, by intensifying competition, result  in

more  competitive prices and a wider range of  products  with  a

better   quality.    Consumers  definitely  benefit.    Existing

operators also seem to be energised by the enhanced competition.

They  have risen to the challenge and continue to be profitable.

For  example, PacificNet was even successfully listed on  Nasdaq

recently.   This also goes to show that the Singapore market  is

not too small to support more than one or two suppliers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another industry which is in the midst of reform is

electricity.   It  was  only very recently  that  the  Singapore

Electricity  Pool  came into operation.   This  is  a  wholesale

electricity  market  designed to facilitate competition.   There

are  currently  three supplies to the Pool -  Power  Senoko  and

Power  Seraya  - which are separate entities owned by  Singapore

Power as well as Tuas Power.  I look forward to the awarding  of

the  tender  of  majority ownership of Tuas Power  in  the  near

future,  for  it would be interesting to see if  the  change  of

ownership would result in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>

lower  prices of electricity which would benefit both businesses

and the general public alike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely this kind of liberalisation, which we have

already  seen  in  these three markets, which serves  as  useful

examples.   And  we  need to see if there are  other  industries

which  could  benefit  from  liberalisation  and  the  entry  of

additional operators.  During the Committee of Supply, I will be

speaking  on  certain areas where I believe  that  a  regulatory

review would be beneficial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might ask why the need for a regulatory review now, at

this  point in time.  There are strong reasons to support  this.

First,  Singapore  is likely to encounter even  more  aggressive

competition  in  the  near  future  when  the  region  recovers.

Companies  in  the  region  will not only  be  leaner,  trimmer,

hungrier  for  business, but they will  also  have  the  initial

advantage  of  a  nominal depreciation vis-a-vis  the  Singapore

dollar.  Hence, it is important that costs in Singapore  do  not

bounce back quickly to pre-crisis levels in the near future.  In

the  light of this, a thorough examination of regulations  which

impact on costs would be timely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I believe that the crisis has accelerated the

pace  of  Singapore's  restructuring towards  a  knowledge-based

economy, just as the previous crisis in 1985/86 accelerated  the

pace  of  restructuring towards a higher value added economy  in

Singapore.   Hence,  it  is  important  to  remove   or   modify

regulations  which  hinder the move today towards  a  knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose that the Government

initiate   a   systematic  and  comprehensive  review   of   all

regulations, to examine whether they inadvertently or  otherwise

contribute  to  costs or inhibit entrepreneurship in  Singapore.

This  can be done by each and every Ministry, with feedback from

the  business sector which would know best which regulations are

excessively   irksome   where  cost  and  entrepreneurship   are

concerned.  This applies not only to business costs but also  to

costs which impact directly on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>

consumer,  and  which would ultimately feed back  into  business

cost through the demand for higher wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, now that the macro framework has been

settled, it is time to focus on the micro and, in particular, on

modifying  regulations, where necessary, in order to keep  costs

down and remove unnecessary constraints to entrepreneurship.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must say

that given the prevailing economic conditions, the Minister  for

Finance's  Budget  is an appropriate one.  It  is  a  remarkable

balancing act in ensuring that Singapore lives within its means,

maintaining  our  ability to compete in  the  market  place  and

looking after the needs and welfare of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very relieved that despite the relentless calls

from  various quarters, the Government has rightfully not dipped

into   our  reserves.   Singaporeans  must  realise  that  these

reserves are built up painstakingly over many years.  Hence,  it

must not be drawn at the first sign of trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the ordinary Singaporeans are also not

left  out  of the scheme of things.  The service and conservancy

charges,  utilities and rental rebates for the HDB  heartlanders

amounted to a sum of $142 million.  This is a big testimony that

the Singapore Government is a caring one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite the effective measures put up by the CSC

and  the  rebates  from the Budget, there  will  still  be  some

Singaporeans  who  need  help. They have  many  worries.   Jobs,

school  fees  and daily expenses are nagging concerns.   Meeting

the  medical  expenses  will  be  another  challenge.   In  each

financial  year,  from FY94 to FY97, the Government  contributed

$100  million to the capital sum of Medifund.  I am  pleased  to

note that for the year 1998 Medifund has paid out $13 million to

patients  from  the  lower-income families.   As  for  my  ward,

Punggol  South,  about $50,000 was granted  over  the  last  six

months.   Therefore, I urge the Government to continue  to  make

generous provisions for Medifund to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>

ensure  that the proceeds from its capital sum would be able  to

meet the increasing demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Development Council (CDC) is slowly but

surely  providing  its  worth during this  trying  period.   Its

active  role  of  helping the needy in our  community  with  the

various  assistance schemes deserves the Government's continuous

financial backing.  In Punggol South, we see an increase in  the

number   of   applicants  for  our  one-time  interim  financial

assistance  scheme  for  the unemployed.   For  the  last  three

months, we have an average of 20 cases per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other entities that have seen a growing role for

themselves are the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs).  They

are   often   very   spontaneous  in  offering   assistance   to

Singaporeans who need them. Thus, the Government can enhance the

effectiveness and ability to help Singaporeans by providing more

funds to the VWOs to computerise and to train their personnel in

such  areas like counselling management and care-giving  skills.

The  better  the trained VWO volunteers are the better  equipped

they are to offer help to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area of concern amongst Singaporeans is the

rising  bill  each  time they have to incur at  their  favourite

eating outlets like the coffeeshops and food courts.  Many of my

residents have come to share with me that they are very  puzzled

about  the price increases at the coffeeshops and wondered  what

these outlet proprietors have done with the rebates given by the

Government.   For instance, the 55% property tax  rebate  for  a

coffeeshop  of  about 4,000 sq ft means a saving of  $12,000  to

$15,000.   NTUC FairPrice and NTUC Foodfare are often  cited  as

good  examples of how cost savings have been ploughed  back  for

consumers' benefit.  These residents have wanted to know whether

the  Government has any monitoring mechanism to ensure at  least

some  justice is being done with regard to ploughing  back  cost

savings  from  tax  rebates and lower  prices.   I  think  their

concerns are valid and their request reasonable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

recently I represented the NTUC at a conference of trade  unions

in  Seoul.  What struck me was the passion in which many  fellow

unionists  in South Korea called for a move to bring the  labour

movement  into the mainstream of activity.  Obviously, they  are

very unhappy with the present lot.  It is the Government and the

major  employer  groups that are calling  the  shots.   All  the

unions  could  do  now  is  to  react.   They  expressed   their

frustration  by  calling  for massive  demonstrations  and  even

strikes.   What the Korean trade unionists want is to  influence

events, and not just to respond to decisions already taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hall reverberated with slogans, I counted myself as

fortunate that we have a system in Singapore where trade  unions

are a partner with Government and management in nation-building.

How  did  we  get to where we are today?  It was  because  of  a

critical decision taken by political and trade union leaders  in

the 1960s.  SM Lee Kuan Yew was then Prime Minister.  The labour

movement  was  headed by Mr C V Devan Nair.  At that  time,  our

labour  movement was already linked in a symbiotic  relationship

with  the  PAP.   But SM Lee felt that it was  not  enough  that

unions  worked  in harmony with  Government.  He wanted  to  see

unions develop equally close relations with management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's separation from Malaysia and the British withdrawal

were  events that made our union leaders sit up and realise that

the  old-fashioned confrontationist policies would be  suicidal.

And  so  the  groundwork  was laid for the  kind  of  industrial

harmony we enjoy today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble is that our style of industrial relations is often

seen  totally  in a different light in some other countries.   I

read  with  amusement a report that people in high  position  in

Hong Kong think that we have been able to cut wages in Singapore

because our unions are under the control of the Government.  Our

unions do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>

dance  to the tune of the Government or management.  We play  an

active   part   in  identifying  problems,  and  in   suggesting

solutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face daunting challenges. Our economy has been affected by

the regional crisis.  Close to 30,000 workers were retrenched in

1998.   How  many more will be laid off this year?  Workers  are

concerned  about  job  security.  So  our  labour  movement  has

initiated  training  programmes.   And  we  are  encouraged   by

workers'  response to training and retraining.  We  are  working

with  Government and management to find jobs for those  who  are

retrenched.   We know that some workers would have  problems  in

paying  for  their  children's textbooks and  uniforms.   So  we

provide education grants to them.  Our cooperatives also help by

lowering  cost of basic items. Other traders followed suit.   We

also got the bus companies and the MRT to lower costs.  Our  aim

is  to  get  workers to acquire skills so that they  can  remain

employable  for  life.  Our workers must  have  the  ability  to

operate  in  a  knowledge economy.  Of course, IT is  what  will

drive  the knowledge economy.  We must find imaginative ways  to

tell our workers what a knowledge economy is all about.  We need

to make them feel comfortable.  Not everyone can become computer

literate.   But  this  does  not mean that  they  cannot  access

knowledge  through computers.  There are computer  screens  that

operate  on  the touch system.  There is no need to key  in  the

secret codes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People not familiar with the computer system should go to the

URA  Gallery.  As you walk across the room, a big cinema  screen

comes  alive.  There is no need to touch anything.   Then  there

are  also computer screens where all you need is to touch.   You

point  to  what you want to see, and bingo, you get to see  what

you want to see!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is working with a company to develop IT kiosks, with

computer screens, operating also on the touch system.  Soon, you

will  find  the  i-ONE  kiosks  all  over  Singapore,  providing

information about our labour movement, among other things.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In due course, many things which now seem so complicated will be

made  simpler.  In a sense, it would be like the development  of

the telephone.  Initially, the vast majority of Singaporeans did

not  have  a  telephone at home.  Now there  is  hardly  a  home

without  a  phone.   Today,  mobile  phones  are  used  by  many

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the labour movement is committed to

playing  its part in moving Singapore into a knowledge  economy.

We  will spare no effort to look after and enhance the interests

of our workers.  We believe that we can do this by working as  a

social partner with Government and employers.  Together, we  can

create  even better paying jobs in the economy so that  we  will

have  enough  opportunities  for  all  Singaporeans  to  pursue.

Together,  we can create new and better skills in our  workforce

so  that  every  Singaporean  can  participate  in  a  knowledge

economy, and live a better life in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in the name of the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  last  year  when  we were debating  the  budget  that  was

presented  by the Minister, the recession was still not  on  us.

We had not gone into recession and we did not know what scars it

may leave in our society.  Indeed, the Minister and a number  of

others  were indulging in some wishful thinking that perhaps  we

would  not be hit hard and we would be all right, although there

were warnings from the outside that the recession would be worse

than the 1985 recession.  But now, a year down the road, we  can

see what the recession has done.  The evidence is all around us.

We  have  28,300 workers thrown out of employment  just  in  one

year.   We  do not have the figures for January and February  of

this year.  I do not know why they are not available.  I rang up

the  Ministry  of Manpower and they said, "We only produce  them

every   quarter."   These  28,300  workers  have   swelled   the

unemployed in Singapore to 82,400 as at 31st December 1998.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we were also told sometime ago that there were 21,000

Singaporeans above the age of 55 who have no CPF savings at  all

to  fall back on.  Many of our workers have not just lost  their

employment, but almost all others have suffered wage  cuts,  and

this  is  on  top of the cuts in the CPF savings.   And  as  the

Minister  said  in his Budget Statement, it has  badly  affected

those  above  40 years of age.  It is not just the workers,  the

businesses  are down.  We have been told of the drop in  tourist

arrivals  and  we know that several businesses have  closed  and

bankruptcies are on the increase.  So it is altogether a  gloomy

picture.  As the Minister said, we do not know whether 1999 will

be  any  better.  He says it is still too uncertain  to  predict

anything for 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of all these, the revenue is down by $3.1 billion.

It  is  against this background that the Government has come  to

present  its  programme to the people.  I say advisedly  to  the

people, because let us not forget this is a programme of how the

Government  proposes to use our people's monies in planning  for

them through this difficult period and beyond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was quite interested to see Mr Ngiam, the Permanent Secretary

to  the  Ministry of Finance, writing in the economic newsletter

from the Department of Economics of the University, say that the

one constant in every administration is the political imperative

behind   every  economic  decision.   He  says  politics  drives

economics.   I  was glad to see that admission  from  Mr  Ngiam.

But,  of  course, it is not new, without being disrespectful  to

him.   That was stated by Aristotle many centuries ago  when  he

said that politics was the master science.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am tempted to ask, and this does not appear in the

Minister's  Statement,  what  is  this  Government's   political

imperative in presenting the programme, not just for the  period

of  the  recession, the crisis, but beyond?   Do  the  political

imperatives include a concern for all our citizens, not  just  a

particular section or sections, but for all our citizens and for

their  plight  during the economic difficulties  that  they  are

facing?  This is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>

political  imperative because it is not just  simply  welfarism.

It shows a concern for those who have contributed to Singapore's

economy  during  the  good  days.  Or  is  it  the  Government's

political imperative that they have to get along as best as they

can?  We have got other matters to attend to, not that they  are

unimportant,  to  try  and  get the businesses  moving  and  the

economy  revived,  and  we cannot be over-concerned  with  their

plight.   That would show a complete lack of concern  for  their

situation and particularly, as I said, of the workers  who  have

contributed to economic progress.  And, of course, in  the  good

days,  we  had  tributes paid to them for their contribution  to

Singapore's economic progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other imperative I wish to know, whether it is one of the

Government's  imperatives, is how does it plan to  minimise  the

risk  of  further  recessions  down  the  road.   How  does  the

Government  see  this as possible?  Is it by  having  a  society

where all our citizens are well-equipped, that means, having the

necessary  basic  education to recognise  the  pitfalls  in  our

society that contribute to any recession that may come our  way?

Or  is  the imperative a society where the majority is left  out

from  making any contribution, and the contribution is  left  to

foreign  workers  and foreign companies, and the decision-making

on  economic matters left to a small minority of our people?  If

we adopt the latter, then we are robbing ourselves of the talent

in  our community.  We have got to make sure that we draw in all

the  talents that are available to us in Singapore, and not just

rely  on  the talents of a few people and particularly just  the

foreigners.   Of  course, it goes without  saying  that  if  our

citizens  are to play this role in making their contribution  to

our  economic  welfare  and progress, then  they  must  be  well

informed - and this is openness - on all economic activities  of

the  Government,  and be allowed to comment and  even  criticise

anything  that the Government proposes to do.  So  the  question

is:  is  the Budget preparing us for such a society  or  are  we

going to continue in the same way as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>

we have continued from one recession to another?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking in last year's budget, Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that the

Budget was disappointing.  I am afraid I have the word again for

it this year.  It is not only disappointing but it is imbalanced

in  the allocations made to the various Ministries.  Why  is  it

disappointing?   A writer in the Straits Times,  the  Government

media, reporting on the Budget said it was a Budget for the man-in-the-street.   I  do not know how he came to that  conclusion,

and  he  also  called it a "Singapore vintage".   Again,  I  was

puzzled by this.  It looked to me it was certainly a PAP vintage

Budget but hardly a Singapore vintage Budget, in the sense  that

Singaporeans  would  all be very happy and  overjoyed  with  the

Budget.  He perhaps called it a Budget for the man-in-the-street

because  of what the Straits Times in another article hailed  as

the  "goodies" for the heartlanders, the people who dwell in HDB

apartments.  I should not look at a gift horse in the mouth.  My

Party, of course, welcomes the relief that is being given and we

would  like  to say `thank you'.  But may I say that  even  that

might  appear  to be given grudgingly because the Minister  says

they would not get the benefit of the 10% income tax rebate that

35%  of the population will be receiving.  But, as I have  said,

let  us  not  be stinting in thanking the Government  for  this.

But,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, may I say it is small fare.  The rebates

on  utilities are offset by the increase in the water-borne fees

and  the conservation tax to take effect from 1st July.  So  the

Government would appear to be taking away with one hand what  it

gives with the other hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's debate, my Party called for a suspension of the

water  conservation  tax.  Clearly, that  has  not  merited  any

consideration  with  the  Government.   We  also  called  for  a

suspension  of the GST, or at least an exemption for  the  basic

necessities.  That, again, has fallen on deaf ears.  But  may  I

ask  the  Government how does it think these 82,400 people,  who

were  unemployed as at 31st December, are going to pay for their

food, their children's education and healthcare.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>

Talking  about  healthcare,  I see  that  the  revenue  for  the

Ministry  has  gone up by $2,066,000 whilst running  costs  have

come  down  by almost $18 million and the other operating  costs

have  come  down by $25 million.  But the charges  made  to  our

citizens  for attending outpatient centres and clinics and  cost

of  medicines would appear to remain the same.  Should they  not

be given some relief from the high costs of healthcare?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the children's education. I know there are

various  funds.   But  we  have called for  free  education  for

children  of  low income families, at least at the  primary  and

secondary  levels.  Why is that not possible if our  aim  is  to

create a knowledge-based economy?  If that is the purpose,  then

we  should be spending money on providing education for all.  We

should be aiming for an egalitarian society, not a society where

there are few elitists and the rest are left out.  How are  they

going  to pay for their transport costs and public transport  is

not  cheap?  The Minister says that the duration of unemployment

in 1998 was about 8.9 weeks.  How long have they been unemployed

now?   We were told some time ago that they had savings only  to

last them for about three months and for some, up to six months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, like the previous Budgets, does very little for our

citizens who will suffer most in this economic crisis.   Yet  it

is  those  people  who have been contributing  to  our  economic

progress.  We seem to take no account of that when it comes to a

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that we must not succumb to the lure of

welfarism  because, once we succumb, it will  be  impossible  to

reverse  it.   May  I assure the Minister, and  I  am  sure  the

Government   knows,  that  Singaporeans  are  not   asking   for

welfarism.   I do not think Singaporeans want welfarism  in  the

sense  that  it has been understood as paying them for  nothing.

But  these people have been thrown out of jobs through no  fault

of  their  own.   It has been forced on them.   They  have  been

forced to take pay cuts, again, through no fault of theirs.   So

is it welfarism to see that they are helped?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>

Is  it welfarism to see that their children's education does not

suffer?   We  keep talking about our only resource, our  people.

And is not education the best investment in that resource, if it

is our only resource?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is not welfarism that we are

asking  for, but a recognition of the contribution made  by  our

workers  and adequate caring for them in their times of trouble.

May I propose that the Government consider very seriously giving

a  cash  allowance to families who are in need during the period

of the crisis?  We called for this cash allowance to families in

need a long time ago but nothing has been done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must move on, Mr Speaker, Sir. I said it is also an

imbalanced Budget.  Although the revenue has gone down by 11.4%,

I  see  the  operating expenditure has gone up by 2% over  1998.

And  I  recall  that the Minister, speaking last  year  in  this

House, said that the Government intended to keep a tight lid  on

expenditure,  and this year, he again speaks about  the  aim  of

keeping  the  public sector lean and trim whilst  maintaining  a

high  quality of public service.  I do not want to run down  the

public  service.   It  is good.  But I am not  sure  that  every

Singaporean will agree that our public service is of a very high

quality.   The running costs, we were told, amount to about  $14

billion  and  92%  of  this goes to the  running  costs  of  the

Ministries.   The manpower expenses, we are told, amount  to  $3

billion.   That leaves about $11 billion for other expenditures.

We do not know what these running costs are.  Should we not have

some breakdown of the running costs of the Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a population of three million, or is it

that  we are approaching four million?  Do we need to spend  $14

billion,  in running costs, in governing ourselves?  I have,  in

the  past, and I was here in 1981 to 1986, called several  times

for  a  committee to examine the running costs of governing  us.

But, again, it has fallen on deaf ears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the imbalance is seen sharply, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

disproportionate allocations made to the Ministries.  Of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>

course, I go straight to defence.  I may be the only speaker  in

this  House who queries this expenditure on defence year in  and

year  out.  But may I assure the Minister that there are a great

many people outside who want to know why we are spending so much

on  defence.   Should  we not be told clearly  in  simple  terms

instead of just general language about the need to be ready, why

we  need to spend 25% of our monies on defence?  If you  add  to

that the cost of policing us and the civil defence, it comes  to

almost 1/3 of our monies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Mr Speaker, Sir, I informed the House of the spending

in  various  countries.   I said that out  of  a  total  of  167

countries,  only  about 24 or 25 were spending more  on  defence

expressed as a percentage in terms of their GDP.  That  was  for

1996.  I have not got any figures after that.  The Minister  for

Defence, replying partly to my call last year, spoke of the need

for high technology and the need to spend the money on providing

high technology.  Well and good.  But the question still remains

unanswered.   What is the threat that we are facing?   Where  is

the threat coming from?  And what form will the threat take that

we  need  to spend 25% of our monies on defence?  Is it that  we

wish  or  that  we intend to impose a mentality in our  citizens

that  they  are under siege, that they are besieged  by  enemies

outside  and  therefore we have to be prepared?  That  may  have

been  the  position years ago, in the 1950s or 1960s,  but  does

that still continue that we are being besieged or surrounded  by

hostile  neighbours?   After  all, we  are  members  of  several

defence pacts under which the members are obliged to come to the

defence of any country if it is attacked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a paranoia about being attacked from outside.

In  the  same way, I suppose, the Government and the PAP  suffer

from  opposition  parties.  There is a paranoia  about  allowing

opposition  parties to function and perform their  role  in  the

society.   I think one speaker in last year's debate  asked  the

House  to  look  at what happened to Kuwait.  What  happened  to

Kuwait?  When Kuwait was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>

attacked, the international community moved in.  So we have  the

United  Nations now and we should be backing the United  Nations

to  see that they provide some security for the small countries.

But  most important is we have got to make a calculation on  our

spending and see whether it is cost effective.  That is the most

important thing.  And again, I have been calling for a committee

to  study our defence needs and how much we need to spend on it.

There  has not been enough thought given to all this.  All  this

is  decided  for  us and we are told, "You, be careful,  we  are

going to be attacked.  So, we have got to be ready."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly is the amount proposed to be spent on education.

That  is  only less than a quarter of our monies.   And  health,

which  is another important factor, takes up only about 1/25  of

our  monies, whereas defence and security take up a third.   The

Committee  on  Singapore's Competitiveness rightly stresses  the

role  of  education in our economic progress and it is not  just

the retraining of our workers, important as it is, ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used up your

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  support  the  Budget  Statement by the Finance  Minister,  Dr

Richard Hu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, this budget would appear to be uneventful.

Some  people  commented  that it is like drinking  plain  water.

Yet,  it is a budget which is popularly supported by the  people

amidst this South-east Asian financial crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget deficit in 1999 has been increased from $470

million  in 1998 to $5.05 billion this year, or 3.5% of our  GDP

which  is the highest deficit in recent years.  The increase  in

the budget deficit is mainly due to the increase in  Development

Estimates  which is as high as S$13.94 billion,  accounting  for

48%  of our total expenditure or 9.8% of our GDP which is  again

one of the highest figures in the recent history of Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Finance Minister, this is to be treated as an

investment for our long-term development of our educational  and

economic  infrastructure. For the education budget, it  receives

S$5.7  billion, which is 4% of our GDP and is much  higher  than

the  3% in 1997 or 3.4% in 1998.  On the Development Expenditure

for  the Ministry of Education, it has also increased by 31%  or

S$2.2  billion, out of which S$1 billion will be  used  for  the

construction of schools and the other S$315 million will be used

on  IT facilities.  I am very glad that our Government would  be

able  to  spend so much money on education despite the  economic

crisis  we  are facing.  I hope that the Ministry  of  Education

would  build more schools so that they could implement the full-day  school  programme  as  soon  as  possible,  and  that  more

computers would be purchased to facilitate our students with  IT

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tax reduction, there is no big change in this budget,

except  for  a 10% rebate for corporate and personal income  tax

only.   However,  provisions are made to help our  lower  income

families  tide over these difficult times, unlike what the  NCMP

had  said  just  now. I welcome the rebates  given  to  the  HDB

dwellers in terms of rentals, utilities and S&C charges.  I hope

that  the  Government could also provide some form of assistance

to  those  who  are  retrenched or  unemployed  because  of  the

economic  downturn, as their families are suffering  because  of

their loss of income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that after the off-budget measures and

the   $10.5  billion  cost-cutting  package  announced  by   the

Government  last year, if the Government again gives some  cost-cutting  provisions  in this budget, it  would  send  the  wrong

message  to  foreign  investors and local businessmen  that  our

economy is getting worse.  Therefore, I feel that although  this

Budget is very cautiously tabled and seemingly uneventful,  like

plain water, it is nevertheless a confidence-boosting budget.  I

believe  that  foreign investors will continue to come  here  to

invest  and  local  businessmen would also make  a  comeback  to

recapture  lost ground, thereby helping to  resolve our  present

unemployment problems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, to look beyond the economic crisis and put our

focus  on  the  strategic industrial development after  recovery

from the crisis is the correct thing to do.  Our Government  has

been  cautious in avoiding over-reacting to the present  crisis,

particularly at this time where there are signs of recovery  for

the  economies in the  region.  I think this budget  would  give

people  more confidence and would alleviate their worries  about

our economic future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since its inception in July 1997, the

Asian  financial crisis has been sustained for  more  than  11/2

years.  Although the crisis has quite seriously impacted on  us,

our  sound financial system and solid economic fundamentals have

stood  us  well  in withstanding this financial  turmoil.   Now,

with  some signs of recovery in the Asia-Pacific region, I  feel

that the Government and our people should not be too pessimistic

about  our  future.   We  should see how  we  could  seize  this

opportunity  and  move one step higher.  The  Government  should

also  consider  creating an environment which  is  conducive  to

foreign  investors and local businessmen to invest  here.   This

will help them to build up their business and, at the same time,

bring out the  entrepreneurship among our Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first day of Chinese New Year this

year,  when   community leaders, friends and relatives  came  to

greet  me, at first, I would avoid using the traditional Chinese

greeting of "Gong Xi Fa Cai" because with this financial  crisis

and all the troubles in this region, no one will believe that we

can  fa cai or strike a fortune this year.  So I just said  very

plainly, "Good Luck, Good Health".  But then by the sixth day of

Chinese New Year, my feelings changed because on the fourth  day

of  the  Chinese  New Year, ie, on 19th February,  the  Japanese

Parliament  approved an unprecedented  huge budget of  S$1,211.5

billion to rescue the Japanese economy with the hope that in the

new  financial year starting on 1st April, it would be  able  to

rescue  Japan  from  its  economic  recession  which  had   been

troubling them over the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>

last  eight days.  I have full confidence in this rescue package

of the Japanese Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the sixth day of Chinese New Year, ie, on 21st February,

the Government of the People's Republic of China decided that it

would  expand  its domestic demand and strive  for  7%  economic

growth this year and they also stated categorically that the RMB

would  not  be  devalued.   With  all  my  years  of  experience

investing  in China, I feel that this is not an impossible  task

for  the  Chinese  government.  And then on 19th  February,  the

Finance  Minister  of Taiwan also announced that  Taiwan's  five

main financial reform measures were receiving immediate positive

results.    Therefore, from the sixth day  of  the  Chinese  New

Year,  I  began to say "Gong Xi Fa Cai" again because I  was  no

longer pessimistic about our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Chinese New Year this year, there are a lot of

changes  in the economic situation in Asia-Pacific.  Apart  from

India  and  Indonesia,  there  are  many  countries  which   are

beginning  to  see light of recovery at the end of  the  tunnel.

For  some countries, they see hope of getting out of the present

financial  crisis.   Apparently, the  launch  of  the  Euro  and

Brazil's  financial turbulence have also caused  some  upheavals

to  the  stock  markets in this region.  However, the  financial

market was able to recover its tranquility in a relatively short

time.  Apart from the attempt to stimulate its economic recovery

by  the  passing  of  a S$1,211.5 billion budget,  the  Japanese

Government  also  adjusted  its currency  policy  to  lower  the

Japanese yen exchange rate to its lowest in  three months.   The

margin  of depreciation of the currencies of the other countries

in  this  region remains quite normal. There was  no  particular

upheaval  in the forex market. On the contrary, I have  observed

that  the  exchange rates of the currencies of  these  countries

have  rebounded by about 5% to 30% vis-a-vis last year's values.

In  the stock market and real estate market, there have been  no

more  slips  and there seems to be a tendency of  stable  climb.

All these changes are very encouraging.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, many countries in the Asia-Pacific have also

increased their budget to stimulate their country's economy  and

to  increase the need for their imports.  According to a report,

in  January,  Korea  has increased 15.4% in  their  imports  and

Thailand has increased by about 1.6%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a speech delivered at a function of the New York Foreign

Policies Association, the Managing Director of IMF, Mr Camdessus

said, "Apparently, the economy of the Asia Pacific region is  in

the process of recovery, and for the world's economy,  the worst

seems  to  be over already."    He admitted that, of late,   the

mistake  of  IMF was to be over-pessimistic about  the  economic

prospects.  He also felt that the economic reform plans  adopted

by  the  Asia-Pacific  region were already  beginning  to  prove

effective,  and that Korea and Thailand have apparently  stepped

out of their economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that there are already some silver

linings  appearing from the black clouds overhanging  the  Asia-Pacific's   economy.  The  financial  situation  is  stabilised,

foreign  trade is gradually improving and foreign  reserves  are

increased.    This  year, the Philippines  issued  international

bonds  to  secure  more financing from  international  financial

houses  and  to  buy  in  US dollars from the  foreign  exchange

market,  thus substantially increasing the foreign  reserves  of

the  Philippines.   Malaysia  has  also  increased  its  foreign

reserves  by 40%, attaining a high of US$28 billion in  a  short

period of time. The Philippines' foreign reserves reached  US$12

billion  in  February this year, back to the  level  before  the

currency  crisis.   As  for Thailand and  Korea,  their  foreign

reserves  have  risen to US$29 billion and US$52.2 respectively.

All these increases in foreign reserves will help the countries'

debt repayment and import capabilities, and indirectly stabilise

the  exchange  rates.  More importantly, the five countries  and

territories  which  have  the highest foreign  reserves  in  the

world,  namely,  Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan  and  Singapore

are  all  in  the  Asia-Pacific region.   This  shows  that  the

resilience and ability to rebound in the Asia Pacific's  economy

is very strong.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the world's semi-conductor industry is also showing

signs  of  recovery with expected growth of 8% this year.   This

will  in  turn  bring about more exports of electronic  products

such  as  personal computers,  mobile telephones, etc. and  this

will  be  beneficial  to South-East Asian countries  whose  main

exports are   electronic products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, I would say that there are already signs of

recovery  in  the  Asia  Pacific's economy.   I  hope  that  the

Government and our people will not  be overly pessimistic  about

the Asia Pacific's economy.  We must be properly prepared. Apart

from  consolidating our domestic economy  so that we would  have

more  and  more  good  years of economic prosperity  ahead,  the

Government   should  also  do  more  to  create  an  environment

conducive  to investment by foreign and local entrepreneurs,  by

providing financing facilities and simplified procedures.   This

will  not only help our business people to tide over the crisis,

but  also  prepare them properly so that they would be  able  to

seize  good  opportunities   when  the  Asia  Pacific's  economy

recovers,  and  make  a  comeback to better  contribute  to  our

country's economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our local businessmen must also seize the

opportunities that may be available to them with the recovery of

the  Asia Pacific's economy.  In general, we must encourage  our

local  businesses  and MNCs to venture into   the  Asia  Pacific

region this year.  Be the "early bird that catches the worm" and

pick  the  right  opportunities  to  invest  and  develop  their

business   for   good  returns.  I  hope  that   the   financial

institutions in Singapore will quickly and resolutely take  this

kind  of economic recovery into consideration, and be daring  in

providing  financing facilities to the more  reliable  promising

local  businesses so as to help them to seize such opportunities

as  they  come  along.   This will be helpful  to  our  economic

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a survey by MasterCard International revealed that

there  has been significant increase in the  consumer confidence

index.   As a businessman,  my feeling for the economy  and  the

market is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>

more  direct  and sensitive.  In view of  this  whole  bunch  of

good  news,  I believe that the new year ahead will indeed be  a

good  year for us to  gong xi fa cai.   Let us work hand in hand

to prepare ourselves to receive gong xi  fa cai .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would describe this as a strategic budget, one for the long

term  and  one  that  would allow us to take  advantage  of  the

opportunities when the region recovers.  Because we  can  expect

some  intense competition from neighbours when and should  their

restructuring  efforts succeed in making them  more  competitive

and efficient.  It is a predictable budget but, in this case, it

is  good  because it demonstrates that we are not distracted  by

short-term   challenges  and  remain  focused   on   fundamental

principles that have proven to be successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, however, to highlight five main areas which I

think   deserve   more   attention  from   the   Minister:   (1)

strengthening  our commitment and presence in  the  region;  (2)

enhancing the capacity and capability of our SMEs; (3) assisting

the  retrenched  and unemployed; (4) encouraging and  motivating

positive  attitudes  towards conservation;  and  (5)  developing

social cohesion.

<br><br><i>Strengthening our commitment and presence in the region</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite great efforts in regionalisation, we still face

many problems.  We hear of many failures than success.  What has

happened  to  our  Growth Triangle?  Our  investments  in  China

continue to throw up many surprises.  But such is the nature and

risk  of  investment despite the fact that we are most  familiar

with  the  region.   One of the problems we have  today  is  the

inability  to  reconcile  the dichotomy  between  political  and

economic  relationships, that when political  relationship  goes

through a bad patch, it seems to discourage many companies  from

committing themselves or investing in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>

country.   Should  this  be  so?  Can  businesses  and  economic

relationships  not  be  based on mutually  rewarding  principles

continue  to survive the occasional and, of course, of  late,  a

little bit more frequent, political challenges?  Like it or not,

we  cannot change our geography.  The region will continue to be

our  major market for our products and hinterland to expand  our

industrial base.  It is still the region we know best where  our

relations are still strong, where our best hopes lie.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our forefathers brought prosperity to this country as

middlemen.  With only goodwill and friendship with neigbours  as

tools  of  trade, now, more than ever before,  we  need  to  re-establish this goodwill between our people and our businesses to

be  strong enough to withstand the occasional political hiccups.

We  need  to  strengthen and deepen this relationship  with  our

neighbours   beyond  political  relationships,  which   can   be

uncertain, but between businesses and between people.  We should

send  a  strong  signal to encourage and motivate  companies  to

develop  and  reinforce this relationship.  We  should  not  let

failures  to  discourage us from continued  commitment  to  this

region.   The  financial  policies  and  budget  allocation  can

reflect  this by making the necessary provision to assist  these

companies to establish their presence and infrastructure in  the

region.   The  economy in the region may be bad, but  there  are

still good companies out there.  We can help local companies  to

develop strategic relations through mergers and acquisitions, as

this may be the right time to forge such relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the humanitarian front, we can do more to help and

assist  our  neighbours,  through  food  aid  and  other  social

projects.   We  can create long-term goodwill, for  example,  by

increasing  the  number of students under the ASEAN  scholarship

programme, or perhaps offer training and scholarships  not  only

in  educational institutions but to broaden the  scope  of  this

programme,  eg,  to  train other professionals  in  the  region.

Government institutions, eg, hospitals and social agencies,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>

can  all  participate in this effort to strengthen relationships

and reinforce ties with our friends in the region.

<br><br><i>Enhancing the capacity and capability of SMEs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of SMEs are traders and distributors. They have

strong  entrepreneurial skills, but many do not  own  their  own

unique product of service.  Most of them are suppliers to  MNCs.

We  need to do more to help our SMEs.  They must be nurtured  to

be  a  strong  base of our economy, very much  like  in  Taiwan,

because  an  economy  that  is too  dependent  on  MNCs  can  be

vulnerable.   If  these companies decide to  withdraw  from  the

region  to support their local industries back home, our economy

can  be  severely affected.  While the Local Enterprise  Finance

Scheme has been expanded, it is still primarily to finance plant

and  machinery and for investment in Singapore.  What is  needed

is  to  help SMEs to strengthen their presence and operation  in

the region, and to support initiatives to explore new markets in

other  regions.  We need to do more to encourage SMEs  to  merge

and  form  bigger  companies and be  better  able  to  withstand

increasing  competition.   GLCs can take  the  lead  by  forming

strategic alliances and partnerships with local SMEs.  This  may

be  a  difficult  task  but one that we cannot  run  away  from,

because  it is extremely important that our SMEs are strong  and

large  enough to be regional or perhaps global players.  I  hope

to  see  a  more  focused and determined effort to  nurture  and

financially  motivate  SMEs  so  that  they  can  enhance  their

capacity and capability to be  truly regional players.

<br><br><i>Assisting the retrenched and unemployed</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retrenched or unemployed are not just unskilled or poorly

skilled  workers.   It  affects also the  skilled  managers  and

executives.   Even good and hardworking staff can be retrenched.

For  most  of  these  people, the need for help  is  urgent  and

immediate.  Not many have enough savings to help them cope  with

long  periods of unemployment.  With depreciating asset  values,

selling  off  their  homes and cars may no longer  be  a  viable

option.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>

They  cannot  think of retraining or other long-term  solutions.

To  them,  the most pressing need is to get a job and  ease  the

pain  of  their  financial burden.  The  subsidies  for  rental,

utilities  and S&C charges are timely.  But I hope the  Minister

would   be  more  generous  in  allocating  funds  for  welfare,

bursaries and scholarships and to make them more accessible.  We

should do more to help their children and families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can also help lessen the burden in other ways by

being more understanding in the collection of various Government

and  statutory  board  charges and fees.  We  must  ensure  that

deficit  spending  does  result  in  either  job  creation   for

Singaporeans or helping them ease the burden.  Deficit  spending

does  not necessarily translate to higher GDP growth because  of

the  large  import content of our spending.  But as long  as  it

creates jobs or helps them pay their bills, it would improve the

welfare of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Manpower Ministry and NTUC have done quite a lot to

help  retrenched workers, we can do more to help a higher  level

of  managers  and  executives.  Why not  make  the  Ministry  of

Manpower a first-stop placement agency and help search  or  find

another job for all types of employees?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not training for managers and executives too? They too need

to  be  retrained, retooled and reskilled.  Where can they  turn

to?   Can  the civil service and statutory boards, for  example,

take  in more part-time or outsource most of their work to these

self-employed professionals, not only to support these people in

times  of  economic crisis but perhaps to make  Government  lean

and,  hopefully,  develop a whole new industry of  self-employed

people?   This is becoming increasingly common in some countries

like the US, but I suspect will be more significant in Singapore

too in the future.

<br><br><i>Encouraging positive attitudes towards conservation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the issue of water supply has brought about greater

consciousness amongst Singaporeans about the need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>

for  conservation.  I would therefore like to see, in  fact,  in

the Budget, a more specific attempt to motivate and incentivise,

eg,  property developers and industrialists to invest in  energy

conservation programmes and equipment as part of our  consistent

and  long-term effort to make energy conservation a way of life.

However,  in reality, some of these equipment tend  to  be  more

expensive than conventional ones and, until and unless  we  help

develop   a  local  market  that  is  large  enough  to  support

conservation  efforts,  energy  conservation  will  continue  to

remain expensive and inconvenient.

<br><br><i>Developing social cohesion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen recent attempts to test social cohesion and

multi-racial   understanding  of   our   people.    Fortunately,

Singaporeans are determined not to let foreigners interfere with

our  social issues or agenda.  However, we cannot take this  for

granted.   The  recent  debate on discrimination  faced  by  job

seekers,  if  not  well managed, can lead  to  problematic  race

relations.   We have agencies like the CDCs that are now  tasked

to  forge community bonding amongst our people.  Perhaps we  can

have  programmes where self-help groups are encouraged  to  come

together;  all  this  for the purpose of  exposing  our  people,

especially  our children, to have more contact with  friends  of

other races, religions and economic backgrounds.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  in  support of the motion standing in the name  of  the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement this year, though cautious, is a

prudent  one against a backdrop of the regional crisis  and  the

two   off-budget  measures  last  year.   The  most  significant

highlight  in  this  year's Budget is perhaps the  unprecedented

budget  deficit projected at $5.1 billion.  The projected budget

deficit  is  mainly a result of reduced revenues than  increased

expenditures.  In fact, the expenditure is rising only  by  $1.5

billion  or  about  6%  compared to the past  year.   While  the

reduced  revenues  resulting  from tax  concessions  are  indeed

welcomed by all,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>

there  are  those who feel that there could have been a  greater

balance  in  the  range  of  growth sectors  which  should  have

benefited   from  these  fiscal  measures.   For  example,   the

financial  services sector is very pleased with the measures  to

develop the bond market.  However, with the Government's  stated

intention  to  make  Singapore a knowledge-based  economy,  more

fiscal  measures  could  have been  introduced  in  this  year's

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to mention three of these possibilities

based on feedback from the public and media.  First, there is  a

need  to  introduce  tax  deduction for  the  purchase  of  home

computers.   Presently, there is a heavy emphasis to  equip  our

schools  with  computers  on a ratio  of  two  students  to  one

computer  within  the next few years.  But school  students  and

working  adults alike would find that having a home computer  in

the  age  of  the  Internet and e-commerce  is  very  essential.

Already more than 40% of homes in Singapore have a computer.   I

feel that to help the remaining homes own a computer through the

deduction  of the hardware cost against the personal income  tax

or  through a grant for HDB dwellers who may not be in  the  tax

bracket,  will go a long way in enhancing our nation's  computer

literacy.  This will also help level the playing field  for  the

younger generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need to lower the cost of information

and  knowledge acquisition.  One of the key ways  in  which  new

knowledge  and information are tapped is through licensing.   It

is  common now to exploit licensed knowledge and information  in

the reseller markets where licensed technology is repackaged for

sale, either as products or services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of licensing is the royalty or licence fee

payable.  Typically, there is a withholding tax cost, which  the

licensee is required to bear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our knowledge infrastructure getting in place,

Singapore is well positioned to become a reseller hub.  Reducing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>

the  withholding  tax  costs  would certainly  help  boost  this

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchase of information and knowledge outright requires

capital  investment.  I understand that presently our  tax  laws

consider  the  acquiring  of  patents,  know-how  knowledge  and

information  as  capital  in nature.   Unless  it  qualifies  as

approved  patents  or know-how, no deduction is  given  for  the

investment  cost  incurred.  From an economic standpoint,  these

intellectual  properties and rights are  the  very  things  that

help create the final outputs, be it goods or services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets used in a business are given wear and tear

allowances  only  if they qualify as plant and  machinery.   But

this  concept  is somewhat dated.  In this information  age,  we

need  to  completely review this if Singapore  is  to  become  a

knowledge based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual properties and rights, whether purchased or

created  in-house, are like plants and machinery in a knowledge-based  economy.   These are the tools with which businesses  are

done   and  carried  out.   Such  costs  should  be  given   tax

deductions, just like plants and machinery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a need to encourage employee share options

especially  as  we try to attract foreign talent  to  build  our

knowledge-based  economy.   In  the  US,  many  IT  firms   have

succeeded  in attracting and retaining IT professionals  because

of  their  very attractive employee stock options.  The  US  tax

laws also facilitate this use of employee stock options.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, tax is imposed at the time the options are

exercised.  The taxable amount is based on the excess of  market

value  at the time of the exercise over the cost of acquisition.

This  does  not  necessarily encourage  employee  share  options

because  share options are exercised when the market values  are

higher than the option price but the full amount is taxed in the

year  of exercise.  As the values of quoted shares move  up  and

down over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>

time,  the  tendency  is to sell at least  some  of  the  shares

immediately to fund the tax payment and to lock in the reward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current tax code does not encourage employees to hold

on  to  their  shares, and there is a need to  make  fundamental

changes in this regard.  The present system could be adopted  in

a  number  of  ways to encourage share ownership  and  long-term

employee commitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the Finance Minister would consider

these three tax change suggestions to develop and grow our human

capital as we move towards a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has attributed to, as one of the

main factors contributing to Singapore's economic slowdown,  the

sharp   contraction  in  regional  demand.   The  economies   of

Indonesia,  Thailand, Malaysia, Korea and Hong  Kong,  have  all

suffered recessions.  The financial crisis has brought  with  it

damage  to  economies, decimation of wealth, job  loss  and,  in

certain   instances,  political  fall  outs.   As  a  relatively

unaffected  country amidst the regional turmoil,  Singapore  has

been  facing increasing pressure to provide financial assistance

as a favour to aid its fellow ASEAN members.  One may also argue

that  such monetary transfers may be the necessary stimulant  to

revive and reinstate the much needed regional demand so vital to

our own economic well-being.  The Budget, however, is silent  on

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The validity of such claims needs to be assessed using two

yardsticks: firstly, does Singapore have the capacity to provide

such forms of foreign aid and, secondly, is foreign monetary aid

the  best  solution  to the problems that cause  chaos  in  such

countries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Singapore economy grew very

rapidly  in  the  past,  but the size of  our  national  income,

measured  in monetary terms, is much smaller than the  potential

income of our neighbours.  A suitable analogy is that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  is  akin  to  a  rabbit and our  neighbours  are  the

equivalent  of  elephants.   As a small  state  without  natural

resources,  Singapore  bears  no illusions  about  its  inherent

capabilities, with its GNP at only around 1% that of the  United

States, a major provider of foreign aid.  As such, we are in  no

position  to  make available, in unconditional  terms,  monetary

assistance  to the magnitude that major developed countries  are

capable of.  Nevertheless, we have consistently tried to  assist

Indonesia  within  our  limited means since  the  start  of  the

crisis.   Examples  include  the proposed  US$5  billion  trade-financing  credit facility, and our commitment  to  extend  S$12

million  worth  of  rice  and supplies as  humanitarian  aid  to

Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has, however, come under criticism for

stipulating  tough  conditions  for  the  usage  of  the  trade-financing  credit  facility.   The  real  problem  lies  in  the

divergence  of  views  on  how  Singapore  can  or  should  help

countries which are suffering from the current crisis.  There is

a  general belief that the rich should help the poor,  that  the

haves should assist the have-nots.  Moreover, the interdependent

nature  of  regional trade and investment has led to  assertions

that  Singapore's  prosperity has, to an extent,  been  achieved

using the resources of its regional neighbours.  As such, we are

now expected to give generously and without conditions.  It must

be  reiterated that the proposed trade financing package serves,

essentially, an enabling function: the main impetus  is  to  aid

Indonesia along the path to recovery by allowing normal economic

functions,  like trade, which have been hampered by the  crisis,

to  continue.   The folly of advancing financial transfers alone

without  ensuring  its effective usage is  well  illustrated  in

academic  studies  on  the efficacy  of  foreign  aid.   Let  me

elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been extensively documented that cash transfers

alone  are unable to foster economic growth and recovery if  the

money  was  deployed  poorly.  In many instances,  economic  and

political   difficulties  are  concoctions   of   specific   and

particularistic circumstances prevailing within  countries,  and

few of such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>

problems  are  amenable to external intervention or  assistance.

Sound   domestic  policies  remain  the  key  solution  in   the

generation  of economic recovery and growth, such as reforms  in

the  financial sectors, the adoption of appropriate  fiscal  and

monetary  policies  and  the  nurturing  of  a  solid  political

foundation  and a firm social fabric.  Countries suffering  from

economic difficulties should try to help themselves by restoring

social  stability which is necessary for growth and development.

Once   stability  is  restored,  foreign  investors,   including

Singaporeans, will start to trade and invest again.  This is the

correct  way  to  generate badly needed  economic  recovery  and

social  stability.  This is also a more dignified way  for  such

countries to emerge from the economic chaos, continue growing at

their own momentum and realise their inherent potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the offering of aid need not be manifested in cash

transfers.  Singapore has provided assistance in other  concrete

forms.   We  have been a strong advocate that ASEAN moves  ahead

with  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area initiative.   Such  policies

precipitate  positive  externalities  which  benefit  all  ASEAN

members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has also set aside S$12 million under the

Singapore   Cooperation   Programme   to   provide   about    30

undergraduate  scholarships a year for ASEAN students  over  the

next  three  to  four  years for study in Singapore.   Upon  the

completion of their studies, these students will return to serve

and contribute to their own countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's fortunes and ASEAN's are intertwined.

Singapore  cannot  afford  to let  other  countries  falter.   I

believe  that within our means we have done our best to  assist,

and hope that they do not falter.  In this regard, I support the

approach taken by the Government in offering assistance packages

to countries in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget tabled by the Minister for

Finance.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, thank you

for allowing me to join in this debate on the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise some comments on Finance policy that

I hope the Minister might respond to and clarify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who think that this Budget is a "non-event".

To  the contrary, I think that there are people who are watching

what  Singapore does in the face of this crisis.  What we do  or

do  not do has significance, not just for individual pockets and

corporate coffers in Singapore, but also in the region  and  the

international context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the recent past, economists and politicians alike

believed,  "We are all Keynesians now", as the late US President

Richard Nixon said.  What this means is that when faced  with  a

financial  or economic downturn, the answer lies with a  greater

government  role.  Government has to tax and spend, or  if  they

cannot   tax,  then  it  should  go  into  deficit  and   spend.

Government spending and Government's role was the central key to

continued  economic good times.  Government, in this  view,  was

not  only  the  regulator but also the active  manager  and  big

player  in the economy.  State-owned enterprises, subsidies  and

the  welfare  state were outgrowths of this thinking.   This  is

especially  in Europe, but also in many parts of the  developing

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have changed since then. Internationally, in almost

every  continent,  we  have  seen  a  movement  away  from   the

Government  to  the  market  as  an  arbiter  of  the   economy.

Singapore  has not been left out of this movement.   Indeed,  we

have been one of the first countries to move away from socialism

towards   the   world   market   emphasising   investment    and

international  trade.  As a marker of this, some observers  have

applauded our economy as the "freest economy" in Asia, ahead  of

Hong Kong.  This movement and accolade are largely welcome.  But

an emphasis on the market is not an absolute blessing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries that have moved to the market have lesser ability to

participate in their economies and less ability to control

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

their  economies.  In good times, this may not matter.   In  bad

times,  however, there may be fewer tools and policies available

for  the  Government to intervene.  If the Government intervenes

to bail out bad companies, or to establish welfare services that

are  beyond  the  ability of its budget, then the  international

market  will  rate  their  economic  potential  for  the  future

accordingly and they will go elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore, the first limitation to what our Government

can  do  for  our economy and our people.  In a  world  that  is

moving towards the market, it would prejudice the confidence  of

the  international community if we pull back.   Yet,  we  cannot

stand  idly  by as our economy and our citizens are hit  by  the

crisis.   It  therefore becomes a question of making  the  right

interventions  that  are helpful for the  present  and  for  the

longer  term, and which are acceptable to our people and to  the

international community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question that Government can do everything or, on

the  other  hand,  that  we should rely  only  on  the  markets.

Rather,  it becomes a question of governing the market,  as  the

political economist, Robert Wade, suggests.  That is to say,  we

require  government  action and policy that  are  in  line  with

market forces, but allied to achieving public and social good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we are not alone in this. In many developed countries,

there  is a wish to continue and restore growth through economic

globalisation,  but  also a wish to soften the  sometimes  harsh

consequences of the market on ordinary people.  There  has  been

as such, talk of looking for a "Third Way", especially in the UK

and USA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, when we consider this deficit

budget  and the financial policy of this Government, it  is  not

the  size  per  se of the deficit that should  concern  us.   We

should  instead  consider  two  basic  questions:   (1)  Are  we

spending  money  in  the right way?  (2)  Are  our  policies  in

taxation sending the right incentives and signals to our people?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn, first, to the money we are spending. The

Government  has  emphasised  the need  to  continue  development

expenditure in key areas such as education and defence.  I agree

that  we  must  think of the long term and use our  reserves  to

develop areas that will advantage us in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On education, I welcome the continued expenditure. But in this

light, in planning for the future, I would call for Government's

assistance in two areas of more immediate concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is of children and education. Schooling is not

compulsory  by  law in Singapore.  In good times everyone  knows

and  most  can afford to emphasise education for their children,

for  their future.  My concern is that this calculation  changes

in  this  time of crisis.  I urge the Government to monitor  the

number  of drop-outs where this may result from changed economic

circumstances.   Sufficient and more generous bursaries  may  be

necessary.   These should support not just the direct  costs  of

schooling  a child but the opportunity cost of the family  as  a

whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second immediate concern regarding education is of self-improvement by our citizens. As we tool up for the knowledge-based economy (KBE), we should try to make sure that all

Singaporeans  have  a  chance  and  the  incentive   for   self-improvement.   Government has generously funded schemes  as  the

main plank, but individuals may also wish to invest in their own

self-improvement.   And where they choose to do  so,  Government

should  support  those decisions with the right incentives.   In

this  regard,  the Budget proposes an exemption  of  $2,500,  an

increase of $500.  But perhaps this may be insufficient,  and  I

would urge the Minister to consider a higher tax exemption.   In

this sense, I am arguing that we need to link the long-term view

of  investing in education to the short-term realities in  these

difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn next to defence expenditure. Like many other

speakers, I see the need for good defence force as a factor of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>

stability in these troubled times.  Peace and security  are  the

bedrock  for  our democracy.  I would, however, raise  two  more

specific questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I note that it is not only the development expenditure

that  has increased, but also the operating expenditure, by some

$160   million.    The   difference  between   development   and

expenditure  is  a bit like between investment and  consumption.

May  I  ask  the  Minister or his colleague,  the  Minister  for

Defence,  to  clarify the need for increases in consumption,  in

this  sense, in this time of crisis?  More, generally,  I  would

like  to  ask  the Government if there are ways of  benchmarking

efficiency  and  sufficiency in the Armed Forces.   I  ask  this

particularly in light of the recent second report of the  Public

Accounts Committee of November 1998 that reports some lapses  in

MINDEF's accounting practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on defence. Our expenditure has remained quite

constant, if not increased, and this is a stark comparison  with

reductions among many of our neighbours in this time of  crisis.

Of  course, we should be well defended, and I am not encouraging

us to downgrade our expenditure according to our neighbours.  We

should  not  beggar ourselves because they  are  poor.   But  my

concern is that our defence spending should not by itself  be  a

source  of misunderstanding and concern in the region.  I  would

encourage dialogue and transparency to allay any suspicion  that

we are taking an aggressive posture and not simply an investment

in a sound defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn next to another area of expenditure - social

assistance.   There have been many calls to assist  Singaporeans

in  this  time of crisis.  I do not wish to add to  the  various

wish  lists.  This crisis should not see the overnight  creation

of  a welfare state in Singapore.  I do however wish to call  on

the  Government to consider ways of innovating the ways in which

it  will  spend  money.   We too should, between  a  suffocating

welfare  state  and often harsh local marketplace,  look  for  a

"third way".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One clear area for innovation is to specifically target

those  who  have lost their jobs.  The Budget has  given  a  10%

rebate to all individuals.  Some may consider this insufficient.

But  I understand that Government cannot help everyone all  that

more,  given the current deficit already.  But there  should  be

special   targeting  in  Government  assistance.   I  think   in

particular  of  those who have lost their  jobs  and  have  been

unable to find employment again for extended periods.  For these

people,  I hope the Government will consider temporary  measures

to  assist  them further.  Areas such as housing,  the  cost  of

their  children's  education, re-training and the  creation  and

match-making to casual or part-time work should be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second area is in jobs and discrimination. This is an

issue  that  has arisen recently, especially as regards  private

sector  hiring.   If this is not addressed, the economic  crisis

will test our social cohesion.  The Government has responded  to

that  by  saying  that  it  will discourage  discrimination  and

encourage  meritocracy.  I support this.  I would also  call  on

the Government to monitor the situation closely and continue  to

set  a  moral  leadership in its own hiring.  We sometimes  take

meritocracy  and rights against discrimination for granted  when

times  are good.  But especially in these bad times, meritocracy

and human rights must be a shield to protect our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third way in which I think we should innovate in our

spending  is  to encourage giving among the citizens themselves.

Our Government has moved away from a welfare state, dependent on

the  Government  and its spending, to a policy of  many  helping

hands.   This requires private sector help and giving.  In  this

time  of  crisis,  there is a pressure on these  private  hands.

When  companies  are showing bad results or losses,  it  becomes

very difficult to sustain the giving to charities and other good

causes.   If companies, families and individuals still  give,  I

think  they  should receive greater support from Government.   I

call  on  the Government to double tax exemptions for  companies

and  individuals who continue to give to charities, arts  groups

and other causes, and to give tax

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>

incentives  to  families who support their own members  who  are

dependants or who have lost their jobs.  This approach does not,

I  want to emphasise, create a dependency on the State.  Rather,

I  call  on  the State to encourage members of our community  to

help  each  other.  This will increase our social  cohesion  and

grow our heartware.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn finally to Singapore and the region. The

Budget  reacts to the regional economic crisis.  For it  is  the

crisis, and not our own internal factors, that is affecting  our

performance.   Conversely, I believe that we must  consider  and

respond to the crisis.  In so doing, our foreign and our foreign

economic policy is not a distraction from the economic situation

but  an  important  task that is linked to  possible  routes  to

recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region's financial crisis has led to social and

political changes in our region, among our neighbours.  There is

a  sense  of  autarky  and a narrow nationalism  rising  in  the

countries around us.  There are inclinations to close borders to

foreign   capital.    There  are  great   social   dislocations,

especially  among the poor, the young and the women.   A  UNICEF

report  has warned of a lost generation in our region - children

who drop out of school with little or no education.  Neither  of

these developments - the autarky or this lost generation - would

be in Singapore's interest, or our neighbours'.  What can we do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our role in this may be very difficult. There have been

unwarranted  and  unfounded criticisms of us by our  neighbours.

These may anger our own citizens.  But we should not over-react.

People  will say things in desperate times that they  would  not

normally.   We  should look to the longer term.  We  should  re-emphasise  the  win-win nature of cooperation in the  region  to

seek  engagement  with those who welcome it  to  provide  useful

forms  of assistance to those who most need it.  We should offer

cooperation and assistance to our neighbours in ASEAN.  I  agree

with  the  previous speaker, the Member of Parliament,  Dr  Ker,

that  this  need  not be in terms of dollar  aid  only  but  our

assistance should be tangible and sufficient.  Additionally,  we

should offer cooperation and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>

engagement  to others outside our region, such as  the  USA  and

international agencies, whose help and attention can assist  the

region's recovery and, therefore, our own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asia has been struck by a contagion. But because we have

kept  ourselves fiscally, not physically, fit over these  years,

we  are less affected.  Among the stricken economies, therefore,

we  should  be among those assisting in the process of recovery.

I  shall  propose specific policies in the cuts in the Committee

of  Supply.  I hope the Minister will respond to my comments and

suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for  allowing me to join in the debate.  Sir, the most  striking

feature of Budget 99 is clearly the $5.1 billion deficit.   Over

the past decade, there has been a recurrent constant refrain  in

this  House and outside for the Government to reduce its  budget

surplus  and  redistribute funds to individuals and  corporates.

Our  current  circumstances, in my view, amply  demonstrate  the

value  of the Government's stated approach.  It has got prudence

in  years of plenty and preparation for the years when  we  have

difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I would like to congratulate the Minister

and  the  Government for not flinching at a time  like  this  in

incurring  a  substantial budget deficit.  I  trust  this  would

clear  the  doubts of many of its detractors.  I also hope  that

the  Government  will  remain steadfast  in  its  commitment  to

continue  with such largesse if the need arises in  future  with

continued economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said in the course of this debate on

various aspects pertaining to the business and economy.  I  wish

to confine my comments to the social dimension.  One significant

implication  of  this  economic  downturn  has  been  the  stiff

challenge it has posed to our resilience and unity as a  nation.

Our  social cohesion has been tested and continued to be  tested

by  external as well as internal forces.  Some manifestations of

this  are,  firstly,  the  more negative  attitude  one  detects

towards  the  infusion of foreign talent; secondly,  in  a  more

pronounced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>

socio-economic  divide  and consciousness  as  those  with  less

skills  lose their livelihood first; and, thirdly, in  the  more

recent  debate, which is the revival of something that has  been

lying  low  for a while, in terms of discrimination in  the  job

market on the basis of age, sex or ethnicity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Sir, as the pie shrinks, the instinct for self-preservation is heightened. So we need to be vigilant and guard

against  such  divisive forces if our social fabric  is  not  to

fray.   The question then is how the financial policy in  Budget

99 supports this objective - the need to maintain and strengthen

our social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, there is much that has been done in the form

of  S&C rebates, GST-related offsets, personal tax rebates, etc,

and a quick back-on-the-envelope calculation suggested something

to  the  tune  of  $500  million  has  been  set  aside  by  the

Government,   in   terms  of  direct  support   for   individual

Singaporeans, particularly those who may need help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, the question is not whether the Government

has  been generous, but whether it has been too generic  in  its

efforts  to  help Singaporeans.  More specifically,  can  we  be

sharper  in the way we structure financial policy to help  those

who  need  help?   Allow  me  to illustrate.   If  we  have  two

neighbours  in  adjacent 4-room flats in the same  block,  their

experiences pertaining to this economic downturn could be vastly

different.   It would depend on whether they bought  their  flat

directly  from  HDB or on the resale market,  when  they  bought

their flat, the number of children they have in the family,  the

employment  situation, whether anyone has been retrenched,  etc.

Some  would have two properties, others would be servicing their

first  mortgage.  Some may drive cars and others would  rely  on

public  transport.  Yet the structure of the financial  benefits

which  uses  HDB flat size as a proxy for socio-economic  status

or,  more  importantly, their financial need begs  the  question

whether it is appropriate as an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>

indicator of where Government funding should be channelled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, using HDB flat size on its own is a less

than  perfect indicator and it is one that the Government should

re-examine  closely.  In particular, I think the system  can  be

improved  and the Government could be more targeted and  layered

in its approach.  For example, whilst we could have a base layer

of S&C rebates and other grants which are distributed along this

line  of flat size, there could be additional layers, especially

those that emerge in these times, which can be more specifically

targeted at those who need help.  For example, instead of having

an  across-the-board  town  council S&C  grant,  we  could  have

instead  taken  this money, put it into a fund,  and  say,  "OK,

let's  target  this  at those individuals who specifically  have

difficulty and can go through CDCs, self-help groups  and  other

voluntary  welfare organisations to apply for such  assistance."

These  organisations  are  already in  close  contact  with  the

ground.  They know the needs.  They know the individuals in many

instances  and they would bring about a better matching  between

the  Government's intent, in terms of setting up  such  schemes,

and how it takes effect on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using voluntary welfare organisations, CDCs and self-help

groups  is  one  method.  Even if it is to  be  done  centrally,

perhaps  by  referring  to CPF accounts  and  whether  they  are

multiple  property owners or single property owners, or  perhaps

by  reference to their property ownership in particular, we  may

be  able  to distinguish those who truly need help.   My  point,

Sir, is not to deny Singaporeans in need of their dues.  Rather,

it  is  to  state  the  point  that  Government  has  set  aside

substantial sums to help those in need.  It is equally important

that these sums be directed at those who truly need it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br>2.35 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

allowing me to join in the debate.  Some might say that this  is

a  very appropriate Budget for the times that we are in.  It  is

indeed a good Budget!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>

After  last  year's  off-Budget  measures  and  after  what  the

Government has come up in terms of the various programmes,  this

year's budgetary response is very appropriate to the times  that

we  are  in.   And  as  the Minister has said,  the  Budget  was

carefully calibrated to respond to the regional crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take heart in the use of the term "calibrated"

because it denotes a sense of exact measure, not more, not less,

but  just  right.  It also means that the response would  change

accordingly  depending  on  how the  regional  crisis  develops.

Indeed,  Sir, it is a very pragmatic strategy in these  changing

and troubled times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, a number of MPs have called on the

Government  to  take care of our own people in  these  difficult

times  and  that  we  should  be more  careful  in  giving  PRs,

employment pass and/or work permits to foreigners.  Sir,  I  too

support  this call.  In fact, I have had the same comments  from

my  own  ground.  But, Sir, in the larger scheme  of  things,  I

would like to caution the Government to be very careful on  this

issue.   There is a need to have a very fine balance of  helping

our  people  and making sure that we do not reject  the  foreign

talents  that  will be very necessary to our economy.   Sir,  we

cannot afford to be a closed economy.  We should not over react,

close  ranks  and help our people to the long-term detriment  of

our economy and, ultimately, our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, closing ranks and rejecting foreign talents is not the

way  to  compete.   We have in fact only one resource,  a  point

often mentioned in this House; our human resource.  The only way

that  we  should  compete is to provide the means  to  make  our

people, entrepreneurs and companies stronger and better than the

foreign  competitors.  In this respect, I  am  not  disappointed

because  the Government has provided ample resources  for  these

goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, in the larger sense, I must still admit that I am

disappointed,  not  because  of this  Budget,  but  because  the

Minister  did  not  make long-term changes to  our  tax  system;

changes  necessary  to promote Singapore  as  a  total  business

centre, not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>

only  for  the region, but for the world.  This Budget  and  the

past  Budgets have done much to promote Singapore as  a  premier

financial centre.  But I ask, despite my own background  in  the

financial area, why only the financial centre?  Why do  we  stop

there?  We want to be a first world economy competing not on low

cost  but on high productivity.  We want to be an industrialised

country, not just only a centre for financial services.  We want

to  attract  top-notch MNCs to set up headquarters in Singapore,

whether  world headquarters or regional headquarters.   We  want

our  home-grown companies to be world beaters, both in Singapore

and abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want these and more, it is time for us to have a

comprehensive review of our tax system.  We need to have  a  tax

system  compatible with these goals and not one  which  provides

obstacles.  For example, take the issue of group income.   Other

Members  have  spoken  on group income  in  relation  to  single

purpose  or  single property companies.  Here, I am thinking  of

group income on a very much wider basis because our overall  tax

system still treats companies within the group as individual tax

entities.  Not only is it wrong but it is out of step  with  the

rest of the advanced economies in the world.  The United States,

European  countries and even Australia have some form  of  group

income  taxation.  I am not asking the Minister  to  have  group

taxation in Singapore just because these countries are doing it.

But  I  would like to ask the Minister why these countries  have

group  taxation.   If  you look at it,  the  answer  is  simple.

Because  a  group of companies, related to each  other,  through

ownership and management, constitutes a single economic unit for

the purpose of strategic management and financial planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a very important phrase here. These companies

within  a  group should not be considered as different entities,

but  as  a single economic unit.  Our current tax system ignores

this  economic  reality and thus helps to  create  economic  and

business  distortions.  I suppose it provides good business  for

tax planners and tax consultants.  But on the negative side,  it

uses up a lot of management time,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>

wastes  resources and distorts strategic planning in  trying  to

achieve the tax plans to beat the irrational system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is that group taxation recognises this. Thus, it

helps  the single economic unit, that is, the group, to maximise

its  potential.  Sir, this is not a new issue.  I  am  sure  the

Minister is well aware of the pros and cons of group taxation as

well  as  the  way  to move towards such a system  with  minimum

dislocation,  cost  and loss of the tax  base,  if  only  he  is

willing  to consider this.  In fact, while I do not wish  to  go

into any detailed argument on this, there is ample literature on

this.   For  example,  in  1994, the  South  African  Government

commissioned  the  Katz Commission to study  this  whole  issue,

amongst other issues.  If Members are interested in this report,

I can make it available to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are compelling reasons why, in a modern economy, group

taxation should be adopted.  It is not because others are  doing

it,  but  because it is a very rational thing to do.  There  are

more  issues,  such as tax on remitted income and capital  gains

tax.   Our  tax  system  is  based on a  territorial  principle.

However,  today,  the  world is one big marketplace.   There  is

globalisation.   There  is freedom of capital  and  funds  flow.

There  are  WTO  regulations and a host of other  liberalisation

measures which have made the world into one big marketplace, and

our   companies   are  competing  in  that   marketplace.    Our

territorial principle of taxation compounded by the  absence  of

group  taxation  really  hampers our  companies  not  only  from

competing in Singapore compared to the rest, but also  in  other

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, financial innovations have made nonsense of what

constitutes  capital gains and income.  Therefore,  to  preserve

the  integrity of our tax base, the IRAS has come out  with  all

sorts  of  interpretations  to remove  what  they  deem  as  tax

loopholes.   But  in  doing  so, they  distort  the  very  basic

fundamentals of our tax system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give some over-simplified examples. If a company in

Singapore were to have income overseas, such income, as long  as

it is not remitted to Singapore, will not be taxed in Singapore.

It  will  be considered as income earned outside Singapore,  not

derived  from Singapore and not remitted to Singapore.   On  the

other  hand, if this company were to use these funds to pay  for

the  expenses  of one of its subsidiaries overseas,  then  IRAS,

under  present interpretation, will most probably deem  this  as

remitted income to Singapore, although the funds do not actually

come   to  Singapore.   This  is  what  they  call  constructive

remittance.  Sir, this is a new interpretation.  They  have  put

this in place some two or three years ago.  But it is causing  a

lot of difficulties for companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, for example, we allow companies to buy back their

own shares.  One would think this is a simple issue from the tax

angle.   These companies are returning back the capital  to  its

shareholders, ie, capital which they feel they cannot use to the

best  of  their  ability.  Again, IRAS is saying that  if  these

funds  do not come from contributed capital, that means  capital

that  was contributed in the first place, then these funds which

are being used in a buy-back scheme would also have to be taxed.

How do these funds arrive in the first place?  These funds arose

because  companies are able to generate some capital  gains  and

therefore  they  put  these  funds into  some  form  of  capital

reserve.  It is part of the company's capital formation.   These

funds are therefore returned back to the shareholders in a  buy-back  scheme.   But  they  are not contributed  capital,  having

arisen  out  of capital gains.  If they are taxed,  then  it  is

actually equivalent to IRAS taxing on capital gains.  Again,  it

is causing problems and distortions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main point is that these tax matters are knee-jerk

reactions.   Because the world has changed,  because  there  are

financial innovations, because the way businesses are  done  all

over  the world has changed, and the taxman is so worried  about

the   tax  base,  they  come  up  now  with  all  these   ad-hoc

interpretations which in essence,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>

as  I  have said earlier, distort the way business is being done

and  it does not help our companies when they compete with other

companies  in the international global marketplace.  The  reason

is very simple - shareholders want after-tax returns, not before-tax returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at our tax system, it came into being when

Singapore was a colony, when the world consisted of many  closed

economies, when we were limited by our shores and our vision  by

Whitehall.  Now, we have changed.  More significantly, the world

has  changed.   So  it  is time for us to have  a  comprehensive

review  of  our tax system to support Singapore's dream  in  the

next millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget with the hope that the Minister could

be  persuaded  to  initiate a comprehensive review  of  our  tax

system  so as to maximise the potential competitiveness  of  our

companies on the world stage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the motion proposed by the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while there were no surprises in this year's Budget,

the  Minister  could  have done more  than  just  focus  on  the

financial  sector if we are really serious about the next  phase

of growth of our economy that has to be driven by more than just

being a financial hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, through a series of budget and off-budget measures,

the  Government  has  addressed mainly  short-term  cost-cutting

measures  in some of the sectors of our economy and I feel  that

it is about time that we started focusing on long-term strategic

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget has failed to introduce new initiatives that are

badly  needed for the next phase of growth for the manufacturing

sector,  the  knowledge-based economy  and  in  encouraging  the

emergence of a more vibrant small and medium enterprise  sector.

So  I  feel  the  Government needs to start doing something  now

because  we have the unique opportunity to widen our competitive

edge against our neighbours and we will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>

be  far  ahead  when the region recovers from the crisis  if  we

start now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since many Members have commented on the details of

the  budget,  I plan to touch on a few long-term  issues  in  my

speech today.  Firstly, I would like to touch on the lessons the

Government can learn from the experience of the last few  years,

and  second,  I  would like to share my views on  the  areas  we

should focus on for the long-term growth of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have observed a few areas of weaknesses in the way the

Government has executed the role for the planning of our economy

in  the  last  few  years.   While the Government  has  done  an

excellent  job in many areas, there are always opportunities  to

be  even better and I would like to suggest that there are three

lessons  that  we  can learn from the way we  have  managed  our

planning process for the past three years.

<br><br><i>Lesson  No.  1:   The Accuracy of Economic Indices Used  by the Government</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight that as far back as in early

1997,  even  before  the regional economic crisis  hit  us,  the

private sector saw signs of our economy starting to slow down in

a  few sectors, including the manufacturing and service sectors.

Then  again  in early 1998, the business community  projected  a

rapid  decline  in  our economy, while in his Budget  speech  in

1998, the Minister for Finance talked about recovery and growth,

including  the  recovery  of the electronics  and  manufacturing

sectors in 1998.  However, many industry players, including some

MPs  in this House, expected a decline in these same sectors and

predicted that Singapore will go into a recession in 1998, while

the  Government maintained a 2.5% to 4.5% growth rate.   Results

showed  that  instead  of  a  growth  in  the  electronics   and

manufacturing sectors, we saw a decline since the second quarter

of  1998  and  going into negative territory in  the  third  and

fourth quarters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the consistent pattern I have observed is that there

is  a gap between what the business community sees and what  the

Government  agencies are able to measure.  I also see  that  the

planning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>

agencies  may  not  have a good feel of the real  pulse  of  the

ground and I also see a significant time lag for the information

gathered  by  the  various Government agencies  to  be  used  to

measure the state of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the information gathered and the measurement indices

are used for economic planning and policy making, any inaccuracy

or time lag could lead to policies that may not be optimal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first thing that needs to be seriously addressed is

the type of indices and how these should be collected so that we

can  do  a better job in predicting our economy.  New mechanisms

and indices need to be introduced if we want to do a better job.

<br><br><i>Lesson No. 2:   The Inefficiencies of Small Incremental Measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also learn a lot about this from the mistakes that

Japan  has made in the last few years in trying to recover after

its  bubble economy burst.  In Japan, the government of the  day

for  the  last  few  years had attempted to recover  from  their

recession  by taking small step-by-step measures and the  impact

on  their  economy  has  been  insignificant,  despite  draining

tremendous resources.  We in Singapore also attempted to take  a

similar  route  by  trying to make small  piecemeal  changes  by

announcing  a  conservative 1998 Budget and tried to  follow  up

with  a  small $2 billion off-budget expenditure.   However,  we

failed to create an impact and finally we decided to take a bold

step by introducing the $10.5 billion off-budget measures at the

end  of  last year.  The second issue that needs to be seriously

addressed  is  therefore our willingness to take bold  steps  in

trying to influence changes to our economy.

<br><br><i>Lesson No. 3:  Timing of Changes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this area, I would like to say that the Government

has a mixed track record.  We have shown that we are willing  to

come  out with off-budget measures when needed and not wait  for

the regular budget cycle to make changes.  Similarly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>

we  have been prepared to make other non-fiscal changes  if  the

need  arises.  On the other hand, we were at least one year late

in implementing the May 1996 property market measures to address

the  growing asset price bubble.  Therefore, the third  area  we

need  to  address is the speed at which we are willing  to  make

changes because sometimes, even a slight delay could result in a

disaster  as we can learn from Indonesia's delay in implementing

the  IMF  measures  which caused the rupiah  to  be  drastically

devalued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to focus on the long-term strategies

that  I feel the Government should focus on if we want to ensure

another  30  years of economic prosperity.  I feel  that  it  is

about time we looked at three key areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) how to ensure growth and new markets, including

globalisation - not just regionalisation;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) putting in place new capabilities, technologies and

mechanisms   to  plug  into  the  knowledge-based  economy   and

encourage technopreneurship;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) to change the direction and to re-orientate Singapore's

economy  to  include  a  vibrant SME sector  to  encourage  more

technology intensive companies and to avoid over reliance on  an

asset-based economy, as we have done in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the areas that the Budget for 1999-2000 has

failed  to  address.  However, I still have hope that  the  much

bigger development expenditure set aside this year will focus on

these  areas.  I urge the Government not to over spend in  fixed

assets, unless these directly support the above three new areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on these three areas that we should be

focusing  on.  First, on globalisation and exploring new  growth

markets.   In  addition to being cost competitive, it  is  about

time we explored new markets, farther afield and go to new areas

not  explored  before.  In this respect, I  believe  the  Budget

could have been more proactive to accelerate growth and to  take

advantage of the opportunities available in the region  as  well

as around the world.  Because Singapore has been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>

relatively unhurt by the crisis, we are in an excellent position

to  be the first to take off and find the best opportunities and

markets  as compared to our neighbours.  So some tax changes  to

accelerate   globalisation  and  in  encouraging   mergers   and

acquisitions  could  have been helpful.  I strongly  believe  we

need  to  restructure the current tax system,  as  some  of  the

Members  in  this  House have spoken about, to  be  more  future

oriented so that businesses will be prepared to invest early for

future returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on technopreneurship and encouraging the

entrepreneurial  spirit.  In my opinion,  technopreneurship  and

entrepreneurial spirit are the most important areas we  need  to

address for the future growth of the Singapore economy, and this

is where I find the current Budget has a serious shortcoming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our success in building a flawless infrastructure

through  a  strong civil service and our education  system  that

inculcates  benefits of stable professions and  the  glamour  of

working  in  multi-nationals  is  now  causing  our  failure  to

encourage  more entrepreneurs to emerge.  We have  to  seriously

address  these mindsets among our young which, as I  have  said,

are  the  results  of our style of governance for  the  past  30

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, after a decade of government led growth, the

country  is now looking at entrepreneurs to lead the economy  to

its next stage of growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taiwan's success is also attributable to its quest to

encourage   technopreneurship.    From   1988   to   1998,   the

contributions made by science and technology-based companies  in

Taiwan  to the economy has grown from 26.3% to almost 40%  in  a

short span of 10 years.  Sir, we too have to now shift our focus

and I suggest the following four areas to be looked into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our education system, from one that is vocation

based  to  one  that is knowledge based.  In Singapore,  we  are

still relying on old methods of teaching which were designed  to

train  people  to fit into the various jobs for  the  industries

planned  for our economic growth.  While I can see some changes,

I think we have to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>

accelerate  these changes if we are very serious  about  growing

this  part  of  our economy.  In the 9th November 1998  Newsweek

report on 'Silicon Valley' aspirant cities, it was reported that

analysts felt Singapore's education system depends on "out-dated

teaching  methods  and learning by rote with little  chances  of

independent  thinking".  This together with  the  reward  system

that focuses on academic excellence and on a scholar system  are

becoming an obstacle in our drive towards nurturing more  people

who  are  willing  to  take  the path of  entrepreneurship  that

entails taking risk in more cases.  We need to develop a  reward

system  that  recognises creativity and encourages doing  things

differently.  The streaming in schools, the labels we  place  on

our  children  and the fear of failing to make it  to  the  best

schools  and the fear of failing to make it to the best streams,

all add to this problem of discouraging creativity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote our Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

In  an  interview published in the Straits Times on 3rd February

this  year,  he  said  "many of the entrepreneurs  are  innately

bright people.  It takes more than paper qualifications to be  a

good entrepreneur".  That is, we need a good combination of both

street smart as well as academic smart people to be successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, tolerance to failure. The way we define and punish

failures  has  a  big  impact on creating  an  environment  that

encourages  entrepreneurship.  We, as  a  society,  have  a  low

threshold  to failure.  The way we measure success  is  narrowly

defined  along  the  lines of academic excellence  and  material

gains.  We need to give second chances to people who have  tried

but failed.  Sir, failure should be treated as just an event  in

a  long  process, and not to be treated as an end.   Our  people

must be able to handle failure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a reply to a question on how many times he failed in his

efforts  to  invent the light bulb, Thomas Edison said,  "I  was

successful  in  knowing 1,800 ways of how not to  make  a  light

bulb."   Sir, we need to encourage such positive thinking  about

failure in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the availability of funds. This is one area where

Singapore has a long way to go if we are serious about  becoming

the  Silicon  Valley  of the east.  In my opinion  and  from  my

experience, while we have a number of Government-linked  venture

capitalists,  the  decision  makers are  very  conservative  and

bureaucratic  and  behave  more like  administrators.   What  we

really need is a big pool of entrepreneur-led or managed venture

capital funds, where decision makers too think in the same  wave

length as the entrepreneurs they hope to support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Taiwan, small funds were introduced in the early

1980s and the government participated, not directly, but through

equity in technology-oriented private venture capital companies.

Today,  I  believe there are more than 100 such venture  capital

funds  managing a total of about US$2 billion, which means  each

company  manages an average of US$20 million, making  them  very

nimble and able to move fast and to make decisions fast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a well-known fact that in Taiwan, venture

capitalists will commit to investments if they see  even  a  30%

chance  of success for a project, while the feeling is  that  in

Singapore, venture capitalists will need to see at least  a  90%

chance of success before participating.  Furthermore, the saying

goes that in Taiwan, there are 100 venture capital funds chasing

after  one  project, while in Singapore there are  100  projects

chasing after one venture capital fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an urgent need to encourage more Taiwan or

Silicon  Valley  type venture capital funds  to  be  set  up  in

Singapore.  Perhaps some Government funds could be used as  seed

money for technology savvy venture capitalists willing to set up

base  in  Singapore.  For example, Temasek Holdings could  allow

some private sector entrepreneurs to manage a certain proportion

of its funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the role of the Government. Sir, in my opinion,

Government direct involvement should be as minimal as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>

possible;  otherwise,  they  risk crowding  out  private  sector

entrepreneurs,  as  our GLCs have done in  the  past   The  most

important  role  the  Government  can  play  is  to  create   an

environment  that  allows  entrepreneurship  to  flourish.   One

useful  role  for  the  Government is  to  fine-tune  rules  and

regulations   that   are  obstacles  and   stifle   a   creative

environment.   Rules  like our bankruptcy laws,  initial  public

offering rules for technological start-ups, restrictions in fund

raising  for  small  venture capitalists and taxation  of  stock

options are examples of rules that need to be revised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do feel that until we can have a vibrant

environment  developed, the Government can play the  role  of  a

match  maker,  especially in the area of making funds  available

and  in  revising  some  of the incentive schemes  that  require

upfront  spending before a company can collect  the  incentives.

We  also  need a new EDB-type one-stop organisation  to  support

technopreneurs who now have to go to multiple agencies for help.

Once we have a natural environment, the Government should take a

step  back and play a purely supporting role and let the private

sector flourish on its own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the people responsible for

administering the many schemes and in setting policies all  come

from  the  same  mould, because of the hiring and the  promotion

practices  of  the  Government.   I  suggest  it  is  time   the

Government  considered a system where we  have  a  good  mix  of

street-smart as well as academic-smart people at the helm.  Sir,

ultimately,  the "dare to dream" attitude must come from  within

and it cannot be Government driven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area that I think we should be focusing on for

the  long-term  growth of our economy is a  thriving  small  and

medium enterprise sector.  In the past 30 years, we have focused

on  attracting  foreign multi-national companies  to  locate  in

Singapore.   Our  lower  cost,  our  hardworking  and   educated

workforce  and  stable Government were the attractions  for  the

foreign  multi-national companies.  However, as we have recently

learnt, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>

cost  is no longer competitive, our neighbours also have a  good

workforce.   They  may still lack in good governance,  but  they

will  soon  catch up.  Singapore may no longer  be  a  preferred

choice for many foreign investments.  And while we should  still

try  to bring in such companies, especially in the area of  high

technology, we need to make a significant shift in our  policies

to  pay  more attention to building a vibrant small  and  medium

enterprise  sector  with high emphasis on  technology  intensive

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons I feel why the Taiwan's economy has not

been badly hit by the economic crisis this time round is because

of  its  heavy dependence on SMEs who are engaged in  technology

intensive activities.  On the other hand, South Korea was one of

the  first to be hit by the crisis and they built their  success

based on big conglomerates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the EDB's Industry 21 programme and its recent

announcements to co-invest in local companies to help them  grow

is  indeed a good move.  I do see a shift of focus towards  SMEs

and  I  hope all of us will develop a positive attitude  towards

them  as  being key players needed to bring our economy  to  the

next stage of growth.  However, I feel a lot more can be done to

reach  out  to even a small fraction of the 100,000 or  so  SMEs

present in Singapore today.  I hope we, in Singapore, can try to

emulate what happens in the USA where one new company is started

every 3.5 seconds!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by once again emphasising

that  while we have done an excellent job in addressing the cost

component of the equation in the last few budget sessions, it is

about time we started preparing for the future by working on the

other  parts  of  the  equation  that  focus  on  the  long-term

strategies of growth.  I will be giving detailed suggestions  on

how   we  can  achieve  this  during  the  Committee  of  Supply

discussions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, capable

hands  crafted this Budget to meet the exigencies of  the  time.

The nation and the market received the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>

Budget with confidence.  I commend the Minister for an excellent

effort and extend my strong support for the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative appreciation of the Singapore dollar to the

currencies  of  the  competing economies is  one  among  several

factors  that  has  eroded  our national  competitiveness.   The

Government   resisted  the  temptation   of   relying   on   the

depreciation  of  the Singapore dollar as  a  means  to  restore

competitiveness.   Instead, we embarked on  the  more  difficult

option of cutting costs.  Our people and businesses support this

option.  Investors too have reacted positively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting workers' pay is key to this option. That we have

been  able to do so, credit must  go to our people, our workers,

our  unions  and  the Government.  When the Government  realised

that  cutting  workers' pay could be necessary,  it  took  great

efforts  to  prepare the ground for it.   The Government  worked

hard  to  explain  the issues to the people,  the  labour  union

leaders  and  the workers.   The union leaders, on understanding

the issue, worked hard to help their members to understand them.

The people and the workers, on understanding the issues, made  a

free and informed choice to sacrifice for the nation.  There was

thus  a  lot  of  hard work, a lot of learning  and  sharing,  a

willingness  to  choose  the better solution  for  the  country.

Hence,  contrary to the mistaken belief, Singapore was  able  to

cut  workers'  pay not because the Government had  dictated  it.

Singapore  was  able to cut workers' pay because the  Government

worked with our people to help them understand that this was the

better way.  And Singaporeans gave their support, even though it

was painful.  Thus, let not others belittle the noble sacrifices

of our people and workers.  This is our competitive strength and

I am proud of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly happy that the Minister has now agreed

that  it  is important, necessary and possible to seek  out  new

markets   overseas.   In  June  last  year,  when  the  Minister

presented  his  first  off-budget  measures,  I  had  asked  the

Minister about expanding into new markets overseas and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>

the  Minister  was  not  very positive in  his  response.  I  am

therefore  glad that the prospects of new markets overseas  have

improved in the meantime.  This is timely. During trying  times,

there  are  more  incentives  to experiment  and  explore.   Our

companies will be motivated to find new markets for their  goods

and  services.  I am encouraged at the speed with which  efforts

have  been  made  to  tap  into new  markets.   A  comprehensive

programme  has  been put in place and implemented with  generous

support.  The Minister is also right to remind our companies not

to  forsake our existing markets while we look for new ones.  We

must  nurture our existing markets while we foray into new ones,

developing both together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confidence in overseas markets is also timely to

counteract  the  disillusionment felt by our  businessmen  about

venturing  overseas as a result of an increase in the number  of

overseas  ventures that have floundered because of  the  crisis.

Business  has its risks. We cannot just withdraw to and  isolate

ourselves  in Singapore.  We must continue to engage the  world,

for this is our destiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the spending on our security. The relevance of

security becomes sharper in times of crisis.  Our past decisions

to build up our security capability have proven right.  Being  a

small  nation,  we become an easy and convenient  scapegoat  for

things that have gone awry elsewhere.  There are others who  may

want  to  cow  us, to alter the status quo of our  relationship.

With  a strong security capability we can respond with calm  and

composure  to  such provocation.  But national security  is  not

just  about  money  and infrastructure.  It  is  about  love  of

country,  about a spirit of and willingness to sacrifice,  about

commitment  to  defend and to protect what one holds  dear.   We

must  therefore be steadfast in our resolve and action  to  show

the   world  that  we  are  prepared  to  defend  our   national

sovereignty  and  protect  our right to  live  as  equals  among

nations.   Developing  our security capability  is  a  long-term

process,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>

and we should not slacken just because of a temporary glitch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and harnessing of our human capital is

important.  We cannot afford to miss developing our young,  even

in a crisis, for to do so is to lose an entire generation, which

being   less   educated  and  skilled  has  impact   on   future

generations.   As  we  move  into the knowledge-based  era,  the

development  of  our human capital becomes even more  important.

Besides  educating our young, we must also help our  workers  to

advance   with  technology  if  we  want  to  avoid   structural

unemployment, which can become a permanent societal problem.   I

commend  the  trade  unions  for  recognising  the  problem  and

undertaking the difficult task to encourage and help our workers

to  upgrade,  retool and re-skill.  The Government responded  by

setting  up several training initiatives and generously  funding

them.  Now  it  is  up to our people and workers  to  seize  the

opportunities made available.  I realise that it is not easy for

our older workers to learn new skills and knowledge, but we must

persevere  to  encourage,  convince and  support  them.   Skills

obsolescence  can also occur among executives and professionals.

I  am  therefore  glad  that  the  Minister  also  supports  the

upgrading of our executives and professionals.  I would in  fact

ask  the Minister to do more to help them to upgrade.  With  the

lengthening of our working life, there will be much  wastage  of

our  manpower resources if we fail to upgrade our older workers.

This  can  lead  to  other problems, which will  be  costly  for

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lessons that our people, especially our young,

can  learn  from the current crisis.  First, we must  appreciate

the  vicissitudes of the market.  When we rejoice in good times,

we  must  not  assume  that it will last forever.   During  good

times,  we  should prepare and set aside something for difficult

times.  The Government has shown that this approach works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our people must understand the growing intensity of

global competition.  In the long term, our competitive edge will

depend on our productivity and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>

our  ability to function in a knowledge-based world.  This means

that we have to become a better educated and a more creative and

innovative  society, and to work even harder.  Let us  not  look

for  an  easier  life,  but a balanced and  fulfilling  one.   A

Singapore that can compete with the world but does not  need  to

work  hard is an illusion.  Let us aim for a life where we  need

to   work  hard,  but  where  there  are  sufficient  time   and

opportunities for relaxation and enjoyment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, our people must take this opportunity to appreciate

the  importance of good government.  There are many reasons  why

we  are  doing  better  than many other  economies  during  this

crisis, but the most important is good government.  To ensure  a

good  future  for  our  children and us,  we  must  demand  good

government.  There is no better insurance than this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current crisis has also exposed the danger to

organisations  of straying from their areas of core  competence.

It  is  clear  that organisations must consider  more  carefully

before  diversifying from their areas of core competence.   This

is  most  clearly illustrated by organisations that rushed  into

property developments for quick gains during better times.   Not

only  does it sap limited management talents, but the market  is

capricious and what seemed like a pot of gold at the end of  the

rainbow quickly becomes an albatross around the neck when  there

are  not  enough  management  talents  to  handle  the  changing

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An organisation must also use its manpower resources,

especially its expensive expertise, appropriately.  For example,

we  should avoid using professional manpower for administration.

Not only is this misuse of manpower resources costly, but it can

demoralise  administration staff who  find  their  career  paths

blocked.  This does not mean that there can be no cross-over  of

talents,  but such cross-overs must be done through an  explicit

re-designation  of post and duties.  While the  concern  applies

also  to  organisations in the private sector, I  am  addressing

this concern in particular to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>

our Government and statutory board organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the individual and family felt left out in

the  two off-budget exercises last year.  The Minister had taken

this opportunity to rectify this neglect. The Minister had taken

a  step  further to spread the benefits.  To the better off,  he

increased  the  tax  rebates.  To the less  well  off,  he  gave

generous  rebates  and grants on HDB flat  rental,  service  and

conservancy  charges and public utilities bills,  calibrated  to

give  more  benefits  to those who needed them  more.   In  this

trying  time, the benefits are most helpful.  The Minister  also

recognised  that  this economic crisis has  bitten  deeper  into

society when he extended service and conservancy rebates to  the

5-room flats.  I thank the Minister for this extension.   I  had

asked for it last November when this House debated the report of

the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, most people will not see the money given to

them.  The transactions will be carried out electronically.   It

is, however, important that our people know, understand and feel

for what the Government has provided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget does not fully describe the care and concern

that  the Government has for the people.  Government has set  up

and  generously funded many grassroots organisations such as the

CDCs,  CCCs, CCMCs, RCs, NCs and NGWOs to reach out to and  care

for   the   people.   Last  year,  as  in  years   past,   these

organisations have done a good job in bonding the community  and

giving  help and hope to many people in need.  Many Singaporeans

from all walks of life have volunteered their time to serve  and

some  have  even  contributed resources.  They  are  the  unsung

heroes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot and must not take our national unity and cohesion

for granted.  We must strive to maintain and strengthen the ties

among our people, especially during difficult times.  We can see

in  the  neighbouring  countries how quickly  social  order  and

stability can unravel and how devastating the effects can be.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as Singaporeans continue to stand together, we

will  be  able to face the storms and emerge intact  from  them.

Let me conclude by saying that I share the Minister's confidence

that  Singaporeans will rise to the occasion, and we will emerge

from the crisis stronger and leaner.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of worsening economic and political

conditions  in  the region with Singapore showing  in  1998  its

first  spending shortfall in 10 years and a forecast deficit  of

S$5.1  billion in 1999, a no-frills Budget containing no radical

moves is a prudent and measured approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we have to appraise the Budget within the context

of having had two other off-Budget measures in June and November

1998,  which had benefitted the business community in more  ways

than one.  This time more individual relief is given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen, I am grateful that we have accumulated funds

to  fall  back  on to cushion our spending shortfalls.   We  are

still  able  to  fork  out large sums of money  to  enhance  the

competitiveness  and  employability  of  our  workforce  through

retraining  programmes and IT in education.   And  now,  we  all

stand    behind   this   country   to   ensure   its   continued

competitiveness  and viability, in preparation for  making  that

quantum leap when the economy recovers in the millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This steadfast, resilient and committed "Singapore Spirit",

Sir, is what I would like to highlight and give credit to.   The

Government has done a good job, so have the people of Singapore.

In the recent parliamentary visit to Hong Kong led by MP Dr Wang

Kai  Yuen, I had the opportunity to meet up with some of my  old

professors in Hong Kong University as well as some old  friends.

One  common reflection from them was: "You Singaporeans are `One

heart in cohesion' (yak tiu sam).  No way can we  push

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>

through  a  cost  cutting  package in Hong  Kong  the  way  your

Government  has  done.  And without violent  protests  from  the

people too!  And you are making all the critical investments now

to  prepare for the future.  It is truly an enviable spirit that

Hong  Kong  should learn to emulate and nurture."  I  could  not

fail  to  note  the  strains of envy, frustration  and  helpless

anxiety  among  my  Hong  Kong  friends.   I  felt  proud  as  a

Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in my four years stay in Hong Kong in the late

70s,  the perception of Singaporeans was "they talk, eat,  walk,

think and act far too slowly and too cautiously."  I used to  be

rather  defensive  about these comments but now,  on  hindsight,

maybe these attributes which have characterised Singaporean over-prudence and excessive cautiousness have stood us in good  stead

in  the  past two decades.  They reflect our underlying  anxiety

about  survival and a tested conviction that things  can  always

get  worse  but as long as we steadily chip our way through  the

odds to make the best of the situation, in measured prudence, we

will see the light at the end of the tunnel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have observed similar prudent financial and lifestyle

management in many Singaporean households today.  Parents,  with

growing children whose needs are never ending, are careful about

how  they spend their dollar.  Instead of buying three  sets  of

new  clothes for the children for Chinese New Year, they  bought

two sets, maybe only one; and one pair of good shoes to last two

years instead of several fashionable ones which last less than a

year and in total cost more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some families I know have adjusted their meals to include

less  meat  -  which is healthy anyway - and have  cut  back  on

eating in restaurants.  Some have sold their flats and moved  to

a  smaller  home  in  order to save the profits  as  contingency

reserves.   Others have sold their cars and travel only  by  bus

and  MRT.   In some cases, I have been offered cats and  special

breed  dogs,  even  goldfish!   In other  cases,  children  have

stopped  taking  tuition classes, and foreign  maids  have  been

dismissed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are scaling down their expectations and re-adjusting their lifestyles in order to cut costs at a personal

and  household level.   They are willing to do this because they

know they have in previous years enjoyed the prosperity and  had

reserves  to  fall back on.  They also know that we  are  not  a

welfare  state  and personal financial prudence is  the  key  to

survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if or when the crunch comes and their personal

reserves become depleted, they will hold the Government  to  the

promise that no Singaporean will be out on the streets without a

shelter  and  no Singaporean will be uncared for if  he  or  she

falls  sick and is unable to pay the medical bills, and no child

will  be forced to leave school because of the inability to  pay

school fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this recession persists, and even if we are to

achieve only stagnant and very slow and low rates of growth  for

the  next  few  years,  the number of Singaporeans  who  can  be

considered the marginal poor will increase.  They may not be the

totally  destitute  and homeless, or denied hospital  care,  but

many  heads of households, particularly the older, lower-skilled

workers,  may  be unemployed for a long time, and the  household

may be in dire need of some financial assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we have a number of assistance schemes already

available in different Ministries and at grassroots levels  that

respond  to those in need.  Whether the assistance is sufficient

and how we can better meet the needs of the less fortunate -  as

we  make  this difficult transition to a knowledge based economy

in  the  midst  of a recession - I hope will be a  policy  focus

following the debate and suggestions proposed by MPs during  the

last two days and in the following days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy must adopt a policy perspective beyond

welfarism.  Beyond the economic fundamentals, what resources  we

allocate for strengthening the social service components  within

our  society to nourish the hearts and souls of Singaporeans are

critical  in  securing our cohesion.  Could we in  extraordinary

times adopt more flexible and responsive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>

policies  to  meet the needs of families in distress?   Have  we

done  enough?  Could we, instead of cynically viewing such moves

as  falling  prey  to  the  "lure of  welfarism",  see  enhanced

assistance  schemes as strategic investments in reinforcing  the

social contract between our people and Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in concrete terms, could we allow Singaporeans

in  the  older  age groups after 40 to draw upon their  Medisave

account  for medical needs such as annual screening tests  which

do  not  classify as "treatment"?  This is consistent  with  our

call  for  a  healthy  lifestyle  through  early  detection   of

diseases.   Could  we  allow family members  to  draw  on  their

Medisave account to pay for their parents' medical bills?  Could

we  increase medical and living subsidies for the needy  elderly

after  60  according  to  age  categories?   Could  we  consider

allowing  single mothers with a stable job and children  to  buy

first-hand  two-room HDB flats in designated residential  zones,

since  we  allow  single mothers to do so under joint  ownership

scheme?    This  is  consistent  with  our  policy   of   family

protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just some examples which I hope to

illustrate my call for the Government to allocate our  resources

using  a  multi-tiered  and multi-faceted approach  to  flexibly

benefit  needy families, instead of applying one policy for  all

which may err on the side of being over restrictive and rigid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While guarding carefully against irresponsible welfarism,

we should also not neglect principles of reasonable distribution

of social security benefits for the vulnerable.  We need a fresh

perspective  to  focus the family as a primary unit  for  policy

formulation.  This perspective may require a critical review  of

defining  who are the vulnerable and the potentially vulnerable.

We  can  easily  spot  the destitute and the  disabled  and  the

Government has been prompt to assist them.  But we may  need  to

define  the  less obviously needy, what I call the  marginalised

segment of our society.  And these are people, I would call, the

dis-enabled, the dis-advantaged and the dis-empowered.  They are

like what MP Sin

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

Boon Ann described yesterday - not poor and not paying tax,  and

now unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was heartened by PM's call for "family care" during the

weekend  when  he  opened the 3-in-1 FSC  in  Tampines.   Indeed

family  members  should  do  their  utmost  to  care  for  their

families,  but  I  also  hope that  the  spirit  of  giving,  as

exemplified  by  PAP  Members handing  out  $200  "ang-pows"  to

residents  in Potong Pasir will be adopted as a broad  principle

of  "family care" by the Government.  Sir, there are many women-run  single  parent  families  who are  facing  difficulties  in

meeting  basic  necessities,  like  food,  transport,  rent  and

utilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cases, due to working adults not being able to

find or pay for home help, they left their elderly parents alone

in  their  homes,  all  locked  up because  they  suffered  from

dementia.  Such unintentional or cannot-be-helped neglect  could

be dangerous if the flat caught fire and the elderly was trapped

inside.   If family members are working, who supplies  the  food

for  the  elderly?  Sir, "family care" or filial  piety  is  not

simply a matter of the heart or culture, it is a function of how

much  children  can shoulder the real burden  of  caring.   When

there  is no job, carers have no money to care.  The rich should

help  the  poor, we heard many MPs said today.  But  they,  too,

facing  business downturn, feel "less rich" to be generous.   It

takes  months to organise fund-raising events and needy families

cannot wait.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not have adequate information on the families.

I  propose  the  setting  up of a multi-disciplinary  FAMILY  21

Working   Committee   to  identify  new   policy   changes   for

strengthening the families.  I would also propose that the  CDCs

carry  out a comprehensive crisis monitoring survey to find  out

the  impact of the crisis on families.  And together, they  will

explore what has to be done to ease the misery in the community.

If the finding shows that I have exaggerated the misery picture,

then it is good news.  If the finding shows that problems are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>

mounting, then we can plan on what we must do as a community  to

set things right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, may I add that I am curious why, after so

many  calls from this House during last year's debate  for  more

allocation of funds for MCD, the development expenditure for the

MCD in 1999 is even less than last year, from 0.38% to 0.34%  of

the GDP?  If we compare with the various Ministries, MCD's total

expenditure  estimates  for  1999  show  a  decrease  by  10.5%,

representing  the  second lowest after MTI  in  estimated  total

expenditure  over  1998.   MTI's  decrease  was   due   to   the

acceleration  of development expenditure in 1998  to  boost  the

economy.   In  the  same year, a number of  projects,  like  the

Girls'  Home and the extension of Kwong Wai Shiu Old  Age  Home,

had to be shelved due to shortage of funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During current difficult times one would expect an increase

in   overall  allocation  for  MCD,  in  particular  development

expenditure, due to increasing demand for services to cope  with

needy  families and rising social problems.  Not only had  MCD's

revised FY98 development expenditure showed 2.9% lower than  the

actual  FY97  sum,  the  development  expenditure  for  1999  is

budgeted  with a further decrease by 15.4%.  Has the development

budget  been axed to this low level by the Minister for  Finance

or  is it because the Ministry of Community Development did  not

ask for more?  And if MCD did not ask for more, why not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek clarification, Sir. For whatever reasons, this is

sending the message that either community development needs  are

not  a high priority, or that we have already arrived at such  a

near Utopian state that we do not actually need to spend more on

community  services.   Yet,  we  can  allocate  for  development

expenditure  318%  more than last year for  MOM,  28%  more  for

education - all of which I agree with, incidentally.  Surely the

Ministry of Community Development has many community projects in

the  pipeline  which  should be financed.  I  propose  that  the

Minister take a longer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>

view  and build the institutions that the community will in time

need.   I  also  propose that we consider easing  the  financial

burden of VWOs by increasing Government funding from 50% to  80%

of  total operating costs so that social workers can concentrate

on delivering quality service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If money is scarce, and we do not think it is prudent to dip

into  our  reserves,  then I propose we  seriously  adopt  cost-cutting  measures at the operation level at all  Ministries  and

donate the "savings" to worthy and needy community causes.  Just

like in the private sector, some companies did not send greeting

cards  for  Christmas and New Year in 1997, 1998  and  1999  and

instead donated money to needy community causes.  We should look

for  innovative ways of saving money and giving it back  to  the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply wish to reiterate here that while Singaporeans at all

levels  are  mustering  their mettle to  uphold  the  "Singapore

Spirit" to help our country ride through these difficult  times,

those  in the job of governance must also make sure that  we  do

not  bend,  distort and stretch this Spirit already malnourished

without extending timely and appropriate help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-term competitiveness, Sir, apart from the focus on the

manufacturing  and service sectors, which we all  support,  must

include the nurturing of this positive Singapore Spirit, through

concrete help, not only by persuasion or in words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to recap. This is a prudent Budget. I applaud

the Singapore Spirit among Singaporeans who have adjusted to the

crisis   by  scaling  down  their  expectations.   We  need   to

nevertheless  identify  the potentially  poor,  adopt  a  policy

perspective  beyond welfarism, by focusing  the  family  as  the

primary  unit for policy formulation.  I propose the setting  up

of  FAMILY 21 and call for more resources for strengthening  the

community, including the family, and the Singapore Spirit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br>3.42 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Potong  Pasir, Mr Chiam See Tong, mentioned yesterday  that  for

our  economy  to  make the next leap, our people  must  be  more

creative  and  more innovative.  Further, he said that  for  our

people to be more creative and more innovative, Singapore should

have  more  political freedom.  Mr Chiam was right on the  first

point  but,  sadly, he was completely awry on the second  point.

He was right in saying that for Singaporeans to justify a higher

income  than others, we must provide higher value-added.   There

is  a  limit on the premium other people will pay for our better

infrastructure,  clean  and  more  efficient  government,   etc.

Ultimately,  the  differentiating factor  is  our  products  and

services that people are prepared to pay more for.  But if  that

is  his  point, then he is not saying anything new.  Mr Inderjit

Singh earlier has also mentioned how to create a more innovative

and  creative  society.  The whole emphasis on the Committee  on

Singapore's Competitiveness towards a knowledge-based economy is

to  inculcate creativity and the inclination to innovate in  our

young  people.   That  is  the reason why  in  this  Budget  the

Government  is  providing more money for education  despite  the

recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettable that Mr Chiam was barking up the wrong

tree by saying that we can only do so by having more freedom.  I

hope  he  is  not  equating greater chaos in  the  countries  he

mentioned  with  greater democracy.  Perhaps  he  is  advocating

freedom  to  demonstrate and freedom to speak  from  the  street

corners as being more democratic.  This, he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>

believes,   will   lead  to  a  more  creative  and   innovative

population.  Unfortunately, there is a fallacy in his  argument.

The  greater  freedom he has advocated is meant  for  the  adult

population  whereas  creativity  and  innovativeness   must   be

developed  and  inculcated when the individuals are  still  very

young,  maybe  starting  as  young as  pre-school  kindergarten.

Actually,  we  are talking about two different segments  of  the

population.   It is indeed a rare individual who will  transform

himself  or  herself  into a more creative  or  more  innovative

person  as an adult just by having greater freedom, ie,  freedom

of any kind, political freedom, personal freedom.  We can verify

that  by checking with friends and acquaintances who have  lived

and  worked  overseas,  for  instance,  in  the  United  States,

presumably the model country Mr Chiam is referring to.   I  have

also  lived and worked in US for a long time.  I do not think  I

have  become  more creative and innovative by being  there.   In

fact,  there  is  a saying that one cannot teach  old  dogs  new

tricks.   So  Mr  Chiam would have been right  if  he  advocates

reviewing  our  school  curriculum  to  promote  creativity  and

innovativeness.  But then it would not be as headline  grabbing,

would it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam further mentioned that he would like to see a

committee of businessmen and chief executive officers  of  major

corporations  to  deliberate the issues faced by  the  Singapore

economy  and  coming up with suggestions without the involvement

of  a  Minister.   Perhaps, he has overlooked that  the  various

subcommittees  of  the Committee on Singapore's  Competitiveness

are  chaired by captains of industries from the private  sector.

Only  the  main  committee was chaired by  two  Ministers.   The

Feedback Unit had in fact conducted several feedback sessions on

the  report  of the CSC.  No one had ever complained  about  the

involvement  of two Ministers.  On the contrary,  they  welcomed

their involvement as an indication of the importance Cabinet has

attached to the issue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Feedback Unit convenes similar workshops

involving notable persons from businesses and CEOs annually with

regard to the Budget Statement.  And these workshop sessions are

typically  chaired  by  Members of Parliament  on  the  Feedback

Panel.   I  believe  the  participants in those  workshops  also

welcomed  the involvement of MPs.  They do not see as  "control"

by  the PAP Government but as an assurance that their views will

get an airing in Parliament as I am doing right now.  This year,

the  Feedback Unit brought forward this discussion session ahead

of  the Budget Statement so that this feedback can be considered

by the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to give a summary of the

session  chaired  by  me on 9th February  this  year.   In  that

particular  session,  41 participants from  trade  associations,

Singapore  Institute  of  Management  corporate  members,  trade

unions   and  feedback  groups  attended  the  session.   Senior

Government officials from the Ministries of Finance as  well  as

Trade  and  Industry were also present.  The mood was  generally

subdued  as  the Prime Minister had commented earlier  that  the

Budget is unlikely to contain any more surprises or goodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback, let me summarise. On corporate taxes,

several   participants  requested  the  Government  to  consider

permitting   group   taxation,  or  what  we  call   inter-group

offsetting,  a  subject  that Mr Heng Chiang  Meng  has  already

touched  on, by allowing the losses of one subsidiary to  offset

against profit in another subsidiary within the same group.   In

this  recession, many companies are finding themselves in a very

difficult  situation where one subsidiary will be  making  major

losses while the other subsidiary will have some profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, for property development industry, companies are

required by law to set up a clean sheet single asset company for

each  project if they were to bid for Government land.  In  this

case, the entire group is engaged in the same business but  only

because of the Government requirements, they have to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>

form  subsidiary companies.  This is especially glaring in  this

period  when  the  losses of some of those  companies  could  be

substantial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Heng has mentioned, Mr Speaker, Sir, this request has

merits.   As  it  stands  today, the  way  we  operate  our  tax

structures  is that the companies bear all the risks  while  the

Government  does  not share the burden of business  risks.   The

basic principle of group taxation, or inter-group offsetting, is

basically  sound.  Companies could have achieved tax savings  by

not  setting up subsidiaries in the first place.  However,  they

are  set  up  for  many reasons, often times for efficiency  and

focus  on management attention.  Therefore, the current taxation

regime penalises this division necessitated by business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the concept is basically sound, the devil is in the

implementation.  It is possible that some companies  might  take

advantage  of inter-group offsetting to avoid paying  their  due

taxes.   Nonetheless, I think it would be better to  tackle  the

issue  head-on  than to avoid it just because of  implementation

difficulties.  The basic fact of the matter is that single group

offsetting is a reasonable idea whose time has come as this will

really help companies caught by the regional crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After giving vent to the concept of inter-group offsetting, it

is   inevitable   that   the  matter  of   loss-making   foreign

subsidiaries   was  brought  up  in  the  discussion.    Several

participants mentioned that it was the Government who encouraged

Singapore to spread a second wing by going regional in the first

place.   Now  that these foreign subsidiaries are losing  money,

many  are requesting that the losses in the foreign subsidiaries

be  offset  against  profits in the home company  in  Singapore.

Many  CEOs  would  like to see the Government as  a  partner  in

shouldering  business  risks,  as  I  mentioned  earlier.   This

concept is already in operation within one single company in the

sense that losses in one year could be carried forward into  the

future  against future profits.  Inter-group offsetting is  just

taking this concept one step further.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several businessmen involved in the trading business pointed out

the  difficulties they are facing as a result  of  the  regional

crisis.  Current tax structure on inventory receivables is based

on  estimates.   This  is  problematic in  these  current  years

because  of the late payment or non-payment of inventory already

delivered  to  the customers, especially those in Indonesia  and

Malaysia.  These companies are facing the cash-flow problems  as

a  result of non-payment or late payment.  Yet, they have to pay

taxes on estimated profits.  So they are asking the Minister  to

review the tax payable to reflect the actual payments received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many CEOs pointed out that because of our tax

on  profit remitted from overseas, many companies or individuals

had  parked  their profits derived from previous  years  outside

Singapore.  Now that they are running into cash-flow and  credit

crunch  problems  in the current crisis, one participant  called

for  a  tax  moratorium  for several  years  to  facilitate  the

repatriation of these profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone present in the workshop lauded the emphasis on the

training of workers.  However, they pointed out that there is  a

lack  of incentives for the training of executives and managers.

The  contributions  of these people to the economy  is  no  less

important.   The participants seem to support a form of  payroll

taxes  for all employees rather than the current SDF which  only

takes care of the lower income workers.  On the other hand, most

of  the participants would like to defer any action on this idea

until the economy has recovered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants also welcomed the reduction of property taxes but

commented   that  property  tax  assessment  by  the  Department

concerned  is  fast on the upswing but sticky on the  downswing.

So  they  would  like the relevant authority to  be  faster  and

quicker in responding to the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several participants pointed out that to provide and promote

promising enterprises, perhaps the Government could provide  tax

break for smaller companies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>

to  allow them to grow into bigger ones.  Some of them mentioned

that  UK  has  such  a law and we could follow  that  particular

model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On taxes on individuals, the 2% gap between corporate and

individual  tax ceilings attracted quite a number  of  comments.

The question is when would the Government remove this gap as  we

have  learned  in  the  past  that  individuals  would  tend  to

corporatise themselves to take advantage of lower corporate  tax

rate.   The other ever green topic is that tax relief  for  non-working spouse should be raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out that the tax relief for insurance premiums

was insufficient.  Most taxpayers are unable to claim tax relief

for  their insurance premiums as their CPF savings had  exceeded

the maximum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One participant pointed out the total sum of estate duties

raised  in the last fiscal year is relatively small.  He  called

for its total abolition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum income beyond which CPF contribution would be

made  was  set  some 30 years ago.  To encourage more  part-time

workers  to  join the workforce, it was felt that  these  income

ceilings should be revised upwards.  Personally, I do not  agree

with  this  request  because  of  our  ageing  population.    If

anything, my own sentiment is that all incomes should be subject

to CPF regardless of its amount.  Perhaps, the ceilings were set

many years ago to reduce the hassle of implementation in the age

when the use of IT and computers was not as widespread.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several participants pointed out that our current practice

of  paying  taxes of last year's income in the current  year  is

creating some difficulties. Especially in the current recession,

some  individuals have actually in the current year dramatically

lower  income,  some have even lost their job.  Therefore,  many

find  it  a burden to pay income tax.  To avoid similar problems

in  the future, perhaps we should move towards a withholding tax

system like many developed countries.  And we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>

phase-in  this  particular structure over time to  minimise  the

burden on the tax payable by people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One participant highlighted the problem of what they call

high  net  worth bankrupts.  At first glance, it sounds  like  a

contradiction of terms.  It turns out that these are individuals

who  have  used their CPF savings to buy a high price  property.

As  a result of the recession, because of their loss of jobs  or

income,  they were forced to sell their properties  as  they  no

longer could service their mortgage loans.  As we all know,  CPF

has  the  first claim on the proceeds for such sales.  For  some

individuals, the balance left behind was so small that the banks

have  no choice but to sue them for bankruptcy.  So as a result,

these are bankrupts.  But they have a lot of money in their  CPF

account.   So  the new term is called high net worth  bankrupts.

The  participant asked for relaxation of the return of CPF funds

to  prevent  unnecessary bankruptcies.  While  I  am  personally

sympathetic with these high net worth bankrupts, my own  opinion

is that any relaxation of the CPF rules at this point of time is

unwise.   Individuals should have known the rules ahead of  time

and be prudent in their use of CPF funds in their investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of bankrupts, it was felt that the restriction

on  bankrupts from holding any directorship for five years seems

to  be  too  harsh and reflects our society being intolerant  of

failure, which I think Mr Inderjit Singh has also touched on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government assistance for small and medium sized businesses

drew quite a few comments, and much of these I would bring up in

the debate in the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few have suggested that TDB promote more missions overseas to

explore  new  markets.  I am glad to note that the Minister  has

already disclosed in his Budget Statement that TDB would do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concludes my summary of the Feedback Session on the Budget

for  FY99.   I must compliment the participants for  being  very

reasonable and realistic in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>

their  proposals.   Everyone accepted that we should  allow  the

cost  cutting measures implemented from 1st January 1999 to work

through the system before the Government evaluates again whether

more stimulations are necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like now to move on to my own comments

on  the Budget Statement for FY99.  As the last but one speaker,

much  of what I would want to raise has already been brought  up

by  the  30-plus  speakers ahead of me.   So  I  find  it  quite

difficult  to  bring up new ideas.  Therefore, I would  like  to

take  a  completely different tack and focus on the use of  past

reserves,  this  being  the  first  budget  deficit  after   the

Presidential  Elections Act was passed  in  this  House.   I  am

particularly interested in the interplay between the role of the

President and the use of reserves as enacted in the Presidential

Elections Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter Fernandez of the Straits Times in his article "Spotlight

on  the  $5 Billion Deficit" touched on a very pertinent  topic,

namely, the provisions of the Elected President and the  use  of

reserves accumulated in the current term of Government.   I  was

interviewed by Walter and basically gave him an outline of  what

I would be covering in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since this Parliament was returned in January

1997,  there are only three fiscal years so far, FY97, FY98  and

FY99.   Only  in  FY97,  there was a surplus  of  $5.2  billion.

Deficit in FY98 was $0.466 billion.  FY99 is projected to have a

deficit of $5.05 billion.  So just looking at the total  sum  of

budget surplus and deficit, the Government has already exhausted

the  surpluses  accumulated in the current term  of  Government.

Note   that  I  use  the  word  "surpluses"  and  not  the  word

"reserves".  Dr Lee Tsao Yuan, earlier in her speech,  has  also

touched on this particular topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reasonable question to ask is whether the Government could

have  been more aggressive in stimulating the economy if it  has

accumulated  greater  surplus.   The  budget  deficit  of  $5.05

billion  is the largest in memory but only in dollar terms.   In

terms of percentage of GDP, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>

3.5%.   On the other hand, the last budget deficit of a  similar

magnitude occurred in FY86 when the budget deficit at that point

was  $2.5 billion.  However, in terms of percentage of  GDP,  it

was  6.3%.   Moreover, it was also followed by another  year  of

budget deficit in FY87 of $1.16 billion or 2.6% of GDP.  So,  in

terms  of  percentage of GDP, the budget deficit in  FY86  would

have  a  greater impact on the economy than the deficit that  we

are  seeing in FY99.  As Mr Inderjit Singh has said earlier,  we

should  take bold steps.  The question I would like to  ask  is:

are we being bold enough in this particular Budget?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all remember the recession of 1985 and 1986 and those

were  indeed difficult years.  The Government's budgets were  in

deficit  for  two consecutive years.  Yet, was the recession  of

1985/1986  more severe than the current one?  Probably  not,  as

the  Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have mentioned  on

several  occasions that the recession in 1998 and  1999  is  the

worst since Singapore became independent.  If we think that this

is the worst recession ever, why are we only having a deficit of

3.5%?   So  the  relative impact of our current deficit  on  the

economy,  I think, is only 56% of what took place in FY86.   Let

us  assume that the Government wants to inject the same level of

stimulants in the economy as in FY86, 6.3% would work out to  be

about $9 billion.  Whether the economy needs or could take  such

a  stimulus, I do not know.  But at least we know if we were  to

achieve  the  same  rate  of  recovery  as  in  1985/1986,   the

Government  could  have  done  more.   Would  we  need  to  make

provision for another year of budget deficit?  Would we be short

of  reserves accumulated in the current term of government if we

were  needed to do so?  When asked by the reporters on 5th March

1999  regarding the issue of past reserves, Prime  Minister  Goh

Chok   Tong   mentioned  that  the  Government  has  accumulated

sufficient reserves since January 1997 to finance a deficit  for

another two years, if it is necessary to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, besides the budget deficit, the definition of

reserves  must have included other income sources for which  the

two major ones are investment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>

income  and  land sales.  Investment income was $3.8 billion  in

1997, and $4.3 billion in 1998.  Land sales were $14 billion  in

1997  and $5.9 billion in 1998.  If these figures are considered

reserves accumulated in the current term of government, then  it

is  absolutely true that there is a lot of money in  the  kitty.

Even  if  these are considered part of reserves, it  still  begs

other  questions  in  my  mind.  Should  not  investment  income

derived from past reserves accumulated in the previous terms  of

government be considered part of the past reserves of  the  past

government  but  not  the  reserve of  the  current  government?

Philosophically, I think part, if not all, of such income should

be considered as reserves for the past government.  My reasoning

is as follows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good fund manager could provide better yield but even a

mediocre  fund manager would yield a return not less than  fixed

deposit.   Therefore, the measure of how good a fund manager  is

only  the incremental improvement in yield rather than the total

yield  of  the investment.  Similarly, maybe only  part  of  the

investment income from past reserves should be credited to  good

governance  of the current Government and not the total  sum  of

the investment.  Before I get all tangled up in this theoretical

discourse, perhaps the Minister could give the House a  definite

answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the same rationale, I think, applies to land

sales.  Could the proceeds from land sales be considered part of

the  reserves for the current government or is it  part  of  the

previous  government?  If it is considered so, then I have  also

two issues.  State land is an inheritance held by Government in-trust  for  all future generations of Singaporeans.  Other  than

reclaimed  land  which is created, all lands are an  inheritance

associated with the sovereignty of the Government at the time of

independence.   Land has inherent value and  its  value  at  the

beginning  of  the current term of government can  be  assessed.

Land sale to me is a process to realise the value of land or its

lease in cash.  It would seem

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>

reasonable to assume that the proceeds of a sale should  not  be

considered  part of the reserve accumulated by the current  term

of government.  In my mind, one should not credit the entire sum

of  land sale to the current Government as such.  Again, if land

fetches  better prices because of good government, perhaps  only

the  enhancement of its value as a result of the performance  of

the  current  government  can be considered  accruable  to  good

government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if these two sources of income - investment income

and land sales - were considered part of reserves accumulated by

the   current  term  of  government,  then  one  would  question

seriously   the   effectiveness  of  the   provisions   of   the

Presidential  Elections  Act  to  protect  past  reserves.   The

Government  of  the  day  could always make  use  of  these  two

instruments - sales of land and investment income - to raise the

necessary  funds to meet this budget deficit without ever  going

back to the President to exercise the second key.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the definition of reserves, it would seem that

Singapore's  economy is a wonder machine.   Why  do  I  say  so?

Because in the current term of government, we have only one good

year  in  1997, two lean years in 1998 and 1999.  Prime Minister

Goh  said  that we could handle two more lean years.   So  taken

together,  the reserves generated in one year could handle  four

lean  years  without  ever going back  to  unlock  the  reserves

accumulated  by the past terms of government.  This  reminds  me

too  of  a passage in Genesis relating to how Joseph interpreted

Pharaoh's  troubled dreams of seven fat cows devoured  by  seven

lean  ones and seven stalks of healthy corns devoured  by  seven

swivelled  ones.   Joseph  interpreted  it  as  seven  years  of

abundance  followed  by seven years of famine  and  advised  the

Pharaoh  to make the appropriate preparations, a task which  the

Pharaoh  had  entrusted to Joseph.  Mr Sin Boon Ann has  already

alluded  to this particular passage yesterday.  In the  case  of

Egypt,  it took one good year to prepare for one lean year.   In

the case of Singapore, one good year

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>

would  have saved enough for four lean years.  I think  this  is

very impressive indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one should not compare any mortal with the

biblical  Joseph.   But  one cannot deny  the  strength  of  the

Singapore  economy  after 33 years of  stewardship  by  the  PAP

Government.   If we look over the past decade during  which  the

present  Cabinet  was in charge, there were  indeed  seven  good

years  where  the  budget  surplus exceeded  3.5%  of  the  GDP.

Indeed, we are very well-prepared for many lean years if it ever

comes  to pass.  Singaporeans should be thankful that we have  a

Cabinet worthy of Joseph.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, may I get a

clarification from Dr Wang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I did not know that I have a new marker

who  is  taking me on.  He says that I got it right when I  said

that  we  need  more creativity and initiative to produce  goods

that  are value added  to justify our higher standard of living,

compared to the neighbouring countries.  And I got it wrong when

I  said that we need an environment of democracy and freedom  to

have  creativity  and initiative.  He says that democracy  would

bring  chaos  and disturbance.  Of course, I certainly  did  not

mean  that  democracy is freedom to do illegal acts, but  it  is

more  a  political philosophy.  We accept democratic  principles

and principles of freedom.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further says that we can inculcate and teach our young

creativity  and  we  cannot do that for old  or  mature  people,

because  he says we cannot teach old dogs new tricks.  The  fact

is  that  if  we  teach people creativity, it is a contradictory

term.   The whole idea of having creativity is to have a  system

that  will allow our children to think in unorthodox and unusual

ways.   If  we limit them to certain parameters, we cannot  have

creativity.  That is under an authoritarian system.  I will give

an example.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, are you seeking a clarification from

Dr Wang or are you making a new speech?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am seeking a clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think you are embarking on a totally

different matter.  Could you go direct to the clarification  you

want from Dr Wang?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> All right. I want to challenge him on

what  he said about teaching creativity to young people.  I will

give an example on the meaning of creativity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, you cannot embark on a new

speech when you rise to seek  a clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I would just give this example and ask

a clarification from him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could you make it very quickly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is on whether we can teach

creativity  in  our  schools.  A building is  almost  completed.

The architect and the owner were in the building and they had  a

problem of putting a lift in the building.  Because that was the

orthodox  thinking and there must be a lift inside the building.

Then  in  came  this  despatch person who  had  no  training  in

architecture.  He said, "What's the problem?  If you can't put a

lift inside the building, you just put it outside."  And that is

how  the  bubble  lift was started.  That is  what  we  mean  by

creativity.  We do not need formal training to have creativity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clarification is whether he agrees that in fact you

need  rather  an  environment of freedom and an  environment  of

democracy to have creativity.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I am not a

marker for Mr Chiam See Tong.  In fact, we entered Parliament at

the   same   time  and  we  have  also  travelled  together   on

Parliamentary  missions.   We  are  close  friends  but   I   am

definitely not a marker for Mr Chiam See Tong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if Mr Chiam is talking about promoting creativity

and  innovativeness of young people, we are  on  the  same  wave

length.  We completely agree with each other.  My point is  that

he  is  saying that for an adult population to be more  creative

and  to  create more opportunities in high-tech enterprises,  we

need  to have more and greater political freedom.  Let us  do  a

mental  experiment.   Let us take the key  people  that  we  are

talking  about and physically transport them to a  more  liberal

society.  Would these adults become more creative?  I think most

of us will agree that we cannot be that creative.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek a

clarification  from  Dr Wang?  Would Dr Wang  agree  that  these

people  who  are transported to a politically more freedom  area

may  not  be creative, probably because in their old environment

there was no opportunity for them to be creative?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is precisely my

point.   If we have grown up in an environment and gone  through

an  education system, we are what we are today.  And  no  matter

how  we  change  the environment, we are not going  to  be  very

different.   So the focus that we should be paying attention  to

is on young people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Why do we not change the environment

here?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Well, we can actually do a mental

experiment  and have Mr Low Thia Khiang transported  to  America

with  complete freedom and see whether Mr Low would become  more

creative!

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, at a time when our country is facing an economic crisis, we

are  fortunate  because we have leaders who  have  the  calibre,

ability and honesty in discharging their duties.  If it  is  not

because of them, our country, which has no natural resources and

also  limited land area and having a population of less  than  3

million,  will be turned into chaos by demonstrations comprising

unsatisfied citizens against the Government which they feel  has

not  discharged its duties correctly, especially at a time  when

we  have almost 28,000 retrenched workers and a large portion of

them  are  still unemployed.  But our Government has  not  faced

this situation because our leaders have set up wise measures  to

overcome this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other reason is that our leaders are calm and not panicky.

They  have  always  emphasised on understanding,  tolerance  and

harmonious  living among us.  As citizens, we should  also  play

our  part in upholding the spirit of harmony.  We should  always

cooperate  with  one another and respect one another.   Economic

stability  also  depends  on such a  harmonious  situation.   We

should  be wary when we listen and read the speeches of  leaders

of  our  neighbours.   We should not react on  the  explicit  or

implicit  intention  in  their  speeches,  especially  when  our

workers are facing retrenchment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement for the year 1999 by the Finance

Minister, generally, is accepted by the community, because  they

are conscious that the Budget Statement is based on an uncertain

economic  background.  As Members of Parliament, we are thankful

for  the generosity of the Minister for Finance to grant rebates

to the flat dwellers, and this is most encouraging.  I hope this

will  be treated as a privilege and not regarded as a matter  of

right, because if these rebates were to be granted every year in

this bad economic situation, it is a question which will not  be

difficult for the Minister for Finance to decide.  But when  the

economic  situation is unstable, it will be  difficult  for  the

Minister  to  make  a decision.  I believe the  grant  of  these

rebates  has been fully considered.  Despite that, I  hope  that

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>

Minister will be able to consider my appeal.  It all depends  on

whether  we  could meet the expenditure for this financial  year

despite the deficit of more than $5 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% tax rebate for the Year of Assessment 1998 should

remain.   It  will be able to assist the expenses of  taxpayers.

But  if  we  take into account the unemployment situation  where

there  are  28,300 retrenched workers, I believe  some  of  them

would  still  have  to pay their income tax,  and  it  would  be

onerous  on  them.  Therefore, I hope the Minister  for  Finance

will consider increasing the income tax rebate for 1998 from  5%

to 10%.  If it cannot be granted to all the taxpayers, it should

be  granted to taxpayers who are unemployed or who have remained

unemployed till today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement for 1999 is good and has been

expected.  But once again this year, I will ask the Minister for

Finance  to  consider the financial problems of those  taxpayers

who  are taking care of their parents-in-law.  This is the third

time  that I have raised this issue.  And I would also urge  the

Minister to consider giving rebates for full-time housewives who

are without income.  I believe it is the duty of the children to

look after their parents, even though they are not their natural

parents.  The duty to take care of their parents-in-law is  also

burdensome,  especially in terms of the household  expenses.   I

believe  that the number in this category is small and  it  will

not affect the expenditure of 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moderate expenditure of 1999 is a surprise. Because in

a  situation where we promote savings and spending according  to

our  ability, the water tariffs have suddenly gone up.  I  think

in an uncertain economic situation, it is not proper to increase

water  tariffs.   Therefore, I hope, and  for  the  citizens  of

Singapore  as a whole, water tariffs should not be increased  at

this  time,  but  it  could  probably be  implemented  when  the

economic  situation is stable or when salary increase and  bonus

are reinstated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was given to understand that 6,000 motorcyclists were fined

for offences in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>

connection   with   entering   the   Restricted   Zone,   either

intentionally  or otherwise, in the last five months.   For  the

whole year, this number may increase by two or three times.   It

also involves other vehicles like cars and lorries.  The payment

for  entering this zone is aimed at reducing congestion.   I  am

thankful to LTA for granting a road tax rebate.  But it would be

better  if  the  road tax be further reduced so  that  motorists

would  be  relieved  of  the  expenses  and  use  it  for  their

children's  school expenses and household expenses.   I  believe

the   Minister  will  say  that  Singaporeans  are  always   not

satisfied.  When given a piece, they always want a bigger share.

But this is the reality of life for Singaporeans.  In fact, this

is  the  time for us to ask the Minister for Finance to consider

whatever problems that they face, especially relating to  money.

There  is  a  saying,  if  you  are fortunate,  it  will  float,

otherwise it will sink.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, for the first time, there is a budget

deficit  of  $5 billion for the estimates of 1999-2000  and  the

measures  that  have been taken have not yet shown  any  result.

What  happens if the economy does not recover or becomes  worse?

Is  the  Minister  for Finance ready to face such  a  situation?

Although  the  Prime Minister has said that fellow  Singaporeans

should  not be worried, because we are able to use the  reserves

of 1997 to face this economic recession, I hope the Minister for

Finance will look for other means to use the reserves so that we

need not be worried when we face a worse situation if it were to

come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the motion in the name of the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this year's Budget is the second deficit budget since  the

independence of Singapore, and  we are in a situation where  our

neighbouring countries are facing political and social  upheaval

and their stability is in trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country, like a small boat in a sea of

towering  waves.  We need a very capable helmsman  to  keep  the

boat  under  control.   We  also need  the  cooperation  of  all

passengers on board

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>

the  boat to balance it properly.  In this way, we will be  able

to  ensure  that this small boat will sail through the  towering

waves  to  reach  our  destination eventually.  So  we  must  be

prepared for all eventualities and face any unforeseen worsening

of the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 is a challenging year. At this very critical moment, the

Government  is  able  to give a 10% across-the-board  rebate  on

personal  and  corporate  income tax and  also  rebates  on  HDB

rentals, utilities and S&C charges to lighten the burden of  our

people.   For the business people, there is also a whole  series

of  assistance schemes to help them, in addition  to  the  $10.5

billion  cost-cutting package announced in November  last  year.

This  year's budget is one  in which the Government  is  sharing

the  people's  hardship.  This budget has the support of all the

ordinary folks as well as the business community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the budget itself, I would like to make the following

suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We must have more tax rebates for donations to charity and

social  community  services.    I  support  Mr  Lim  Swee  Say's

proposal that the Government should give more incentives  during

these  bad  times.  When we feel that money is  not  enough,  we

should  make it possible for more enthusiastic charitable people

to  donate more money to charitable and community organisations.

I  believe and suggest that the Government would be able to give

them double tax deduction for their donations, just like what we

have done for the foreign maid levy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should revalue the commercial and residential

properties more readily so as to keep  in line with their market

value.  The Government is granting a 55% property tax rebate.  I

think it is a good policy.  But some commercial properties  were

bought  in the year 1995/96, when the property value was at  its

peak.    Now that the property market value has dropped by about

30% to 40%,  I hope the Property Tax Department will take a more

realistic approach to revalue these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>

properties, particularly commercial properties, to reflect their

present market value  and give them the proper tax rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On GST, I also support Mr Lew Syn Pau's proposal that

GST  should be reduced from 3% to 2% for a period of two  years.

At  present,  businesses with  annual business turnover  of  not

more  than  $1 million are exempted from GST.  I feel  that  the

ceiling  should  be raised to $2 million.  This  will  help  the

small and medium  enterprises and the neighbourhood shops in HDB

estates as well as the residents there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Liberalise the rules on subletting of land and factory

premises.  Last year, I successfully proposed to the Minister to

liberalise  the subletting of  JTC and HDB factories and  shops.

Factories  are  now allowed to sublet 50% of  their  space   and

those  companies  which  are linked to the  parent  company  are

allowed to sublet up to 75% of the factory space.  However, this

rule  applies only to factories which are in occupation of  more

than  5  years.   In other words, only those who  have  been  in

occupation  of  the property for not less than  five  years  can

enjoy this kind of preferential treatment.  I think JTC and  HDB

should  repeal the 5-year limit to allow those who bought  their

factories at the peak prices in 1995/96 to sublet part of  their

premises so as to collect some rent to help them tide over these

difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Financing for SMEs. Many small and medium enterprises

managed to   obtain bank loans in 1995 and 1996 through the help

of EDB at low interest rates.  This is a good policy.  Many SMEs

have  benefited  from this.  However,  because  of  the  1997/98

economic  recession,  the business of these  SMEs   is  severely

affected.   At  the  same  time, these  companies  have  to  pay

interest  to the bank at rates higher than before.  During  this

critical period, can the Government consider setting up a   two-year bridging loan at preferential rates to help these companies

tide over these difficult times?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me deal with the expenditure on education. This

year,  the  Ministry of Education's budget is 3.2%  higher  than

last year's.  The idea is to train and educate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>

more people so that they can serve society and contribute to the

country.   This is a long-term investment on our human resources

so as to prepare Singaporeans to face the challenges of the 21st

century.   I  believe all Singaporeans will support  the  bigger

budget for the Ministry of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few issues I would like to raise on Education. One,

we   must  ensure  that  there  are  sufficient  places  in  the

universities  for  our own local students.  I  strongly  believe

that  every Singapore citizen should be given at least 10  years

of  education in primary and secondary schools. Those with  good

results  may  go  to  junior  colleges,  polytechnics  and  even

universities.  At the moment, we have two universities - NUS and

NTU.   Every year, we are able to provide for 9,000 places, with

10%  reserved  for foreign students, ie, about  900  places  for

foreign  students.   According  to  the  newspaper  report  this

morning,  the Ministry of Education intends to raise the  number

of  places  reserved for foreign students to 20%  of  the  total

enrolment  each  year. I would like to ask the Minister  whether

this extra 10% of places for foreign students will come from the

existing  9,000 places or is the Ministry of Education going  to

create  more  places  in the universities for  foreign  students

without  reducing the places for our local students,  since  our

third university will only start to enroll students in the  year

2004.   There  are still five years to go before  2004.   During

these  five  years, if we take away another 10% from  the  9,000

places  for  foreign  students, that means our  local  students'

opportunities will be correspondingly reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, graduates from the polytechnics have to work for two

years  to  earn  some credits to qualify for  admission  to  the

university.   I  think  this is a good  idea.   But  polytechnic

students who graduated in 1997/98, when we were facing a  severe

economic crisis, are experiencing great difficulties in  finding

jobs  because many factories and companies are retrenching their

workers.   In  these  circumstances, many polytechnic  graduates

cannot get jobs, thereby jeopardising their chances of admission

to the NTU.  Those who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>

can  afford can go overseas to get their degrees, but those  who

are  not  so well to do will lose the opportunity to  enter  the

university.  In view of the economic crisis, this policy  should

be adjusted accordingly so as to ensure our students will not be

deprived of the opportunity to enter the university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to deal with the problem of brain drain.

Every  year,  we have only 9,000 places in the universities  for

our  students.  Many parents are telling me that their  children

cannot gain admission to the local universities and have  to  go

overseas.  To  be able to go overseas for further studies  is  a

good thing.  SM Lee has also said that when students go overseas

for  study,  they can mingle with students of foreign  countries

and  establish  rapport with them. After their graduation,  they

will  be  able to strengthen relations with other countries  and

contribute  to the development of our nation.  I have  not  been

able to get the statistics from the Ministry of Education on how

many  Singapore students have to go overseas each  year  because

they  are unable to get places in our local universities. I  was

told  that  the Ministry did not have the relevant  data.   This

gives  me cause for concern.  It is important that we keep track

of  the  number  of  students who have  to  go  to  universities

overseas  because  there  is no place  for  them  in  our  local

universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry of Education set up a

special  department to assist our students in finding places  in

foreign  universities and to maintain contact with  them.   This

way, we will be able to know when they have graduated from these

universities, and find some way to make them come back, so  that

our  good  talents  will  not be lost.  Our  students  who  went

overseas and do not come back after graduation are a loss to our

society.   We  have invested at least 10 years of  education  on

them.   I would ask the Minister how much money we have invested

on  each  student  for the 10-year period from  primary  one  to

secondary four.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Budget this year is not particularly

spectacular, it is not a bad

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>

budget  either.   If  the Government and  the  people  can  work

together to overcome our difficulties, we will be able  to  tide

over the difficult times. We hope that at the end of the tunnel,

we can see some light.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support this Budget.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br>5.20 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would first like to thank all Members  of  this

House  who  have  spoken on the Budget over the past  two  days.

Given  the  time constraint, I will not be able to  address  all

questions  and issues raised.  So I will focus on  major  issues

and  leave  matters of details to the Committee of Supply  where

cuts on these subjects have been raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the release of the FY99 Budget, many have commented

that  it  is prudent, and geared towards the long-term  good  of

Singapore.  However, some felt that the FY99 Budget is  cautious

and contained few new measures to stimulate the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>

economy.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the FY99 Budget should be seen in the

context  of  the  total response Government has made  since  the

start  of  this crisis.  When the economic outlook  deteriorated

after  the FY98 Budget last February, we did not wait until  the

FY99  Budget to introduce the $2 billion off-Budget  package  in

June,  and the subsequent $10.5 billion cost-cutting package  in

November  1998.   The  Government  has  responded  promptly  and

appropriately as the situation develops.  As I have said  in  my

Budget   Statement  earlier,  we  should  let  the  cost-cutting

measures  work  through the system first.  The Budget  therefore

did  not  contain  any new major cost-cutting initiatives.   The

Government   will  be  monitoring  the  economy   and   external

developments very closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with this House Government's thinking behind

the   formulation  of  the  FY99  Budget.   The  Government  has

consistently  adhered to the wisdom of a prudent fiscal  policy.

We  live within our means, accumulating surpluses in good  years

of  strong economic growth and drawing down on our reserves only

in  years  of  economic downturn.  Government has been  able  to

maintain budget surpluses in normal years, not by overtaxing the

people and businesses, but by spending judiciously and fostering

economic growth.  On hindsight, it is plain that Government  has

been correct in resisting the temptation to simply spend what we

have when economic growth was buoyant.  The accumulated reserves

now give us a valuable buffer against the present downturn.  The

policy  of spending what we need, and always with an eye to  the

future, is a fundamental pillar for Singapore's economic health,

social stability and long-term security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY98, Government is expected to run a deficit of $466

million.   After  taking  into account the  impact  of  the  tax

benefits and rebates announced in my FY99 Budget Statement,  the

forecasted budget deficit for FY99 is $5.4 billion.  FY 2000 may

still  be  in deficit, given the carry-over effect of the  cost-cutting  measures,  and  the time lag in  the  increase  in  tax

collection when the economy does turn around.  Even  so,  it  is

important to bear in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>

mind  what  the  FY99  budget  deficit  will  be  incurred  for.

Firstly,  Government has carefully prioritised its  spending  by

focusing  on developing long-term capabilities, with substantial

increases   in  spending  on  social  and  community   services,

especially  for  education.  Secondly,  FY99  Budget  introduces

further  tax  incentives to help Singapore seize the  window  of

opportunity  to  further  develop certain  economic  activities.

Thirdly, the Budget offers relief to individuals and households,

both in tax rebates and household rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government wants to help our people tide over the

current  difficulties as best as possible, partly by alleviating

costs  with  rebates, but even more so by miminising job  losses

through  helping  companies survive and prepare  themselves  for

future  competition.  We must understand that Government  cannot

fully  offset  the  impact of this recession,  which  is  caused

largely  by the fall in external demand.  Adjustment is painful,

but unavoidable.  We must adapt to changing circumstances.  This

may  mean  that  many of us will need to tighten  our  belts  or

retrain  for  a  new  job, or that some companies  may  have  to

restructure or even close down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present recession has forced us to

focus  on  what the essentials are for building our future.   It

has  exposed  the areas which need improvement, and  accelerated

the pace of economic restructuring which we will need to undergo

in  any event to remain competitive in the long term.  If we act

wisely,  we  will emerge fitter than our competitors  after  the

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis has also made us less complacent as a people, and to

appreciate  the  significance  of  the  fundamentals,  like  the

upgrading  of  skills,  maintaining  competitive  costs,  having

strong  reserves,  and most important of all, preserving  social

cohesion.   This crisis is not merely a test of the Government's

skills,  but  also a test of the resilience of  Singapore  as  a

nation and a people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must not just aim to survive the economic crisis. We

must emerge from the crisis fitter for the race ahead.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>

I  have  elaborated  in  my  Budget Statement  our  five-pronged

strategy,  which is, cutting business costs, ensuring access  to

working  capital,  market diversification, investment  promotion

and  capabilities building.  This Budget, as well as the earlier

off-Budget   and   cost-cutting   packages,   manifests    these

strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to the specific concerns raised by Members of

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to thank Mr Lim Swee Say for his timely

reminder that what the Government has done in the 34 years since

independence  has  been focused not only  on  creating  economic

growth for its people, but more importantly, on the creation  of

a  nation  from the disparate parts with which it started.   The

latter  is  an imperative which is often forgotten by  observers

when   they   compare  Singapore's  circumstances   with   other

countries.   I  believe that the Singapore of today,  a  unified

nation,  with  its  strong  institutions,  is  perhaps  the  PAP

Government's greatest achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim has also pointed out that in moving into the next

century, it is important that all sectors of the nation, public,

private  and  individuals,  must  be  prepared  to  change   its

collective  mindsets, not to work in compartments, but  to  work

collaboratively with a common purpose.  I do not disagree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim also urges the public sector to be cost conscious, and

work  on  a  new mindset of promoting knowledge-based  companies

through  an incentive package.  The latter point I will take  up

in the Committee of Supply.  As for the public sector being cost

conscious, we have various systems currently to ensure  that  we

have  a  prudent  public  sector that is  effective,  efficient,

responsive  and enterprising.  Thus, we have the  Budgeting  For

Results  framework  to promote cost- consciousness  and  result-orientation,  and  the  Public  Service  for  the  21st  Century

initiative to promote continuous improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a specific example, keeping costs low in the construction of

Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>

buildings,  like schools and hospitals, has always  been  a  key

consideration.  We have in place a system of building norms as a

measure  to  control  costs.  We also  pay  attention  to  other

factors  such  as upgradability, and the need to  maximise  land

use.   I  agree  that  our Government buildings  should  not  be

ostentatious,  but neither should we go back to  building  plain

old boxes.  Where the architectural finishes will cost virtually

the same, whether the architecture style is modern or dowdy,  we

should go for the modern style.  In any case, the finishing of a

building  only  forms a small part of the total cost,  the  most

part   being   structural,  mechanical  and  electrical   works.

Notwithstanding this, we are undertaking an exercise  to  review

building norms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr Chiam See Tong does not often agree with the

Government, this time he is correct in his assessment  that  the

present   recession  is  due  primarily  to  external   factors.

However,  he strays when he claims that Taiwan has coped  better

with  the  economic crisis because the country has  become  more

democratic.  He also says that the Singapore Government has been

too   paternalistic   and  this  has  stifled   private   sector

initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these statements, he has taken a grossly simplistic

view   that   more   democracy  always  means  better   economic

performance,   hence,  the  Taiwan  economy   has   outperformed

Singapore.   A  quick look around the world should convince  him

that some of the world's most democratic countries are mired  in

economic problems.  He himself has recognised that the Singapore

economic  performance  has been dragged  down  by  the  external

factors  outside our control.  Our exports of goods and services

have  been  severely depressed by the economic collapse  of  our

neighbours,  whereas Taiwan's economy has been less affected  as

its  export  markets are largely to the US  and  China.   Taiwan

itself  has  not  entirely  escaped  from  the  effects  of  the

financial turmoil in the region.  To pump-prime its economy,  it

has   introduced  a  NT$194  billion,  or  about  S$10   billion

equivalent, stimulus package in August 1998.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's claim that the Government stifles private sector

initiative  is also contradicted by the International  Institute

for  Management  Development.  In its 1998 World Competitiveness

Yearbook,  it  rated  Singapore  top  in  three  areas:   first,

Government economic policies, second, our political system being

well  adapted  to  today's  economic challenge  and  third,  the

bureaucracy  not hindering business development.  I should  also

point  out  that  CSC (Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness)

and  its  various subcommittees were private sector  driven  and

many   of  its  recommendations  have  been  accepted   by   the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also confess that I was grossly disappointed by Mr

Low  Thia Khiang's approach in criticising the FY99 Budget.  His

views  are myopic.  He claims that there is no need for a budget

deficit.   Since  development expenditure accounts  for  48%  of

total  expenditure for FY99, excluding development  expenditures

from  the  Budget  balance would automatically create  a  budget

surplus.   He  has further said that the Government  could  have

capped  its  development spending at FY97 levels to avoid  going

into  a deficit.  However, if we do as Mr Low suggested, we will

lose out in the race to develop our human resources and build up

our infrastructure to enhance our long-term competitiveness.  In

fact,  Mr Speaker, Sir, not many governments can afford to spend

more  in  the midst of a recession.  Even if they do, the  focus

will  tend  to  be more on relief measures or measures  to  pump

prime  the  economy,  rather than in the  long-term  development

expenditure.   The fact that we are able to spend  50%  more  on

development expenditure in FY99 than in FY97 clearly shows  that

Singapore has the resources, the will and the confidence to  not

only  overcome the current crisis, but to prepare for the  post-crisis future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has also said that the PAP should apologise to the

people  for the current economic slowdown.  I find this  request

very  strange,  since  even Mr Chiam  has  recognised  that  the

economic downturn was brought about by external factors  outside

the Government's control.  Astute foreign observers of the Asian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>

economic  scene have noted how Singapore has stood  out  in  the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has also claimed that the special monthly S&C

rebates ranging from $2 to $6 are piddling and of not much  help

to  Singaporeans.  His analysis is deliberately misleading.   If

he  had  added up all the various S&C rebates and grants in  the

Budget, he would find that households in, for example, 1- and 2-room flats would enjoy annual savings in S&C charges of $170 and

$200  respectively.  This means that they need only pay  between

1/4  and  1/3 of their annual S&C bills respectively.  In  fact,

the  Government is passing back some $490 million  to  Singapore

individuals  and  households in the  form  of  tax  and  special

household rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also refute Mr Low's point that the increase in water

tariffs  shows  that the Government does not want  to  help  the

people.   Water  is a strategic and precious  resource.   It  is

precisely because the Government has in mind the future good  of

Singaporeans that the increase in water tariffs has  to  proceed

as scheduled.  However, the Government is mindful of the need to

offset  the  increase for lower income households.  A  total  of

$114  million will be passed back to 1- to 4-room HDB households

which will more than offset the water rate increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hougang has also questioned the need for the

Programmes  Central Vote in MOF.  This provision is  to  enhance

the  Ministry's capacity in the current economic climate to meet

high  priority and urgent spending needs if and when they arise,

and  cater for new operating expenditures arising in the  course

of  the  year.  The central vote is no blank cheque - it  has  a

fixed  ceiling.   This  request for  some  treasury  flexibility

amounts  to  a minuscule 0.4% of total expenditure  or  0.8%  of

operating expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam has criticised the disproportionate Budget

allocation  for defence.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we are living  in  an

uncertain world.  A strong defence capability is the cornerstone

for the development and well-being of Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>

Without an adequate defence, it is not possible to continue  our

way  of  life.   It is also not sufficient, as suggested  by  Mr

Jeyaretnam,  to  rely  on  defence cooperation  and  support  of

international  organisations.  Ultimately, we have  to  rely  on

ourselves.  We need to be prepared for all circumstances and for

the  worst.  Therefore, to allocate funds for the defence budget

only  when we face a clear and impending threat to our security,

as suggested by Mr Jeyaretnam, is foolhardy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has asked if the budget deficit could have been

bigger  without  the  provisions  on  the  protection  of   past

reserves,  and  whether  we would need  to  draw  down  on  past

reserves  in  FY2000.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's  fiscal

policy  in  this crisis has not been constrained by the  Elected

President's safeguards.  The size of the cost reduction packages

has  depended only on what the Government judged was  necessary,

given  the state of the economy and the prospects in the region.

The  Government  has  accumulated substantial  reserves  in  its

current term of office.  It therefore does not expect the fiscal

deficits  in 1998, 1999 or 2000 to exhaust its current reserves,

and make it necessary to draw upon old reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong Teng Cheong has told Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong

that  if  the Government needs to draw on past reserves to  deal

with  the  current  crisis, he would support  it.   Mr  Goh  has

thanked  the  President, but told him that the Government  would

try its best not to draw on past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution protects the reserves that were not accumulated

during  the  Government's current term of office.  The  reserves

that are accumulated during the Government's term of office, and

therefore  are  not  subject  to  the  Presidential  safeguards,

include  the  budget surplus, as well as net  investment  income

(NII).   Net  Investment Income is defined as  the  Government's

annual  earnings from its stock of reserves.  These are  current

earnings accruing from interest and dividends alone.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>

exclude capital gains arising from the sales of bonds and equity

holdings from past reserves.  NII is below-the-line item in  our

annual  budget.  As for proceeds from the sales of State  lands,

these  have  always accrued fully to past reserves  even  though

these  proceeds  are  treated  as  operating  revenue  in   some

countries such as Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government took office on 25th January 1997.

Between  25th  January 1997 and 31st March 1998, the  Government

generated an operating budget surplus of $6,273 million.   After

taking into account expected deficits in FY98 and FY99, we  will

still  have accumulated surplus of $368 million as at 31st March

in  year  2000.  If we were to add in the NII since 25th January

1997, the Government's current reserves would comfortably exceed

this figure.  This is because our investments have done well  in

recent years.  Hence, I do not see any immediate need to draw on

past   reserves  that  will  require  the  Elected   President's

approval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chay Wai Chuen's and Mr Seng Han Thong's concern on the

filtering  down of the cost cutting effects on prices,  most  of

the  measures will flow directly to the companies and consumers,

such  as the CPF cut, reduction in foreign workers levy,  rental

reductions,   transport   and   electricity   tariff    rebates,

telecommunications tariff reduction and GST  offsets.   For  the

property  tax rebate, public sector landlords, such as statutory

boards,  will pass on the rebates fully.  Government also  urges

landlords  in  the  private sector to pass on  the  rebates.   A

random survey of landlords conducted last year revealed that the

majority  of landlords are passing on at least half  the  rebate

savings  to  their  tenants.  With the keen competition  in  the

slowing   market,  rentals  and  consumer  prices   have   eased

considerably in recent months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Ong Ah Heng have asked how the

Government  will keep track of the economy and the effectiveness

of  the  cost cutting package.  Being a small and open  economy,

Singapore's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>

economic  growth is heavily influenced by external developments.

Even  in  good  times, the Government is constantly  interacting

with businesses to obtain feedback and refine our policies.  MTI

uses  a  combination of hard and soft information in  monitoring

the  economy.   Hard  information includes  data  on  trade  and

industrial  production, while soft information includes  surveys

of  business  expectations and regular  meetings  with  industry

players.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we try to be as accurate as possible in our forecast,

Government  recognises that we are in a period of discontinuity.

Non-economic  factors  such as the confidence  of  international

investors  are  critical in a state of  uncertainty.   For  this

reason,   we   have  adopted  scenario  planning  to  complement

conventional  economic forecasting.  Last  month,  Deputy  Prime

Minister  Lee  had  outlined three economic scenarios  Singapore

would have to be prepared for.  The world does not run according

to  our  wishes:  we must make our future by planning ahead  and

being  able to respond in good time to develop any opportunities

that come up even in the midst of crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin spoke on the need to

help  SMEs.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir, we  know  that  SMEs  are  most

vulnerable   in   economic  downturns.   The  Productivity   and

Standards  Board  (PSB) has just issued a press  statement  last

week  which detailed how PSB has helped SMEs on five  fronts  in

1998  -  access  to finance, information and IT, technology  and

innovation, markets, and human resource development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are already more than 60 programmes to

help  local  enterprises in various stages of development,  with

the  Local  Enterprise  Finance  Scheme  (LEFS)  and  the  Local

Enterprise  Technical  Assistance  Scheme  (LETAS)  as  the  two

flagship  programmes.  The Government recognises  that  the  top

concern  of  SMEs now is short-term cash-flow.  Thus,  LEFS  has

been expanded to $2 billion in June 1998 and enhanced further in

September  1998 to cover more SMEs.  From April 1998 to  January

this year, about 1,320 loans were approved under LEFS,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>

amounting  to $533 million, which is 32% higher than the  amount

approved  from April 1997 to January 1998.  Where  feasible  and

practical,  the  Government will consider enhancing  the  scheme

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help SMEs reduce operating costs and build up capabilities,

LETAS  is  very flexible and can be used for any aspect  of  the

business  upgrading  for qualifying SMEs.  From  April  1998  to

January  1999,  about  800 SMEs were assisted  under  LETAS,  as

compared  to 643 companies from April 1997 to January 1998.   To

help SMEs upgrade the skills of their workers, SDF is positioned

to  place  greater emphasis on skills such as those required  in

electronic-commerce  while continuing to support  training  that

caters  to  current  needs.  As at January 1999,  about  230,000

places have been approved to support SME training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua spoke on the need for local businesses to

seize  opportunities in the region, while Mr Ong Kian Min  urged

that  we develop our local MNCs.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Promising

Local Enterprises (PLE) programme, launched in 1995, targets  to

produce  a  pool of 100 PLEs with a turnover of  at  least  $100

million each by the year 2005.  Today, there are about 300 PLEs.

Most  PLEs were able to weather the regional crisis in  1998  as

they served the  OECD markets.  Just last week, to help PLEs  in

both the manufacturing and hub services sectors, to be trim  and

fit  for  the race ahead when the economy recovers, EDB launched

the   3Cs   programme   -   Co-investment,   Collaboration   and

Consolidation.  Under this programme, a $100 million  fund  will

be  set aside for EDB to take short-term equity stakes of up  to

30% in PLEs to support their growth for an appropriate period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has touched on the issue of the credit

squeeze  arising from the current crisis.  Total credit extended

by  commercial  banks moderated significantly through  1998,  in

line  with  the  slowdown in the economy  and  a  more  cautious

lending  policy  by banks given the increased risk  environment.

Our  banks  are accountable to their depositors and shareholders

to act on sound commercial decisions, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>

Government  cannot  and  should  not  put  pressure  on   banks.

Nevertheless, the Association of Banks in Singapore has  advised

its  members  not to take a short-term view of the viability  of

their  clients' businesses, nor to pull back on loans  that  are

being regularly serviced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng, Mr Ong Kian Min and Dr Wang Kai Yuen

have  raised queries on group offsetting and taxation of foreign

income.   As this is a complex subject, I would reply  to  their

queries in the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng has also asked whether we have inadvertently

moved towards taxing capital gains, by taxing the recipients  of

dividends distributed out of capital gains.  Whether  or  not  a

receipt is taxable depends on the nature of the receipt  to  the

recipient.  If the receipt is income, it is taxable.  If  it  is

capital  gains, it is not.  To the shareholders,  dividends  are

returns  on  their investment and thus constitute income.   This

applies  irrespective of whether the dividends  are  distributed

out  of the company's operating profits or capital gains.   This

tax  principle  of  dividends  being  income  in  the  hands  of

shareholders  and  thus  taxable has been  confirmed  by  Courts

including  those in the UK and Australia.  Our tax treatment  of

dividends  does  not contradict our system of no  capital  gains

tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau has asked when we will cut the corporate

income  tax rate to a long-term level.  The Government has  just

given  a  10% corporate tax rebate for Year of Assessment  1999.

It  is  therefore too early to consider reducing  the  corporate

income tax rate at this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng may wish to note that the Ministry of

Finance  continually reviews our tax system, together with  IRAS

and  economic  agencies such as EDB, TDB, NCB and  the  MAS,  to

align  tax rules with changing business environment.  The  views

of  the  private sector have also been sought, such  as  through

committees  like the CSC and the Financial Sector Review  Group.

IRAS and the Ministry of Finance also have regular meetings with

tax  practitioners  such as the Institute  of  Certified  Public

Accountants of Singapore (ICPAS).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua have

spoken   on   the   need   to   promote   entrepreneurship   and

technopreneurship  by  creating a conducive  environment  via  a

review   of  regulatory  framework,  the  establishment   of   a

development  funding provider and promotion of  venture  capital

funds.  Mr Sinnakaruppan also spoke on how the tax treatment  of

stock  options  could help companies attract  talents.   I  will

address these issues in the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the many Members who have made

suggestions  on these various matters.  Some, like  Mr  Inderjit

Singh,  have  expressed disappointment with the Budget  for  not

doing  enough  to  encourage entrepreneurship.   Time  does  not

permit me to address the many suggestions that have been raised.

However,  Members  of  this  House  should  be  aware  that  the

Technopreneurship 21 (T21) Ministerial Committee, chaired by the

Deputy   Prime  Minister,  Dr  Tony  Tan,  has  been   set   up,

complemented by a private sector subcommittee led by Mr Sim Wong

Hoo,  the CEO of Creative Technology.  They will be touching  on

areas  mentioned by Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr Lee, Mrs  Lim  and  Mr

Sinnakaruppan.  The recommendations of the T21 Committee will be

announced this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members, such as Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Lim Swee Say,

Mr  Sin Boon Ann and Mr Ahmad Magad, have spoken on the need  to

build up the software and step up workers' training such as  via

manpower development schemes, and a "Skillsave" CPF account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is already an array of initiatives in

place   to  promote  lifelong  learning  and  skills  upgrading,

including among the older and lower skilled workers.  Retraining

is  critical,  especially  among the less  skilled  workers,  to

minimise the adverse impact on people from the transition  to  a

knowledge-based economy.  Let me elaborate on these initiatives.

For  FY99,  the budget allocation for the promotion of  manpower

development  is $150 million versus $58 million  in  FY97.   The

Skills Redevelopment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>

Programme  which aims to retrain the unskilled and  semi-skilled

mid-career workers has been expanded by $120 million,  of  which

$20  million  has been committed to set up a Skills  Development

Centre.   For  the Skills Redevelopment Programme, SDF  and  the

Government  defray up to 80% and 70% of the course  fee  support

and  the absentee payroll respectively.  For manpower in leading

edge  technologies, we have the $800 million Initiatives in  New

Technology (INTECH) grant scheme, of which $50 million has  been

set  aside for EDB's new Training and Attachment Programme.  The

Government  has  also given a grant of $9 million  to  the  NTUC

Education  and  Training  Fund  to  support  training  by  union

members.   Companies can enjoy tax deduction for their  workers'

training  expenses.  Government agencies also work with  private

training  institutions to develop training  programmes  for  the

workforce.    In   recognition   that   the   individuals   will

increasingly have to be responsible for their own employability,

the  tax  deduction for qualifying educational expenses incurred

by individuals has been raised to $2,500 in the FY99 Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 (M21) Committee is studying what more needs to

be  done to support in-employment training and lifelong learning

by  individuals.  The use of the "Skillsave" CPF Account is  one

option, but we have to ensure that the use of CPF funds will not

deplete  members' CPF savings.  The M21 study will be  finalised

by the middle of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Dr Teo Ho Pin have spoken on

promoting  IT awareness and use.  I want to assure both  Members

that  NCB  aims  to create an IT culture where people  from  all

walks  of  life  are comfortable with using computers  at  home,

school,  work  and  at  play.  First, NCB is  already  promoting

awareness  of  the benefits of IT through computer roadshows  at

shopping malls, libraries and schools.  Second, IT training  and

upgrading is accelerated and Government is reaching out to  more

than 300,000 workers, including mature workers,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>

through the SDF IT Power training programmes.  Also, the use  of

Internet  and Singapore-ONE services is being stepped  up.   For

instance, the mobile IT Coach has already reached out to  16,000

factory workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has also suggested that the Government should upgrade

NCB  to  be  an  IT Power Ministry which will act as  a  central

ministry  responsible for overall IT planning  for  the  nation.

There  is  considerable merit in her proposal.  Such a  Ministry

can bring together the functions of the NCB, TAS and SBA.  IT is

not  only a major new basis of economic activity, but it is also

a key capability for making Singapore a fully developed country.

IT will change the way we live, how we study, work and enjoy our

leisure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IT, telecommunications and broadcasting sectors are not only

growing   rapidly,  but  are  also  quickly   converging.    The

Government   is   actively  studying  how  to   streamline   and

consolidate   the   agencies  concerned  with   regulating   and

developing   these  related  sectors.   Besides  the   principal

agencies  such  as  TAS, NCB and SBA, other  agencies  are  also

involved.  For example, EDB promotes IT investments just  as  it

promotes investments in manufacturing and other high value-added

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some rationalisation is necessary, but we need to decide exactly

what  will  go into the combined entity, and which  Ministry  it

should  come under.  There are also a few grey areas  that  need

further  study.   We hope to make a decision  on  these  matters

within a month or two.  Creating a new ministry to supervise  IT

and  telecommunications is a longer-term possibility, but to  do

so in the near future would be premature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen has suggested that GLCs should not be

competing  aggressively in the local market to  give  our  local

companies  more breathing space.  Whether or not  a  GLC  should

compete  with businesses in the local market or venture overseas

is  a  commercial decision which the GLC and not the  Government

should  make.  Also, many of our GLCs are publicly  listed,  and

are accountable to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>

their   shareholders  for  their  corporate   decisions.    More

fundamentally, with the increasingly global business competition

today  and  Singapore's relative free and open  economy,  it  is

wishful  thinking that we can give our local companies breathing

space  simply  by removing GLCs from the playing field,  as  new

competitors will always be there.  Where Government can help  in

a  meaningful  way, as has also been suggested  by  Mr  Zulkifli

Baharudin, is to facilitate our companies, whether GLCs, SMEs or

PLEs,   to  compete  successfully  overseas,  for  example,   by

encouraging our local companies to form clusters or  to  tie  up

with  GLCs under a Singapore Inc approach to maximise collective

leverage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau and Dr Wang Kai Yuen have talked about

corporate  tax grouping for property developers.   For  property

subsidiaries  which are required to be set  up  because  of  the

prudential requirements in Government land tenders, they will be

wound  up  after the specific project for the tendered  site  is

completed.   Unlike other companies, these property subsidiaries

are  therefore  unable  to carry forward  their  losses  on  the

project.   Mr  Lew  may wish to know that  REDAS  and  IRAS  are

already  in  discussion on how to resolve  this  tax  constraint

arising  from  the  prudential requirement  of  Government  land

sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Kenneth Chen have asked whether more

could be done to assist retrenched workers and families, such as

allowing  them to use their CPF savings or setting up  a  safety

net.   There have been many calls on the use of CPF savings such

as  for  training  and living expenses.  However,  we  must  not

forget  that  CPF savings, are meant primarily for members'  old

age, basic housing and for medical needs.  To help alleviate the

difficulties  these  workers face to pay their  mortgage  loans,

Government has already allowed them to use their Special Account

savings from February 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to assist retrenched workers is to help them seek

re-employment as quickly as possible.  Even before the  regional

economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>

downturn, the Ministry of Manpower had taken steps to expand its

Employment   Services  Department  (ESD)  to   help   unemployed

Singaporeans  or  Permanent Residents.  When  large  numbers  of

workers  were  retrenched in 1998, MOM not only  allocated  more

resources  to  ESD but also introduced several new  initiatives,

such as strengthening the partnership with NTUC, SNEF, CDCs, and

self-help organisations, to extend the reach of the Government's

job  assistance  services.  On Mr Simon Tay's  concern  for  the

retrenched  workers  and their families in  financial  hardship,

there  are a number of assistance programmes which such  workers

can  tap  on.  These include the community assistance  programme

administered  by MCD, the CDCs, the National Council  of  Social

Services, self-help groups and VWOs.  MOE also helps to pay  the

educational  expenses  of the families'  school-going  children.

The Ministry of Health's Medifund scheme helps to ensure that no

one will be denied of basic health care just because they cannot

afford it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo and Mr Lim Swee Say have suggested more tax

reliefs for those supporting their parents-in-law and dependants

such  as jobless spouses.  The aged parents' relief, which  also

applies to parents-in-law, and the wife and child relief can  be

claimed  by  those  who  are  supporting  these  two  groups  of

dependants.  We have only recently raised these two reliefs with

effect  from  Year  of Assessment 1998.  For the  aged  parents'

relief,  if  the  taxpayer lives with his  parent  in  the  same

household,  he  can enjoy an additional $1,000, on  top  of  the

normal $3,500 relief.  As for the wife and child relief, it  has

been raised from $1,500 to $2,000.  I would like to stress again

that tax reliefs are not meant to fully defray the cost incurred

for the maintenance of dependants, but rather serve as a form of

recognition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Lew Syn Pau's and Dr Wang Kai Yuen's

query,  I would like to say that there is no need to reduce  the

top marginal personal income tax rate from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>

28% to 26%, in line with the corporate tax rate.  Our individual

income  tax rates and brackets have been reduced over the years.

The  last  change  was effected in the Year of Assessment  1997.

Our  individual income tax burden is amongst the lowest  in  the

world.   For  the 35% of the population who pay personal  income

tax,  the effective tax rate is in fact considerably lower  than

28%,  because 28% is only the marginal top rate, and  there  are

various reliefs and rebates which reduce the effective tax rate.

Government is mindful of the impact on our people and  has  thus

given a 10% tax rebate on personal income tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Wang Kai Yuen's suggestion for the abolition of

estate  duty, I should point out that estate duty  still  has  a

role  in  helping  to  moderate the distribution  of  wealth  in

Singapore,  despite  the relatively small  collection  which  is

mainly due to our generous exemption limits.  Countries such  as

Hong  Kong, the United States and UK also have estate duties  or

inheritance taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng has asked whether workers will have to go

through  another round of CPF and wage cuts.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

Government  is fully aware and appreciates the workers'  anxiety

over  further  cost-cutting measures if the  recession  worsens.

Government hopes that such a move is not necessary.  We and  the

NWC  urge companies to implement the flexible wage system, which

will  enable the companies to adjust their wage costs by varying

the  payment  of  variable components such as  the  annual  wage

supplement  or  the  13th  month  salary  and  bonuses   without

affecting  the workers' basic wages.  In this way, the reduction

in  CPF and basic wages can be avoided.  To date, more than  70%

of  the  companies  have adopted some form of flexi-wage  scheme

with  variable wage components.  16% of total annual  wages  are

made  up  of variable components, averaging 2.3 months of  basic

salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Vasoo's query of more pension for lower income

pensioners,  I should point out that pensions are calculated  on

the last-drawn salary at the time of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>

retirement  and the length of pensionable service,  as  provided

under  the  Pensions  Act, and are thus not subject  to  change.

However,  to  help lower income pensioners cope with  inflation,

the  Government  had  in  April  1974  introduced  an  ex-gratia

allowance   called  the  Singapore  Allowance.   The   Singapore

Allowance  was  last revised in August 1997.   Since  then,  the

Consumer  Price Index has dropped.  Thus, there is no ground  to

review  the Singapore Allowance at this time.  Besides, to  keep

on  raising the Singapore Allowance of pensioners may be  unfair

to  other  Government  officers who had retired  under  the  CPF

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has appealed for more funds for the Ministry of

Health.  MOH's FY99 budget has been kept at a reasonable  level,

notwithstanding the tight fiscal position.  MOH's FY99 operating

grant  to  voluntary welfare organisations is  $63  million,  as

compared to $44 million for FY98.  MOH has also been allocated a

block  budget  of  $200  million to cover medical  research  and

development for FY97 to FY2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for disease prevention programmes and training, the budgets

have  not been reduced.  An inter-Ministry committee led by  the

Minister  for Health is looking into the financing  of  old  age

medical   needs.   The  Government  is  committed  to  preparing

Singapore for an aging population and to maintain our lead as  a

regional  medical  centre.  Having said all these,  some  issues

which  Dr  Neo raised cannot be solved by more funds alone.   Dr

Neo  has  spoken  on  the  need for giving  free  screening  for

mammography.  However, in a recent study to establish the  cost-effectiveness  of  mammography, less  than  half  of  the  women

accepted the free screening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has spoken on the funding for Medifund, CDCs

and  VWOs.  The Medifund was established on 1st April 1993  with

an initial contribution of $200 million.  This will be increased

by  $100  million each year to reach $1 billion eventually.   To

date,  the  Government has already contributed a total  of  $600

million to the Medifund.  No contribution is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>

proposed for FY98 and FY99 as we do not expect budget surplus in

these  years.   However, our assessment shows that the  expected

income   from  Medifund  will  be  more  than  enough  to   meet

disbursements for needy patients in FY99.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran has suggested riding on the CDCs to implement a more

targeted  approach for helping Singaporeans in need.  Government

gives  CDCs  a  resident  grant of $1  per  resident  per  year.

Government  also  gives matching grants of $3 for  every  dollar

raised  by  the  CDCs,  and $4 for every  dollar  of  residents'

donations   through  the  GIRO  system.   The  total  Government

matching grant is presently capped at $24 million per year  from

FY98 onwards and will be reviewed every two years. For VWOs, the

total Government FY99 funding is $129.9 million, as compared  to

$90.38 million in FY98.  The Government has thus not cut back on

its support for VWOs despite the tight revenue position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee has commented that with only 1.66% of the budget

being  allocated to the Ministry of Community Development (MCD),

a   $10   million  fund  could  be  set  up  through  a  one-off

contribution  to  provide  a safety  net  to  help  families  in

difficulties  until the economy turns around.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,

Government   believes  that  to  build  a  resilient  community,

individuals  ought to rely on family and self,  then  community,

and   only   lastly   the   State  for   financial   assistance.

Nevertheless, Government has a fairly comprehensive  safety  net

to  help  those  in  genuine financial difficulty,  but  without

destroying the incentive for the individual to work hard.  MCD's

budget  alone does not adequately reflect Government's  spending

in  the  social safety net.  There are schemes funded  by  other

Ministries  or off-budget measures, eg, Service and  Conservancy

rebates  reflected under the Ministry of National  Development's

budget; Medifund, Edusave Endowment Fund and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang has asked why MCD's budget has fallen for

FY99.   I  want  to  point out that development  expenditure  is

subject to fluctuations

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>

according  to the progress on major projects.  In  the  case  of

MCD,  the drop of $25 million or 14% can be attributed to  major

projects  nearing completion, such as the Singapore Boys'  Home,

Grassroots Recreation Clubhouse and the new sports facilities at

Bishan and Jurong East.  However, in terms of capital grants  to

VWOs, we have in fact increased the sum from $14 million to  $16

million.  As for operating expenditure, there was an 8% drop  in

MCD's  allocation, primarily due to the 15% wage and  CPF  cuts,

and  not  due to a scale-back in activities.  In fact, transfers

to  various financial assistance schemes and operating grants to

VWOs  and self-help groups have gone up by about $20 million  or

20%  if  we  exclude  the  3-year one-off  advance  for  Mendaki

Tertiary Tuition Fee Scheme from the revised FY98 estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to sum up by reiterating the point

made  in  my  Budget speech that despite some initial  signs  of

economic  turnaround, there still exist many  risk  factors  and

uncertainties in our external environment.  The health of the US

and  Japanese economies, as well as the socio-economic political

developments  in  our neighbouring countries, will  have  a  big

impact  on our economy.  There are other uncertainties, as  some

Members  of  the  House  have rightly pointed  out,  that  given

China's  strategic and economic weight, the performance  of  the

Chinese economy could also impact on us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with an uncertain environment, we will do well not to over-react before the signposts become clearer and at the same time,

retain  the  flexibility  to allow us  to  respond  quickly  and

appropriately  to  the out-turn whatever it may  be.   The  FY99

Budget has therefore adopted the approach of continuing with the

economic  fundamentals that have served us  well  in  the  past,

develop  the capabilities needed for our future growth,  and  be

dexterous in dealing with change.  With this approach, I believe

that Singapore stands in good stead to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>

capitalise on an upturn, and  meet the challenges that  we  will

face in the year ahead.  [Applause]

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission

to  clarify  part of my speech which was misinterpreted  by  the

Minister for Finance?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to clarify that I did not

suggest  in  my speech that the Government should  not  incur  a

deficit  in  this Budget, nor did I suggest that the  Government

should  cut  back on development expenditure.  I  also  wish  to

further clarify that there are basically two underlying messages

in  my speech in my attempt to analyse FY99 budget deficit.  One

is  that  the  deficit is not alarming because the  Government's

revenue  estimates  are  more  than  sufficient  to  cover   the

operating  expenditure.  Secondly, the deficit is the result  of

greater  development expenditure and is not due to more  schemes

or expenditures to help the people weather the economic crisis.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I thank him for the clarification. The

implication was that if we exclude development expenditure, then

there  is  a  surplus,  which  means  we  should  not  spend  on

development.  Is that right?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> That was not my intention.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Then who pays for development? That is

the problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the point is that the revenue estimated

by  Government is sufficient to cover the operating expenditure.

So,  the  question  is  how  much do  we  want  to  spend.   The

Government  has  decided  in  this  Budget  to  spend  more   on

development expenditure, and that has caused the deficit of $5.1

billion.  That was the point I made.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Precisely. And that is what we have said

all along that we are spending heavily on development to prepare

for the future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I do not disagree with that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That is fine. Thank you very much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
