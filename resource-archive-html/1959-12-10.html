Standing  Order No. 69D, I have for both the  Main

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>REDUCTION OF CITY COUNCIL 1959 EXPENDITURE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister

to  state  the  amount of reduction  of  the  City

Council 1959 expenditure occasioned by the cut  in

variable allowance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I have been asked by the

Prime Minister to reply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut in the variable allowances was made in

the  City Council as from 1st July, 1959. For  the

six-month  period,  the savings are  approximately

$849,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from 1st January, 1960, the technical and

professional  allowances  that  will  be  paid  to

Government  servants will also  be  paid  to  City

Council  officers  who qualify  under  the  rules.

Therefore,  the savings for 1960 will be  somewhat

less.  It  is not possible to assess now how  much

will   be   paid   out  in  these  technical   and

professional allowances.

<div align="center"><b>NICOLL HIGHWAY PROMENADE DEVELOPMENT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>OLD KALLANG AIRPORT PARK DEVELOPMENT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(National Construction Corps)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

National Development, with reference to the Nicoll

Highway  Promenade Development and the Old Kallang

Airport Park Development, to state-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how much of the labour cost of each of the

projects was paid to members of the National

Construction Corps;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many of such members of the National

Construction  Corps  were  members  of   the

People's Action Party;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) how many of such members of National

Construction Corps were unemployed; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) what information was publicly given in the

press or otherwise that such members of  the

National Construction Corps would be paid an

allowance of $3.00 a day for their expenses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I should first

explain  that  the  National  Construction   Corps

consists  of two types of workers: (1) members  of

the  general  public  who volunteer  for  work  on

various  projects and receive no  payment  of  any

kind; and (2) members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



Special  Squad  which forms the  hardcore  of  the

Corps,  all  of whom are paid $3 a  day  to  cover

expenses.  Whenever delay occurs on  any  project,

the  Special Squad is called upon to expedite  the

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I presume the hon. Member for Mountbatten is

concerned only with the Special Squad as  seen  in

the  various questions asked, and the  replies  to

the various questions are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Question (a), the following payments were made

to members of the Special Squad:-

<pre>

    Nicoll Highway project       $4,660.05



    Kallang Park project        $73,506.00

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Question (b), the Special Squad at present has

about  700  members and of this number about  half

are members of the People's Action Party. I should

mention  here  that  many of the  members  of  the

Special Squad have applied for membership  in  the

P.A.P. after joining the Special Squad.  We  have

made this open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Question (c), about 95 per cent of the P.A.P.

members  were unemployed at the time  they  joined

the Special Squad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Question (d), as the hon. Member for

Mountbatten is aware, I myself announced  in  this

House on 25th November, 1959, that members of  the

Special  Squad  would be paid $3 a day  for  their

expenses.  As  far as I am aware, no other  public

announcement has been made in this connection.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I assume

that  none  of  those 700 members  knew,  the  day

before they started work, that they were going  to

be paid?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, all of them knew

they would be paid $3 a day as allowances.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, would it be too

much  to ask how they knew, because there  was  no

public announcement at all until the 25th November

when it was announced in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



House? Before then, there was no announcement. How

did they know they were going to be paid?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, my belief is that

the  -  hon. Member for Mountbatten has  not  been

following  closely the activities of  the  Special

Squad.  If  I  could only ask her and  many  other

Members on the Opposition Benches to come one  day

and  have  a look at the Special Squad. But  since

none  of  them  has  given even  an  hour  to  the

construction  projects which we  have  at  Kallang

Park, the Promenade, and Changi beach, I hope they

can  join the Special Squad tomorrow, or  the  day

after,  or  at  some  convenient  time  of  their

choosing, and work in places like opening parks at

Hong Lim Green, Havelock Park, Elgin Bridge, swamp

reclamation, construction of roads and bridges and

standpipes. And if they do such kind of work, I am

sure, Mr Speaker, they will have a better insight

into  the  activities and follow more closely  the

activities of the Special Squad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Special Squad was formed, it was decided

that  they should be paid $3 a day, and  from  the

day  when  it  was formed under my Ministry,  they

were  paid  $3  a  day. It was  not  necessary  to

announce  that  we  were paying  them  $3  a  day,

because these people were not public servants  and

there   was   no   necessity  for  making   public

announcements on the detailed administrative  work

that  the  Government  was  doing,  as  it  was  a

physical impossibility.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, may I refer him to

the people recruited to this National Construction

Corps? Would the Minister please state whether the

Labour  Exchange  has been consulted?  As  we  all

know,  Sir,  the Labour Exchange has about  45,000

registered unemployed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the People's

Action  Party Government believes in doing  things

openly  and  honourably.  The  Special  Squad   is

necessary  because  in any construction  work,  we

need a-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the Minister

that we are not in a debate, and the questions ask

for brief answers and to the point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker. The

recruitment  of members of the Special  Squad  was

not  done through the Labour Exchange, because  we

believe in doing the things honestly and openly in

order  to  achieve  certain desired  objectives - in

this case, the construction of important projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a different position when the Member for

Cairnhill  was the Chief Minister of the  previous

government  during  which  period  he  formed  his

unemployment squad. We openly state  that  we  are

going  to recruit members from our Party who would

be   trained   in  order  to  lead  the   National

Construction Corps for our special projects.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do I

understand  aright  when the Minister  said  that,

because he did not consult the Labour Exchange, it

was therefore done honestly and openly?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we are embarking on a

debate!  Perhaps the hon. Member could pursue  the

matter further on the adjournment or by way  of  a

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow, question 3, please.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRES AND YOUTH ORGANISATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and Law, with regard to the reorganisation

of  Community  Centres and Youth Organisations  as

announced by the Government five months ago,  what

progress has been made in such reorganisation; and

whether  Members of the Assembly are now  expected

and encouraged to participate in the activities of

the  Community Centres and Youth Organisations  in

their respective Constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Department

of  Social Welfare has taken over control  of  all

Social Welfare community centres and Rural Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



community centres. It is in the process of  taking

over  the  Singapore Improvement  Trust  community

centres,  and work has been started on two  small-sized   community  centres  and  one  medium-sized

community  centre.  The  centralisation   of   all

community  centres under a single organisation  is

making  progress  and will not be completed  until

all  new  community centres planned by  Government

are  built.  With the winding up of the  Singapore

Youth   Council,   the  responsibility   for   co-ordinating all youth activities now rests with the

Singapore Council of Social Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Assembly can participate in the

activities   of   community  centres   and   youth

organisations,  provided they do not  force  their

way in and are acceptable to the great majority of

those  enjoying  these amenities and  do  not  use

these centres for political propaganda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[25th November, 1959], "That the Assembly approves

the  financial  policy of the Government  for  the

year 1960."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this is the first Budget of the P.A.P. Government,

but  there is nothing in it for the P.A.P. to crow

about.  In  fact, any other Government would  have

made  the  same,  if  not better,  provisions  for

improvement in the social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, Sir, one fundamental

difference,  and this is the manner in  which  the

tools of Government machinery are put to use. They

believe, Sir, that to give better service  to  the

people, civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



servants   should  have  their  total   emoluments

reduced  arbitrarily. They believe, Sir,  that  to

give  better  education to the children,  teachers

should be treated in such a manner that many  have

now  resigned. They believe too, Sir, that to give

better  medical  attention to the people,  doctors

should  be  treated  in such a  manner  that  many

doctors have now resigned. And they believe  that,

to  give better housing to the people, architects,

engineers and others should be treated in  such  a

shameful  way that many architects, engineers  and

others  have resigned. They believe that, to  give

the workers a better deal, trade unions should  be

brought  under firm control so that they will  not

behave  in  the manner that the P.A.P.  -dominated

unions  in  the  past were wont  to  behave.  They

believe  that,  to  win  over  the  confidence  of

capital for the economic development of Singapore,

capital  should be first frightened  away  by  the

utterances  of  threats during election  campaigns

and later coaxed by assurances that there would be

no  increased  taxation, and that  the  Government

would,  by the exercise of firm control  on  trade

unions,  see  that  there is no industrial  strife

when the Party got into power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not subscribe to these beliefs. In

fact,  we  abhor  such beliefs  because  they  are

damaging  to  the  interests  of  the  people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance said, and I quote

from Hansard, column 772:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An elected Government which enjoys the support

of  the  mass  of the people must have  objectives

basically  different from the Government  that  it

replaced."



<br><br>Sir,  if  by  objective is meant the many  beliefs

that  I have just related, then they can have this

claim  without challenge. But I think the Minister

means it to mean the provisions in his Budget.  In

this I can see no basic difference, apart from one

important  aspect.  He  has  submitted  a  deficit

budget  of  $6  million; he has indicated  in  his

speech of applications for supplementary votes  in

the   coming   months,  thereby  increasing   the

deficit; and yet he has taken no step



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



whatsoever  to  meet  this deficit  by  increasing

taxation on those who can bear it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, Sir, that they have now come to the

realisation  that to save Singapore from  economic

disaster,  they  have to re-adjust their  attitude

towards  capital to repair the great damage  which

they did by the utterances of their threats during

the  election campaign. They are now anxious - very,

very   anxious   indeed - Sir,  to  win   over   the

confidence  of  capital to help them  to  run  the

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1959 standstill budget, there was a

deficit  of about $4 million, and yet we, who  had

been  accused by the P.A.P. as capitalist stooges,

introduced  increased income  tax  in  the  higher

brackets  and  company tax in order to  meet  this

deficit.  This was done at a time when we  had  to

face the impending general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has announced one

tax proposal. That is the imposition of port dues.

About  this, let us see what he has to say. Column

805 of the Hansard reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The port dues envisaged, however, will be modest

ones   and   shipping  interests  will  be   fully

consulted before they are implemented."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shipping interests will be fully consulted

before they are implemented."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the right step and is another indication

that  they do not want to offend capital any more.

It  would  have been a good thing,  Sir,  for  all

concerned,  if  they had only followed  this  same

step by consulting fully the Staff Side instead of

imposing   arbitrarily  the   cuts   in   variable

allowances.  Capital must be treated  gently,  but

civil  servants - they are after all wage  earners

- should  go on their bended knees that  worse  has

not befallen upon them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance in the earlier part

of  his  speech  devoted  six  paragraphs  to  his

appraisal  of  the  economic  situation   in   the

Federation  of  Malaya.  We  all  know  that   the

Federation  is  now enjoying a  period  of  steady

progress.  But  this cannot be said of  Singapore.

There seems to be a spirit of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



despondency, not only in business circles -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> But in the Opposition!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -but throughout the country.

Therefore,  Sir,  any move by  the  Government  to

inject  confidence and a buoyant spirit  into  the

economic life of Singapore is to be welcomed  even

by   the  Opposition.  The  proposal  to  form   a

commodity  common  market with the  Federation  of

Malaya  is  indeed  a  good one  and  I  wish  the

Minister every success.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why did you not try to do it?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In regard to Indonesia, Sir, I

am   glad  that  relations  with  Indonesia   have

immensely improved. This is all to the good and  I

hope that it will lead to the early removal of the

severe  restrictions  on imports  imposed  by  the

Indonesian Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance said that there was

a  major  building boom in Kuala Lumpur.  But  the

building trade in Singapore, however, went through

a  difficult  period. Surely, the  Minister  knows

where the blame lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his financial review of 1959, the Minister has

quoted  figures  which  I  find  it  difficult  to

reconcile.  On  the  one  hand,  he  said  that  a

shortfall  of  $10 million on the tobacco  revenue

was   expected.  He  made  no  mention  of   other

shortfalls. On the other hand, he said that if the

Government  had  not  acted  as  promptly  and  as

decisively as it did - and this, of course,  refers,

among  other things, to the increased tobacco  and

petrol  duties and the imposition of a tax on  the

hire of films - there would be $4 million in revenue

shortfall.  First, the Minister  said  that  there

would  be a shortfall of $10 million and  in  just

under two minutes I think, this shortfall had been

reduced  to  $4  million.  Sir,  the  1959  budget

estimated  a  total revenue of $265  million.  The

Minister  in  his  speech said  that  the  revised

estimates  showed  that  the  1959  revenue  would

amount to $258 million, whereas on page 16 of Cmd.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



(New Series) 32, the revised estimated total revenue is

given  as  $259.2  million.  Sir,  accepting   the

Minister's  statement of $258 million as  correct,

although it is actually $259.2 million, there  is,

therefore, a shortfall of $7 million. The Minister

said  that  if  the Government had  not  acted  as

promptly   and  as  decisively  as  it  did,   the

shortfalls  would  amount to $4 million.  We  know

that   the   Government  did  act   promptly   and

decisively  by increasing the tobacco  and  petrol

duties and by imposing a tax on the hire of films.

But  what I cannot understand is why, in spite  of

this prompt and decisive action, the shortfall  is

estimated to be $7 million. If they had  taken  no

action,  it is $4 million. Because they had  taken

this  decisive and prompt action, it  rose  to  $7

million! Perhaps the Minister will try to explain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I base my speech not on what is in the

budget  but on what the Minister himself  said  in

presenting  the  budget. I  would  urge  upon  the

Minister  that  when he moves any motion  in  this

House,  he  should be more attentive to the  facts

and  figures and not expect the Opposition to wade

through  a  mass of figures in order to  find  out

where he has gone wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister said in col. 776 of Hansard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Singapore, the year 1959 had been a period

of  some  uncertainty. The first half of the  year

was notable for a general attitude of wait-and-see

adopted  by business enterprises. It was a  period

of  comparative  stagnation.  The  reason  was  of

course  the impending general elections, scheduled

to take place in May."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nothing can be more true. But let us examine

the  real reason for this stagnation and for  this

wait-and-see policy. This was because of the silly

utterances  of  threats issued by  P.A.P. leaders

during the election campaign. And it is because of

these  silly  utterances that business enterprises

called  a  halt and some of them even  removed  to

Kuala   Lumpur.  Now  the  Government  is   making

strenuous efforts to repair this damage by  giving

assurances of no increased taxation. I have found,

Sir, that capital is less concerned with making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



more  profits; what it desires most of  all  is  a

healthy  political climate, and  so  long  as  the

climate is right, business enterprises will remain

and will expand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that the task of promoting the visitor

industry has been transferred from the Ministry of

Finance  to the Ministry of Culture. The  Minister

for  Finance  describes this particular  important

and  growing  industry  as  "the  task  of  luring

tourists  to our shores". And because he considers

that  tourists have to be lured and not attracted,

it  is but right that it should be transferred  to

the Ministry of Culture. I do not think, Sir, that

Government is serious about the promotion  of  the

tourist  industry.  The budget provisions  do  not

provide  for  a  senior  officer  who  knows  this

particular   job  and  I  would  urge   upon   the

Government  that,  as the tourist  industry  is  a

growing  and profitable one, it should  look  into

and  strengthen  this particular  section  in  the

Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the estimated revenue for 1960,

the Minister is rather optimistic as this is based

on  the  same rates of taxation in all fields.  He

has  estimated the yield from Income Tax to be $65

million,  and  although this is $11  million  less

than that collected for 1959, I feel, Sir, that he

has  underestimated the adverse trading conditions

this year. The economy of Singapore has suffered a

great blow as a result of loss of confidence among

business circles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards revenue from petrol, although the

duty is now 20 cents a gallon higher than it was a

few  months  ago,  there is a  downward  trend  of

consumption    brought    about    by     economic

circumstances.  Less  and less  people  are  using

their motor-cars for rides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister expects to collect $43.1

million from tobacco, and this figure is about  $9

million  more than in 1959. The Minister has  said

that  this  is based on certain assumptions  about

consumer  preferences but he is not  so  confident

that  these assumptions will be justified.  He  is

not so sure of the types of cigarettes people will

smoke in 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



Will they smoke more imported cigarettes which are

dearer,   or   will   they  smoke   more   locally

manufactured cigarettes which are cheaper? That is

the  question.  Sir, I say that  the  Minister  is

rather optimistic, but then, who knows, trade  may

pick  up next year, particularly as the Government

is  now  repenting the silly utterances of threats

during the election campaign and is going all  out

to win over the confidence of capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to see that the Prime Minister has

taken over the direction of the City Council. This

has  caused  a  great measure  of  relief  to  the

suffering  public, and I wish to congratulate  the

Prime  Minister  for taking this  move.  It  is  a

matter for regret that he did not do it earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Minister for Finance when

he  said  that the process of integration must  be

carried  out  in  stages, and  that  the  help  of

outside  experts should be sought. I  am  anxious,

Sir,  that the gradual integration will not be  to

the  detriment  of the City Council  employees.  I

would  like  to  receive  an  assurance  from  the

Government,  in the same manner as the  Honourable

the  Minister for Finance has hastened  to  assure

the Civil Service, that such integration would not

lead to an extensive retrenchment of personnel and

that  holders of posts found redundant and thereby

abolished  will  be  given every  opportunity  for

transfer without loss of emoluments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to that part of the Minister's

speech on the Development Estimates. I will  touch

upon  this  during the Committee stage; but  there

are  certain points in his speech I would like  to

mention  now.  It is clear, Sir, from  his  speech

that  there is no possibility that the Development

Estimates will be put to full use in 1960, bearing

in mind that engineers, architects and others have

been  driven  to resign, leaving the Public  Works

Department  and  the S.I.T. with only  a  handful.

This  is  indeed a setback to the Government,  but

this is of their own seeking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the building of more schools, more

hospitals, more clinics, more houses, and  so  on,

if  done  by  the  P.A.P.,  is  described  by  the

Minister for Finance as adding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



to  the accumulation of wealth in this country and

strengthening the sinews of economy. But when  the

same kind of development was carried out by a non-P.A.P. government,  it is described  as  wasteful

expenditure  and a strain on the  economy  of  the

country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That proves you are wrong!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister, Sir, admits that

the  Government has to go overseas to recruit  the

expert  know-how  to help them  run  the  Economic

Development  Board.  I can see  nothing  wrong  in

this. It is indeed a very wise move to recruit the

expert knowhow from overseas to help them run this

very  important  Board, but I  cannot  understand,

Sir,  why the Minister should have spent  so  much

time  to explain why this Government has found  it

necessary  to  do  so. It would  appear  from  his

speech  that  there is a group of  people  in  the

P.A.P. perhaps, Sir, who are against this sensible

and  realistic policy, and in this connection  the

Minister said (col. 797):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To these people, we can say with perfect candour

that  members  of the P.A.P. political  leadership

are   not  lacking  in  talent,  vigour  or  self-confidence.  A  combination  of  these  qualities,

however, may well lead to recklessness bred out of

arrogance and ignorance if it is not tempered with

a sense of realism."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A combination of these qualities, however, may

well  lead  to recklessness bred out of  arrogance

and  ignorance if it is not tempered with a  sense

of  realism."  Sir, the cat is  out  of  the  bag.

Recklessness  has  been displayed  by  some  Party

leaders,  bred out of arrogance and ignorance  not

tempered with any sense of realism!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has indicated that

there  will be further claims on the revenue  next

year  by  way  of  applications for  supplementary

votes.  One of these foreseen items of expenditure

is   the  question  of  a  grant  to  the  Nanyang

University.  I  would urge upon the Government  to

expedite  consideration  of  the  Report  of   the

Commission  of  Inquiry under the chairmanship  of

Dr  Gwee  Ah Leng. It is important that an  early

decision  be reached. Sir, we did not appoint  Dr

Gwee  Ah  Leng.  Dr  Gwee Ah Leng  was  appointed

during this session [Interruption]-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think honourable Members on

the Front Bench of the Government side should give

a   lead   in   this  debate  and   refrain   from

interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I said I urge upon the

Government that they should expedite consideration

of  the Report of the Commission of Inquiry  under

the  chairmanship of Dr Gwee Ah Leng, for I  know

they  are  very anxious, just as we  are,  that  a

decision  should  be reached with  regard  to  the

question of a grant to the Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another foreseen item of

expenditure, and that is the payment of scientific

and  professional allowances which the  Government

has  proposed  to the Associations concerned.  The

Minister,  Sir, has found it necessary to  make  a

statement on this in his speech, but he has failed

to  give  us  greater details. For instance,  what

classes  of  officers qualify for such allowances?

We  can think of some, but we do not know the full

range.  It  is  not improbable that anomalies  may

arise  and  what steps, if any, does the  Minister

propose  to  take to correct such  anomalies?  For

instance,  if  Legal Officers get this  allowance,

what    about   legally   qualified   men    doing

administrative  jobs? And  if  such  men  get  the

allowance,   what   about   those   administrative

officers  in similar or more responsible positions

who   are   not  required  to  possess   a   legal

qualification?  The Permanent Secretaries  are  at

the  top of the Civil Service, but if they are not

professional men, maybe the officers working under

them  may  get more than what they get  when  they

receive  this allowance. It is an anomaly and  has

to be corrected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister says that there are three

grades of allowances proposed. The highest is,  of

course, that to be paid to officers who have shown

exceptional merit in their work. We do not quarrel

with  that grading. But what we would like to  ask

the  Minister  to inform this House is  this:  who

will  be entrusted with the duty of assessing this

question of "exceptional merit"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general run of Government employees we

are told "the Government is prepared to present  a

scheme" to relieve hardship. I can understand  and

sympathise with the attitude of the Staff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



Side  on this question. Surely, Sir, trade  unions

are  not  in  existence to help run an  agency  to

assist their members to borrow money to tide  them

over  any period of hardship. Trade unions are  in

existence   for   the   fundamental   purpose   of

protecting the interest of their members,  and  of

seeing  to it that their members get paid  a  fair

and  adequate wage. It is evident that  the  Staff

Side   is  not  challenging  the  rights  of   the

Government to impose a cut in variable allowances.

What  the  Staff Side challenged, and  this  is  a

question  which has been repeated  time  and  time

again, is the manner in which these cuts have been

introduced.  What they are fighting for  is  their

right  to  negotiate  with their  employers  on  a

matter which adversely affects the pay packets  of

their  members.  Sir,  will  the  Government,   in

keeping  with  their declared policy of  referring

industrial disputes to arbitration, implement this

policy in regard to their own employees?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has explained the economic

steps taken and has described the recent steps  as

the  use  of the big knife and the broad  axe.  He

went on to say, Sir, In column 803:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have been simple ones in that they do not

require  detailed examination of  each  and  every

item  of expenditure. They could be justified only

on a temporary basis . . .".



<br><br>"They  could  be  justified only  on  a  temporary

basis",  said  the Minister for Finance.  Does  he

mean that the cut in variable allowances, Sir,  is

on  a temporary basis? Or will the Minister please

confirm that he does not mean what he says?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister said, in col. 802:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is to be regretted that a number of officers

in   administrative  and  technical   posts   have

resigned.  Some of these have chosen to leave  the

Government  service for a more  lucrative  private

practice. It must not be forgotten, however,  that

service  in  Government  provides  officers   with

special opportunities for advanced training, which

are not available elsewhere."



<br><br>It  is  indeed,  Sir, to be regretted  that  these

officers  have by force of circumstances resigned.

I do not think it right to say some have left "for

a  more lucrative private practice". If this  were

so,  Sir,  then  they would have left  before  the

P.A.P. came into power; for then was the time when

private practice was really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



lucrative.  All these officers who have  resigned,

Sir, have resigned because they could not tolerate

the  injustices  that have been piled  upon  them.

Sir,  I agree with the Minister when he said,  "It

must  not  be forgotten, however, that service  in

Government   provides   officers   with    special

opportunities for advanced training, which are not

available elsewhere." I must remind the Government

also,  Sir, that it must equally not be  forgotten

that  the Civil Service is there to carry out  the

policy  of  the Government of the day and  is  not

there   to   be   kicked  about  to  satisfy   the

recklessness  bred out of arrogance and  ignorance

of  some  sections of the political leadership  of

the Government of the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in concluding his speech, the Honourable the

Minister  for Finance paid tribute to the Treasury

officials and the Government Printer. We are  with

the  Government  on  this,  but  I  must  say  the

Minister overlooked the fact that it was  not  the

Government  Printer  who did the  printing,  proof

reading, etc, but his technical men, and these men

should  not be forgotten too - that to them, we  too

owe due thanks.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

the  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance  in  his  Budget

statement said [col. 7761:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the scare about the decline in business

generated  by the cuts in variable allowances  was

largely unfounded."



<br><br>Sir,  this is true if he is referring to  business

that  concerns the big magnates and the  very  big

businesses of the millionaires. But for businesses

of  small  tradesmen we read in  the  papers  that

taxis had to lower their fares to the level of the

fares  of  the buses because of lack of  business.

They  had  to  engage girls,  it  seems,  to  lure

passengers,  and  when this  did  not  work,  they

employed runners to campaign for passengers.  Some

motor  firms,  we were told, threatened  to  close

down  if business went on as badly as it did. Why,

even  the  Minister for Finance  himself  admitted

that there was a decline in the building trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every hawker I have met has said or complained

about  bad business. Unemployment is ever  on  the

increase. Yet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  thinks  that the  scare  about  the

decline  in  business generated  by  the  variable

allowance  cuts  was  unfounded!  He  argued  that

receipts   from  entertainment  duty  and   liquor

revenue showed no decline. Of course, it did  not,

Sir.  As  I  have  said,  the  magnates  and   the

millionaires  have not been hit. People  with  big

business - big money - have not been hit. That is  the

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. claims to be a Government of the

people - a Government of the masses. But it was  not

the  rich that had been hit. It was the middle and

the lower income groups that had been hit. The cut

in  variable allowances has hit civil servants and

below.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Finance, the

building  trade  went through a difficult  period.

Who   and  what  was  responsible  for  this?  The

Minister  himself  admitted  that  there   was   a

building boom in Kuala Lumpur; and since,  in  the

words  of the Minister himself, prosperity in  the

Federation  inevitably brings with it an  increase

in  business  in Singapore, how is it,  Sir,  that

Kuala  Lumpur  is  enjoying a  building  boom  and

Singapore  is suffering the reverse fate?  Perhaps

in  Kuala  Lumpur they did everything to encourage

developers. But certainly not here, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, barriers have been placed before

developers.  Whereas  in  the  old  days  electric

cables  and  pipe  lines were put  in  development

estates  for  developers because such  investments

eventually brought revenue to the City Council, it

is  now up to the developers to pay for these.  In

the old days, if after five years - I stand open  to

correction in the number of years - if the money for

installation  was  recovered, the  developers,  if

they had put in the deposit, were allowed to claim

the refund. This is no longer the practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on this point - the third point that I shall

be  giving - I open myself to correction - it is  said

that  the  City  Council  now,  when  working  out

charges for connections and installations, allow a

profit  for themselves - a very high percentage  of

profit - and this is not subject to query.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat to close down the brick-works is

sufficient  warning, Sir, that if unemployment  in

Singapore  is  not to be substantially  increased,

these  impositions should be lifted,  because  far

from hitting the developers, it will hit the small

purchaser - the wage earner, who perhaps in all  his

earning  life has put aside some money  hoping  to

provide  a  roof over his and his family's  heads.

Any  charge  that  the Government  forces  on  the

developers  is  going  to  be  passed  on  to  the

purchaser. It is understandable that no  developer

will  run a losing business. Eventually it is  the

purchaser  who  has  to pay for  all  these  extra

charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister believes that local industry was adversely affected for a variety of reasons. A

variety  of  reasons was forwarded.  But  I  think

there  is  one  important  reason  that  has  been

overlooked.   Local  products  are  cheaper   than

imported products and, therefore, consumed by  the

middle  and lower income groups. And these people,

as I have mentioned before, having been hit by the

pay  cuts,  consumed less and, therefore,  it  has

affected  local  industry; whereas imported  goods

are  expensive and consumed by the rich and as the

rich  has  not  directly or indirectly  been  hit,

naturally  that  explains why  trading  conditions

have shown an improvement of about ten per cent in

respect of imports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a common market with the Federation will

benefit  Singapore, I shall not make any  comments

in   case  they  prejudice  the  chances  of   the

Government.  All  I  wish to  say  is - I  wish  the

Minister  luck in this project, for, he will  need

plenty of it if he is to see it through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister seems to be pessimistic concerning the revenue increase for 1960. He gives, as the

reason  for this, the fact that revenue  has  lost

the  buoyancy  of the post-Korean war  years.  One

wonders what part the transfer of firms, factories

and  head offices from Singapore to the Federation

plays  in  the loss of this buoyancy. The Minister

has  prophesied prosperity for the Federation  for

1960, and he has also stated, as I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



have   quoted  before,  that  prosperity  in   the

Federation  inevitably brings with it an  increase

in  business in Singapore. It is difficult then to

understand  why he should not be optimistic  about

the  increase  of  revenue in Singapore  for  1960

also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of population, the Minister

promised  to  make every effort to slow  down  the

rate  of  population growth.  No  one  denies  the

necessity  for  this, Sir, It is  hoped,  however,

that  the Government will find means and  ways  of

carrying this out without offending religions like

those of the Catholics and the Muslims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 1,109 new posts created for 1960, 80 are

against  the  deletion of existing posts,  leaving

1,029 for the Health and the Education Ministries.

We  shall  be obliged, Sir, if the Government  can

give   us  a  breakdown  of  these  figures.   For

instance,  how many specialists, doctors,  nurses,

etc, for  the  Ministry of Health  and  how  many

lecturers,  teachers, inspectors of schools,  etc.

for the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the absorption of City Council

departments by the Government, can the  Government

enlighten  us,  Sir, on the question  of  retiring

benefits?  Will the City Council employees,  after

being absorbed by the Government, be eligible  for

pensions  that are enjoyed by Government servants?

If so, what happens to their provident fund?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last few months, Sir, aids to T.B.

patients   have  been  reduced  by  over   $30,000

monthly.  Will they be increased in  1960,  seeing

that  the Social Welfare and the Health Department

expenditures  have been increased by $2.3  million

and $1.9 million respectively? Sir, it is not wise

to  cut down the aids of the T.B. patients because

this  will bring more worry to the patients.  Less

food  means  less  nourishment and,  therefore,  a

delay  in  recovery,  which eventually  will  cost

Government  more money. The Minister  stated  that

costs  for  the Survey Department and Trade  Marks

Registry must be met. I wonder whether it will  be

possible to make these departments self-supporting

like the Telecommunications Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can the Government tell us whether they have

any plans in mind with regard to means and ways of

increasing   the  earnings  of  the  Airport,   of

improving efficiency and cutting down the cost  of

the Airport?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to Government's new development

proposals, the Minister said [col. 794]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be that, taking into account the vast

amount  of planning and preparation that  will  be

required  in  relation  to  the  availability   of

engineers,  architects and others, there  will  be

some   difficulty  in  completing  all  the  works

envisaged."



<br><br>Can the Government tell us, Sir, how available are

qualified and experienced engineers and architects

in,  let  us say, the P.W.D., S.I.T. and the  City

Council? Secondly, what Government intends  to  do

about the extensive resignations of qualified  and

experienced  engineers and  architects,  and  what

they intend to do to prevent further resignations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister stated that $7 million has been allotted to the Ministry of Labour and Law and

that  this will provide employment for a  residual

of  unemployed. This gives the impression that the

rest  of  the 45,000 unemployed would have already

been given employment, leaving a residual of a few

thousand  who  would  be catered  for  by  the  $7

million. Will the Minister confirm that, with this

$106 million allotted for development, and the  $7

million  allocated to the Ministry of  Labour  and

Law for unemployment relief works, the problem  of

unemployment in Singapore will be solved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister stated that work brigades will be grouped in residential units. May I suggest, Sir,

that  this  may not be the best plan,  because  in

areas where construction work on roads and bridges

is  necessary, there may not be sufficient skilled

and  experienced  workers in that particular  area

and  the  conditions might be vice  versa  in  the

other  areas. Would it not be better to  allow  an

overflow of skilled and experienced workers of one

area  into  another? Would it  not  be  better  to

divide    them   according   to   experience    or

qualifications rather than do it on the  basis  of

residential qualification?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister announced that an allowance of $300 will be paid monthly to officers who show

exceptional merit in their work. May I venture  to

ask  what would be the yardstick of measuring this

"exceptional  merit", and who is to  measure  this

"exceptional  merit"? If it is the Public  Service

Commission, who will put up recommendations to the

P.S.C.?  Who are deemed to be the technicians  and

professionals who qualify for this allowance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has already been an open charge of banal

disguise  of individual motives, such  as  putting

friends  in  office in the name of efficiency  and

counting  on their support. This appeared  in  the

Press. There must be some truth in this because it

has  not been denied and this charge has not  been

made  by  disgruntled workers or  Members  of  the

Opposition.  It has been made by a very  important

person   holding   a   very  important   post   in

Government - a very prominent member of  the  P.A.P.

The  fact  that  there has been a  racket  in  the

matter of appointments and that victimisation  was

practised   in  order  to  create  vacancies   for

political supporters, is common knowledge  amongst

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public in general, and in particular the

civil servant who has been living in fear of being

the  next  victim, would be very grateful  to  the

Minister  or to the Government if they would  give

them  the assurance that this gross injustice will

not  be  repeated  when measuring the  exceptional

merits of the civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also promised that Government employees who do not qualify for this allowance

can  obtain assistance to tide them over  for  the

period of their financial difficulties. Sir,  many

Government employees have been faced with hardship

due  to the variable allowance cut. Some have been

forced  into  debt. I wonder what  the  Government

plan to do with regard to the assistance promised.

Are they planning to give them interest-free loans

to  pay up their debts, and to do this on a  long-term  basis  so  that the monthly deductions  from

their   salaries  would  not  bring  about   undue

hardship?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also accused the Staff Side of taking the attitude that further discussions

should  only deal with the restoration of variable

allowances.  Sir,  surely this is  understandable.

The  employees felt that it was not fair that only

a certain section of the population should be made

to  bear  the  burden of the State budget  deficit

indefinitely.  After  all,  the  Minister  himself

admitted in his Budget speech that this method  of

effecting  economies can only be  justified  on  a

temporary  basis. At a time when  Government  felt

that  immediate action was imperative,  the  broad

axe was dropped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that they had six months to plan a new

budget,  is  it not logical that those  victimised

should  expect to be relieved of the burden  which

they felt had been unjustly forced on them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister admitted that there is little doubt that the civil service is going through a

difficult period. I would go further, Sir, and say

that  the  civil service has gone through  a  six-month  period of misery. The fact that there  have

been   innumerable   resignations   from   several

Government  departments - of  doctors,  specialists,

teachers,    senior   officers,   engineers    and

architects - show that Government servants  are  far

from happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this unhappy state of affairs has not

been brought about, as the Minister believes it to

be,  by  the  exacting standards expected  by  the

Minister  of  the Civil Service or  the  speed  of

Malayanisation.  Sir,  as I  said  before,  in  my

adjournment  speech on the 2nd of  September,  the

civil  servants have always risen to the occasion,

and  if  they  are given fair and just  treatment,

they will no doubt again rise to the occasion  and

give  the  Government their loyal, their efficient

and their valuable services.



<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in our debate today I

certainly welcome one of the many speeches made by

the Minister for Finance. I have no hesitation  in

saying  that  the  time has come  when  we  should

realise and understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



full  well the fact that this Government,  elected

by  the  people  under the constitution  of  self-government,  will  not  deny  that  they  will  do

anything  for the benefit of all sections  of  the

population.  It  may perhaps  be  that  they  will

explain  the  mistakes which I am going  to  point

out.  But I would like to remind them that  if  we

wish   to  have  confidence  that  Singapore  will

prosper  from year to year, then the Minister  for

Finance  should say specifically what is mentioned

in the preamble to the constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, although we are considered a minority group, there are many other minorities

composed of foreigners domiciled here who consider

that  their  allegiance is undivided in  order  to

determine  our every-day fate for the  achievement

of  something good. In my opinion, Mr Speaker, we

do  need  to get money from time to time to  swell

our  Treasury so that our Budget will  fulfil  the

needs  of  the  youth  in Singapore  who  will  be

looking   for  employment  and  those   who   need

assistance. The fact that such a statement is made

makes  it  necessary, therefore, that we  consider

the  situation in which Singapore is placed.  And,

as has been explained by the Minister for Finance,

that is, constantly to improve the trade relations

with  Indonesia and matters connected with finance

in  the  Federation of Malaya. But we cannot  deny

this matter or that our Treasury can be boosted if

the  Minister for Finance had stated in his speech

as  to  how we can give assistance, as I mentioned

just  now,  to the indigenous people of Singapore.

In  our constitution there is provision for  that.

But  there is no mention whatsoever in the  speech

by  the  Minister  for Finance.  Therefore,  I  am

doubtful.  If  we study his speech carefully,  Mr

Speaker,  vacant posts for 1960 total  1,109,  but

will  these  posts  help the people,  who  I  have

mentioned  just now need help? What are the  means

whereby we can help them? Can we render assistance

to them merely by way of social aid without giving

any  aid to raising their standard of living? Such

posts,  it  can be said, in my opinion,  are  high

posts.  If  we are going to take a census  one  by

one, I do not think there will be many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



opportunities for people like myself. Mr Speaker,

I  hope we all are for prosperity, but here I wish

to emphasise that whenever I speak I am accused of

being  communal. But as to who is being  communal,

only  time will tell. Whatever be the methods they

must  help the lower strata. I wish to bring  this

point  to the attention of the proper authorities,

so  that  they will know what is really wanted  by

U.M.N.O. which  is  also  represented   in   this

Assembly.  Based  on such matters as  appointments

for 1960 - and surely the emoluments are big and the

qualifications required are high-there is no clear-cut policy on what I have said just now concerning

the Malays in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing, Mr Speaker, I also wish to be

enlightened   by   Government  on   the   Economic

Development  Board. From what has been  emphasised

by  the  Minister for Finance concerning  the  $20

million  which  will  be handed  to  the  Economic

Development Board, it could be said that  it  will

be  far from being of help to that section of  the

people  whom  I mentioned earlier on. The  Malays,

Mr  Speaker, are not communal, because we  agreed

recently  to  send our delegation to  sit  on  the

Opposition side, because we do, in fact, need help

from  our own Government and we did take  part  in

the promulgation of the Constitution. There is  no

ground  therefore to charge me as being  communal.

The  past  Government  did what  little  it  could

towards the Malays in Singapore. Therefore,  I  am

greatly shocked, Mr Speaker. I wish to remind the

House  that  I was accused of communalism  by  the

Prime  Minister  when I spoke on  the  subject  of

internal security matters, in relation to the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara. I hope that enlightenment  will

be  forthcoming  from the Prime Minister  who  had

accused me before of being a communalist; but,  in

my opinion, what we need is to be able to stand on

the  same  footing  as the others.  However,  this

matter  will take time. We had hoped that  mention

would  be made in the first Budget - what assistance

would be given to the Malays - and not only to  the

Malays  but  also  to  the  other  minorities   in

Singapore.  I take this opportunity to bring  this

point home



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



because,  although  we number only  eight  in  the

Opposition, there will be a time when we will work

hand-in-hand  with the Government. Under  our  new

status  as  a  self-governing State of  Singapore,

this  is  the first time that we are debating  the

first   Budget   and  U.M.N.O. wishes   to   draw

particular attention to the Malays who are in need

of  help. I say that it is not possible now but it

is  our  intention to free Singapore totally  from

colonial yoke in the future. I appeal particularly

to  the Prime Minister who had said before that  I

was  a communalist, this and that. I say that here

is  the opportunity, a golden opportunity, for the

Prime  Minister to prove his attitude on the  1960

Budget.  It  could be mentioned in the scheme  for

the  Economic Development Board, amounting to  $20

million how assistance could be given to help  the

Malays  and also other minorities who really  need

help.  If  they receive help, I am quite  sure  it

will be very much appreciated since no opportunity

whatsoever was given to them to improve their day-to-day standard of living. Therefore, Mr Speaker,

such being the circumstances, I would not speak at

length on other matters, but this is what we hope.

I  wish  to reiterate in this Assembly once  again

that  although we, particularly U.M.N.O.,  may  be

charged as being communalist in the course of  the

present  Constitution, we will  continue  to  call

upon the Government to state in no uncertain terms

the amount of assistance that will be given to the

Malays in conformity with what is contained in the

Constitution.  Otherwise,  it  will  be  left   to

U.M.N.O. in Singapore to consider whether we  will

go forward or otherwise.



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Budget  speech of the Finance Minister  shows

how  difficult it is to try to serve two  masters,

to  try to look in two opposite directions at  one

and  the  same time, to try to please on  the  one

hand  Party  supporters  and  on  the  other  hand

mercantile  interests in Singapore.  I  must  say,

however, that he has made a very skilful attempt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He will be squint.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> However, beneath the learned

phrases and sentences, there is visible a distinct

conflict of ideas or sentiments. It is not easy to

try  to  balance on a see-saw, and present to  the

public an economic policy that see-saws now to the

left  and  now  to the right. The  public  have  a

feeling  of uncertainty and instability that  this

may  be but a temporary respite, a lull before the

storm,  before the big axe and the big knife  fall

again; this time on the mercantile interests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Cairnhill said they

were now being coaxed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I notice three instances

where this conflict of sentiments becomes visible.

From  Hansard, col. 772, paragraph 2, we read  the

following (the Finance Minister says):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are a democratic socialist Government..."



<br><br>and  a  few  lines below that, "it"  (meaning  the

Government):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...will seek to eliminate the forms of

exploitation  of men by men which the  exploiters,

through being tolerated over the years, have  come

to regard as customary and, indeed, normal."



<br><br>Now,  Sir,  who  are the exploiters  referred  to?

Doubtless,  the  employers  and  the  capitalists.

However,  Sir, the Finance Minister realised  that

he  must go to the right - so in col. 798, paragraph

2, he tries to coax the people by saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Business people do not embark on new ventures

for  political objectives, such as the defence  of

the democratic system. They do so on a calculation

of  profits  and  if  we want to  induce  them  to

develop  new industrial enterprises, we must  make

the economic setting suitable for the promotion of

these activities."



<br><br>I can imagine their saying, "Hear, hear!" However,

Sir, these two statements or sentiments contradict

each other and cancel each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the subject of taxation. He says of the

future, in col. 785, paragraph 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For there is a limit to the tax capacity of any

economic system."



<br><br>Then,  thinking that he has committed himself  too

far perhaps, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not saying that we have reached this limit

in Singapore."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



meaning that there is promise of further taxation.

He confirms this in col. 804, paragraph 5, when he

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The taxpayer must therefore be called upon to

bear his burden of responsibility."



<br><br>He realised that he must go back a bit now to keep

the balance on the see-saw:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, I hasten to assure the taxpayer that

there will be no unduly heavy claims on his purse.

It  is  not  proposed to make any changes  to  the

rates of income tax next year."



<br><br>"Next  year"?  That is the rub.  Thereafter,  what

happens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, a third instance. In col. 776,

paragraph 4-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You have got a bible now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> -he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the Government assumed office, trade has

picked up".



<br><br>Then he contradicts himself - in col. 798, paragraph

5 - when  he refers to the present state as a "state

of stagnation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the reasons why the Finance

Minister  has  to try to please both  the  extreme

left  and  the  extreme  right?  Because  he   has

realised  that extreme socialism is  not  suitable

for a place like Singapore, and the effects of six

months'  rule  on  that  basis  have  produced   a

Singapore economy which is not only stagnating but

literally dying. So something must be done by  the

Honorary Doctor to help the patient to recover!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Moral rearmament!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, we all know that

capital - a  great  deal of it - has  flown  to  other

countries.  It has gone to enrich and to  help  in

the industrial development of other places. It has

gone to the Federation, Borneo, Sarawak, even back

to  Hong  Kong. But I am afraid, Sir, the  Finance

Minister is now trying to lock up the doors  after

the  horses,  or  many of the horses,  have  flown

away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Run away or have flown away?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Or have run away. Sir, the

climate of Singapore, economically, has become too

hot for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



property  investments. Stability has been spoiled,

and  so  now a sugar-coated pill must be given  to

the  patient. I believe that these steps, although

temporarily  they  may be good, will  never  bring

conviction to the mercantile interests unless  and

until the Government basically will say that  they

have abandoned and will abandon their ideology  of

the  class  war or the class struggle. Singapore's

economy cannot be rebuilt that way. We cannot have

a  Government that every time pledges itself to be

on   the  side  of  one  section  against  another

section.  It  must  base  its  philosophy  on  the

welfare



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Of the people!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Of the people, of all the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Against the minority who

exploit the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> By the people, we mean all

sections  of  the people, and not  only  one  side

against  another  side, because  that  will  never

bring about unity in this country or a merger with

the  Federation. Sir, a very interesting thing  is

the  fact that the Government keeps on saying that

they  stand  for a democratic, socialist  form  of

Government.  I  therefore decided, Sir,  that  the

words  "democratic socialism" should be  clarified

so  as to make us understand whether the Singapore

brand is really the article as understood in other

free  countries.  I have here,  Sir,  an  official

booklet issued in 1950 with the authority  of  the

National  Executive Committee of the Labour  Party

on  a  statement of the policy and  principles  of

British  democratic socialism, and  I  find,  Sir,

that in Singapore-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What date is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> It was issued in 1950.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is out of date!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Well, it may be out of date,

but  it is a definition of a term that is not  out

of date. I find that in Singapore in its financial

policy, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



so-called  democratic  socialist  Government   has

departed  from  the democratic socialism  of  free

countries  like Great Britain. Let me quote,  Sir,

extracts  from  pages 26 and 27  of  this  booklet

under the head "Planning for Full Employment":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If people do not have enough money to buy all

the  goods  that can be produced, unemployment  is

inevitable."



<br><br>And one paragraph after that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government must always [I want to emphasise

that, Sir - must always] be prepared to increase  [I

will   emphasise   the  word  again - to   increase]

purchasing  power  in order to prevent  any  drift

towards slump.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first method is to expand public investment

at the first sign of depression."



<br><br>I  am  glad  that the Government, after  this,  is

going to do this part. The second one, Sir,  I  am

sorry to say, is where they slipped up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second way of increasing purchasing houses

become  full  of  goods which  the  people  cannot

afford   to  buy,  the  Government  must  increase

spending power."



<br><br>The emphasis, Sir, is on increased income so as to

increase  spending  power, power  is  to  increase

incomes. If the ware -



<br><br>But this Government saw  fit

to reduce the income of its workers by $12 million

and thereby reduce their purchasing power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on another issue, on local government, the

Singapore brand of democratic socialism  has  gone

astray. In page 38 of this booklet it says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Democracy will flourish best when power is

spread  throughout the community.  No  more  power

should ever be concentrated at the centre than  is

reasonably  necessary  for  efficient  government.

This  principle  determines our  attitude  to  all

forms of government."



<br><br>Therefore,    they   are   against    totalitarian

government in any form.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is that in the book?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Somewhere in the book. You can

look it up.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must

realise  that  if  he  takes too  much  notice  of

interruptions from the other side of the House, he

must  expect more interruptions to arise. I  would

also ask Members on the Government bench



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



to  try - I  know it is a little bit difficult  when

the hon. Member speaks - as much as possible not  to

interrupt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> To continue, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is in accord with this principle that there

should be local management of local affairs."



<br><br>Now,  what  has  this Government done?  They  have

abolished  the City Council and the  Rural  Board.

Both  of  these bodies are now in the  process  of

being integrated with the Government so that there

will  be just one central authority, and everybody

must obey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is contrary to democratic socialism as

known in Great Britain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation has been referred to by the

Finance Minister, I noticed, with envy. He pointed

out  that in the Federation they have a prosperity

budget. There is a big building boom-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of order. Would it be in

order for the hon. Member to impute an evil motive

on  the  part  of  a  Member of the  Assembly,  an

undesirable,  shall we say, attitude  towards  our

neighbour across the causeway?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the Chair is a

little  puzzled about what is the motive  imputed.

Will Dr Goh please elaborate?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for

Cairnhill-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, I beg your pardon. The Member is even more-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> More democratic!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I was about to say more

exclusive. But the Member for Tanglin did say that

I  look upon the Federation with envy, and  I  was

just  enquiring whether it would be  in  order  to

impute such an undesirable attitude



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



of mind, an evil intent on the part of a Member of

this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I expect the Minister for Finance is

really  talking  with  his tongue  in  his  cheek,

because I cannot imagine it is improper to  impute

such a laudable idea of envying the Federation for

what they have. Please continue, Mr Thio.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Maybe the Minister for Finance

would   rather   prefer  that  I  use   the   word

"jealousy".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we admit, and he has admitted, that there is

a   major  building  boom  in  Kuala  Lumpur.   In

addition,  there is in motion there  a  successful

programme of industrial development. Then he  went

on to express the following hopes. He said that in

spite  of political differences he hoped that  the

Federation would co-operate with Singapore as  one

economic unit. We on this side of the House,  Sir,

share  with  him in this hope. He also hoped  that

the  Federation, having welcomed the  transfer  of

commercial head offices from Singapore, would  not

pursue a policy designed to isolate Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are natural fears which we hope will

never materialise. But on the question of a merger

with   the   Federation,  we  already   know   the

answer - nil - because  the Singapore  Government  has

decided  to go left, or extreme left, whereas  the

Federation Government has decided to go right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You really believe that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I believe that some new

basis  for reconciliation and unity must be found.

I  do not believe personally that you can work out

unity  and co-operate with Singapore on the  basis

of  left and right. It has got to be on the  basis

of  right and wrong. What is right for the welfare

of the people of Singapore, let us do it together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then he went on to talk about the common

market   with   the   Federation.   Singapore   is

enthusiastic, but the Federation is cold. So  with

that kind of prospect, what can we foresee for the

future  of Singapore? I foresee that we are  going

to face difficult times.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here too, Sir, the Singapore Government has

followed  a  policy known as restrictionism.  They

are making things difficult for private capital to

invest in housing. Reference has been made to  the

difficulty in getting plans passed. At one time it

was  thought that, with Malayans in charge of  the

S.I.T.,  plans  would be passed more  quickly  and

more easily. But we have heard that things are not

as  we  have expected. There is greater difficulty

in having plans passed now than before. Then there

is  the demand of the City Council. Before housing

estates  can  be  developed, the  developers  must

deposit  the full cost of laying the service  plus

35  per cent surcharge. One company has decided to

build  in Johore Bahru, not in Singapore.  Even  a

school is called upon to pay the full cost plus 35

per  cent  surcharge. How can  we  expect  foreign

capital  to be interested in investing further  in

Singapore  when  there are all these  difficulties

and all these restrictions? And yet we are facing,

as   the  Minister  for  Finance  has  said,   the

nightmarish  problem  of  population -  a   rapidly

increasing  population with a  rapidly  increasing

problem  of mass unemployment. The Government  has

been  very wise in providing $7 million  for  work

brigades  for the young unemployed.  But  we  know

that  this is only relief, a temporary relief.  At

the  rate  we  are going to do it, $7 million  for

5,000,  just  to  help the present  unemployed  of

45,000,  plus the annual increase of about 30,000,

Government  must  be prepared to spend  on  relief

measures  $105  million rising by  $42  million  a

year. Economically, the task is almost impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not an economic expert, but having read

several  books, and having had also the experience

of studying budgets for quite a number of years, I

know  that  in Singapore, we cannot follow  either

the  extreme  left kind of economy or the  extreme

right   kind  of  economy.  I  suggest  that   the

Government  sceptics  look  beyond  their   noses,

beyond  Singapore, and look at West Germany.  West

Germany after the war suffered one thousand  times

or  more than Singapore suffered with the pressure

of 12 million refugees. They had a stupendous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



problem,  but  what do we find there  today?  Full

employment  and  more than that.  104,000  foreign

workers  and 25,000 people from Italy were brought

in.  Today 350,000 jobs go abegging. Sir,  wherein

lies  the secret of this post-war German recovery?

I  have  here, Sir, a book issued by  the  Federal

German   Government  Information  Office  entitled

"Facts  about  Germany". In 1949  they  faced  two

alternatives.   They   could   adopt   a   planned

economy - planned by the State and controlled by the

State - or they could adopt a free economy. They had

to study the question, weighing the pros and cons,

and  they  decided for a free economy, which  they

described as "social market economy". In  page  93

and   onwards  of  this  book  there  are  certain

statements  over  which, I  feel,  the  Government

experts could well ponder:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The growth of the West Germany economy took

place  under  the  German `social market  economy'

which means the free development of markets."



<br><br>And the next part to satisfy their socialist mind:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"with due consideration for both private

initiative and social progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exponents of free social market economy

realised that the state has the essential duty  of

maintaining order in the economic realm as well as

in  others. But the basic principle of free market

economy is free competition. These exponents  are,

however, aware of today's social demand and it  is

for  that very reason that the term `social market

economy'  has been chosen. It signifies  that  the

underlying principle of free market economy is not

a  fact dogmatically. Its limits are reached where

social or cultural questions begin to clash either

permanently  or temporarily with the principle  of

unrestricted supply and demand. Now, an undeniable

success has been achieved."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I commend that type of economy for the

consideration  of the Government experts  because,

unless we find a solution to our mass unemployment

problem,  we  shall  not remain  on  the  economic

plateau but go further down into the ravine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today there is too much planned economy from

the  Government. It looks wonderful on paper,  but

in  Singapore  it will not work.  They  will  find

difficulties. People will not know what laws  will

be passed on a certificate of emergency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two theories on how to cope with a

deficit  in  the budget. There is  the  theory  of

expansionism   and   there  is   the   theory   of

restrictionism. Sir, I am not an expert, so I have

to  call  on somebody who is an expert. I want  to

quote  from  a book on the "Principles  of  Public

Finance"  by Dr Hugh Dalton, formerly  Chancellor

of the Exchequer in the Labour Party Government in

England  and for some time reader in economics  in

the London School of Economics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No. I will not give way, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He does not want to be

involved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Dr Dalton asked the question:

"Should the budget be balanced?" and he answered-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> -"Clearly in the long run it

must be .  But in the short run, measured in terms

of   a  year  or  two,  the  budget  need  not  be

balanced."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, Hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> "Public policy may sometimes

deliberately  and  legitimately  incur   temporary

deficits in the pursuit of larger aims, notably an

increase  of  employment through an  expansion  of

credit."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a fallacy that an unbalanced budget

necessarily  leads to inflation. It will  only  do

this  if  the  Government resorts to the  printing

press to cover the deficit either directly to meet

its  own  expenditure  or  indirectly  to  support

inflationary bank loans to itself. To stop  budget

deficits   or   at  least  to  keep  them   within

reasonable  bounds, there are indeed two  possible

types  of  policy which may be adopted. The  first

accepts  the  fall  in prices  together  with  the

possibility  of further falls, and on  this  basis

seeks to reduce expenditure and increase revenue."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the policy adopted by the Finance Minister until this budget time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second seeks to reverse the fall in prices

and  relies  less on economies than on stimulating

trade and thus increasing revenue."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he makes his comments on these two policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first policy has been pursued under orthodox

financial  guidance  in  many  countries.  It  has

involved,  in its most drastic forms, a  wholesale

breakage of contracts, both public and private, by

legal  process including the compulsory conversion

of  public  debts and the revision of  established

expectations, including cuts in the  salaries  and

wages of public servants."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I draw the attention of the Government to

this particular statement, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...in pensions and many other social service

benefits."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he gave his opinion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is doubtful whether it has anywhere..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"anywhere succeeded in its object."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since it has sought to balance the state budget

by unbalancing the budgets of private persons, the

deflationary  policy  has caused  great  immediate

privations and aroused deep popular resentment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, was the verdict of another expert.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second policy is `expansionist' as the first

is  `restrictionist'. It has been tried  by  fewer

countries, [Sir, because this was written in  1935

or  so]  and affords less evidence, as yet, either

of practical success or failure."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, Sir, I have consulted several other

people  and they have pointed out that this second

theory  has been tried out in West Germany and  in

America  lately when there was talk of the  coming

world depression that never came.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On closer examination, each has its own

difficulties.  But, given the actual  institutions

and  temper  of the present age, the second  seems

the less difficult."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad, Sir, that the Finance Minister has

decided from this budget time to follow the second

policy,   but   only  when  it  comes   to   state

expenditure.  May I suggest that he  extends  that

policy  not  only with regard to state expenditure

but also to private enterprise, and by every means

he should encourage private investors to invest in

Singapore? Sir, this is the policy that  can  save

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



The  see-saw policy followed previously will never

do.  It  will  never give Singapore  the  economic

stability and prosperity that we need to save  the

masses from unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whether we are in the Opposition or in the

Government, we are all interested in the future of

Singapore. We do not want our children to grow  up

in   a  place  where  they  face  the  spectre  of

unemployment  all the time. I do hope,  Sir,  that

the  Government will not be self-satisfied and not

be  arrogant, as has been pointed out  by  one  of

their  own  Members,  but  be  humble  enough   to

consider  suggestions  from whatever  source  they

come.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

actually I was not prepared to give a speech here.

But  when I heard the Opposition Members speak  on

the    Government's    financial    policy,    the

childishness  and  incapacity  in  their  speeches

interested me, and therefore I am going to  say  a

few words here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Singapore was a British

Colony.   Previously,   the   Colony's   financial

prosperity  was  due  to the  tension  created  by

international  circumstances. If the international

situation  were  settled and the price  of  rubber

came  down,  there would be no prosperity  in  the

Colony. Such prosperity in the post-war years  was

not due to the encouragement or the endeavours  of

the previous Government, but due to the industrial

prosperity created by international tensions  such

as the Korean war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our Party has come into office, we are

going to improve the social situation. We want  to

place  our finances on a stable basis. We  do  not

depend upon international circumstances to do  so.

From  our  Finance Minister's speech  it  is  very

clear  that  we are a Government with constructive

and  vigorous  energy. Our economic policy  is  to

bring happiness to the people and not depend  upon

international circumstances. Since our Party  came

into power, we have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



faced  with  difficulties. We inherited  from  the

previous  Government  a very  great  deficit.  The

Finance Minister has pointed out very clearly that

if   the  Government  wants  to  meet  the  budget

deficit,  there are three ways of doing this.  One

is  to  borrow  money from foreign countries,  the

second  is that the Government itself must  reduce

administrative expenses, and the third is to print

more  currency notes. The Lim Yew Hock  Government

sold  Christmas  Island in order  to  balance  the

budget. If his Government had continued to  remain

in  office,  they would have to borrow more  money

from   America   or  other  countries.   But   our

Government  cannot adopt such a policy.  We  must,

first  of  all, try our best. We have adopted  the

second method. We have reduced the expenditure  of

the  Government. The Member for Cairnhill had just

now  strongly attacked the reduction  of  variable

allowances  for  teachers, doctors and  engineers.

They have criticised our cutting down of their pay

and  therefore gave them cause for grievance.  But

actually  what are the facts? The important  thing

is  not whether the cutting down of allowances  is

fair  or  not, but what is important is  how  they

live  after  their pay-cut. We have  merely  asked

those  who  were  in a privileged  position  under

colonial rule to make a little sacrifice  now.  If

they  have three cars, they could use one car,  if

they  have  three servants, they  could  have  one

only,  and  the money spent on the maintenance  of

the  other  cars  and servants  could  thereby  be

saved.  We  can make use of this money to  improve

the  standard  of living of the poor people  which

needs  to  be improved. When the majority  of  the

people   in  our  society  are  living   in   poor

condition,  it is not reasonable to  let  a  small

number enjoy luxury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has attacked us, the

P.A.P.  Government, that since it came into office

it  has controlled the trade unions very strictly.

The  minds of the workers are very clear  on  this

point:  in  this  society, the new  Government  is

quite  different  from the  old  one.  The  P.A.P.

Government  wants to strengthen the  influence  of

the trade unions and not to suppress them. We want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



them  to realise that improvement of their  living

conditions  is  connected with the  fate  of  this

country. We want them to understand that  if  they

want  their  standard of living to  improve,  they

should understand the financial conditions of this

country.  What we are trying to do  in  the  trade

union  movement is to let trade union leaders  and

workers  realise more fully the situation  of  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see very clearly that

the  Finance Minister is a very capable man. Under

his leadership, our Government has in a very short

time  balanced the Budget. He has also  made  many

constructive suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding external affairs, the Member for

Cairnhill just now praised the improvement we have

made, particularly the many things we have done to

improve relationships with Indonesia. What was the

relation  like  between  the  old  government  and

Indonesia? What did the previous Government do  to

improve  relations with Indonesia? Under  the  Lim

Yew  Hock Government, Singapore became a base  for

subversive  elements  of  Indonesia.  This  is   a

wellknown fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Cairnhill said he agreed

to   our   creating  a  common  market  with   the

Federation of Malaya, and he hoped that  it  would

succeed.  When he was Chief Minister, why  did  he

not think of this plan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding internal affairs, first of all, we want

to  integrate  all  the departments  of  the  City

Council  into the Government administration.  This

is  being very smoothly done. In future, when  the

Public  Utilities Board has been set  up,  we  can

distribute  the work of the Rural Board  to  other

departments; then the Government will become  more

efficient and save much more money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the position set out in the

Budget for 1960 is clear. In the development  plan

for  next year, our Finance Minister has not  only

balanced  the  Budget, but has  acquired  for  the

first time in the history of Singapore large  sums

of money for development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



Tun  Lim Yew Hock said that he also had a building

development   plan.   If  every   person   studies

carefully the geography of Singapore and  how  the

building contractors build their houses, in one or

two  years' time there will be no space  left  for

building  projects. The Member for  Cairnhill  has

praised our Industrial Development Board. Why  had

he   not  mentioned  his  own  Development  Board?

Because  he  had only $1 million for  development,

and even then no progress has been made in the few

years.  The P.A.P. Government, however,  has  been

clear  on  this  point. We  have  more  vigour  to

improve the industry of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has reminded us to

promote  the  tourist trade in Singapore.  In  the

past, the previous Government used public funds to

give   free  advertisement  for  the  big  hotels,

restaurants and cinemas. We will never do  such  a

thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also touched on the

Report  of Dr Gwee Ah Leng, and has asked  us  to

show  our  attitude  towards  it.  He  seems  very

concerned about this matter. I do not know whether

he  knows  the  damaging  effects  caused  by  his

Government  saying  that  it  wanted  to  give  $5

million  to  Nanyang University. We are  going  to

help  the  Nanyang University, but  the  point  is

whether  it is practicable as far as finances  are

concerned.  We  have to use the  money  reasonably

with  regard to Nanyang University. This is a very

complicated    question    and    needs    careful

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Members criticised us and said

that  the Civil servants are afraid of us and many

have resigned. This is not a fact. The achievement

of  the  Government in its six months'  of  office

could  not have been realised only through its  43

Members  here.  Without the civil  servants  these

achievements  would  not have been  possible.  The

Finance Minister has thanked his staff for helping

him  to  prepare a balanced Budget.  This  clearly

shows   their  faith  in  the  Government.  Public

servants   are  not  as  described  by  Opposition

Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not afraid of the P.A.P. Government. They

work  very  hard,  and  so are  confident  of  the

Government.  In  the  past  week,  the  Government

celebrated  National Loyalty Week  and  the  Civil

servants  in  Radio Singapore and the Ministry  of

Culture  have helped a lot to make it  a  success.

Those who are afraid of the P.A.P. Government  are

those  who  are  anti the people of Singapore  and

whose  activities are questionable. When they  are

brought  under  the  new  rule,  they  are  afraid

because they cannot escape from it. The fact  that

Opposition  Members  defended them  clearly  shows

that they are of the same type.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our financial policy was announced to the

public,  businessmen and others in  all  walks  of

life  have expected 1960 to be a prosperous  year.

We  are still not satisfied with this. We are  not

over-optimistic because, in the long run,  we  may

be  faced  with  many difficulties  due  to  over-population  and the lack of land. If  we  want  to

better our social circumstances, we have to depend

upon a merger with the Federation. We have to  rid

ourselves  of this semi-colonialism  in  order  to

solve our financial problems. Fundamentally, it is

a difficult task, but our Government has presented

a  favourable financial Budget in our first  year.

It  tells  all  the people of Singapore  that  our

Government  is a responsible, logical, reasonable,

and a talented Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

must  congratulate the Members on  the  Opposition

Bench for their extremely well-polished attempt to

make  a  mountain out of a molehill in this debate

on the budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have quite obviously shown their political

bankruptcy,   and  have  to  rely   on   political

eloquence to lead them out of their quandary. Like

all  empty vessels, they make the most noise.  And

in  doing  so,  they have echoed the emptiness  of

their ideas and ideals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten, in particular, should

ascertain  the  accuracy of her statements  before

bringing  wild allegations against the  Government

benches.   I   speak   of  her  allegations   that

Government  has  cut  tuberculosis  allowances  to

aggravate   the   situation  of  tuberculosis   in

Singapore. This, I feel, is a calculated  move  on

her  part  to  discredit the Government  on  false

premises.  I  would like to clarify the  situation

here,  and perhaps give the hon. Member here  some

accurate information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuberculosis allowance was instituted some

few  years ago to remedy the rapidly deteriorating

circumstances created by the dreadful disease. The

allowance  is  given especially for  patients  who

have  been certified by medical experts  of  their

curability.  The recipient of this allowance  must

have  a  good prognosis - a good chance of recovery,

and this allowance is only given to people who, in

the  opinion of the chest physician, will  benefit

from  a  rest  from  work. As soon  as  the  chest

physician feels that the patient is well enough to

go  back  to  work,  his T.B. allowance  will  be

discontinued. The People's Action Party Government

has  never cut these allowances as implied by  the

Member  for Mountbatten. What the People's  Action

Party Government did in September was to impose  a

maximum  on  these allowances because the  way  in

which  these allowances were given was subject  to

abuse.  It  was  known that certain  sufferers  of

tuberculosis  in Singapore were receiving  a  T.B.

allowance of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



over $300 per month, a really fantastic figure  in

comparison  with the salary given to  the  working

class.  The Government fixed this maximum at  $180

per  month  as from September this year and  there

were  no  cuts  whatsoever  imposed  on  the  T.B.

allowances except the removal of the 10  per  cent

C.O.L. allowance  which was  added  to  the  T.B.

allowance  in 1951 due to the inflation then.  The

Government  has on no occasion cut any  allowances

on  tuberculosis. In fact, the Government is  well

aware  that tuberculosis is a big problem in  this

country,  and the Ministry of Health in particular

has  planned schemes to provide compulsory  B.C.G.

vaccination  for  all  the  people  of   Singapore

vulnerable   to  the  scourge  of  this   dreadful

disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to ask the Opposition Members at present

not  to  make  wild allegations and  frighten  the

people   of  Singapore  with  speeches   in   this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Ministry of Health is concerned, in

accordance with the declared policy of the  P.A.P.

Government, we are spending more money  next  year

so  as  to  provide the people of  Singapore  with

better facilities for health and medical care.  In

the  Development Estimates alone, a  sum  of  more

than $8 million has been allotted to cope with the

planned  expansion  of  the  medical  and   health

services   for  the  benefit  of  the  people   of

Singapore. Though the sum is only $2,825,000  more

than  the Development Estimates for 1959, we  are

confident  of  achieving a much better  result  by

careful  and  realistic planning. The Ministry  of

Health has always received substantial grants  for

development  in the past years. But  the  previous

Government stressed on the architectural beauty of

hospital  buildings rather than  realistic  needs.

This  was  perhaps a scheme on  the  part  of  the

previous  Government to pull  the  wool  over  the

people's  eyes. Let us take a look  at  the  white

elephant  of the S.P.A. Government at the  Thomson

Road  Hospital for the chronic sick. The buildings

alone were erected at a cost of some $4,650,000 to

house just 396 chronic patients.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



It is pertinent here, Sir, to mention that chronic

patients  once admitted to a hospital are unlikely

to  be  discharged  at all. That  is  to  say  the

turnover  of the chronic hospital will  be  almost

nil,  or at any rate very, very small once it  has

been  filled up initially. This shows the  failure

of  the  previous Government to grasp the  problem

socially  and economically, much less politically.

The  previous Government was prepared  to  sink  a

capital  expenditure  of $12,000  per  patient  in

buildings  alone  to  solve  the  problem  of  the

chronic sick. This kind of shortsightedness on the

part  of the previous Government resulted  in  the

deprivation  of  medical care for  many  of  those

needy and sick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing the Minister for Health did when

he  assumed  office  was to make  a  thorough  and

overall   inspection   of   all   hospitals    and

institutions  in the Ministry of Health.  We  were

aghast  to  see an impressive building beautifully

laid  out,  perhaps,  to rest  in  peace,  if  the

previous Government had its way, at Thomson  Road.

It  was  declared open by the previous  Government

just  before  the elections as an election  stunt,

and  left empty to stand as a monument of masterly

inactivity on the part of the S.P.A. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Government is not interested in window

dressing. We are interested only in resolving  the

needs of our people. The $8� million will be spent

in  realistic  expansion of  the  health  services

commensurate with the economical capacity  of  our

country.  New  economical  and  utility  types  of

medical units will be designed and built all  over

the  island in an attempt to decentralise the out-patient  services  in order to  really  and  truly

bring  health to the door steps of all the  people

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main item of expenditure in the Health

Ministry  falls  on  personal  emoluments,   which

account  for  some  $22�  million.  Singapore   is

fortunate in having a medical school for more than

half  a century. This has resulted in the Ministry

of  Health being almost Malayanised. But there  is

no denying the fact that there is still a shortage

of doctors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



in Singapore. This shortage has adversely affected

our doctors in two ways. Firstly, the doctors were

overworked to cope with the demands of the  health

service, and secondly, due to the inability of the

service  to  spare the doctors to go abroad,  they

were    unable   to   go   overseas   for   higher

qualifications which are so essential today in the

face  of  rapid scientific advance and  increasing

medical specialisation. Our medical school,  which

maintains  a  very  high standard,  is  unable  to

double   its  student  intake  at  short   notice.

Government has, therefore, decided to send some 80

to   120  students  annually  abroad  for  medical

training. However, it takes at least six years  to

train  a  doctor. Therefore, to meet  the  present

needs,  we  have decided to recruit  doctors  from

overseas  on  short-term contract.  This  probably

answers  the  point  raised  by  the  Member   for

Cairnhill  on  the  situation of  the  doctors  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the People's Action Party formed the

Government,  the  standard of  hospital  care  has

improved   tremendously,   particularly   at   the

Woodbridge Hospital and at the Trafalgar Home.  At

the  Kandang Kerbau Hospital too, improvement  has

taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The out-patient services still remain congested

and  overcrowded, despite new extensions and added

staff.  This is because we are treating more  than

double  the  number of patients daily as  compared

with  the number at the beginning of the year.  It

is  expected that the present congestion will only

be  eased  by  complete  decentralisation  of  the

outpatient  services  in  the  future.  The   same

applies to the Kandang Kerbau Hospital. And it  is

the   Government's  intention   to   build   large

maternity homes to solve the congestion at Kandang

Kerbau Hospital in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore boasts of a very high standard of

health  in  South East Asia. A rapidly  decreasing

death  rate and a fast increasing birth rate  have

brought us new problems. The population is growing

at  the rate of 70,000 a year. This Government  is

planning  a campaign to reduce the birth  rate  in

Singapore  early next year. Many of us  here  feel

that family planning should be easy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



to  implement.  But I would like to  mention  here

that from the social-medical point of view, it  is

not  so. It must not be forgotten that to many  of

the  poor, sexual relationship remains perhaps the

only  form  of  recreation they can afford.  After

all,  the  Government takes care of  the  pregnant

mother  and  the  infant baby completely  free  of

charge.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the debate on

the Singapore budget, I wish to draw the attention

of  the  Government to the fact  that  it  is  the

responsibility  of  the  Opposition   Members   to

criticise  constructively in the interest  of  all

the people of Singapore. What I am surprised at is

the  fact that the Government considers that  only

the  P.A.P. Government is sincere, and that it  is

the  only  Government who wish to  help  the  poor

masses: and that other than the P.A.P. Government,

others do not have the interests of the people  at

heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speeches made by the Government

backbenchers, the facts are contradictory to  what

has  already  been explained by the  Minister  for

Finance  in  his Budget speech. For instance,  Mr

Speaker, the speech by the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Prime Minister, who stated that there  are

two  ways  to improve the budget position  of  the

State - by a reduction of administrative expenditure

so  that  the masses will benefit, or by means  of

borrowing  money,  whether  from  the  people   of

Singapore or from countries outside Singapore.  We

admit  that  these  are two ways  which  can  help

Singapore   to  attain  a  state  of   peace   and

prosperity,  so that the people will  be  able  to

taste  the good things in life and there  will  be

assurances  for their children and  their  future.

However,  what we are concerned with,  as  I  said

earlier  on,  is that the Government  assume  that

they  alone can bring about an improvement to  the

masses, but the ways and means by which they spend

the  State's money is a matter with which  we  too

are   concerned.   Indiscriminate   spending,   or

spending to suit their own political ends - this  is

our concern, too.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have just received an answer from the relevant ministry to which a question was

posed,   concerning  the  formation  of  voluntary

contingents the members of which were given $3 per

day.  That was done without consultation with  the

Ministry  of  Labour. This we consider  is  a  big

matter for Singapore in regard to the unemployment

problem.  The  Government  also  admits  that  the

members   of   the  contingent  comprised   P.A.P.

members,  or at least the great majority  of  them

comprised  P.A.P. members. Here it is obvious  and

apparent  that the whispers circulating among  ths

masses  do  indeed  have  substance.  The  general

opinion  of the masses is that if you are  looking

for  employment you have got to be a member of the

P.A.P.   This   is   an  act  which   I   consider

disappointing and disgusting to the tax payers who

contribute  much  to  the  State.  That  kind   of

attitude   is   basically   wrong,   because   the

Government,   constitutionally   formed,    should

protect  the  interests of  the  population  as  a

whole,  irrespective of whether they are following

the ideologies of the party in power or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to make on this

budget  issue  is this. After the  P.A.P. assumed

office,    the   Prime   Minister   issued    many

announcements, which were the same statements made

during  the  election period, that is to  say,  to

raise  the  standard of living of those  who  were

neglected  and ignored by the previous government.

I  wish  to  remind the House and to stress  here,

that  the position of the past Government differed

from that of the present government which is under

a different constitution altogether. The powers of

the  past  Government  and those  of  the  present

Government under the new constitution also differ.

I am here not to defend the past government. But I

have  stressed  on  many  occasions  that  we  are

heading for a definite objective, that is to  say,

to  shape a nation without discriminating  between

one  community  and another, and I find  that  the

attitude or action



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



taken by the present Government is disgusting. The

Government should realise that the aim of building

our  nation  is  a  big task.  Hence  a  socialist

ideology, I fear, will be a deterrent towards  the

shaping of a common nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, once again I stress that it is up to the P.A.P. Government to make good. Before they

assumed  office, they made promises  to  the  poor

masses,  for  instance, to the fishermen  and  the

farmers,  because they considered that these  were

the  people who were oppressed by the capitalists.

But  what I find in the Budget submitted  is  that

such  matters as affect these particular  sections

of  the  masses are not mentioned. As I have  said

concerning  the fishermen, they are  oppressed  by

middlemen. Therefore, it is indeed necessary  that

their problem should be given prime consideration.

The   Government  should  help  by  giving   these

fishermen assistance in the form of capital  loans

to  enable  them  to  buy new equipment  or  gear.

However,  I am of the opinion that this  will  not

really  solve the crux of their problem. They  can

still  catch fish, but the real problem  they  are

faced with is that after the catch, where are they

going  to  dispose  of their catch?  If  they  are

encouraged  to  form a co-operative society,  they

will  find it difficult to dispose of their catch.

The  prices offered for their catch in the  market

are  very low indeed. The prices offered to people

who  bring  in  the fish vary. For  instance,  Mr

Speaker,  if the fish is brought to the market  by

the  regular persons these people will be  offered

fixed or regular prices. However, if the fishermen

themselves  bring their catch to the  market,  the

prices offered them will be considerably lower  or

half  of  what has been offered to the  middlemen.

Therefore,  I  consider there is no other  way  to

help  the fishermen than by establishing a central

marketing  board, administered by the  Government,

for  the  purpose  of fixing the  prices  of  fish

irrespective  of who brings it in,  and  then  the

catch  can be sold to the retailers. There  is  no

other way I can think of to help the fishermen out

there. I am not saying that the other ways are not

practical,  but  it  is  important  to  help   the

fishermen living



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



in the islands to solve their real problems and to

improve  their living standards. Not much  purpose

can  be  achieved by providing them with community

centres  or clinics alone if we do not  look  into

their economic aspect as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from that, Mr Speaker, concerning the

civil  servants  mentioned in the  speech  by  the

Minister for Finance, originally it was decided to

change  the system. In column 802 of the  Hansard,

he says (I will read it in English):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is intended next year to make a review of the

staffing position to ensure that there is  a  hard

core  of  experienced officers in all Departments,

and   that  opportunities  will  be  provided  for

accelerated  promotion to those local officers  of

merit  and  ability who are prepared  to  give  of

their best."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued in Malay): Mr Speaker, in the last

sentence which reads, "who are prepared to give of

their best" I think that is incomplete. This is  a

matter about which we are uneasy. From that speech

there  are rumours that the civil servants  wonder

how  they  are  to  receive  assurances  from  the

Government, when in point of fact they  are  being

carefully  watched and they are in an embarrassing

position.  We have asked for assurances  from  the

Government that, in the case of civil servants who

are  not  able  to offer themselves for  voluntary

services over the week-ends, nothing will be  done

to  them and that their promotion or other  rights

will  not  be  affected.  We  have  asked  for  an

assurance and the Prime Minister himself has given

us  an  assurance to this effect. What  the  civil

servants are concerned about is that, in spite  of

the assurance, and in order to protect their rice-bowl, they feel that they have no alternative  but

to  offer themselves, not voluntarily, but on  the

pretext  of being voluntary. Although such  people

are  qualified for promotion, it has  been  feared

that  the  Government would give special attention

to  them. Why I said this, Mr Speaker, is because

they  are  constantly plagued with fear  in  their

everyday livelihood, and the Government should  do

everything  possible to allay  the  fears  of  the

civil  servants in the interests of all the people

of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  it  has been six months  since  we  took

office  and  we have arrived at such a Budget.  It

can  be said that we have tried our best to  reach

this  Budget. Although externally this  Budget  is

similar to that of the previous Government, if  we

analyse it carefully, we will see that the content

is  entirely different. Let us compare our  Budget

with the Lim Yew Hock Government's Budget. In  the 1958   Budget,

Government  expenditure  was  $124

million. This was the greatest expenditure in  the

history  of Singapore. On the contrary,  our  next

year's Estimates amount to only $111 million. This

clearly explains the economic expenditure  of  the

Government. Six months ago we stated our  economic

policy.  We  said that we would economise  in  the

matter  of  expenditure. We can  now  see  in  our

Budget for 1960 the amount of our expenditure.  On

the   other   hand,  our  proposed  $105   million

Development  Fund is also the greatest  amount  in

the history of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Cairnhill criticised our

Budget.  We  can excuse others who criticise,  but

not  him,  the Member for Cairnhill.  We  have  to

answer his criticism because he himself was  still

the  Chief Minister six months ago. He was  rather

proud  and  happy to say that his 1958 Budget  had

still several million dollars remained. But if  we

investigate  it carefully - we would know  that  the

Estimates  Expenditure for 1958 was  $267  million

and the Estimates revenue was $271 million - we will

find that they have sold Christmas Island for  $20

million.  Therefore, there could  have  been  some

remainder.  Otherwise we will  find  in  the  1958

Budget  a deficit of $15.5 million. But our Budget

is basically different from the previous one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friends on the opposite side always quote

from some books. I remember that a few months  ago

they  quoted  the Five-Year Plan of  the  People's

Action  Party.  But  now the  Member  for  Tanglin

quoted something from Western Germany. But he  has

forgotten  that Singapore is in the East.  We  are

always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



proud  to  say that the P.A.P. Government  is  the

only  Government that acts on what  it  says.  Our

Budget is worked out from our Five-Year Plan which

the  Opposition considers as their Bible.  Let  us

see the financial policy outlined in the Five-Year

Plan.  If  the  Member for Tanglin will  read  the

Financial  Minister's speech on the common  market

at  page  21  of  the English edition  `The  Tasks

Ahead',  he will see whether that is contradictory

to  the  promises we had made during the  election

campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the development plans between Singapore

and  the  Federation given in the  Budget  speech,

they are in line with the promises we gave in  our

election campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enterprise and capital investment, that has

been very clearly stated in the Budget speech.  We

pay  special attention to the economic development

of  our  country. We are trying our best to  solve

the  problem of the increase of population. We are

not   just   criticising  only.  Apart  from   the

statements made in the Budget speech, we have also

done  certain things. For instance, last month  we

in   the  Finance  Ministry  visited  many   local

factories.  We have paid attention to the  present

conditions. From our visit, we have found out that

the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government had  never  before

visited these factories. How could they know where

the problems lie? Therefore our Budget can be said

to  be a very proper one. It is agreeable with the

promises   which  we  gave  during  our   election

campaign.  It  is  unlike  those  given   by   the

Opposition   Members  who,  during  the   election

campaign, made promises but when they were elected

they forgot what they had said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the announcement of our Budget policy in

the  Press,  we  know, from the  response  of  the

people, that it is agreeable with the interests of

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>6.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  his speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Prime   Minister  said  that  the  prosperity   of

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



has   been   due   to  the  tension   created   by

international circumstances, and he also said that

we  do  not  want  to  be  influenced  by  outside

sources. I am at a loss to understand exactly what

was  in  the  mind of the Parliamentary  Secretary

when  he  said it. Could it be that he meant  that

the   post-war   prosperity,   and   indeed,   the

possibility to be able to stay alive in Singapore,

was  entirely  due  to tension caused  by  warring

nations  outside Singapore? If he  meant  that,  I

would,  with respect, suggest to him that  he  has

entirely   misconceived   the   reason   for   the

prosperity  of  Singapore, and the  reasons  which

have  enabled Singapore to prosper. And if by "but

we  do  not  want  to  be  influenced  by  outside

sources"  he  means that he does not  want  to  be

influenced  by  political  factors  from   outside

sources, I entirely agree with him. But if by that

he  meant  (and as we are on a discussion  of  the

Budget, be must, I think, have meant that) that we

do not want to be influenced by outside sources in

so  far as our economy is concerned, it seems that

in this matter, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Prime  Minister and the Hon. Minister for  Finance

do not seem to see eye to eye. If I had understood

the  Minister's speech, I understood him  to  mean

that  Singapore  being what it is, our  prosperity

and  indeed our economic life is dependent on  our

neighbours, particularly the Federation of Malaya,

and secondly, Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Prime Minister had intended to contradict

the  Minister for Finance on this matter.  Perhaps

he  had  political considerations in mind when  he

said that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another subject touched upon by the Parliamentary

Secretary  was  Christmas Island.  The  point  and

purpose of touching upon Christmas Island is  lost

on  me. What does he suggest should have been done

with  Christmas  Island? Does he suggest  that  it

should  have  been  handed over  by  the  previous

Government to the P.A.P. Government as  a  colony?

In  the  events  that  have  since  happened,  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister  had

better thank his stars that that problem was taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



off his plate, and that his government has got $20

million to boot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary also said that the P.A.P. Government has reduced the expenditure of

Government  on every possible head of  expenditure

it  could  think of. Undoubtedly it has  done.  On

some  of  the larger items of expenditure  in  the

Government  budget,  they  have  done   it   quite

well - quite  effectively - by  unilaterally  reducing

total emoluments of Government servants. They have

done  that very well. On other matters, they  have

increased  expenditure rather than diminished  it.

The  cost  of ministerial government, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  has increased and not decreased. And  by  an

increase in the cost of ministerial government,  I

mean   that   the  salaries  paid  to   Ministers,

Parliamentary   Secretaries  to   Ministers,   and

Political  Secretaries to Ministers have increased

over   those  paid  to  Ministers  and   Assistant

Ministers in the previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis of the budget will indicate that for

the previous government, the cost of Ministers was

$317,000 approximately, whereas the cost under the

present  Government is 515,000  approximately.  So

that   the  cost,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  easily

deducible.  The  increase in cost  of  ministerial

government under the present P.A.P. Government has

gone well over $190,000. It is not a very big  sum

possibly,  but when a government goes out  of  its

way  to  boast that it has cut down on  government

expenditure by reducing the personal emoluments of

civil servants, then this increase in the cost  of

ministerial government does not exactly seem to be

in  keeping  with their avowed policy  of  keeping

down expenditure on personal emoluments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary then said that in a short time, the Minister for Finance was able to

balance  the  somewhat unbalanced  budget  of  the

previous  Government. Whilst not  for  one  moment

detracting from what the Hon. Minister for Finance

did to balance the budget, might I say that it was

not   an  operation  that  presented  very   great

difficulty to a man of the calibre of our Minister

for Finance? All he had to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



was  arbitrarily to impose cuts on the  salary  of

civil  servants and to stop expenditure on special

services.  It was as simple as that, Mr  Speaker,

and yet, we are asked to believe by the supporters

of  the  P.A.P. Government that the  Minister  for

Finance  had  done something quite wonderful,  and

that  he  and only he could have done it;  and  in

trying to persuade us to believe that it was  only

he  who  could have done it, they tell us  what  a

wonderful economist he is. Let me hasten to assure

them  that I am the first to agree with them  that

he is a wonderful economist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Now, the Parliamentary Secretary to

the Minister for Health - he is not here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Look for a bigger one!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He warned the Opposition Members not

to  frighten the people of Singapore with speeches

in  the  Assembly. It is strange that this warning

should  come from a member of the P.A.P.  To  warn

the Opposition Members! - Poor, isolated Members on

this side of the House - that we could frighten  the

people   of  Singapore  with  speeches   in   this

Assembly. If anybody has frightened the people  of

Singapore  with speeches, it is not the Opposition

Members,  but  it  is the members  of  the  P.A.P.

Government who, during their vigorous campaigning,

had frightened the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We won!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must congratulate

the  Hon, the Minister for Finance for presenting

such   a   balanced  budget.  In  the   particular

circumstances  in which the Minister  for  Finance

found  himself when he was called upon to  present

his Budget, I suggest that his Budget was the only

thing  that he could have presented. And  we  must

pay  tribute to his genius for not giving  way  to

the  more difficult elements in his party  in  the

matter of the Budget, and in placing the interests

of the country before any other interest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



Any  other  budget at this particular juncture  in

the economic life of Singapore would have hastened

its decadence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assess the circumstances as they now

prevail in the light of what the P.A.P. Government

have  done  over  the last six  months,  and  even

before,  and what they intend to do in the  future

as revealed in the budget which they have proposed

to  this House. The most important problem that is

now   worrying   the  parents  of   Singapore   is

education.  The  Ministry of  Education  has  such

revolutionary plans for seeking to change the  way

of  life and the way of thought of the children of

Singapore.   They  wish  to  achieve   all   their

objectives in the five years they hope  to  be  in

for. Mr Speaker, Sir, the objective of being able

to  understand  one another in a  common  language

without  the difficulty of having interpreters  by

one's  side  to  translate one's fellow  citizens'

speech  is a laudable objective, and is one  which

must  be achieved in the least possible time.  But

one   must   not  hasten  these  rather  difficult

processes in human development merely because  the

Government wants to attain that objective within a

given  period  of time. No one quarrels  with  the

Government over its education objective,  but  the

quarrel with the Government is in respect  of  the

manner  in  which  it seeks to put  forward  these

experiments in education, hoping to achieve  their

objective  within their term of office. The  first

thing  the Government did when it came into  power

was  to declare that it would have a six-day week.

Perhaps  it is a good thing. I do not know.  I  am

not  an  educational expert, Sir. But we  seem  to

have  survived  over the years with  the  five-day

week.  We  have produced a Prime Minister  of  the

calibre of our present one, and we have produced a

Finance  Minister of the calibre  of  our  present

Minister for Finance, and I believe they  grew  to

this intellectual stature on the five-day week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not leisure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And yet our Education Minister would

have us believe that, to build a better nation and

to produce a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



better  lot of Prime Ministers, Finance  Ministers

(who  can  say that we could get better ones  than what  we have today, even with a six-day week)  it

is necessary to impose the six-day week?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What about the language

situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most important

thing  to  Singapore is for us all to  think  like

Malayans  and  act like Malayans.  I  believe  the

Prime  Minister in one of his speeches said  that,

when  he  was  in the United Kingdom  for  further

studies  (I  believe  it was  post-war)  and  that

whenever  he  met  a  Chinese  from  Singapore  in

London,  he could see the difference between  that

Chinese and other Chinese from China. Might I  say

to the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when

I  was  in  England pre-war - that was in the  year

1929-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hyde Park!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I also experienced the same feelings

that  the  Prime Minister himself did  experience.

That  when we from Malaya - be he a Malay,  Chinese,

Indian,  Ceylonese or anybody else  who  had  been

born  and bred here - met in London we were able  to

understand  each other readily; but  when  we  met

Chinese  from  China  or  Indians  from  India  or

Ceylonese from Ceylon, we found that we could  not

take to them. In fact, we found them alien to  us.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the tendency  was  always  for

Malayans  to  stick  together  with  Malayans   in

London.  What  does that indicate? Does  that  not

indicate,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  way  of

thought,  the way of life, the way of approach  to

problems  were  similar  and  that  we  could  all

understand  one another irrespective  of  race  or

pigmentation? Might I suggest, with respect to the

Minister  for  Education, that the most  important

thing  for us in Singapore is to develop a Malayan

outlook?  And  to develop a Malayan outlook,  what

better  way  is  there than  of  putting  all  our

children in one school irrespective of race rather

than   do   what   is   now  becoming   known   as

"segregation"  in  schools? I know  the  Education

Minister  has  vehemently denied  it.  I  am  very

appreciative of that fact. But the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore  are still worried about  what  they

call segregation of the races. If the objective is

for all of us to be bilingual or trilingual within

five  years' time, that in itself is an  objective

worthy of attainment, Mr Speaker. But I put it to

the  Education Minister that even more  worthy  of

attainment  is  a Malayan outlook.  Anything  that

will  detract  from  the  creation  of  a  Malayan

outlook  is something which the Government  should

discourage.  And  I  am telling  the  Ministry  of

Education  that  this  so-called  taking  away  of

Indian  boys  and Malay boys and putting  them  in

certain   schools,  merely  because  the  teaching

situation  is difficult and it might  add  to  the

costs  of Government, is, in my opinion, a  policy

which  will not pay this country in the long  run.

If  it is going to cost the Government more,  well

then  let it cost the Government more because  the

main objective should be to build a common Malayan

outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heading Education on page 152 of the

Singapore  Annual Report for 1958 certain  figures

are  given  which  show that  so  far  as  English

schools are concerned, there were 99,000 pupils in

Government schools and 33,482 pupils in Government-aided  schools,  making a total of  about  120,000

pupils  in  all Government schools. In  a  further

section  on  page 145, there is a statement  which

says  that  in 1958, there were 14,719  candidates

for    the    entrance   examination   of    which

approximately  750 were from Malay  schools.  From

that, it appears to me, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

percentage of pupils in secondary schools is about

10  to 11 per cent of the total student population

in   Government   and   Government-aided   English

schools. So that 90 per cent of our children,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, go to primary schools and the  other

10 per cent find themselves in secondary schools.

May  I  put  a  proposition  to  the  Ministry  of

Education for consideration? I understand that the

introduction of the six-day week, Mr Speaker, has

not added very much to the actual amount of school

hours  in  school  so far as primary  schools  are

concerned. It is negligible. The five-day week and

the six-day week provide the same number of school

hours for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



the  primary  schools. Would not the  Ministry  of

Education consider introducing only a six-day week

for  secondary schools and stop the  six-day  week

for  the  primary  schools? This would  release  a

number  of teachers, and Saturdays would  be  free

for  the  primary schools, and could not Saturdays

be  utilised  for the purpose of language  tuition

for  the  primary schools? I understand  that  the

difficulty confronting the Ministry is the lack of

teachers  in  Malay,  and  in  Tamil  and  Chinese

possibly.  Now, instead of taking the children  to

the  teachers, could not the teachers be taken  to

the  children? Could not the teachers be  provided

with  some form of transport to go from school  to

school and there teach Tamil or Malay as the  case

may be, rather than to dragoon all Malay and Tamil

school  children into some schools merely  to  cut

down  the  cost in education? These are  thoughts,

Mr Speaker, which have passed through my mind and

which  I  place before the Hon, the  Minister  for

Education for his consideration.



<br><br>6.39 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item that concerns the people of

Singapore   is   the  question  of  housing.   The

Development Estimates provide a sum of $25 million

for  the Ministry of National Development for  the

erection of houses. We have not heard what exactly

the  plans  are and how the Minister for  National

Development  hopes  to utilise  this  $25  million

during  the space of 12 short months. We had  also

been  promised a lot of houses for the year  1959.

So far as I can make out, not one housing unit has

been   completed  by  the  Trust.   The   question

therefore pertinently arises, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

will  the Ministry of National Development be able

fully  to utilise this $25 million which has  been

allocated  to  that Ministry, or is  it  merely  a

paper   vote   which,  owing  to  the   conditions

prevailing in the Singapore Improvement Trust, the

Minister  for Finance knows that the Trust  cannot

fulfil?  I  understand there are no architects  in

the Trust, or such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



architects  as there are have so little experience

in  building, that they do not know which  way  to

site buildings - east, west, left or centre. If that

is  the  position  in  the  Singapore  Improvement

Trust,  can  they  utilise  the  $25  million?  We

understand that one housing unit is going to  cost

$4,000.  That means the Ministry will  erect  well

over  6,000 housing units during 1960.  I  do  not

know  what  plans have been laid now, whether  the

sites have been earmarked, whether contracts  have

been let out, whether plans have been put on paper

and  contracts have been signed. If none of  these

has   been  done,  I  am  suggesting,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, that building operations cannot start  on

the  site for another four to five months and that

the Minister for Finance will, at the end of 1960,

find himself with, instead of a deficit budget,  a

surplus  budget. And this will not be through  any

stroke of genius on his part, not this time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other factor - if you want to build

houses,  not  only  must you have  architects  and

engineers, but you must also have a building trade

fit,  ready and willing to receive the grand plans

of  the  Minister  for Housing. I  understand  the

building trade in Singapore is in the doldrums and

the  builders are slowly but surely trekking their

way up to the Federation where there is a building

boom. And if the Minister for National Development

does not hurry on with his plans, he will not have

the builders or the workers to construct them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Government can hope to provide a sufficiency

of  houses for everyone in Singapore, and for that

reason  it  is  vital  that  Government  encourage

building also on the private sector. What has  the

P.A.P.  Government done to encourage  this?  Since

December 1957, the Mayor of the City Council - he is

now   with   us  as  the  Minister  for   National

Development - did everything possible  not  only  to

discourage but to kill private enterprise  in  the

private  sector of building. The Mayor was  unable

to appreciate that revenue from assessments is the

backbone  of  municipal finance, and that  if  you

kill the building trade and private building,  you

destroy municipal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



finance. If there is one thing in respect of which

the   Mayor  will  go  down  in  the  history   of

Singapore,  he will certainly go down as  the  one

who most effectively destroyed the main sinews  of

municipal finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like

to  touch  on  is  the  professional  services  in

Government.  The Finance Minister  in  his  speech

said that he was offering allowances staggered  in

three  categories - $100, $200 and  $300.  $100  for

professional and technical people with under seven

years'  experience;  $200  for  professional   and

technical  people of over seven years' experience;

and  $300  for those who give the Government  true

and  faithful service. Whether this only  includes

(this  faithful category, I mean) the  technicians

and  professional men, the Minister did  not  make

quite  clear. Or whether he wanted to take  within

his  embrace  the  whole of the Civil  Service  by

offering the $300 bounty to all the civil servants

who  are  good,  true, loyal and work  hard,  even

perhaps on Sundays, that was not made quite clear.

Perhaps  the  Minister might clarify  that  point.

Now, I wonder what the Minister for Labour and Law

has  to  say on a matter like that. What reactions

will  a  genuine trade union movement have to  the

offer by an employer to his employees who work  so

hard  that the employer of his own free will gives

$300  each?  I  have always understood  from  good

trade  unionists that this is one of the  ways  in

which  employers seek to split trade unionists.  I

am sure the Minister for Finance-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is an incentive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> These are incentives. Mr Deputy

Speaker,  I  am  grateful  to  the  Minister   for

Finance - these  are incentives to break  wide  open

the trade union movement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No. It is to encourage good unionists!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do you remember in the bad old days

when  posts  carried "Allowances, Special  to  the

Holder" - that. I believe, was the technical term in

the bad old days. The unions fought against it. Oh

yes, they fought tooth and nail.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



They  said,  "The post must be paid  according  to

what  it is worth." "Special to the Holder" merely

means  the blue-eyed boy gets everything  and  the

rest  get nothing. Does the Finance Minister  want

to do a thing like that? I am sure he does not.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We will cut out the $300.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On the question of income tax. I am

somewhat  disappointed with the cursory  statement

of  the  Minister for Finance that there  was  tax

evasion  and that he was going to tighten  up  the

tax  machinery in order that it might  effectively

collect more. I think it is public knowledge,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, that there has been tax evasion on

a  mass  scale in Singapore, if I may put it  that

way,  with  the result that a lot of  people,  who

should  be  paying  taxes and thus  pulling  their

financial  weight  behind  the  State,  have  been

evading it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Hansard

of  13th  December,  1957. This  is  the  official

report on the 1958 Budget; col. 2921. Mr Lee Kuan

Yew,  who  was then the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are just indicating, Mr Speaker, Sir, as a

matter  of general government policy that  if  and

when the P.A.P. runs this government, we shall see

that the Income Tax Department does its duty.  The

way  to  do  it  is  the way it  is  done  in  all

civilized  countries.  If  you  think   that   Mr

Goldsmith  has  not  been  paying  his  tax,  then

judging from the number of cars and the number  of

diamond solitaires his wife exhibits, you just put

in  an estimate of what you think he ought to  pay

and  let him disprove it. If he pays it, next year

double the estimate; then let him disprove it.  If

he pays again, quadruple it, and so we go on until

we  make everybody in the community pay their fair

share   of  taxation  or  become  barrow-boys   or

hawkers, in which case they do not have to pay any

taxes  at  all. It might well be, as a  result  of

just  rounding off this computation, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  at 12,300 employers, as I said, on the  mean

average of $50,000 chargeable profits, that  ought

to   bring   $8,630  per  employer,  which   means

$106,149,000 per year just from employers alone. I

could develop this argument, and I will, all about

this  property tax both in the city area  and  the

Rural  Board. But a conservative estimate of  what

could  be  collected on present rates is somewhere

in  the region of $128 million per year; in  other

words,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



double  what  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary

estimates  for  next  year.  The  tragedy  of  the

situation  is  this, that although  this  is  what

should be the case, whatever Government comes into

power  next year it will be saddled with the  same

apparatus with which to extract the tax. Unless we

have a ruthless Minister for Finance who will deal

with  inept  and bureaucratic civil  servants  and

will  improve  the  running of  the  machinery  of

state, we will be back in the same position."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know what "the

same position" means, but if the collection of the

same  amount of tax must necessarily indicate  the

same  position, then we are in "the same position"

today  as  when the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  who

happily  is now the Prime Minister, addressed  the

Assembly  on the 1958 Budget. So that if  one  can

place  any weight on the speech of the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar - and I am not the one to say that  no

one  should not - then I think the position is  that

even  today, with drastic measures, the  provision

of  $65 million by way of income tax for the  year

1960  is certainly inadequate and very much  below

the  paying capacity of the tax-paying  public  in

Singapore. Whether we have a ruthless Minister for

Finance,  I do not know, but he certainly  is  not

lacking in courage - that we know. Therefore, he  is

the  man  for  the job and we hope that  when  the

final  accounts  for the year  1960  are  written,

instead  of  an amount of $65 million  by  way  of

income tax we shall have $120 million collected in

the  way  of income tax, which will mean then,  of

course,  instead of a $6 million deficit we  shall

have  a  surplus  budget of $60 million;  and  the

P.A.P.  Government will have found all the  monies

they  want  for all the development projects  over

the next four years or so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, turning to the Medical Services. I remember

the Minister for Health, whilst making a statement

to   the   Press - I  wonder  if  it  was  correctly

reported, but this is what I read - that so  far  as

the  doctors  were concerned, he was not  worried,

they  could  go.  But  he was  worried  about  his

nurses! He was wondering whether his nurses  would

stay with him, but if the doctors were to go,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



"let them go; so long as I have my nurses." Within

six  months  of that report "we expanded  so  much

that  we  are  now  going  abroad  to  recruit  60

doctors." That seems to be an appropriate  comment

on  the  Minister's references to the Press  about

his  Medical Services. Quite frankly,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  we are not running a government  service

composed  of morons or donkeys. We are  running  a

government  service composed of human beings,  and

if you treat them like human beings they will give

you  good,  true, honest, efficient  service  like

human  beings. What the doctors are worried  about

is  not so much that they are being called upon to

do the work that two doctors should be doing. Most

of  them  are doing it now, and most of  them  are

doing it willingly. But what they object to is the

manner  in  which they are being pushed around  by

the   Ministry   and   its   officials,   and   no

appreciation is given them for the amount of  hard

work,  long hours, and no holidays which they  are

now  doing. If the Government could only treat its

servants  as  human  beings, they  will  get  much

better results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the development programme

envisaged  by this Government, as set out  in  the

Budget,  a  close  inspection of  it,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  seems  to indicate - to me  at  least - that

very  little  is  going to be done.  Most  of  the

development  projects  are  subject  to  financial

control  and by that I understand it to mean  that

no  plans have yet been formulated, and when  they

are  formulated, it will be subject  to  the  most

agonising  scrutiny by the Minister  for  Finance;

and by the time the Estimates have got through the

agonising  scrutiny of the Minister  for  Finance,

the year might be over. So we end up in this happy

position - that if the Minister for Finance, who  it

is  suggested should be ruthless in his income tax

collections, does in fact get ruthless and rake in

another   $60   million  and  if  the  development

projects  have not been advanced further over  the

next  six  months  than they are  today,  the  $60

million estimated to be spent on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



development  projects will not be  spent,  and  we

shall end up our final accounts for the year  1960

with a $150 million surplus.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, may I

start   by  quoting  a  very  well-known   Chinese

proverb,  which  is  Tsuo  ma  k'an  hua,  meaning

"Riding  on  horses and looking at  flowers"?  The

Budget  is an extremely complicated piece of  work

on  which  several  minds  have  been  turned  for

several months. For the Opposition to stand up and

in a few minutes blast it to smithereens, shows  I

think  a  tendency to be superficial and  just  to

denigrate whatever effort the Government is trying

to  make with the limited financial means  at  its

disposal.  It  is fortunate that the  P.A.P. came

into  power  at  the end of May last,  because  we

found  very soon that there was going to be a  $14

million deficit for 1959. Quite rightly, when  you

are  faced with empty coffers, the important thing

to do is to tighten your belts - pay cuts have to be

imposed  and all of us shared in them. It  is  not

because we did not wish to consult anybody or that

we  were  arbitrary in our action, but a firm  and

quick decision had to be made before the situation

deteriorated. And I would say that the industry at

large appreciates this action - that we are honestly

trying to balance our budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also discovered that the reserves had fallen

from  $320  million to $87 million  in  the  short

space  of  five  years. What did  the  old  S.P.A.

Government  do  to stop the running  down  of  the

reserves?  They  sold  Christmas  Island   for   a

song - $20 million to be exact. In 1957 the  revenue

expected  from Christmas Island was $1.2  million.

They  have  a further lease for 32 years  and,  on

that  estimate, would have earned us an  estimated

$38.4 million. Instead, the old government sold it

for $20 million - half that price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park brought an attack on

the   Parliamentary   Secretary   to   the   Prime

Minister - that  he has no argument for  talking  on

Christmas Island - and suggested that we would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



want to colonise Christmas Island. But may I quote

here what has been said by the last Government  on

Christmas Island:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No useful purpose would be served by a Minister

visiting,  apart  from  the  practical  difficulty

getting there."



<br><br>that is Christmas Island:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and back. The Island clearly cannot be

part of a self-governing Singapore and it would be

wrong  to let the inhabitants think that they  are

in a position to reopen H.M.G.'s decision."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who are the inhabitants, Mr Deputy Speaker?

The inhabitants are 1,810 Chinese, 489 Malaysians, 9 Indians, 136 Europeans, making a total of 2,444. That was the census, Mr Deputy Speaker, in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, when the P.A.P. Government found that financially we were faced with a

critical situation, we did the right thing. It was

lucky  that  we came in time, otherwise  we  would

have  found that the S.P.A. Government would  have

sold Singapore to somebody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I reply to the Member for Mountbatten who

has  shown  her  interest in aeroplanes?  She  has

asked  us  for  the  Government  policy  on  the

Airport.  Here  I  would like to  state  that  the

present potential capacity of our single runway is

far greater than the existing traffic. The Airport

is  estimated to lose $2.8 million in 1960, and it

has  been regularly losing about $2 million  every

year.  Let  us  remember,  before  we  talk  about

extending  the  runway, that there are  altogether

four  aerodromes in a little island of 220  square

miles - three  military airports at Changi,  Seletar

and  Tengah, and one civil airport. Extending  an

airport  would  mean  displacing  people  who  are

living in that area. Extending your airport is not

in any way going to increase your revenue. What is

important   is  that  more  aircraft   should   be

permitted   to  use  the  Airport.  More   airline

operators  should be allowed to use  the  Airport.

Only  in this way can we increase our landing fees

and, therefore, help to cover the expenses paid to

the Airport.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the Government is not in a position

to  control  any air traffic rights in  Singapore.

That  is because, from my understanding of letters

exchanged,  the  old Government  had  agreed  that

civil  aviation comes under foreign  affairs,  and

that  being  so, it is in the hands of the  United

Kingdom.  That  is all I wish to say,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker.



<br><br>7.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, first of all, I want to reply  to

the  two respectable Opposition Member - the Member

for Cairnhill and the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said that the Ministry of National

Development had during the past few months  sacked

many  engineers. Mr Speaker, many engineers  have

resigned. We can tell them directly that under the

P.A.P.  Government, and also when we were  in  the

City  Council,  we  want an efficient  Government.

When  we were in the City Council and when we  saw

them  working  in our departments,  the  engineers

were  irresponsible  and  did  not  work  for  the

people.  At  the  time when we were  in  the  City

Council,  we carried out a revolutionary  project,

and  that is how to make those engineers work well

and  effectively  and  with  responsibility.  But,

unfortunately, our project was frustrated  by  the

Opposition. Today the

P.A.P. Government is supported and elected by  the

people.  I  can tell you why during the  past  six

months  many  engineers  have  resigned  from  the

Ministry  of National Development. There are  many

engineers who had not been sacked. They  had  gone

to  foreign countries by air and they had  sent  a

letter saying that they were going to resign. They

had  their  motives. Now we can tell you  why  the

engineers  in the Ministry of National Development

had   resigned.  We  have  recruited  many   local

engineers,  because  we have  full  confidence  in

local  engineers.  They  are  able  to  work  with

responsibility.  Today  with  the  P.A.P. in  the

Ministry   of   National  Development,   we   have

completed  a  lot  of  work during  the  past  six

months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding our 1960 Budget, the Member for

Mountbatten has said that the Ministry of National

Development did not build any houses.  There  were

no  projects like those in Kuala Lumpur. She  must

realise  that the reason why there is  development

in Kuala Lumpur is because they are going to build

a  capital. They must build a capital city  there.

In  Singapore at present we must take care of  the

interest   of  the  people - the  people's   housing

problem. The Member for Farrer Park said  that  he

does not know what we can do within a period of 12

months. But strangely enough we have taken  office

for  only  six  months,  and  not  twelve  months.

Whether it is six months or twelve months our work

will   be   completed.  That  we  will  tell   the

Opposition Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much improvement in the reorganisation of the

Ministry  of National Development and  S.I.T. has

been  made  during the past six  months.  The  old

S.I.T. complaints  of  corruption  against   the

allocation of flats, the passing of plans and  the

construction of S.I.T. houses plus the transfer of

T.O.L.s  or State reverted properties are  now  no

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 1,800 houses of more than 99 years

lease belonging to the Government. They have  been

a source of much corruption. Work has been started

to  reorganise  these  2,000 units  of  Government

State reverted houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the Rent Conciliation Board is

being  reconstituted to represent  more  equitably

the  interests of the poor tenants.  The  previous

Board  was  mostly  composed  of  members  of  the

Landlord class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office is undergoing a thorough

reorganisation and a study is now being made of  a

revision  of our land policies so that the  little

land  available to us in Singapore would  be  made

use of to the maximum advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the S.I.T. was reorganised we started

on  building  for  the two fire sites  namely  the

Kampong  Tiong Bahru and Kampong Koo  Chye  sites.

Work  would  be completed very soon and  with  the

finance  available to the S.I.T. in  1959  we  are

embarking on the use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



all  available funds we have to build  up  another

2,000  units  of flats in the Kampong Tiong  Bahru

fire  site. This will be the first time  that  the

S.I.T. is building really low cost housing and the

rent  of these flats would be within the means  of

the  lower income groups. Next year, when the  $25

million is made available to the Housing Authority

we  hope  that with the checks in corruption,  the

drafting  of  plans on a rational  basis  and  the

useful  employment of local architects instead  of

expatriate  architects we can  build  about  8,000

units  of  flats. $25 million if used by  the  old

S.I.T. would only build 4,000 units of flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruption in the passing of plans was well known

and  since  the  S.I.T. was reorganised  all  such

allegations have stopped. The passing of plans  is

most  susceptible to temptations of corruption  by

unscrupulous  people  who  can  make  millions  of

dollars from the passing of plans each year.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, today is the first

day  in  the history of Singapore when a programme

concerning  the  economic  policy  framed   by   a

people's government is being discussed. In opening

the  debate, the Member for Cairnhill  said  that,

after   hearing   and  reading  the   Government's

financial  policy for 1960, there was nothing  for

the  present Government to crow about.  Admittedly

the  P.A.P. Government does not make it its policy

to  crow,  because we do not wish to be  the  cock

that  crows.  It  is the hen that lays  the  eggs.

Indirectly  the Member said that, from the  speech

made  by the Minister for Finance, it was apparent

that  there was a split in the Party hierarchy.  I

think this is irrelevant and, in point of fact, it

is  only  people  who suffer from  nightmares  and

people  who  are faced with a split in  their  own

party who are themselves full of wishful thinking.

Foreign capital, he said, has no confidence in the

present  Government.  This is  most  unreasonable,

because  Singapore  has  now  become  one  of  the

biggest and busiest harbours in the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Members from the Opposition made a hue

and  cry  about  the  reduction  of  the  variable

allowances  and  they have accused  Government  of

being  dictatorial and that no opportunity and  no

mercy were shown to the civil servants. This is  a

wild  accusation which was made  in  a  moment  of

emotion and sentiment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan in his speech

touched   on   the  preamble  contained   in   the

Constitution of Singapore. I think I am quite sure

the  Member had in mind the special privileges for

the   Malays  as  the  indigenous  people  of  the

country.  He also touched on the appointments  for

1960  about which no specific mention was made  by

the  Minister  for Finance. He also mentioned  the

Economic  Development  Board.  Again  the   Member

warned  that if in this matter the Government  has

no  specific policy, then U.M.N.O. will  determine

the shape of the government in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election, there were people who were

prepared  to tear down manifestos in the  presence

of   huge   crowds.  Actually,  as  the   people's

government, we are fully conscious of the fate  of

the neglected and the downtrodden in this country.

It  is  our  responsibility to  help  raise  their

standard  of  living,  whether  they  are  Malays,

Chinese  or Indians. Today, we had the opportunity

to  receive a course on economics from a Member of

the  Opposition who produced various booklets  and

made  the  accusation that the  P.A.P.  Government

worked  subject to capitalist interest and to  the

party interest - that is to say, that at one time it

is  for  the  left and at another it  is  for  the

right. It is fortunate the Member did not say that

the    P.A.P.   Government   worked   for    three

interests - party interest, capitalist interest  and

also   self-interest.  If  the  P.A.P.  Government

support the demands of the people and, at the same

time,  respect  the interests of the  capitalists,

this  is  because we should know the situation  in

which  Singapore is placed. It is lacking  in  raw

materials  and  dependent mainly on its  entrep�t.

But  what we oppose are the capitalist groups  who

oppress  the downtrodden. We do not wish to  adopt

the attitude of taking away one man's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



credit  and  depriving him of it. The  Member  for

Tanglin also said that social democracy, which  is

being   carried  out  by  the  P.A.P.  Government,

differs   from  that  in  England.  Yes,   it   is

different. Because the circumstances between those

obtaining  in  England and those in Singapore  are

different. He also suggested that we should follow

the  examples  of the economic policy  pursued  by

Western  Germany.  I do not know  which  socialist

ideology  he follows, whether it is that  of  West

Germany  or  of  England. I think putting  forward

theories is an easy matter.



<br><br>7.22 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You buy at one cent, sell at three cents and you

can  make  a profit of two cents. But the position

of  the buying public must be considered. Just  by

putting forward theories I think if the Member for

Tanglin  becomes  the Minister  for  Finance,  the

economic position will change every other day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Southern Islands, I would like

to  stress  that it is the responsibility  of  the

Opposition  to  criticise. As for  his  accusation

that the P.A.P. Government has claimed that it  is

the  only sincere party, we have not made  such  a

claim. But we have said that we are the only party

which can carry out its pledges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worry and the fear that money is being spent

wastefully  is unfounded. We will not  betray  the

trust  of  the people. As an example, mention  was

made  of  the  Minister  for National  Development

recruiting workers without consulting the Ministry

of  Labour and Law. I think what is being done  is

better  than  what had been done by  the  previous

Government.  Against the P.A.P. Government,  there

was   also   the  accusation  that  if   you   are

unemployed, in order to get a job you have to be a

member  of the P.A.P. This is not true.  If  there

are  P.A.P. members in the squad, what of it?  The

Minister  for  National Development  has  admitted

openly that there are P.A.P. members in the squad.

It  is not true to say that as it is the Party  in

power, all the top posts are being held by P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



members.  It  is  not  fair  for  the  Member  for

Southern Islands to make wild charges. If he wants

to  know what the Opposition is doing, he must ask

his Opposition friends. Concerning the promise  to

raise  the  standard of living of those  who  were

neglected by the past government, it is true  that

the Government is giving serious consideration  to

this matter. They do not make promises every other

day, but once we make a promise, we will see to it

that it is carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to promotion, which is a matter of

concern  to  the  Member for Southern  Islands,  I

think the civil servants should realise that  they

need  not  have any doubt in their minds that  the

P.A.P.  Government is constantly paying  attention

to  the safety and interest of the civil servants.

And we hope that they will not work only when they

are  asked to. Mr Speaker, I think all the  other

charges  will be answered by my colleagues.  If  I

were to reply to them one by one, it will take  me

two hours or so.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, I find it rather difficult to  reply

to the Opposition Members when they are not in the

House to listen to what I have to say. Yet time is

catching on, and one could not possibly allow wild

statements  to  go unanswered. I  shall  therefore

have  to  speak my piece and allow the  Opposition

Members to read it in Hansard, or perhaps the hon.

Member  for  Tanglin would kindly  pass  the  word

round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, replying to the Member for Cairnhill,

former  Chief  Minister  and  last  Minister   for

Education  of  the  now dead  Government.  He  has

raised the point that this Government should  very

quickly publish the Report of Dr Gwee Ah Leng. He

was   the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  that  was

appointed  to  review  the  Prescott  Commission's

Report  on  Nanyang University. It  is,  I  think,

important    to   mention   that   the    Prescott

Commission's  Report  was  handed  to   the   last

Minister  for Education who is now the Member  for

Cairnhill on the 12th of March, 1959. He  did  not

have the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



courage to publish the Report, but allowed  it  to

hang  fire  for  2� months, till his  Government

lost  miserably  at the last elections.  And  this

Government,   under  two  months,  published   the

Prescott  Commission's Report and also decided  to

appoint  a Review Committee headed by Dr Gwee  Ah

Leng  to  go into that Report. Dr Gwee Ah  Leng's

Report  was  handed to me on 20th of November - just

three   weeks  ago.  The  Report  is   now   under

consideration  by  the  Government  and  will   be

published after due consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware of the anxiety of the people over

Nanyang University and the graduates who are  soon

to  be  produced. The Prime Minister  himself  has

already  announced  the fact  that  the  Education

Ministry  will  be employing at least  50  of  the

graduates  from Nanyang University  for  the  next

year  subject  to selection by the Public  Service

Commission. While on this subject, it is pertinent

to  ask  what  has  happened to the  so-called  $5

million  that was promised by the last Government.

It was stated publicly and it was published in the

Press,  under  the name of Mr Tan Lark  Sye  some

weeks  ago,  that  the  last  Deputy  Speaker  had

suggested  this  $5 million grant  which  had  the

support of the former Chief Minister, Mr Lim  Yew

Hock, and his colleagues. Since there had been  no

public  denial, we can only say that wild promises

had  been made by responsible members of the  last

Government  and  they  have run  away  from  those

promises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if it had been a case of breach of promise I think it would have gone to court and

serious penalties would have been imposed. So  you

can see for yourselves the type of politicians who

made wild promises and who ran away from them when

the  time  of  reckoning came. Even at  this  very

moment,  they  are not present  to  listen  to  my

reply.  There  is talk of development  of  schools

which  the former Minister for Education was proud

to talk about. Yes, we see wasteful expenditure of

Government money in that there are parquet  floors

in science laboratories; parquet floors for school

halls. I suppose the former Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



Education  and now Member for Cairnhill  is  very

interested in dancing so that all these facilities

are available. We are not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must go on now to answer the Member for Farrer

Park,  when he said that we are attempting  to  do

too  much  in  too short a time. Mr Speaker,  the

problems   facing  this  country,  especially   in

respect  of trying to bring about unity out  of  a

diversity  of four educational streams which  have

developed  in four different ways, and  trying  to

integrate them into one to form the basis  of  the

future nation of Singapore, do not permit of  lazy

or usual methods of solution. We must have courage

if  we want to build a nation. We must be prepared

to  experiment. If we fear to experiment, we might

as well turn the clock back and choose to be under

colonial government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park brings up the subject

of  the six-day week. Little does he realise  that

one-half of education in Singapore comes under the

Chinese stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Member for Farrer Park is back,

because  I  am answering his queries. One-half  of

the educational system in Singapore is the Chinese

stream. Because of his fears of a six-day week, he

seems  to  be oblivious of the fact that there  is

such  a  thing  as  a Chinese stream  existing  in

Singapore.  Does  he  realise  that  in  both  the

elementary  and secondary schools in  the  Chinese

stream, a six-day week is common and normal?  They

have had it, but of course it was not quite a full

six-day  week. They used to stop their classes  at

11  on Saturday mornings. Only the English schools

which  were accustomed to a five-day week regarded

the six-day week as an extra day of hard labour!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then talked about a Malayan outlook.

Surely  that  is  the  last thing  that  he  could

possibly   level   against  the  People's   Action

Party - that  we  do  not know  what  is  a  Malayan

outlook, and how we are to proceed about  it.  His

suggestion, which was for a five-day week, but  to

allow  the  sixth  day to be taken  up  with  pure

language teaching, is very simple to put forward.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



But  surely it is not beyond his comprehension  to

realise that you do not learn languages one day in

a  week.  Language is taught day in and  day  out,

hour  after hour, before it gets right  into  your

system.   Only  then  can  language  be  part   of

yourself!  It is necessary, therefore, that  there

should  be  adequate language teaching  facilities

during  the  course of the week and  for  so  many

periods a day. We hope to put in at least 44 hours

per  week for language teaching. But he rears  the

ugly  head of segregation. We have already stated,

Mr  Speaker,  that this is optional.  It  is  not

compulsory. Parents have a right to refuse; and if

they do, their children stay where they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important tenets of a democratic

society  is  to  ensure that  the  rights  of  the

minority are respected. Which is exactly what this

Government is trying to do in Singapore, which has

largely a Chinese population. It is important that

we  must  give in a little to the Malay and  Tamil

sections of the public who form the minority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand in the English schools, I should

like now to inform the Member for Farrer Park what

present  conditions are like for  the  purpose  of

teaching  Malay and Tamil in English schools.  The

numbers  are too small to form a class because  we

have perhaps five, or three, or one Malay pupil or

Tamil  in  a  class. Almost every  class  in  most

schools  is perhaps 90 per cent Chinese. When  the

Chinese  have their Chinese classes in an  English

school, what happens? The Malays and Tamils  could

have  their classes if they can get the  teachers.

But  they will have to have their classes in make-shift classrooms, verandahs, tiffin sheds, bicycle

parks, even in the open, and sometimes next to the

school lavatories. If you call that segregation, I

throw  my  hands.  Here is a case  of  wanting  to

provide  the  minority with as good facilities  as

the majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Mr Speaker, that perhaps there will be

more  time  for  me  during  the  period  in   the

Committee  of  Supply to answer  other  questions,

since time is the limiting factor tonight.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  had  the tables  been  turned,  we

would,  I think, have given the Opposition a  much

more rousing time than they have given us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to take seriously opponents

who  cannot stand up to your punches. One  gets  a

feeling  of  being cruel to people who,  when  you

knock  them down once, stay down for an indefinite

length of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pay cuts, the pay cuts, the pay cuts! Round

and  round  the mulberry bush! There  was  nothing

other than the pay cuts. Then there was the Member

for Cairnhill's favourite technique of fishing  in

troubled  waters.  I  have  told  him  on  several

occasions  in  the past that the least  profitable

thing  is to try and exploit differences  real  or

supposed  in the P.A.P. We are a democratic  Party

with  a  tremendous amount of guts and  gusto.  We

have  our  differences of opinion, and  we  settle

them  in the Party. And believe me, those  who  go

fishing  in troubled waters will find that  it  is

not  a tadpole which will take the bait, but a big

whale that will take the fisherman into the water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Sunday School teacher who ventured into

the  fields of economics and high finance - I do not

know  whether  we ought to take him seriously,  or

whether  we  should sit down and laugh  our  heads

off.  The  bits  of  ill-digested,  ill-understood

economic  titbits do not make up for  an  economic

philosophy,  and that is what is in this  document

produced  by  the  P.A.P. Government  through  its

Minister   for  Finance.  There  is  a   political

philosophy  underlying  an  economic  treatise.  I

thought  today, if they had some people who  could

help  them  do their thinking - as was suggested  by

the  Member  for Tanglin that he had some  friends

whom  he  had  consulted on  these  high  economic

matters - that they would have propounded a counter-economic  theory. All we had was a lot  of  rather

sour and not very clever witticisms. That was what

the  Opposition choose to believe  is  a  throttle

attack on the P.A.P. Budget.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not in this House when I was being quoted

from   Hansard,  and  I  therefore   reserve   the

opportunity to deal with the quotation later.  But

I  would  remind the Member for Farrer  Park  that

when  the P.A.P. says something, there is  usually

sufficient circumspection to provide for all kinds

of  contingencies. The art of political leadership

lies  not  in  making reckless, irresponsible  and

sweeping  generalisations. It lies in the  art  of

prophecy with sufficient of the enigma of  oracles

to  meet all eventualities. Indeed, Sir, for  that

reason,  I  think  he  must  have  been  the  most

surprised person to find himself here because I do

not think he expected it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, may I meet the only point made by the Member

for   Farrer   Park   that  is   worthy   of   any

consideration, this pet theme of his - that the cost

of   ministerial  government  has  gone  up   from

$300,000  to $500,000? In the course of  the  five

days  in Committee of Supply, I shall take him  to

task  on this. First of all, on the basis  of  the

computation; secondly, on this point - is he  really

suggesting that it would have been good government

had  he and his friends (in those halcyon days  in

1955  when  they  had  ambitions  of  winning  the

election  under the Rendel Constitution)  won  and

formed  the Government? This is a Government  that

is  prepared to put its cards on the table - that is

the first function of the Government in this Asian

situation.  A  government that shilly-shallies  is

one  that perishes. We take our views out into the

open,  thrash  them  out, and  establish  what  we

consider  to be right. That is the secret  of  the

strength  of  the P.A.P. Those who seek  political

longevity  should do well to dwell on  this:  that

the  art  of  long, political life is the  art  of

being  honest  and  being  prepared  to  meet  all

corners on the level, in the open. That we  intend

to do for the next five days.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is there nobody else who wishes to

speak? Dr Goh, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  human  beings,  when  they   find

themselves in an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



extraordinary situation, are liable to  behave  in

extraordinary ways. For instance, in  a  shipwreck

and  in  critical situations of that  nature,  the

normal pattern of behaviour is often abandoned and

we   see   the  basic  characteristics  or   basic

qualities  of a person emerging. Somerset  Maugham

is  the one writer whose main theme is to dwell on

the  unusual behaviour of human beings in critical

or extraordinary or unusual circumstances. But,  I

think,   not   even   Somerset   Maugham's    deep

understanding of human nature would  have  enabled

him  to forecast with any accuracy how Members  of

the   Opposition  in  the  Singapore   Legislative

Assembly will react and behave when they are faced

with  the task of criticising the first Budget  of

the People's Action Party Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find, much to our delight, that the Member for

Mountbatten  is a staunch champion of taxi-drivers

and hawkers. The Member for Tanglin has revealed a

hitherto  unsuspected predilection for out-of-date

socialist literature, and the Member for Cairnhill

emerges as a Gallahad in shining armour in defence

of the Nanyang University. Sir, I put it to you as

a  simple  and  straightforward  proposition  that

these  are  attitudes that have been adopted  with

the  general elections four and a half years hence

in  mind, and that they do not reflect any genuine

philosophical conviction when they set out on  the

task of commenting on the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I am now engaged in a race against

time.  Within a period of about fifteen minutes  I

have to review the comments made by Members of the

Opposition.  I  shall start with  the  Member  for

Cairnhill.  He stated that he found difficulty  in

adding  up  figures  which I  gave  in  my  budget

statement.  I  am  sorry I have to  go  over  this

ground   all  over  again.  But  I  realise   that

elementary  arithmetic may be beyond the  capacity

of  some  people.  When the Government  came  into

office,  the  budget  deficit  as  stated  in  the

Ordinary  Estimates  was  $4  million.   That   is

correct.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



That is quite true. But there was a deficit of $18

million in the Development budget, and I think the

Member  for Cairnhill did not understand that,  in

the  calculation of a possible budget deficit  for

this year, I had to take into account not only the

deficit  in the Ordinary Estimates but  the  large

deficit in the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in the budget statement, if

things  were  left  to go on  as  planned  by  the

previous  Government, we would be  faced  with  an

overall deficit of $42 million, to which the  late

supplementary  estimates made  in  May  this  year

contributed $10 million. These late estimates were

put up clearly with the general elections in mind.

More  important and more basic are the Member  for

Cairnhill's comments on the P.A.P. policy  towards

capital  and  trade in this country.  He  has  the

audacity to say that-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I have over-ruled the

word  "audacity" in the past. Perhaps the Minister

will withdraw the word.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I withdraw that word, Sir, I

intended to convey to you that he was sufficiently

misguided  to come to the conclusion that  it  was

the  P.A.P. that was responsible for  frightening

business by what he termed silly utterances.  Now,

I  wish  to recall some of the statements made  by

the   Opposition  Members  during   the   election

campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I do not have the Press cuttings

with  me,  and  therefore I can  only  speak  from

memory. The Member for Cairnhill himself said that

if  the  P.A.P. were to come to power,  Singapore

would be a dead city. The homes would be empty and

the  streets would be deserted. Well, Mr Speaker,

Sir, everyone knows that during the last week  the

streets  could  not be more full than  they  were,

with  the  people  rejoicing in the  Loyalty  Week

celebrations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten stated at a meeting at

Fullerton Square that if the P.A.P. came to power,

they  would  confiscate  jewellery.  Now,  I  have

noticed very carefully her attire, and as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



you  can  see  for yourself, she  is  quite  gaily

bedecked with jewellery. Obviously, therefore, she

did not believe what she had said in her speech at

the election campaign!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that perhaps can be

termed  as  personal  conduct,  and  the  personal

conduct  of a Member wearing jewellery  cannot  be

referred to.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I certainly did not intend to

be  ungallant, and if you think it is improper,  I

certainly withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin in another election rally

stated, doubtless in the heat of the moment,  "The

lightning has struck Singapore, and your house  is

on  fire."  Now, Sir, if these are not  statements

calculated  to  frighten the people,  may  I  know

exactly what would scare business and trade  away?

It is the irresponsible and mischievous statements

made by the Opposition Members that had set off  a

sort  of  nuclear chain reaction in the psychology

of  businessmen. Regardless of what the Member for

Farrer  Park  said,  about  the  harmlessness  and

inability of his colleagues to frighten people,  I

say that that was the effect, and that the decline

in  trade  preceding the election  was  due  to  a

systematic  scare campaign conducted by Opposition

Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, against their absurd and irresponsible

statements,   may  I  quote  the   P.A.P. policy

statement as contained in "The Tasks Ahead",  Part

1,  page  25? This refers to a policy  on  foreign

investment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Foreign business concerns which wish to

establish factories in Singapore will be given all

the  encouragement and assistance  they  need.  We

shall  give them guarantees in regard to  security

of  capital,  remittance of  dividends  and  other

matters  which  all modern governments  regard  as

normal practice."



<br><br>Therefore, when Members of the Opposition tried to

make out that there had been a deviation or change

from  the previous P.A.P. policy, I would  say  to

them  that  the evidence is quite to the contrary.

We  do not change our policy overnight. What we do

now   we   have  announced  during  the   election

campaign.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



In  particular, I would refer to the  comments  of

the  Member for Tanglin when he described what  he

thought  is our dilemma today, that we  are  under

pressure from the membership to go what he  called

the  extreme  left, whatever that maybe,  and  the

need  to assess the real position in business.  He

then  quoted  my budget speech in respect  of  two

points. One, that the Government would see  to  it

that the exploitation of men by men which had been

regarded  as  habitual and normal as a  result  of

toleration by the previous Government, will cease;

and the second point he drew attention to was that

if  we  want to have an expansion of business  and

investment  of  capital we must  see  to  it  that

suitable  conditions prevail. And the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  doubtless as a result of his  diligent

perusal  of  socialist  literature,  came  to  the

conclusion that there was a contradiction in these

two    objectives.   Our   Government   sees    no

contradiction whatsoever. In fact, if  the  Member

for   Cairnhill   insists   that   there   is    a

contradiction-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If the Member for Tanglin

insists that there is a contradiction, I can  only

conclude that, by suitable conditions for business

expansion,  he meant that the exploiters  must  be

encouraged to do their worst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of items, Mr Speaker, to

which  I can only now cursorily refer. The  Member

for  Cairnhill was greatly agitated that,  by  the

transfer  of  the  Department of  Tourism  to  the

Ministry of Culture, the effect would be to reduce

the  appeal of Singapore to foreign tourists. Now,

let  me  describe  some of  the  attempts  by  the

Department  of Tourism to attract tourists.  Under

the  previous dispensation, we all know that there

was an establishment named "Toby's Paradise" whose

proprietor had to leave the country in a hurry and

under a cloud when the P.A.P. took over. This  was

one  of  the distinguished efforts of the previous

Government to attract tourists. Then we found,  to

our  horror, that an arrangement had been made  to

invite  the  winner of a competition in  Australia

who had the biggest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



chest   to   come   to   Singapore.   Accordingly,

arrangements were made to invite Mr Chest to come

and  parade him round the country in the  interest

of attracting tourism. Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest

that  this  kind of action will not only  fail  to

attract tourists but will hold the country  up  to

ridicule and contempt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten made a number of

comments in defence of her proposal to restore the

variable  allowances.  She refuted  my  conclusion

that the effect of the cuts in variable allowances

was  comparatively negligible. She said  that  the

fact   that   liquor  revenue   and   the   cinema

attendances  were well maintained  had,  in  fact,

increased proved nothing, because these were forms

of enjoyment catering only to, if I may quote her,

"rich  magnates". Now, we know that the number  of

seats  in a cinema total several thousands  and  I

would  be astonished to learn that it is the  rich

magnates and the business tycoons who swamped  the

$1 and 50 cent-seats in the cinemas!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Tanglin quoted at length a

book  published in 1925 to advise me on  financial

prudence.  I  am afraid I cannot be  persuaded  to

fall  in with his point of view and, in any  case,

he  failed  to  realise  that  there  is  a  basic

difference   between  Singapore,  which   has   an

automatic currency, and the United Kingdom,  which

has  a  central bank, and it is possible  for  the

United  Kingdom Government to budget for a deficit

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



get  finance from the central bank. But these  are

technical matters which I will not pursue now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the variable allowances, everyone

says:  "Why not pay them more? This would help  to

make taxi-drivers and hawkers more prosperous, and

we  may  assist  local industry." The  Member  for

Mountbatten  presumes that if we were  to  restore

the  variable  allowances, the  purchase  of  soap

manufactured in Singapore would increase  to  such

an  extent  that  it would solve  the  problem  of

industry.  But  let me come to the point.  If  you

want  to  pay  them more, where will you  get  the

money  from?  Among  the Opposition  Members,  one

detects a lack of unanimity because the Member for

Farrer  Park,  who  has  a lot  of  experience  in

financial  matters, has concluded  that  no  other

budget is possible in the general interest of  the

country, and therefore-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is 8.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1960.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That this Assembly do now adjourn."

[Dr Toh Chin Chye].
