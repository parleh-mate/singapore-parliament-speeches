<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>LOCAL MEDIA</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Review of rules)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Information

and  the  Arts whether the Government is going to review  the

rules  on  the local media in order to pave way  for  greater

competition  in  the  industry,  and,  if  so,  whether   the

Government is prepared to give licences to news groups,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>



apart  from  Singapore Press Holdings, to publish  newspapers

which may be partially or wholly owned by foreign companies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is currently studying

the  local  media structure to keep it abreast of market  and

technological  changes.  Whilst it is useful to  have  market

competition, the control of the domestic media should  remain

in  local hands because of their unique nation-building role.

They can help unify and share local highpoints and viewpoints

among   Singaporeans,  and  get  the  Government's   official

position through to the people.  Foreigners must not be  able

to use media to influence local politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present rules, such as the 3% cap on ownership by

any one person and the requirement that only Singaporeans may

own  management shares, are thus still relevant because  they

ensure that these goals are met.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, advertisers

always  feel  that  it  is  expensive  to  advertise  in  the

newspapers.   Could  the  Ministry  control  the  prices   of

advertisements  in  the newspapers so  as  to  make  it  more

affordable?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, we believe in a free market here,

whether  it  is  for advertisements or for other  things.   I

think we should leave it to market forces.  If the newspapers

are too expensive, the advertisers can resort to other media.

For  example,  we get a lot of junk mail in our  post  boxes.

There are also the TV and other media that they can use.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> Sir, as far as the media is concerned,

there is no free market.  It is a monopoly.  Therefore, I ask

whether   the   Ministry   can   control   the   prices    of

advertisements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, there is no monopoly. There are

so many newspapers, although they are under the SPH umbrella.

But they all compete like cats and dogs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [14th March, 2000].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100."  -  [Dr S. Vasoo].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I am very glad

that   this  Government  has  set  up  Community  Development

Councils (CDCs) to more effectively cater to the needs of the

people.   I am concerned about the direction the CDCs  should

go  in order to be relevant and perceived as relevant to  our

citizens.   I would like to suggest that the CDCs  should  be

proactive in areas that affect a majority of residents and on

programmes that benefit more residents in the constituencies.

Ideally, the CDC can be a form of "local government".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the CDC also venture into

three  areas  that  I  am  familiar with;  areas  where  most

families  will benefit from and can appreciate from long-term

outcome.  These areas are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Healthcare is generally an important issue to most

people and, frequently, it is a political one too.  Singapore

is  no  exception.  It is, hence, an area worthy of the CDCs'

attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A programme that can benefit all the households of our

residents and also something that will improve the health  of

all  the residents would hold the CDCs in good stead.   I  am

suggesting that the CDCs sponsor everyone above 50  years  of

age  for  health  screening tests on a  regular  basis.   The

Minister for Health announced yesterday on the launching of a

community health screening programme.  The CDCs could perhaps

co-sponsor this scheme for residents on the amount payable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>



by them, especially those less well off residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has the benefit of making sure that preventive

care  is  extended to everyone, especially to the poorer  and

less  informed.  This will ensure that Singaporeans will have

better  health  and  happier lives.  It  will  thus  help  in

containing the cost of healthcare in the future as well as in

enhancing   the   economic  contributions  of   a   healthier

citizenry.  The tangible benefit for a lot of households,  as

many households have at least one person above 50 years, will

be  good for our nation too.  The CDCs are the best to  carry

out  this  programme  because it has  the  machinery  of  the

grassroots  workers  to  ensure  comprehensive  coverage   of

residents  in  the  constituencies.  The Ministry  of  Health

shall  lend  the  medical  resources  and  the  follow-up  of

patients that require them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sir, the second area that I would like CDCs to

consider is the complete take over of MediFund and the future

ElderCare Fund.  CDCs should be the decision-making  body  in

the disbursement of these Funds because, as "local councils",

they  will  know the residents' needs better.  The grassroots

also have better rapport with the residents in assessing  the

eligibility  of the applicants.  This is better than  letting

social  workers of the hospitals to do the job.   Members  of

Parliament  can  be  the advisors and perhaps  hand  out  the

awards to the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sir, as we are facing a fast-increasing aging

population  in  Singapore,  I would  like  to  urge  CDCs  to

redouble its attention in these potential problems that  come

with   it.   The  CDCs  should  consider  setting    up   and

subsidising  Centres  of  Activity for  Retired  and  Elderly

(CARE) island-wide.  These centres are to make sure that  the

increasing numbers of elderly have places to go to every  day

where  they  can have beneficial physical, mental and  social

care.   The purpose is to maintain them to be as healthy  and

active for as long as possible.  The elderly who attend these

centres  will appreciate the effects and their children  will

have  peace of mind knowing that they are catered  for  while

they are there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Community Development would

consider my suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir I

would  like  to speak on two points.  One is on the  identity

and role of CDCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have followed with great interest the development of

CDCs  since  its launch in 1997.  Since then, the  CDCs  have

committed  500  over projects, found jobs for many  residents

and  served  almost  like  a "local government"  for  300,000

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly welcome the strategic move to take over some

of  the  responsibilities so far carried out by MCD.  I  have

long  argued  for the need to work small, stay  targeted  and

relevant  to  smaller population bases, which have  different

demographic   characteristics  and  distinct   socio-economic

needs.   The Mayors and the MPs in each ward would know  best

what  the people want, how they wish their environment to  be

organised  and whom they can mobilise to kick-start community

projects.   There  is  no better way to  create  a  sense  of

ownership and responsibility among residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the CDC defines itself as a bridge between

the people and the public sector, it must then see itself  as

a  capacity-building agency within the people sector, and not

as a Government instrument designed for exerting more control

over  the  community.  Is CDC prepared to accept the  active,

egalitarian participation of citizens who are free to debate,

contest  and  challenge issues that affect them?   Or  is  it

prepared  to  only encourage individuals and groups  to  rise

from  the grassroots to undertake self-help projects  already

defined  by  the  CDC management?  The distinction  community

leaders  made between the role of an activist within a  civil

society  movement  and that of an agent in creating  a  civic

society  will impact in numerous fashions the way we organise

projects, communicate and share responsibility.  Undoubtedly,

it  is  going to be a very complex decoupling and re-emerging

process where the promises of civil society and that of civic

society can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>



somewhat  be negotiated.  It will take time, and it  takes  a

lot of trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiences on the ground so far have yielded a

mixed  satisfaction level and mixed successes.  Although  the

perceptions   have  improved  since  1997,  a  thorny   issue

persists,   among  others,  in  the  relational  aspects   of

cooperation between the older grassroots leaders and  younger

professional  social  service  operators,  between  the   CDC

management  and  the  community  agencies.   The  groups  are

divided  by  age, social class, experiences,  differences  in

skills,  attitudes and interests.  If these  differences  are

not managed, people's agencies will just shut themselves out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult enough to accept CDCs as non-Government,

because  they  are led by politicians, but  it  can  be  less

"bureaucratic" or jeng-hu or "government", so  to  speak,  by

adopting  flexible, open, fair and accountable inter-personal

skills   to  interact  with  a  more  demanding,  questioning

citizenry, one which seeks more information and is not likely

to merely follow instructions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that the National Community Leadership

Training  Institute  (NCLTI)  take  the  lead  in  organising

workshops  for the grassroots organisations within each  CDC.

It  would be useful to include key partners in other  sectors

as   well,   like   the  Police,  social  service   agencies,

polyclinics, residents' committees and so on.  We would  need

very  good  facilitators to get this going.  I  believe  that

when  people  work and learn together, the  greater  are  the

chances of building rapport with one another and making sense

of  the  meaning  of  "community".   An  even  more  concrete

suggestion is to regularise an on-going workgroup for  people

to  meet and discuss community concerns and solutions.   Such

regular  face-to-face  interactions  are  more  effective  in

generating   the   social  capital  that   encourages   civic

engagement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDCs can serve as strong bridges, but without effective

networkers, they cannot become effective community  builders.

Without  professionalising the personnel  by  equipping  them

with a range of skills in building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>



community, the goals of S21 which CDCs are tasked to  execute

at the community level will be harder to realise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this weekend's gathering on the 19th for the nine

CDC  leaders will identify the kind of leadership  attributes

needed for CDCs.  The clarion call made by Mr Eddie Teo could

serve  as a lead for more discussions.  His call was  to  ask

the  civil  servants  to  open  up,  share  information,   be

responsible   to   constructive   ideas   and   tolerant   of

differences.   This  same  message must  be  adopted  by  the

voluntary  sector as well as by community leaders and  social

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is about making CDCs a "virtual

neighbourhood".   We could kick off a pilot project  by  CDCs

sponsoring   old   computers  for   a   limited   number   of

participating households in one constituency.  We can request

the  help  of  polytechnic students to design an  easy-to-use

Internet training programme to promote Internet literacy.  It

is   my  wish  to  see  simple  computers  and  even  simpler

programmes  that older persons could learn to use  to  create

this virtual neighbourhood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, an on-line service connected to the CDC will

serve  as  the  coordinating centre to  answer  all  queries,

respond to assistance calls and make the necessary referrals.

This  is where volunteers and students could be mobilised  to

manage this on-line service.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In London, at Islington, where such a networking

experiment  was  tried, participants were  able  to  exchange

information as mundane as gardening tips, recommend a plumber

or electrician, find a baby-sitter or exchange notes on shops

and  restaurants.   These bits and pieces  of  everyday  life

created  the vibrancy of a shared and a caring community  and

allowed  more communication among residents which  could  not

have  happened otherwise.  The company, Microsoft Corp, which

sponsored   this   experiment   called   this   their   first

"cyberstreet community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>



project".   Maybe this is something CDCs could  spearhead  to

help make Singaporeans, young and old, Internet literate  and

connected.   I  believe technology must be  made  simple  and

broadly applied to promote some level of social cohesion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Recently,

the  results  of  a  survey conducted by the  National  Youth

Council  revealed that  out of the 100 youths surveyed,  only

one  was  interested in social work, while 55% of  them  were

more    interested   in   outdoor   activities   and   public

entertainment.  Such surveys have aroused my  interest.   The

Ministry of Community Development has also conducted a survey

on  some 25,000 grassroots leaders.  According to the survey,

60%  of  the grassroots leaders were over the age of 60,  and

25%  between the ages of 30 and 40.  These two surveys showed

that our young people are disinterested in social work.  Such

survey results merit our attention.  It is a problem that  we

will have to solve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-cultural society.

The  fact that we are able to enjoy peace and racial  harmony

is  due to the fact that all of us work towards the same goal

to  build a better home for Singapore.  The important  factor

for   such  an  achievement  is  that  we  have  very  strong

grassroots  organisations.  They help  to  build  our  social

cohesiveness.   They act as a bridge between  the  Government

and  the people. They convey messages from the Government and

also  receive  feedback  from the people.   Such  hardworking

grassroots  leaders  merit our admiration.   I  know  certain

grassroots  leaders  have been working in the  constituencies

for  long  periods of time. They sacrificed  their  time  and

donated  their money.  They worked very hard for the society.

Many   grassroots leaders worked for more than 30  years  and

have  devoted  their  life to society.  Such   dedication  is

exemplary.   Our young people should emulate them.   Most  of

these people are quite elderly and when they leave the scene,

we  would  have no young people to take over from them.    We

have  to  do something about this.  We have to work out  some

plans  to  encourage  our  young people  to  be  involved  in

community work.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is not here. Mr Harun

Ghani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Harun Bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun Bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The Muslim

residents  in the Jurong area are grateful to the  Government

because,  for many years, the Government has allowed  Muslims

to  use  the land in Jurong to build a mosque, which  is  the

Jalan  Majapahit Mosque.  Unfortunately, at the end of  1999,

the  Mosque could not function any more because the site  has

been  acquired.  Therefore, the Muslim residents  in  Jurong,

Jurong West, Gaik Poh, Nanyang, Old Jurong Road, Boon Lay and

the  workers in the Tuas industrial area and its surroundings

also do not now have a place to go and observe congregational

prayers and attend religious classes. So the residents  there

are  appealing  to the Government, through  the  Minister  in

charge  of  Muslim Affairs, for a mosque to be built  in  the

Jurong  West  area because there are now  65,000  residential

units  in the area.  According to the Development Guide Plan,

each  area  with 20,000 units of residential units  ought  to

have  one place of worship for each religion.  I believe that

with  this density of population in Jurong, it is timely  for

Jurong West to have a mosque.

that  of  employment opportunity.  It is within our  national

interests  that  we  build an environment  for  persons  with

disabilities to optimally function as independents.  For  me,

employment is the key pillar in empowerment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a centralised employment centre, Bizlink that

provides    vocational   assessment,   placement,   training,

counselling/follow up for disabled people.  In 1996, only 272

placements   were  made,  but  since  then,  the   employment

situation  became  increasingly difficult  for  the  disabled

community due to the economic crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government does not enforce employment legislation

for the disabled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>



However,   various  incentives  are  provided  to   encourage

organisations to hire people with disability.   Allow  me  to

raise  two promotional schemes because I feel they  have  not

been  publicised enough.  First, the Inland Revenue Authority

of Singapore permits employers to claim a tax deduction of up

to  $100,000 when they modify their business and premises  to

help  their disabled workers.  Second, the Singapore  Chinese

Chamber  Foundation reimburses the salaries of each  disabled

worker  employed by the private sector for the first one  and

the  half months.  It provides a transport and meal allowance

of   $5  a  day  for  the  first  two  weeks  of  employment,

channelling  the  money  through the  Ministry  of  Community

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could we ask the Government to be generous and

complement  the role of the Chinese Chamber by  matching  the

reimbursement  amount  to  the  disabled  community  and  the

companies  that  employ  them  on  the  basis  of  co-sharing

principle?  This initiative may well succeed in incentivising

companies  to  offer jobs and individuals with disability  to

seek jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn to the employment issue. Could Bizlink

serve  as a labour contractor responsible for placing  groups

of  workers in a work context and be responsible for ferrying

them  to  and from work and helping them adjust to  the  work

environment?  The advantage of placing more than  one  worker

is  self-evident.  The disabled person feels  supported.   Or

could the role of contracting employment for the disabled  in

groups  be left to individual organisations so that they  can

find  the  appropriate employment placement for  those  under

their  charge?   Because they would know what  their  clients

could  do  and tasked with this job they will find  the  work

contracts that are suitable to the work and skills levels  of

their  clients and they could conduct orientation and support

programmes  at work to give employers their fair  return  and

help workers feel useful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, the Labour Department actually adopts an

integration model by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>



setting  a  quota  of  1.8%  of employment  of  persons  with

disabilities  for  companies  with  more  than  300   regular

employees.   If such companies failed to comply,  a  levy  of

50,000  yen is imposed on the companies.  On the other  hand,

employers who recruit more, above the quota, will be  paid  a

grant  of  25,000 yen per person per month for the number  of

disabled persons employed in excess of the quota.  This is  a

very enlightened labour policy, as it encourages companies to

open up more jobs for people who are disabled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Japanese integration and rehabilitation model

has  a lot to teach us.  Not only is their disabled community

being  encouraged  to  function in  the  open  market,  large

ventures  are encouraged to contract them to be part  of  the

production  teams.   One  example is  the  operation  of  big

printing presses.  The persons with disabilities do the  less

physical  demanding jobs of desktop publishing, mailing,  and

so  on,  while  the  able  workers  do  the  physically  more

demanding ones.  This way the workshop can provide  the  full

range of service to the customers from desktop publishing  to

printing and mailing service, like in any commercial printing

company.  Through training and close supervision, out of work

and  during  work, the flourishing of commercial ventures  in

Japan  involving  persons with disabilities  has  proven  one

vital  point: that the disabled are not unable and  they  are

economically  productive  if they  are  given  a  chance  and

adequate  support.  We need employers to open  up  more  jobs

with some levels of incentives from Government.  We need  MOM

to   provide  an  employment  bulletin  for  jobs  posted  by

employers who are really willing to recruit the disabled.  We

need to strengthen the assessment and referral procedures  of

Bizlink and other VWOs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Jennifer Lee is not speaking. Dr Lily

Neo.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I have repeatedly raised in this

House,  over the past three years, various issues  about  the

aged  in  our country.  Notwithstanding the embarrassment  of

being a bore to my colleagues, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>



seek  their  indulgence on this topic one more time.   Please

allow me to reiterate an important issue concerning ageing of

the  population. I refer to the financing of  healthcare  for

senior citizens in the future.  I am raising this issue under

the Ministry of  Community Development because it is the lead

agency   to  implement  the  recommendations  of  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on Ageing Population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned in this House before, there is an

inadequacy  in our present healthcare financing in  spite  of

our  Medisave,  MediShield and Medifund  schemes.   This  was

recognised  by  the  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  Ageing

Population  and  is referred to as "Expanding Step-down  Care

Financing".   It is recommended that the Ministry  of  Health

and  the  Central Provident Fund Board establish, as  I  have

advocated in this House as well, an insurance scheme  against

severe  disabilities.   It  is  also  recommended  that   the

premiums  be  made less burdensome by making it payable  with

Medisave.  Sir, my main contention on this issue is  that  we

must  make  sure this insurance scheme addresses the  problem

well and its execution is well planned, lest we find it still

lacking after implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure success, this insurance scheme must

cater for all aspects of "step-down care" and contrary to the

recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on  Ageing

Population, must include medical expenses.  Yes, coverage  of

medical expenses is an important part of "step-down care" and

must  be  included.   Many  "step-down  care"  patients  need

continued medical care and long term medications after  their

discharge  from the hospitals.  If the medical  expenses  are

exclusive  of  the  "step-down care" and  are  excluded  from

financing,  this financing scheme will only fail.   Sir,  our

future cases of chronic-disease sufferers will heavily burden

our  tertiary  medical institutions, raising  the  healthcare

costs  unnecessarily  when they  can  be  cared  for  in  the

community  facilities or in their own homes.  But  they  will

opt not to because they can only use Medisave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>



and  MediShield  in  the  tertiary institutions  and  not  at

community facilities or when they stay at home.  I hope  that

we  do  not let this serious mistake take place, or  we  will

have a perpetual flaw in our system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Community Development can steer

the implementation of this issue with favourable outcome.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, with good

medical care, senior citizens are now living to an older age,

averaging about 77 years.  Currently, there are already cases

where  the  old, about 60, are looking after  the  yet  older

parents  who  are in the 80s.  This type of elderly  care  is

obviously  not  efficient.  Although the full impact  of  the

ageing  population will not be seen until  15  to  20  years'

time,  I am glad that the Government had taken the initiative

with a high-level Inter-Ministerial Committee to make an  in-depth  study  on  this  issue.  While  the  Inter-Ministerial

report  on  the  aged is a total approach  to  the  issue,  I

believe  the  Ministry  of Community Development  and  Sports

should  be  the  lead  Ministry to take  care  of  the  total

solution.   Based  on  the  current budget  allocation,  this

amount  will  not be sufficient to take care  of  the  ageing

population.   The  Ministry  should  work  closely  with  the

Ministry of Finance for higher budget allocation which  could

be related to the population of the aged.



<br>1.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, young mothers are allowed to take leave

to take care of sick children below the age of six.  With the

ageing  population,  I would like to ask for  elderly  parent

care leave which will allow workers similarly to take care of

aged parents of 60 years and above.  This will encourage more

people to take an active part in the care of ageing parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fertility rate has dropped from 1.82 in 1980 to 1.48

in  1999.  If this trend  continues, there will not be enough

siblings to take care of their parents.  Loneliness  will  be

the biggest problem which the aged will have to learn to cope

with.  Teaching the senior citizens how to cope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>



with  ageing will be a major task.  The Ministry should  work

out comprehensive plans to help senior citizens adjust to the

problem of ageing, especially in the mindset.  Preparing  for

retirement  with  sufficient  money  is  only  one  important

aspect.   There  are many other variables  to  take  care  in

ageing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has over the years spawned a whole new

industry  in  childcare  centres.   These  childcare  centres

provide  good  care for children with working  parents.   The

Ministry  should  now  draw up guidelines  and  provide  good

incentives  for the private sector and VWOs to  set  up  more

senior citizens care centres, where workers could place their

elderly  parents, and professionally trained  geriatric  care

staff  can  take good care of senior citizens  at  affordable

rates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, at the moment,

there  are  about 280,000 people aged 60 and above.   By  the

year  2030,  there will be about 400,000 such people.   Later

on,  there  may be about one million such senior citizens  in

Singapore.   So we must have a comprehensive plan  to  tackle

the problems of an ageing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three suggestions to make. On the family,

Minister  Mah  Bow  Tan has mentioned that  there  are  about

800,000  families in Singapore, and the number is  likely  to

rise to one million. On the average, there will be one senior

citizen  in every family.  So, at home, we have to  start  to

educate  our young to respect the old and take care of  them.

We  must  also  ensure that there is good care  for  the  old

people.  As it is said  in Chinese, "Look after your own  old

people  and extend it to look after other people's old people

too."   We must be caring to all the old people around us, so

that we have a compassionate and caring society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent a lot of time talking about setting up more

childcare centres because of the need for them.  In  view  of

the  ageing  population, we must also seriously  think  about

establishing more elderly-care centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the MCDS should consider setting up day care

centres for the elderly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>



at  our  community clubs or community centres.  Now that  the

trend in our society is to have small families, couples  have

to  work  in the day time, while the old people are  left  at

home.   They  may feel very lonely. So if you have  day  care

centres  in  the  community centres and the community  clubs,

then  such  senior  citizens can go to the  centres  to  read

newspapers, watch TV, sing karaoke songs, or do some physical

exercises.   These  day care activities will  certainly  make

life happier and more wholesome for such old people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is said, the four essential things in life are:

clothing,  food,  housing, and transportation.   To  our  old

people,  clothing is not much of a problem.  As for  housing,

the  Ministry  of National Development has already  announced

various measures to make the HDB flats more user-friendly for

the elderly, such as having lift landing on every level, etc.

Minister  Mah  Bow Tan has already actively  considered  this

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is that we must have regular health

screening for senior citizens.  Minister Lim Hng Kiang has

already accepted my proposal.  I would like to thank the

Minister for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third one is transportation problem. I mentioned

this in the debate on the President's Address.  Generally, we

have  a  good and safe public transport system in  Singapore.

We  have  taxis, buses, MRT and LRT, and so on.  But although

the  senior citizens are granted concessions for the  use  of

public transport, these concessions are restricted to certain

periods  of  the  time.  I would like to  ask  if  this  time

restriction  can  be removed.  I understand that  the  Inter-Ministerial   Committee  has  accepted   this   proposal   in

principle.   Now  it  is for SBS and TIBS to  implement  this

recommendation.  Hitherto, I have not heard any good news  on

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two approaches to tackle this problem. One is

when  you  want  to  do something, you  take  the   proactive

approach  and   actively look for ways and means  to  achieve

what you have targeted to achieve, so that your plans may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>



carried  out   smoothly.  On the other hand, if  you  take  a

negative  approach, and have no intention  to  work  hard  to

resolve  the  problem, then you will think of  all  kinds  of

reasons  and excuses for not doing it. So I hope the  parties

concerned  would be very active in considering my  proposals.

We  must know that the senior citizens had made contributions

to  nation-building  when  they were  young.   Without  their

dedication  and contribution, we would not have a  prosperous

Singapore  today.  So we must give them due  recognition  and

reward.   I  think  they  deserve  our  concern.   It  is   a

concession.   It is not completely free.  So  this  will  not

seriously  eat  into the profit of the companies.   A  Zaobao

survey  said  that  more  than 90% of those  people  surveyed

supported  this proposal.  I hope the parties concerned  will

consider this favourably and bring another good piece of news

to the 280,000 old people in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, currently, there is

an  Elderly  Development  Division,  under  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development.  Its functions include,  among  other

things,   monitoring   and   reviewing   of   community-based

programmes and residential care services for the elderly, and

regulatory  control of sheltered homes for the  aged.   Under

the  Ministry  of  Health,  there is  an  Elderly  Care  Unit

responsible  for  development  of  institutional   care   and

community-based services for the elderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although I understand the different focus and

capability of the Ministries in developing specific  services

needed  by  the aged, I share the view in the report  of  the

Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population that the

current  situation does not provide a satisfactory  framework

in  providing services to the aged.  The Report said,  and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The present administrative divide between social care

and health care hinders the development of holistic models of

care  for  senior  citizens.   It  also  discourages  service

providers  from expanding their scope of services and  limits

the  scope  of joint planning and development of  health  and

social services."



This is in page 85 of the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know from the Minister what is his

response to the above.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the number of

senior  citizens aged 65 years and above stood at 235,000  as

at  1999 and there will be 529,000 of them in the year  2020.

The  rapidly ageing population will mean that there  will  be

increased  demand  for  elderly care services  at  the  local

level.   It  has been commented for sometime that  there  are

insufficient facilities at the local level for the elderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one particular area of concern among VWOs serving

the  elderly is the lack of coordinated effort to look at the

social needs of the community at the planning stage.   It  is

not common for services to be needed in a particular locality

but one is not able to site the service centre there due to a

lack  of  a proper site.  Matters are compounded in  the  new

housing estates where void decks are becoming short in supply

and there are competing uses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has become critical that the various planning

agencies  get together and provide for many of these services

and  facilities at the planning stage.  The Inter-Ministerial

Committee  on the Ageing Population made a recommendation  in

its  report  last  year,  calling  for  MCDS  to  become  the

coordinating  agency  to coordinate with  various  Government

agencies  involved in the town planning stage, that is,  when

the   blueprint  is  being  drawn  up,  MCDS  should  be  the

coordinating agency to identify the demands and needs of  the

elderly.   Sir,  it also made the recommendation  that  CDCs,

grassroots organisations and VWOs be consulted on  the  local

needs  as far as the elderly were concerned so that the needs

and facilities that they require can be taken into account in

planning and when implementing programmes for the aged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what steps the

Ministry has taken to become the coordinating agency in  this

respect.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on

the Ageing Population has many good recommendations on how we

can prepare Singapore for an ageing population.  I would like

to  urge  the  Minister for Community Development  to  hasten

implementation of some of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>



recommendations   and   to   ensure   attainment   of   those

recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise the issue of community-based

services  for  our senior citizens.  Here, I  strongly  agree

with the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population

on  one of its key desired outcomes for senior citizens,  and

that  is,  to  ensure  sufficient opportunities  for  healthy

senior  citizens to remain socially, physically and  mentally

active.   Indeed,  I  have  been  advocating  this  and  have

mentioned this in this House on several occasions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up "multi-service centres" and integrating

health,  social and other services under one roof for  senior

citizens   has  been  recommended.   Two  models  have   been

suggested: (1) co-location of services targeted at  different

clientele  groups  such  as  senior  citizens,  children  and

disabled, and (2) co-location of eldercare services  such  as

day care, day rehabilitation and home care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that for this scheme to give

the  best  results  in the future, we must first  have  basic

centres  preferably throughout the island  that  promote  the

social,  physical  and mental well-being of  the  independent

elderly.  The aim of the centres is to enable the elderly  to

lead a healthier, happier and independent life for as long as

possible and to contribute to society for as long as possible

without burdening themselves and others.  Sir, the very basis

of preventive care for the aged shall depend on a scheme like

this.  It is better to strive for excellence in this area  so

that  we  do not need to cater excessively to look after  the

sick and disabled elderly.  I urge the Minister for Community

Development to first prioritise setting-up such basic centres

which  are  easier  and cheaper to run.  Once  we  have  such

centres   in   place,  other  relevant  services,   including

childcare, can be developed from them.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Community Development should not be

over-zealous in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>



getting  co-location of other services  too  quickly  in  the

"multi-service  centres".  Let there  be  well-founded  basic

centres  in  the beginning and expand to have other  services

from  these centres later.  The expansion for other  services

is  best tailored to the requirements of each centre  or  the

task  may be overwhelming and prone to failure.  It is to  be

noted  that a constituency that needs eldercare may,  indeed,

not need childcare services, and vice versa, depending on the

age distribution of the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These basic centres will be good platforms to offer help

on various aspects, such as health, finance or job issues, to

an  ageing  population.  They can also be  further  developed

into  day rehabilitation or day care venues and some  of  the

healthy  elderly there can even be co-opted to help and  care

for the dependent elderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as recommended by the Inter-Ministerial Committee,

it  is best to set up the "multi-service centres" through the

collaboration  of the Ministry of Community Development,  the

Ministry of Health, the Community Development Council and the

grassroots and voluntary organisations.  We should  make  use

of  available infrastructure like the community centres  that

are   often  under-utilised  in  the  day  as  the   centres.

Governmental  financial  subsidy,  of  course,  has   to   be

forthcoming as the elderly usually have no disposable  income

to pay for these services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Community Development will take

into  account  all the points raised when implementing  these

"multi-service centres".



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, years ago,

when  Mr  Howe  Yoon Chong presented the White Paper  on  the

problems  that  we could face in our ageing population,  many

were   sceptical,  but  it  became  obvious  now   that   our

demographic  profile is changing faster than expected.   With

the  ageing  problem plus the less than satisfied  population

growth,  an  ageing  population has  become  a  very  serious

problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raising of CPF withdrawal age, the emphasis on

training  of  our older workers, the promotion of  healthcare

and the various schemes by the Government to encourage senior

citizens to be more active, all help to emphasise the need to

deal  with the rapid increase in our ageing population.   But

one  of  the  most  important steps to take to  address  this

problem  is  to change the mindset of our population  towards

old age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 30 to 40 years ago, when we mentioned a person who

is  50  years and above, an image of an old man came to mind.

However,  through  these years, because of  better  diet  and

medical advancements, life expectancy has increased for male,

maybe,  up  to  76  and  female, 78.   Therefore,  this  will

straightaway  mean  that  those in  the  50s  should  now  be

considered as middle aged and only those who are above 65, or

so, can be defined as senior citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important for the Ministry to make greater

efforts  in  promoting  the change  in  the  mindset  of  our

population  so  that we have a whole new concept  of  ageing.

This  will  not  only change the profile of  the  demographic

pyramid, it also helps to physically and mentally change  the

number of the so-called senior citizens we have now.  And  if

we  are able to change the definition of senior citizen  from

what  is now being pursued as around 50-65 to, say, about  65

to  even  70,  it  would  then reflect  more  truly  our  age

classification at this present moment.  I therefore call  for

a number of measures to be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Retirement to be raised further;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Define the age when one can be considered senior

citizens,  for  example,  increase  the  age  limit   to   be

considered for MRT, bus fares, or any other such concessions;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All senior citizens' clubs' or associations'

qualifying age should be increased;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Redefine the classification of age for senior

citizens in senior sporting events.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

am  pleased  to  note that the Government will  increase  tax

reliefs for those who live with their aged parents by $500 to

$5,000.   I  am also pleased that the Government is extending

the  CPF's top-up scheme to include the grandparents as well.

The  above measures will encourage more young people to  live

with  and  take  care of their aged parents,  promote  inter-generational  ties and strengthen family bonding  and  filial

piety among the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's population is ageing rapidly. It is a

matter  regarded as very serious among all  our  people.   In

1998,  the  Government formed the Inter-Ministerial Committee

on  the  Ageing  Population to lead  a  coordinated  national

response  to  address  the challenges of Singapore's  rapidly

ageing  population.   The  Inter-Ministerial  Committee   has

finalised its recommendations and has submitted its report to

the  Government.  Perhaps, the Government could enlighten  us

on  whether there is any timeframe for the implementation  of

the  various  recommendations of the report, as many  of  the

Members  who spoke before me have also expressed interest  in

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government provides childcare subsidies for working

mothers to send their children to childcare centres of  their

choice.   Of  course, the children are the future masters  of

our  nation.   There  is  nothing wrong  with  such  subsidy.

However, for our elderly, who had worked hard and contributed

to  our  nation during their younger days, we should consider

giving  similar  subsidy for working couples  to  send  their

elderly  in  the  family  to some elderly  day-care  centres,

irrespective of whether they are run by the voluntary welfare

organisations, or by private operators, or cooperatives.   If

the  Government  could grant the subsidy, it  will  encourage

more private operators and cooperatives to play a larger role

in  providing  affordable services to  those  who  need  such

services.  Hopefully, more day care centres would be  set  up

for the benefit of our senior citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has introduced the studio apartments for

our  elderly  to have more choices in their housing  options.

This is something which is very good. HDB has also promised a

"complete  living environment" so that the  elderly  will  be

able to live near their children and other elderly people  in

an   estate  with  easily  accessible  amenities.   Can   the

Government inform us on the types of facilities and  services

which will be provided for residents of the studio apartment?

Will  the  service  providers be confined  to  the  voluntary

welfare  organisations?  Can private operators also be  given

the opportunity to provide such services?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> First, let

me  thank  Members who have spoken.  I must admit that  I  am

really  impressed  by  the  passion  and  the  commitment  of

Members,  especially on the institution of  the  family,  and

indeed  this bodes well for the community.  We, at MCD,  have

put the family at the top of our agenda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, come 1st April 2000, MCD will become the Ministry

of  Community Development and Sports (or MCDS).  This signals

more  than a mere change of name.  I would like to take  this

opportunity to lay out the new policy directions and emphases

that  my Ministry will pursue to strengthen our social fabric

and the role of sports in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS' mission is to build a cohesive and resilient

society,   supported  by  four  pillars:  that  is,  socially

responsible  individuals,  strong  and  stable  families,   a

sporting  people,  as well as a caring and active  community.

And  all Singaporeans must share these responsibilities.  But

MCDS  has  a special role in nurturing individuals,  families

and  the  community and in charting out the policy directions

for the future of sports and social services in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this mission, Sir, MCDS will adopt the

following approaches and emphasis.  First, where feasible, we

should  take  an  integrated Government  approach  to  social

issues.  Whether it is preparing for an ageing population  or

addressing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>



the issues of family ties, values, marriage and procreation - these  are  highly  complex  issues  which  cut  across  many

agencies  and  sectors of the community.  We therefore  agree

with Dr Vasoo, Dr Jennifer Lee, Mdm Claire Chiang and others,

who  have highlighted the benefits and effectiveness of  such

an integrated approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need the spirit of active citizenship in the

public  and  private as well as people sectors.   The  social

issues we face today can no longer be addressed by Government

alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to make the social safety net more effective, we

will increasingly work upstream to identify and deal with the

root  causes before they grow into social problems.  MCDS  is

studying  the problem of youths and families in  distress  to

identify  the predictors and the risks.  And based  on  these

studies,  we  will  strengthen preventive  and  developmental

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first pillar: we want socially responsible

individuals.   We want citizens who are active to  serve  the

community.  At the very least, we want Singaporeans  to  take

responsibility for their own lives.  But there will always be

those  who  need  help.   And social welfare  will  therefore

continue to be a major responsibility of my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we will strengthen our rehabilitation

programmes for juvenile offenders.  As family involvement  is

critical  for  the effective rehabilitation of offenders,  we

will  increasingly seek the involvement of  parents  in  this

process.   And  I am happy to inform the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar,  Dr  Vasoo,  that  we  will  propose  making  parental

involvement  and  counselling mandatory  when  we  amend  the

Children and Young Persons Act before the end of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move to our second pillar, which is the family.

The  family,  as  we  know,  is  the  single  most  important

stabilising  pillar  of society.  And MCDS  will  deepen  its

commitment to building strong and stable families.   However,

family  values are under pressure due to changing  lifestyles

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>



rising  expectations.   Our young are delaying  marriage  and

postponing   having  children.   Both  men  and   women   are

struggling to balance their work and family responsibilities.

It  is  therefore  in the national interest  to  ensure  that

Singapore  has  a pro-family environment.  I  would  like  to

assure  Dr Jennifer Lee, Mdm Claire Chiang and other  Members

that as lead Ministry for the family, MCDS will work with our

various  partners  to  put  in  place  an  integrated  policy

framework  on  the  family.  We will  promote  practices  and

services which create a family-friendly environment which  is

conducive  to  marriage  and procreation  and  which  support

families in their parenting and care-giving roles.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a key concern, as has been alluded to by several

Members,   is  marriage and procreation.  The Prime  Minister

raised  this  issue  during  the debate  on  the  President's

Address  last  October.  Although the  proportion  of  single

graduates  has  remained stable somewhat, there  has  been  a

dramatic  increase in the proportion of single non-graduates.

And  as a group, there are far more non-graduate singles than

graduates.   For  example,  the  singlehood  rate  for   non-graduates between the ages of 40 and 44 years has risen  from

9.2% in 1990 to 13.8% in 1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for those who choose to marry and have children,

the  median age of mothers at birth of their first child  has

increased  from 27.5 years in 1990 and eight years later,  in

1998,  to  28.5  years,  a  one year  increment.   The  total

fertility  rate  has fallen, as mentioned by  other  Members,

from the Dragon year high of 1.96 in 1988 to 1.48 in 1999.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Singaporeans are not replacing themselves. The

fewer  babies  we  have, the more we will  have  to  rely  on

immigrants to make up the numbers. This may have an impact on

our  social  structure  and values. Our  population  is  also

ageing  rapidly partly because of this fall in the  fertility

rate.  With increased singlehood and smaller families, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>



family as the primary source of care and support may also  be

eroded.   But  Singapore is not alone  in  this  regard.  For

example,  Italy and Spain saw their fertility rates  decrease

steadily from replacement levels in early 1980s to about 1.17

in 1995. Japan also reported fertility levels of only 1.42 in

1995. Japan has implemented a set of comprehensive pro-family

policies,  the so-called "Angel Plan", mentioned by  Dr  Wang

yesterday,  which increased childcare benefits, nursery  care

services, reinforced maternity and child healthcare  systems,

and provided help in childcare costs, besides other measures.

Yet, Japan has yet to see a turnaround in their TFR.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to arrest declining fertility rates, our

procreation  policies must be targeted at the broad  base  of

the population and not just at graduates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subject is a very complex one which requires a

multi-agency  and  a  multi-sectoral approach.  For  Members'

information,  there  is  currently an Inter-Ministry  working

committee looking into the issues of marriage and procreation

in  detail.   And I would like to thank Dr Vasoo,  Prof.  Low

Seow  Chay and the Member for Bukit Timah, Dr Wang Kai  Yuen,

for  their  suggestions  and  comments  on  this  subject  of

national  concern  and certainly their  suggestions  will  be

conveyed to the Inter-Ministry committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to mention that in its effort to

address the problem of singlehood and under procreation, this

working  committee  will  be looking  into  the  plethora  of

reasons   and   attitudes   that  discourage   marriage   and

procreation and what we can do to encourage family  formation

and to provide family support.  I agree with Dr Jennifer Lee,

Dr Vasoo and Mdm Claire Chiang that an integrated approach is

necessary  in tackling wider family issues.  But  given  that

the  Inter-Ministry working committee is still  deliberating,

it  would  be  premature  for me  to  comment  on  whether  a

structure,  similar to the high-profile IMC  for  the  Ageing

Population  or  a  series of committees focused  on  specific

issues, as mentioned by Mdm Claire Chiang yesterday, would be

the most effective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>



mechanism  to  take  family issues forward.   Nonetheless,  I

would like to assure the House that my Ministry will work  to

ensure  that  the Singapore family is given high priority  on

the national agenda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the ageing population. The IMC on the

Ageing Population has been cited by Members as a good example

of a multi-agency initiative and approach. The Government has

accepted the Committee's recommendations in principle  and  I

am  glad to report that implementation of the recommendations

is on schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some recommendations have already been implemented, for

example,  the  Ministry of Health's recent revisions  to  the

subsidies  for VWO-run nursing homes, while others are  being

implemented,  such  as  the Supplementary  Retirement  Scheme

(SRS)   announced  by  Dr  Richard  Hu.  The  rest   of   the

recommendations,  such  as the development  of  multi-service

centres  and  an elder-friendly built environment,  would  be

part of a longer term programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leading agency on the ageing issues and

secretariat to the Committee, my Ministry is working with the

various agencies to ensure the effective implementation of as

many  recommendations  as  possible,  bearing  in  mind  that

solutions   have  to  be  feasible,  sustainable  and   cost-effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to youth development. Our youths are

our   future.   Agencies,  such  as  the  NYC,  the  People's

Association,  the  Ministry  of Education,  the  Ministry  of

Health,  including the Ministry of Home Affairs  and  various

non-governmental organisations have been doing  an  excellent

job in running youth programmes in line with their respective

organisational concerns. However, we agree with calls that it

is  timely  for us to take a more coordinated approach.  MCDS

will  henceforth  play  a more active  coordinating  role  to

ensure  a  more  integrated approach to youth development  in

Singapore.  My Ministry will also give increased emphasis  on

youth matters by incorporating such matters into a new Sports

and Youth Division in MCDS.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next pillar is a caring and active community. MCDS

has  been  reviewing  how community services  can  be  better

delivered and made more responsive to local needs.   We  also

want  to  empower the community to do more  for  itself.   We

intend  to  delegate certain functions to CDCs, so that  they

can  take  on  the  role  of planning and  delivering  social

services  at  the  local level. Apart  from  planning  social

services,  the CDCs will serve as the first-stop  for  social

assistance  in  the  community,  thus  making  services  more

accessible to those who need help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs will also be the local focal point for

volunteerism and community involvement.  Getting more  people

involved  in  community services and activities will  promote

community bonding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this delegation of functions to CDCs, the role of

MCDS  will  be  less in direct services, but more  in  policy

formulation,  national planning, as well as  in  setting  and

regulating standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the services to be delegated to the CDCs is the

administration of Public Assistance (PA) and other short-term

financial assistance schemes. The CDCs will also take  charge

of  planning  and siting community-based services,  beginning

with childcare, student care and also family service centres.

We expect to delegate these functions in phases over the next

few  years.  In  fact, two CDCs, the Marine  Parade  and  the

Tanjong Pagar CDCs, will be involved in the first phase  with

the other CDCs coming on board later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to sports. Dr Vasoo has asked for an

elaboration  of  our  policy on sports.  To  provide  greater

policy  focus  on sports, MCDS will, as I mentioned  earlier,

form a new Sports and Youth Division from 1st April 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since my announcement of MCD becoming MCDS, I sense

rising  expectation  on what should be done  for  sports,  in

terms  of  resources,  manpower  and  financial  support  and

infrastructure.  Members' speeches during the past two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>



days mirror this expectation.  I empathise with this.  But  I

wish  to  also emphasise that the sports fraternity  and  the

various  stakeholders should also accompany this  expectation

with effort, commitment and changes in mindset, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the Singapore Sports Council, my Ministry

intends  to  consult  various  stakeholders  in  the   sports

fraternity on a new vision for sports in Singapore,  as  well

as  strategies  to  realise this  vision.   We  have  already

started this process in February and we hope to announce  our

new sports vision before the end of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much of the desired outcomes of sports policy include

increased  focus on national pride and community bonding,  we

recognise that sports excellence or winning medals remains  a

key  driving force.  Hence, the critical element  is  greater

professionalism  and  accountability of the  National  Sports

Associations or NSAs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, we have identified three strategies to

achieve  this.  The  first  is  for  the  SSC  to  develop  a

systematic   programme  of  training  for  NSAs   in   sports

management and board governance. We will start with  NSAs  in

the core and merit sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative is to encourage the "twinning" of

key  NSAs  with  GLCs or MNCs.  Corporate  sponsors  will  be

encouraged to adopt NSAs so that the latter can benefit  from

the  financial support and guidance on corporate  governance.

Asia  Pacific Breweries (APB), for example, not only sponsors

the FAS' S-League but provides management expertise as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third strategy is greater accountability in the

management  of resources. To optimise resources  and  promote

better  accountability, we will coordinate  funding  by  SSC,

Singapore  Pools and other major funders and tie  funding  to

plans,  targets and results mutually agreed upon between  the

sponsors and the NSAs. Leadership effectiveness will also  be

taken into account as plans will remain as plans unless  they

are  properly executed.  My Ministry and SSC will  work  with

the NSAs towards this objective.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Ris, Mr Ong Kian Min, and Dr Wang

Kai  Yuen  have  raised the idea of a  Sports  School.   This

subject was also broached at the SSC@21 Sports Conference  in

January  this  year.  I am glad to inform Members  that  MCDS

will be working with the Ministry of Education to see how  we

can best make the idea of a Sports School a reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is prepared to consider funding such a school to a

similar  extent as it funds other secondary schools, provided

there   are   competent  organisations  willing  to   provide

additional  funding and see to the running and management  of

such a school.  MCDS will work closely with MOE on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also just announced a scheme whereby autonomous

schools  can  develop  different niche areas  of  excellence,

including  sports.   This  is one  way  to  establish  sports

excellence  in  schools.   In fact, some  of  our  mainstream

schools  already  make special provisions for  athletes.  For

example,  at  Anglican High School, I was  told  that  sports

persons  from different sports attend classes together  where

their  time-tables are scheduled to enable them to train  and

attend inter-school competitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of sports for community bonding, I am

pleased  to announce a new initiative mooted by the East-West

Cultural  Development  Centre, a non-profit  organisation  in

Singapore.  Under  the overall rubric of "Building  Community

through Sports", the proposed programmes seek to involve  the

community   in  sporting  events  as  much  as  possible   as

participants, spectators and also as sponsors.  One  proposal

that  we  are  studying is a series of inter-community  youth

games  between  the CDCs.  The games will have  a  youth  and

family focus and spectator involvement will be encouraged, by

placing  emphasis  on cheer leading teams, for  example.  The

support of local business community will be sought to further

the idea that corporations have an important role to play  in

sports development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these plans and priorities which I have outlined, I

am confident that MCDS



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>



is  on  the  right road to building a cohesive and  resilient

society.  But to achieve our desired outcomes, MCDS will need

the  cooperation of many agencies and sectors. We  need  also

active  citizens  who are prepared to do their  part.   I  am

confident  that  MCDS  and  Singapore  will  rise   to   this

challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the other questions raised by

Members.   Dr  Vasoo, Dr Lily Neo, Mdm Claire Chiang  and  Dr

Jennifer  Lee have been very passionate in their support  for

the  family.   I  agree  totally with them  that  the  family

remains the single most important stabilising pillar  of  our

society. It is an institution which is very important to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many Members have pointed out, our families are

changing.  They are facing stress and strains brought  on  by

changing  lifestyles and many of the social problems  we  now

face are more complex. Dual-income families, as mentioned  by

Dr Lily Neo, are now quite common in Singapore, especially as

our  women become better educated. For women aged  25  to  34

years,  the  group  most likely to have young  children,  the

married  female workforce participation rate has  risen  from

32.7% in 1979 to 52.1% in 1989, and again to 66.7% last year.

Trends  in  developed  countries are similar.   So,  to  help

families   cope  with  the  changing  social   and   economic

environment,  my  Ministry promotes both the  "hardware"  and

"software" programmes for families.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on "software". My Ministry works with

social  service agencies and self-help groups in many  public

education  programmes.  We will continue doing this  in  more

effective  ways with a view to reaching out to as many  types

of  audiences as possible.   And our key strategy  in  family

life  education  is for MCDS to provide a  resource  bank  of

messages, materials, trainers and to facilitate groups in the

community  and private sector to reach out to as many  people

as possible, particularly the so-called unconverted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for "hardware", my Ministry promotes care centres for

children,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>



students  and the elderly, family service centres  and  other

services to create an environment which supports but does not

supplant  the family's nurturing and care-giving roles.   And

we  agree  that schools are good locations for  student  care

centres, as mentioned earlier by either Mdm Claire Chiang  or

Dr  Jennifer  Lee.  And based on the survey conducted  by  my

Ministry,  indeed,  about 50% of parents using  student  care

centres share this view.  There are currently 22 student care

centres  in schools, and we are working with MOE to encourage

more  schools  to  set  up  student  care  centres  in  their

premises.   And  there is a fee subsidy scheme  for  children

from low income families who go to such centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has suggested that we co-locate childcare

services with social day care centres (SDCs) for the elderly.

Indeed,   my  Ministry  plans  to  co-locate  family  service

centres, childcare centres, student care centres and  elderly

care   centres  together  in  multi-service  centres  (MSCs).

Families would find these MSCs more convenient, as they  will

allow   the   various  service  providers  to   network   and

collaborate,  thus  bringing  about  synergies   in   service

provision.   Dr Neo's suggestion of "borrow a granny"  scheme

is  indeed  one innovation which can take place at  the  MSC.

The  Tampines East PCF, I am told, has tried out this concept

in   their   three-in-one  family  centre  with  considerable

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On maid sharing, the Ministry of Manpower has considered

such  a  scheme but found that it could create complications,

because  of the question of responsibility for looking  after

the welfare and housing of these foreign domestic workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many dual income families have maids, they need

not  necessarily be the only care providers.  The full  range

of  options  should be considered first. Given the importance

of  the early years in a child's development and in nurturing

of   strong  parent-child  bonds,  families  should  consider

whether or not both parents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>



should  work full-time during these critical years.  And,  of

course,  this  will  entail  some  material  sacrifices,  but

families  should re-examine their own priorities and consider

the  merits  of  having one or one and a half  income  during

these important years in their children's development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, dual income families could consider

involving the extended family, ie, parents, aunties,  uncles,

in  the  care of their children while the couple is at  work.

And  there  is also the option of the childcare  and  student

care centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCD agrees that having flexible work arrangement is

yet  another avenue to help parents balance work  and  family

commitments.   So  both  my  Ministry  and  the  Ministry  of

Manpower   support   the   adoption   of   flexible   working

arrangements.   It is inappropriate, however, for  Government

to  compel  companies  to  adopt prescribed  measures.   Work

processes  and worker profile vary across organisations,  and

employers must be given the flexibility to choose, and  being

prescriptive  will  give  rise to rigidities  in  the  labour

market  and  add  to the financial burden  of  the  companies

without necessarily meeting the needs of the employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a better approach would be to promote awareness and

recognition.   MCD  has  introduced a Family  Friendly  Award

(FFA)  in 1998 in collaboration with MOM, SNEF and the  NTUC.

And  we  are now conducting a survey on public attitudes  and

preferences  as  well  as producing publicity  and  education

materials on family-friendly practices, among other plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also urged that we change the mindset of

Singaporeans on the role of men in the family.  I would  like

to  draw  Members'  attention to the study on  the  Singapore

family  released  last year.  The study  found  that  78%  of

married  respondents agreed that "although  the  husband  may

help out, the wife is responsible for the housework."  And it

is  notable that more women than men held this view (85%  and

60%).   This  suggests that there are many  couples  who  are

quite comfortable with the traditional division



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>



of  roles in the family.  However, the same study also  found

that  younger couples are more likely to share household  and

parenting  duties.  We can encourage and educate  couples  to

share  household responsibilities, but I do not think  it  is

appropriate for the Government to insist on a change of roles

if the individuals are comfortable with them.  What roles the

husband  and wife would play must be left for them to decide.

We can only encourage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Dr Ho Tat Kin and Dr

Jennifer Lee have also asked about infant and child care.  My

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary, Mrs Yu-Foo, will answer  all

these questions on my behalf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to family life education. Both Mdm

Claire  Chiang  and  Dr  Jennifer Lee  had  called  for  more

targeted  and extensive parenting and family life  programmes

to  strengthen families and parents as carers.   My  Ministry

agrees   that   families  today,  especially  parents,   need

strengthening and support, both as nurturers of the young and

carers  of  the elderly.  Sir, this is no mean task  in  this

age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We work with VWOs and various civic organisations to

help  parents  at  different stages of their  parenting  life

cycle  in  their  nurturing  and  caring  functions,  eg,  by

organising   parenting   talks  and  distribution   of   age-appropriate resource materials, and producing video tapes and

pamphlets  for carers of the elderly.  We also encourage  and

promote support groups for parents and carers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD also adopts a multi-prong and multi-channel approach

based on the following four strategies:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Spearheading family life education and parenting

messages based on studies on family and parenting needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Coordinating and extending outreach by partnering

the  people  in  the  private sector in  the  production  and

distribution  of  family  life  and  parenting  messages  and

programmes.   This  enlarges the network and  customises  the

messages



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>



for  different target groups and brings the programmes closer

to the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Developing and sponsoring resource materials and

training  of  family life educators.  The resource  materials

for  parents are differentiated according to significant  age

groups  of  children,  eg,  pre-school,  primary  school  and

teenagers.  And we sponsor a graduate certificate  course  in

parent education conducted jointly by Swinburn University  of

Technology,  Australia, and the Family Resource and  Training

Centre here.  The number of graduates for 1998 and 1999  were

26 and 18 respectively.  Another class, I am told, will start

next   month.   The  Ministry  also  sponsors  training   and

management of parent support groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The fourth strategy is media activities organised

to  generate awareness and mass outreach.  We also  publicise

family  life  programmes in the press, radio, magazines,   at

bus stops and MRT stations and through our web site.  We also

have  new  initiatives  in the pipeline  which  includes  the

production  of  a  guide for family life educators,  and  the

title of the book is Learning About Parenting Young Children.

It  will  help  social work professionals and volunteers  who

conduct parenting programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also established a Central Repository of

training and resource materials, and we also organise regular

sharing  of  best practices among experts in the  field.   We

have   formalised  a  structured  comprehensive  family  life

education   delivery   system  by  appointing   family   life

ambassadors from all walks of life.  This was announced by my

Senior Parliamentary Secretary earlier in the week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also producing a Malay video tape to equip

divorcing   parents  with  effecting  parenting  skills   for

children affected by divorce called Anak Amanah Kita Bersama.

It  will be launched on 25th March and it will be screened at

the  Syariah Court and social service agencies.  My  Ministry

will be working on other language versions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, we will feature case studies and family

issues on TV along the lines of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>



the  popular series Extraordinary People, and supporting  the

Young  Parents  of the Year Award.  We will continue  to  pay

special  attention  to at-risk groups and we  partner  social

service agencies in this effort.  In this connection, I would

like  to  commend Dr Lee for initiating the programme Healthy

Style  for couples and families which her hospital identified

as  needing  special and closer help from social agencies  in

their parenting and family responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang would also be pleased to know that the

committee  on  the family has a work group on  parenting  and

another  on  stresses  on  the  family.   They  are  actively

reviewing  what  more can be done to strengthen  and  support

families and parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with both Dr Jennifer Lee and Mdm Chiang that

much  more can and should be done to create awareness and  to

educate  our  people on the importance of the family  as  the

basic building block of our society.  Given the wide spectrum

of  issues to be covered under family life education and  the

diverse groups of people we want to reach to, MCDS cannot  do

this on our own.  We must continue to engage and partner  the

public,  private  and  people sectors  in  our  efforts  and,

indeed,  we welcome feedback and suggestions on what and  how

we can best bring this message to our families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin asked about abandoned babies. Sir, the

truth  is  that  we do not know who the parents  are  in  the

majority  of cases of abandoned babies.  In the few instances

where  the parents are identified, they are not always  young

people,  as  commonly  perceived.  The  number  of  abandoned

babies  is actually small, ranging from 3-7 a year  over  the

last  five years.  Of these, the mothers of only seven babies

were traced, and only one of them was a teenager.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ho that public education on responsible

parenting is critical, and that is why my Ministry emphasises

continuous  family  life  public education  programmes  which

cover a variety of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>



topics  including  marriage  preparation,  parenting,  family

enrichment  as  well as effective parent-child communication,

especially  on  sensitive issues such as  teenage  sexuality.

For  the  young  people,  we need to tackle  the  problem  at

source,  ie,  parents must take the responsibility  to  spend

time with and instill the right values in their children, and

to  supervise and guide them wherever they can.  Some of  our

programmes  help parents to spot tell-tale signs  of  teenage

pregnancies  and  to  point  them  to  the  support  services

available in the event their children get into trouble.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, abandoning babies is against the law. That must be

established.  But while we do not want to encourage  children

born  out of wedlock, we also recognise the trauma that unwed

mothers  and their child face and their need for  support  in

their  plight.   This  is  why  we  provide  services  in  my

Ministry's  Child  Protection  and  Welfare  Service,  social

service agencies, or medical social workers at any Government

restructured hospital which the unwed mothers could  turn  to

for  help.  Arrangements can be made for the mothers to  stay

in  a  temporary  shelter pending delivery, if  she  requires

alternative accommodation.  Should the mother want to give up

her  baby,  the  Ministry will assist in adoption  placement.

Where the unwed mother is a teenager, the Ministry and social

service  agencies will generally work with the girl's parents

to provide the support and guidance needed by the girl.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho asked if my Ministry could consider a baby deposit

scheme   like  the  one  in  Hamburg,  which  the  newspapers

highlighted recently.  Sir, it must be clear that this option

is  akin  to  abandonment, albeit of a different nature.   We

note  the  different views among the Germans and  even  among

Singaporeans who read about this, and the views are  divided.

I would like to advocate a careful and closer study into this

before  we  adopt similar methods in Singapore.  There  is  a

need   to   look  holistically  at  the  social   issues   of

abandonment, the needs of the mother



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>



and  the  child, and the wider societal values  and  legality

involved.  I believe our current approach balances  the  need

to  preserve our traditional family values and the welfare of

both  the  unwed mother and child.   But we will continue  to

monitor the Hamburg scheme and we will keep our minds open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay and Dr Wang raised the issue of

marriage  and procreation and on the setting up of an  Inter-Ministry Committee.  I think I have already responded to this

point  in  my earlier speech, but I would like to  thank  the

Member for Bukit Timah, Dr Wang,  for his two suggestions  to

boost  fertility, ie, to consider additional  tax  incentives

for the third and fourth child and to teach our girls the joy

of  larger families.  I will pass on this suggestion  to  the

working committee to consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for family support services which Prof. Low has asked

about,  I  had earlier mentioned a number of them,  including

childcare  centres,  student  care  centres,  family  service

centres, and promoting family-friendly work places and family

life  programmes, such as parenting courses for  the  various

age groups.  My Ministry is committed to regularly review and

improve  these programmes and services to support individuals

and  families  in  making  life  decisions  such  as  getting

married, having children and the care and upbringing  of  our

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on sports now. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang had given

several  suggestions  on how we can make  Singapore  a  great

sporting  nation.   I  would like to thank  Mr  Yeo  for  his

suggestions  and my Ministry will certainly  take  his  views

into   consideration,  as  we  work  with  all  the  relevant

stakeholders  in the sports fraternity.  The  Sports  Council

also supports the idea of providing housing schemes for these

various  NSAs,  of both recreational and competitive  sports.

That is why we have given much support to provide a home  for

each  of  the  core and merit sports.  We have also  provided

some  accommodation for some active NSAs,  ie,  non-core  and

merit sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Council also provides office space at

subsidised rental rates to NSAs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>



However,  with the limited land and space that  we  have,  we

need to be realistic as well as pragmatic in our distribution

and  provision  of  such  resources.  Nevertheless,  we  will

continue  to  see  how  best we can  provide  NSAs  with  the

requisite facilities as our resources and manpower allow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin asked about careers in sports. Sir, one

of our strategies in making Singapore a sporting nation is to

ensure  that  we  have viable career options for  people  who

choose  to continue their interest in sports.  But  it  is  a

fact of life in Singapore that most parents and children give

their  priority  to education and to career  over  full  time

commitment to sports.  This is inevitable and understandable,

given the highly competitive environment we are in.  However,

we are encouraged that there is an increasing number of young

Singaporeans  who  are prepared to put  their  education  and

career on hold to achieve sports excellence and glory for the

country.   The  SSC  will nurture them and  provide  all  the

encouragement   and  support  to  help  them  achieve   their

aspirations,  including scholarships,  financial  and  future

career options and assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Council will help retiring athletes get

certification as coaches if they wish to, and  if  they  meet

the  standards.   For example, we have sent  Sheik  Allaudin,

through  a  scheme for national athletes, to attend  coaching

courses   under   the  National  Coaching  and  Accreditation

Programme  (NCAP).   He  has  earned  his  qualification  and

assumed  the  national coach's position.   As  Members  know,

footballers, Fandi Ahmad and Malek Awab, have also benefitted

from  this scheme.  SSC also provides career counselling  and

guidance.  But more can be done to develop a sports  industry

which  offers a career in sports and its related  fields.  We

will   continue to study and promote the development of  this

industry in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked for more grants to NSAs.

Sir,  although  SPEX  21 is targetted at  sports  with  medal

prospects  at  the  international  and  regional  games,  the

Singapore  Sports Council also funds other types  of  sports,

such as volley ball



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>



and other team sports. The Sports Associations of non-SPEX 21

sports   receive  between  $8,000  and  $120,000  per  annum,

depending on their annual programmes.  As Members know, funds

for  sports  promotion  are limited.   The  Singapore  Sports

Council has to be judicious in its allocation and will not be

able to meet the financial needs of all NSAs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be difficult to work on a ratio of 2:1 or

3:1 funding formula, as suggested by Mr Ang, because even the

core and merit sports under SPEX 21 only receive between one-third  and  two-thirds of their funding from SSCs,  and  they

would  have to source the remainder from corporate and  other

sponsors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min wanted to promote figure ice skating in

Singapore.  He has made two suggestions to promote figure ice

skating  both as a sport which we could excel  in  and  as  a

career  path for Singaporeans.  He has suggested  building  a

world  class ice skating rink for the promotion of the sport.

Currently,  we have two ice skating rinks.  In providing  for

world class facilities for promoting sports excellence and in

land  scarce  Singapore we have to be  mindful  of  the  many

competing  sporting  needs of our population.  Therefore,  we

will  have  to  be selective and promote certain  sports  for

excellence based on a set of criteria and put them under SPEX

21 programme.  At the moment, there are no strong reasons, to

my  mind,  to include figure ice skating as a sport we  could

excel in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second suggestion is for the Ministry of Education

to  encourage  students  to take up  ice  skating  as  a  co-curricular  activity. Again, MOE has no  immediate  plans  to

make  figure  ice skating a CCA in schools.  However,  pupils

who  take up the sport with an approved organisation can  get

CCA  bonus  points  as  provided  for  under  MOE's  recently

announced  scheme  to recognise approved  activities  outside

schools.   SSC  will  continue to work with  the  Figure  Ice

Skating  Association to develop and promote the  sport.   The

support for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>



sport  will  increase  correspondingly with  the  demand  and

popularity of the sport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo and Mdm Claire Chiang have spoken about the

need  to  give more help to the VWOs and for my  Ministry  to

review  the  funding  formula.  Under the  Government's  Many

Helping Hands approach to social services, my Ministry  works

very  closely with the VWOs, the National Council  of  Social

Service, which is the umbrella organisation of our VWOs,  and

increasingly now, with the CDCs, together as stakeholders  in

this  social  sector.   We complement each  other's  work  to

ensure  that  we  provide a responsive  and  seamless  social

service  delivery  system, and my Ministry  coordinates  this

effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VWOs have been receiving and will continue to receive

Government  funding  for capital and recurrent  funding.   We

are,  in  fact, reviewing our current funding policies.   The

review  will  also  consider how we can widen  the  range  of

services beyond meeting the basic needs so that those who are

prepared to pay for more services could have access to  them.

And  to  ensure that an increase in the funding will lead  to

better  standard and effectiveness of services,  we  will  be

looking into linking funding to outcomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like the VWOs to take responsibility for

maintaining  good  and  effective  service.    This  can   be

achieved  through training of VWO staff and board members  to

equip  them with better governance and management  skills  to

deliver a better standard of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS, in fact, has been planning and organising such

training  courses. Today, it has put together a  workshop  on

board  governance  which  provides  training  for  VWO  board

members  on good governnance skills and has also developed  a

Senior   Management  Development  Programme  which  will   be

implemented in due course.  The Executive Directors'  Network

has  also been set up to enable EDs to learn through  sharing

from  others  in  the  network.  NCSS is also  exploring  the

possibility of starting a Diploma Course in Non-Profit Sector

Management  with one of the local polytechnics as  well.   My

Ministry has also helped fund and saw to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>



the  setting up of the National Volunteers Centre (NVC).  The

NVC will strengthen the work of VWOs by linking volunteers to

VWOs and also training them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also actively involved in the effort to

enhance the role of CDCs when they take on the role of  local

administrator for community-based services.  By strengthening

the  links between VWOs and CDCs, they can capitalise on  the

outreach  capabilities that both parties have and there  will

also  be greater synergies in the use of scarce resources  in

the social sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang has also asked how much is enough and

who  is  funded to do what.   Last year, we spent $58,736,210

on  non-health related social services, such as services  for

the  aged, disabled, the families and children.  I think  the

issue  is less on whether funding from Government is  enough,

but  rather whether we have a system in place that  tries  to

ensure  that  no  one who should be helped  is  left  totally

neglected,  whether  by  the Government  or  by  the  various

partners  in society.  The social service sector is  not  the

sole  responsibility of the Government and each of us  has  a

part  to play in ensuring that we indeed live up to our ideal

to be a caring and gracious society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang also quoted yesterday a case study of the

Bukit  Ho Swee Social Service Centre.  I would like to  point

out that the Centre did not approach my Ministry to develop a

second  FSC.   What  happened was it  was  working  with  the

central CDC to develop a youth centre, and when that did  not

materialise, it planned to relocate its social service centre

to  another site, so that the existing site can be  used  for

the proposed youth centre instead.  My Ministry, as you know,

funds  new FSCs, but not the relocation of existing  centres,

especially where we feel the existing locations are  good  or

ideal.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng moaned the fact that the young are not

coming up to volunteer and only the old volunteers remain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not surprising that there are more elderly

people  involved in volunteer activity than the young people,

because those above 60 years of age are likely to be retirees

who  may  have  more  time  and less competing  demands  than

younger  people.  However, this does not mean that we  should

not  encourage more young people to be active volunteers.   I

agree with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the NCSS had worked out jointly to set

up,  which I mentioned earlier, the National Volunteer Centre

(NVC)   in  December  last  year,  and  this  is  to  promote

volunteerism  as a way of life among Singaporeans.   The  NVC

will  try  to match volunteers of all ages with the voluntary

organisations  that meet their interests.  In  addition,  the

centre  would train volunteer leaders and volunteers so  that

they  can  be  better equipped to carry out  their  voluntary

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also believe in exposing our people to volunteer

activity from young, to inculcate in them an instinct  to  be

responsible for and to contribute to the community they  live

in.  One good example is the Community Involvement Programme,

or  CIP,  which involves every primary, secondary and  junior

college  student,  and  the centralised  institute  students,

launched  in  October  1997  by the  Ministry  of  Education.

Certainly, MCDS will continue to explore ways to attract even

more younger people to volunteer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Harun Ghani asked whether there could be another

mosque  in Jurong West.  Under the Mosque Building Programme,

one  mosque  is built in one new HDB new town.  He  mentioned

earlier  the  DGP criterion of 20,000 dwelling  units.   Sir,

there  is already a mosque, which is the Al-Mukminin  Mosque,

in  Jurong East and the Assyakirin Mosque in the Jurong  West

New Town.  There is therefore no plan to build another mosque

under the project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the increasing demand, the Assyakirin

Mosque   in  Jurong  West  will  be  redeveloped,   and   the

redevelopment  project will begin from the third  quarter  of

this  year,  and is expected to complete in year 2002.   Once

completed, the new mosque will have a larger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>



capacity  from  the  existing 2,600 square  metres  to  4,500

square  metres.   If  there is a need, MUIS  will  conduct  a

review of the Mosque Building Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang spoke at length about empowering

people  with disabilities, and she mentioned BizLink.  People

with disabilities can approach BizLink for jobs.  The centre,

which was set up in 1986, acts as a central body for the  job

placement of people with disabilities.  The centre is jointly

funded  by  my  Ministry and the National Council  of  Social

Service  and  currently  it has a  job  bank  of  over  1,700

employers.   It  not only looks out for new job opportunities

but  also  provides follow-up services and support  to  those

placed in employment to help them remain employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from BizLink, there are also other avenues which

exist for people with disabilities, for example, several VWOs

help  their  clients find jobs.  And people with disabilities

can  also register with the Ministry of Manpower's Deployment

Department  or  online with MOM's Internet  job  system.   My

Ministry  and the NCSS are reviewing the employment placement

system  for  people with disabilities to see how  it  can  be

further  improved, including whether there is scope for  more

dedicated VWOs to complement what BizLink is doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BizLink is already engaged in raising public awareness

of  the employment potential of people with disabilities.  It

telemarkets, for example, to potential employers and their HR

departments   for  available  jobs,  and  visits  prospective

employers  to  present what BizLink and its clients  have  to

offer  them.   It  also  taps  existing  employers  from  its

database  to  see if they have new openings and  avenues  for

BizLink's  clients.   BizLink also  provides  free  technical

advice  to employers on workplace modifications, if they  are

needed,   to  accommodate  the  disabled,  and  monitor   the

adaptation  of  clients  in  their  workplace.   Apart   from

feedback, BizLink also visits the workplace to find  out  how

clients are coping in their work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank Mdm Claire Chiang for her

suggestion on encouraging more employers to open up more jobs

and for an employment bulletin to publicise work openings for

people with disabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM, in fact, is currently helping to urge employers to

recognise  that  some  people with  disabilities  can  be  as

capable  as any worker.  My Ministry and NCSS will study  the

suggestion  put forward by the NMP earlier in the  review  of

the  employment placement system, and will discuss  with  MOM

where there are synergies to be got from working together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the issue of ageing. Dr Lily Neo and

Mr  Ang  Mong Seng both talked about co-location of eldercare

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is preparing an Eldercare Services Masterplan for

the  next  five  years  until 2005.   A  key  focus  of  this

Masterplan is the setting up of Multi-Service Centres  (MSCs)

to  cater for all age groups at the local level.  This is  to

allow  Community  Development Councils (CDCs)  to  administer

community-based social services, and where possible, the MSCs

will  be co-located at Community Clubs to make better use  of

land and other common resources.  MCDS would also work out  a

regional  masterplan of services for the next five  years  to

guide  the  CDCs  in  the  provision of  eldercare  services,

tailored to local needs.  A network of Activity Centres  will

also  be  set  up  around  these MSCs  as  focal  points  for

volunteerism  in the community and where the elderly  can  be

engaged  to help other elderly in need.  The Activity Centres

are  modelled after our existing Senior Activity Centres  for

the  low-income elderly.  However, the Activity Centres would

cater to the needs of the elderly in the wider community, and

not just the low-income.  Thus, my Ministry's plan is similar

to what Dr Neo described and had in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to caution against overly

unrealistic  expectations.  Our pace  of  ageing  would  only

increase from 2010 onwards.  Therefore building Multi-Service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>



Centres  immediately for every constituency  might  be  over-providing   infrastructure  and  straining   our   resources.

Instead, we will embark on a programme to build Multi-Service

Centres for the long term whilst continuing to facilitate the

setting  up  of eldercare services where there  are  specific

demands and needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng has asked about subsidies to be given to

senior  citizens  for  elderly day care centres  operated  by

private companies or cooperatives, and services in the studio

apartments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the Masterplan for Eldercare Services,

we  are  also determining how we can incentivise the  private

sector and cooperatives to provide eldercare services for our

citizens.    We   will   take  Mr   Ong's   suggestion   into

consideration  in  drawing up our framework.   Such  Activity

Centres will indeed be set up in studio apartments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen talked about the uniform age for

defining  "senior citizen" for benefits.  Mr  Ang  Mong  Seng

also spoke about full day concessionary bus fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is now no common age to determine when one is

or  is  not  a  "senior  citizen", in order  to  qualify  for

benefits, as various organisations are free to determine  how

generous  or restrictive they are willing to be.  Also,  some

of the operations that stipulate a certain age to qualify for

benefits  as  a senior citizen, such as bus concessions,  are

private commercial concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our life expectancy increases, what would be

considered "senior" now could also creep upwards in  time  to

come.   We would rather prefer to leave the cut-off  age  for

dispensation  of  benefits  to the respective  organisations.

For  the purpose of compiling statistics and policy planning,

however,  we  have used 60 years and above  in  the  past  to

define   "senior   citizens".   We  have  now   adopted   the

international  norm  of defining "senior citizens"  as  those

aged  65  years  and  above, so that we  can  compare  across

countries  for  policy analysis and planning,  and  also  for

comparison of situations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMC on the Ageing Population has supported the call

on  bus  operators to consider extending concessionary travel

rates  for senior citizens for the whole day.  However,  this

is  a proposal for bus operators to consider, and bearing  in

mind  that  being  public  listed companies,  they  are  also

accountable to their shareholders.  So it would  have  to  be

their decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of elder-friendly features raised by Mr Ang

Mong  Seng, the IMC has recommended "ageing-in-place" as  the

guiding  policy for our environment.  This means that  elder-friendly  features should be included in our housing  estates

and  the  transport  system as part  of  the  infrastructure,

including  elder-friendly lifts, ramps and other features  to

make  our environment "barrier-free" for our senior citizens.

These features will be gradually put in place as we build our

new estates, and upgrade the older ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin spoke about eldercare leave and programmes

to help change mindsets as well as to prepare the elderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, eldercare leave was one of the suggestions proposed

during  the feedback sessions in the deliberations  with  the

IMC.   However, this is a proposal for companies to  consider

as  part of the benefits package that they provide for  their

employees.  I agree that changing of mindset is essential not

only  for the population, for the younger ones, but also  for

the senior citizens themselves.  But this requires collective

effort  and  my Ministry is working with VWOs to  draw  up  a

public  education  programme or plan to  address  this.   For

example,  some  VWOs  conduct  seminars  to  help  the  young

understand  and  communicate  with  their  aged  parents  and

grandparents.   This  will allow the young  and  the  old  to

better understand and communicate with each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers from various VWOs also regularly visit the

elderly who are living alone.  For those elderly who wish  to

equip  themselves with relevant skills, the Senior  Citizen's

Division   in   People's  Association  organizes   continuing

education  classes on a variety of topics  in  the  community

clubs.  To help our younger people to prepare themselves  for

old age, my Ministry is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>



working   with  the  Civil  Service  College  on  a  training

programme  for  civil servants.  We hope to  share  with  the

private  sector employers a similar programme, perhaps  at  a

later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are now 17 day care rehabilitation centres

and 14 social day centres.  We have plans to set up more such

centres  over  the next few years, as part of  our  Eldercare

Services  Masterplan.  There are already guidelines on  these

centres and the guidelines will be progressively enhanced  to

ensure good service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Lily Neo spoke on financing for step-down

care.   Arising from the IMC's recommendations, I am informed

that  the  Ministry of Health is studying a Severe Disability

Insurance,  or SDI, scheme to protect against the high  costs

of  care required by those with serious disabilities and  are

unable  to perform normal activities of daily living  without

considerable help from other people.  So it is being  studied

and MOH will have to decide on this.



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked that the SDI scheme covers

medical  expenses  of  a  chronic  nature  incurred  in   the

outpatient  setting.   I  am  not  too  sure  whether  it  is

meaningful to cover such expenses because the treatments  are

generally  affordable  and are not  low  probability  events.

Treatment  for  chronic  illnesses,  such  as  diabetes   and

hypertension, is heavily subsidised at Government polyclinics

and  public  hospitals.  And Singapore citizens aged  55  and

above  already  enjoy a 50% fee concession at the  Government

polyclinics.  They are thus generally already affordable.  At

the  same  time, these chronic illnesses are more  prevalent,

making  the  premiums  for  such insurance  cover  very  much

higher.   So,  in the end, the elderly might  be  better  off

saving the money from the premiums to pay for the treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I share Dr Neo's concern that inappropriate use of

medical facilities will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2328</b></font><br><br>



lead  to  unnecessary  healthcare cost  increases.   However,

whether  a  patient  ought  to  be  cared  for  in  hospital,

community facility, or in his own family, should depend  only

on his medical condition.  The decision has to be made by the

doctor  and  not  by  the patient.  Those  who  face  genuine

difficulty  in  paying for their outpatient medical  expenses

could  apply  for  their  fees to  be  waived  at  Government

polyclinics.   And  needy  Singaporeans  who  attend   public

hospital's  specialist  outpatient  clinics  may  apply   for

Medifund  assistance  and  no  Singaporean  will  be   denied

essential  healthcare services because of their inability  to

pay.   Hence,  Dr  Neo's fear of patients  abusing  inpatient

facilities for the sake of using Medisave or MediShield  does

not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the Ministry of Health has

got the ECU (Elderly Care Unit), whereas my Ministry runs the

EDD  or  the  Elderly Development Division,  and  as  he  has

rightly pointed out, they run different services.  People are

confused.  MCD runs social day care centres, for example,  we

run social activities and MOH runs other centres which have a

higher  health  care content.  I agree with the  Member  that

sometimes the public are also confused about where to go, and

sometimes  they  run  from one type  of  centre  to  another,

depending on the status and condition of their health.  We at

MCD  are also concerned about this overlap and confusion  and

separation  of roles which are not really clear  for  certain

cases.  We certainly agree with the IMC's recommendations and

we  are  looking  into  it to see how  this  problem  can  be

resolved between MOH and ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification

from the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Harun has the floor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani:</b> Sir, point of clarification for

the  Minister.  The Assyakirin Mosque is meant for the people

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>



are  residing  or living in Taman Jurong and the  Al-Mukminin

Mosque  is  for those who are living in Toh Guan  and  Jurong

East.   So  there is no mosque around Jurong  West,  and  the

number of dwelling units there is more than 20,000.  For  his

information, we have about 65,000 units.  Could the  Minister

explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, as pointed out by the Member,

the  DGP criterion is actually 20,000, and our plan is  based

on 20,000 dwelling units for one mosque to be built.  This is

what  the  DGP allows us to do.  It does not place  a  higher

population ceiling for each mosque.  Anyway, Sir, as  I  have

responded  earlier,  if  necessary,  MUIS  will  review   the

criteria for a mosque to be built in a constituency and  also

the   ratio  for  the  number  of  dwelling  units  in   each

constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, in his reply just now, the

Minister  appears  to be very compassionate  and  sympathetic

towards unwed mothers.  I would like to ask him whether he is

aware  of  lodging  problems  faced  by  unwed  mothers  with

children,  and  whether he would persuade the  HDB  to  allow

unwed  mothers with children to apply directly to HDB  for  a

flat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, this is for HDB to respond,

but  certainly,  if  you  are talking  about  unwed  mothers,

especially those unwed mothers who are about to deliver their

babies, there are at least two VWOs which run such homes.  In

other  words,  they can go to these homes  to  deliver  their

babies  and  they  will help on how the babies  ought  to  be

either  adopted  or to be kept within the family.   But  with

regard  to  whether HDB will provide accommodation for  unwed

mothers, I think he has to approach HDB.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that it

is  not  only the part on delivery, but also bringing up  the

children.   Very  often,  these  unwed  mothers  face  family

pressures in between, so they have problems of living  within

the family, and if they are going to live with their friends,

they  are going to face uncertainty over accommodation.   The

question  is  how do they have a permanent home for  them  to

bring up the child?  They face this problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2330</b></font><br><br>



and  the  HDB  will not allow them to apply  directly  for  a

rental  flat.  Since the Minister is so sympathetic, I  would

appreciate  it if he could persuade the HDB because  we  have

asked the question but HDB did not allow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>: I can have a word with the

National Development Ministry.  But, Sir, we must be careful.

The  HDB  has  got very valid reasons for insisting  on  that

policy.   We  want  to  be compassionate  to  unwed  mothers,

especially  when children are concerned and babies  are  also

involved.   But we must also consider the kind of  signal  we

will  be  sending to the community in terms of how we condone

having  babies  out  of wedlock.  We have to  consider  this.

Compassion is one thing.  I agree that we have to think about

how  we could save the baby, or we could do as much as we can

for  the  baby, but we also have to look, if not through  the

HDB way, perhaps at some other ways.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister on the multi-service centres. What kind of fund allocation has been

provided  for them?  Earlier on, the Minister might have  got

me  wrong.   I  did not ask for such centres  to  be  set  up

immediately island-wide, but could I just have the  timeframe

of what kind of numbers will that be in the end.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I am afraid I cannot give the

Member any details because, as I mentioned earlier, we are in

the  midst  of  preparing our five-year  plan  on  this.   As

regards the exact timing, I am afraid I cannot tell her  now.

But I agree with her sentiment that we ought not to build all

these  centres simultaneously.  In fact, we cannot  do  that.

How much we will put aside to build these centres and what is

the  programme  will  be the very subject  that  we  have  to

discuss when coming up with our plan.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon):</b> Sir, I thank

Dr Lily Neo, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Dr Jennifer Lee and Dr Ho Tat

Kin   for  their  keen  support  for  more  better  childcare

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare is indeed a key family support service and has

become all the more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2331</b></font><br><br>



important  with  the increase in the numbers  of  dual-income

families  in  Singapore.   MCD  promotes  childcare  services

through  a three-pronged strategy - ensuring availability  of

childcare  places,  promoting quality  care  and  maintaining

affordability.   I  would  therefore  take   some   time   in

responding  to the hon. Members' questions on the  supply  of

childcare  centres, childcare standards and  their  continued

affordability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang had asked about the

supply of childcare centres.  My Ministry has come a long way

in  meeting  the demand for this very important service.   In

1980, there were only 25 childcare centres in Singapore.  The

number has increased 20-fold to 535 today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has first encouraged voluntary welfare

organisations and subsequently commercial operators to set up

childcare   centres.  The  Ministry  has   ceased   operating

childcare  centres  way back in 1979.  Today,  about  60%  of

childcare places are provided by commercial operators.   They

are  able  to  set  up freely as long as  they  meet  minimum

standards.  We are therefore able to harness market forces to

guide supply towards demand.  MCD facilitates the process but

childcare industry is primarily market-driven.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pure market mechanism is unable to operate

effectively  at  HDB estates, due to a shortage  of  suitable

commercial  property space for childcare centres,  Government

allows  the  use of void decks for use as childcare  centres.

In new HDB estates, MCD plans ahead of demand through regular

meetings  with  HDB.  This allows childcare  premises  to  be

built  together  with  the housing  blocks.   For  other  HDB

estates,  MCD increases the number of centres in high  demand

areas  that we identify through waiting lists, feedback  from

the ground, including MPs' feedback, and other data.  We also

monitor closely the number of children born each year so that

we  can  plan  ahead.   Our development  plans  include  both

commercial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>



and  non-profit operators.  Non-profit operators can approach

us  to  propose sites and MCD would work with them to set  up

their centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 2000, MCD expects nearly 49 new childcare

centres, increasing childcare places by about 3,300 or 8%  in

this financial year.  Over the next three years, this rate of

development will mean an increase in capacity of about 20%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang was also concerned about the childcare

development at Sengkang and Punggol.  Included in these plans

are  Sengkang and Punggol.  Today, Sengkang has six childcare

centres.   Over the next three years, around 30 new childcare

centres  will  be set up.  Punggol is a new  estate  that  is

still   under  development.   We  have  already  planned   10

childcare centres over the next two years in line with  HDB's

building programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee has suggested that childcare centres

also  take in children under 18 months.  Any childcare centre

can  do so as long as they comply with our minimum standards.

The  same  childcare  subsidy  is  extended.  Most  childcare

centres  however  prefer not to take  in  children  under  18

months  as  they require much more care and attention.   Many

child  experts agree that the first few years  of  a  child's

life  are  important for parent-child bonding  and  are  best

cared  for  at home.  There is also the concern that  centre-based  care  may expose the young infant to cross-infections.

Granting  higher subsidies for children under 18 months  will

send  the  wrong signal that parents should put the child  in

centres at such a tender age.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo observed that some centres have long waiting

lists.   But  double  counting is common  in  waiting  lists,

causing  the lists to be inflated by about 30%. For  example,

some  parents  place  a  child on the waiting  list  of  many

centres.   Today,  we have about 45,000 childcare  places  in

Singapore. There are, in fact, more vacancies than demand  at

the national level. Even so, a waiting list exists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>



because   some  parents  are  choosy  and  due  to  localised

shortages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate better matching of supply and demand, my

Ministry  will be delegating the local planning of  childcare

centres  to Community Development Councils (CDCs) later  this

year, starting with the Marine Parade and Tanjong Pagar CDCs.

CDCs, being closer to community, are better able to gauge and

respond to local demand.  MCD will continue to project demand

for  and  plan  the  supply  of child-care  services  at  the

national  level,  and  focus  on  licensing  to  ensure  that

acceptable standards are met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo had asked about childcare centres in the

private  sector.  I am pleased to inform Dr Neo that  besides

promoting  the  setting up of childcare  centres  at  private

residential  areas,  we also encourage childcare  centres  in

condominiums.    URA  levies  development  charges   at   the

residential  rate, instead of commercial rate, for  childcare

centres in condominiums.  In addition, URA lately also lifted

restrictions requiring such centres to serve residents  only.

That  means, they are also open to outsiders. These  measures

will  reduce  the cost of setting up and running  child  care

centres in condominiums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Dr Ho Tat Kin and Dr Jennifer Lee for their

support  for  the  steps my Ministry  has  taken  to  require

diploma  training for childcare supervisors.  As  Dr  Ho  has

rightly  pointed out, there is increasing evidence indicating

the  importance of a child's early years. To  quote  a  World

Bank publication, "It is well established scientifically that

the   early   years   are  critical  in  the   formation   of

intelligence, personality and social behaviour."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD has licensed childcare centres for more than 10

years.  MCD  has also an established training system  whereby

childcare workers can upgrade from a Basic level certificate,

through   the  Intermediate  level,  to  an  Advanced   level

certificate.  This  system has served us  well.  Today,  most

staff in our childcare centres are trained. About 80% of  our

childcare  centre  supervisors  have  already  attained   the

advanced level of training or higher.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with 60% of each cohort of our students being

tertiary-educated, tapping on the certificate level group  of

each  cohort  is  not  enough given the importance  of  early

childhood  education.  Hence, MCD will require all  childcare

supervisors  to be diploma trained in five years'  time.   In

addition, we are also targeting for each centre to  have  one

teacher   trained   at  the  diploma  level.   This   diploma

requirement has not been introduced in isolation.  Many other

complementary steps have also been taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD issues a set of guidelines last year so that only

diplomas awarded by training agencies that meet our standards

will  be  recognised. We have worked with training  agencies,

such as Ngee Ann Polytechnic and the training arm of the NTUC

Childcare,  to  provide  a range of  diploma  programmes  for

different target groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary school-leavers were able, for the first time

last  year,  to  take a Diploma in Early Childhood  Care  and

Education offered jointly by Ngee Ann Polytechnic and  NTUC's

training  arm.   There  are also specially  designed  diploma

courses   which  allow  in-service  childcare  personnel   to

upgrade.    Even  diploma  and  degree  holders  from   other

disciplines will soon have a post-graduate diploma course  to

help them switch to the early childhood field.   In addition,

we have arranged for funding from the Skills Development Fund

(SDF),  as  well as the NTUC's Skills Redevelopment Programme

(SRP) to help to defray these training costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, childcare teachers must have an intermediate

certificate level of training in early childhood. We have  no

plans  to  raise  this requirement in the  immediate  future.

However,  teachers  and supervisors alike are  encouraged  to

upgrade  continually in a spirit of life-long  learning.  MCD

has  been  working  with the Association of  Early  Childhood

Educators,  Singapore  (AECES) to raise  professionalism  and

expertise in the early childhood field. From time to time, we

jointly  organise  seminars  and  workshops  to  share   best

practices across the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho also mentioned about normalising standards. Sir,

normalising standards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>



means   requiring  all  childcare  centres  to  have  similar

standards  and level of service. We prefer to set  a  minimum

standard  for all centres. Centres wishing to upgrade  beyond

minimum  standards  are encouraged to do so  and  many  have.

This  approach  gives  parents  flexibility  and  variety  of

choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvements are also in store for MCD's licensing

system. My Ministry has developed a more effective system  to

evaluate  the  quality of childcare centres  to  ensure  that

unacceptable care practices are detected and corrected early.

This system will be implemented in the next few months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also be introducing a new web-based

computer  system that will link up all childcare  centres  to

MCD  electronically.   This will improve  efficiency  and  my

Ministry's  ability  to track standards in  centres.  Parents

will  also be able to search for centres nearest their homes,

to  register  with any childcare centre on-line,  and  access

basic  information of childcare centres, like  opening  hours

and fees.  MCD will announce more details of this system at a

later date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to affordability, Dr Jennifer Lee was concerned

that childcare fees might rise if centres have to pay more to

attract  better qualified staff.  Based on data  gathered  in

1998,   the  average  salary  of  diploma  trained  childcare

supervisors   was  about  $2,300  and  that  for  non-diploma

supervisors was $1,700.  In comparison, the average  starting

pay of a polytechnic graduate, that is, across all fields  of

study,  is about $1,400. The average pay of all workers  with

post-secondary education, including polytechnic graduates and

those from JCs, is about $2,400. As you can see, the pay that

childcare supervisors are getting today is already similar to

that of diploma holders elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry had examined the impact of its higher

diploma  requirements on fees and found that the increase  is

unlikely  to  be significant.  Currently, about  40%  of  our

centres  already  have  at least one  staff  trained  at  the

diploma level.  A centre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>



without a diploma-trained supervisor is expected to pay about

$600  more  to  attract a diploma-trained supervisor.  For  a

typical centre with 75 children, this translates to about $8,

2% more per child per month. The timeframe for implementation

of  the  diploma requirement is five years. This rise  would,

therefore, be spread over a five-year period. The  impact  is

therefore  minimal  and is a small price to  pay  for  higher

standards.   MCD  monitors  the  affordability  of  childcare

centres closely. Dr Lily Neo would be glad to know that we do

not control fees.  Rather, we employ a range of strategies to

maintain affordability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD's plans to increase the supply of childcare centres

is  an  important factor in fanning competition  which  keeps

childcare  fees in check.  The childcare subsidy for  working

mothers  at  $150  per  month for full-day  also  helps  make

childcare affordable for many families. Each year, about  $60

million is given out. Low-income families may also apply  for

additional  financial assistance which are means-tested.  The

schemes  help low-income families pay both the monthly  fees,

as  well as initial start-up costs, such as uniforms and  fee

deposit.   MCD also allows an extension of childcare  subsidy

of up to 9 months to mothers who are affected by retrenchment

and  single  fathers  who are in financial  hardships.   Some

centres provide additional subsidies to low-income families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this wide range of fee assistance schemes, my

Ministry  does not feel that it is necessary to increase  the

childcare  subsidy at this stage. My Ministry, however,  does

agree  with  Dr  Jennifer  Lee  that  these  fees  assistance

schemes,  like all such schemes under MCD, must  be  reviewed

regularly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to my colleague, Mr Sin Boon Ann, who talked

about  marriage to foreigners.  I would like to thank Mr  Sin

for  raising  this  issue.  With globalisation,  there  would

certainly   be  more  marriages  involving  foreigners.   The

majority  of such marriages are successful and happy.   There

will,  of course, be instances of unscrupulous foreign grooms

and brides.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>



But  marriage is a very personal decision and  it  is  up  to

Singaporeans  to think wisely and choose their partners  with

their eyes open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know, in reality, love is sometimes blind.

The  greatest prevention against a bad marriage  is  marriage

preparation.  That is why my Ministry encourages  couples  to

attend  marriage preparation classes.  MCD works with  Family

Service  Centres  and social service agencies  to  run  these

classes.  These classes help couples share more deeply  about

themselves, discuss their expectations of each other and deal

with  differences and potential conflict before the marriage.

Grassroots  organisations can work with MCD to organise  such

courses  for their residents. For example, the Sembawang-Hong

Kah  CDC  organised a marriage preparation programme for  its

residents last month.  If Singaporean overseas clubs are also

interested  in  organising marriage preparation  courses  for

Singaporeans  stationed overseas, they can approach  MCD  for

advice.  Couples  encountering problems during  marriage  are

also  encouraged to consult social work professionals in  the

Family Service Centres and social service agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin said that there are some cases where

Singaporean  men are cheated by their foreign wives  who  use

marriage as a means to get rich.  They may abuse the  Women's

Charter for this purpose.  However, the Women's Charter  also

protects men when their matrimonial assets are divided  in  a

divorce.   If the wife is not taking their marriage seriously

and  contributes little to their marriage and family, she  is

not  likely  to  get  away  with a large  proportion  of  the

husband's assets easily.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> I would like to thank the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary for her  answer.   Would  the

Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  please  tell  us  how   the

Ministry  is  able  to determine that the  majority  of  such

marriages are happy?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Sir, I did ask my officers this

question  and according to the figures on divorces,  most  of

the marriages



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>



so  far  are  still intact. There were only a few  cases  who

filed for divorce among this group of couples.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Sir, I would like to thank both Dr Lily Neo

as  well as Mdm Claire Chiang for their support on the  CDCs.

In  fact, they are so confident in the CDC concept that  they

have  been  asking CDCs to do more.  As you have  heard,  the

Minister  as well as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  have

both  announced that CDCs will indeed do more, starting  from

Marine Parade as well as Tanjong Pagar.



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to recapitulate what CDC is all about in response

to  Mdm Claire Chiang's point.  CDC is, in fact, a Government

programme  to  facilitate the development  of  heartware,  in

order  to  enhance  social  cohesion  as  well  as  community

bonding.   This  is  done  by empowering  the  community,  by

encouraging  more  community  self-help  effort  as  well  as

through  greater  community involvement.  In  doing  so,  the

community  feels more stake in CDC's work.  And by organising

themselves  to help themselves, the community  will  be  more

energised and more active.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, the implication is that there will be more

consultation,  and more discussion amongst the community,  to

solve community issues.  There will be less and less cases of

imposition  from  management of  the  CDC,  because  the  CDC

management is really under the influence and control  of  the

local community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, I agree with Mdm Claire Chiang that officials

will  need  to be more people orientated, behaving less  like

bureaucrats.   There  should  be  more  service   orientation

towards the community, as PS21 says.  I have indeed talked to

a  few Administrative Officers who have been seconded to  the

CDC  as  general managers.  All told me that it was  a  very,

very good experience.  They have learned a lot, but they  are

still  learning.  If the general managers, as  administrative

officers, are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>



still  learning,  then  the rest of  the  officers  are  also

learning.   Let us not forget that the CDC is still  new.   I

will  acknowledge that there is still a lot  to  learn.   But

give us a little bit more time.   Give us more work.  We will

learn. We will improve.  Things will be better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also acknowledge that there is a need to do more

to  enable  the  grassroots  organisations  as  well  as  the

voluntary  organisations and the CDC to  communicate  better.

This is a never-ending task, because these set-ups are all so

different.   Their  working style and  their  approaches  are

different.   But is that not the point?  That  when  we  talk

about team work, we are talking about getting people who  are

very different to work towards a common goal?  And because of

the  differences,  all contribute their strength  and,  as  a

result, we achieve synergy.  And through synergy, we do more.

Grassroots  organisations have very  good  reach.   They  can

reach the community.  But they are relatively less skilled in

handling,    for   example,   social   problems.    Voluntary

organisations, on the other hand, have a lot of enthusiasm, a

lot of expertise, but they do not have good grassroots reach.

But  getting  both to work together, we will have  expertise,

enthusiasm as well as grassroots reach.  We acknowledge  that

we  need time to get to know each other better. However, I am

not  so  sure  the  correct approach is to ask  the  National

Community   Leadership   Training   Institute   to   organise

conferences involving many.  I think it would help  to  start

with.   However, in the longer run, it is more important  for

voluntary organisations, the grassroots organisations and the

CDC  to  arrange  on their own to talk to each  other.   They

should recognise that they have to work together.  They  have

a  common  objective of serving the residents.   They  should

just get on with working with each other.  In the process  of

working with each other, they would communicate more and they

would be able to do better as a team.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mdm Claire Chiang and Dr Lily Neo have made

suggestions on what CDCs should do.  For example, Dr Lily Neo

mentioned that CDC should pick up the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>



tab for medical screening for everybody, especially the poor,

and  that  the CDCs should subsidise Centres of Activity  for

Retired and Elderly (CARE).  Mdm Claire Chiang suggested that

the   CDCs  should  look  into  the  setting  up  of  virtual

neighbourhoods  for senior citizens.  Since  I  said  earlier

that the style of CDCs was consultation, the Ministry and the

People's Association could not impose all these on the  CDCs.

Hence  I  will  pass  the suggestions  on  to  the  CDCs  for

consideration.   But  let  me  also  give  some   preliminary

comments.  On virtual neighbourhood, I do not understand  why

we  want  the old people to talk to each other over the  Net.

Is  it  not  better to encourage them to come out, meet  each

other  face to face and talk?  So I think we should  continue

to  work on our senior citizens' activity programmes, instead

of  just encouraging more virtual neighbourhoods.  I  do  not

think  it  is  very healthy for the senior citizens  if  they

spend all their time on the Net.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards picking up the tab for the health screening

of  the  poor, let me also say that the Minister  for  Health

yesterday announced that the screening costs only $5 to  each

resident  -  above 55.  $5 nowadays can only buy a  ballpoint

refill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is for a Mont Blanc refill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I understand Parker refill is about

$5.  Mont Blanc refill is $7.50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the small fee is a reminder that all of us have

a  stake in our health.  I do not think we should just expect

somebody  to  pick up the tab for our health  screening.   We

must be responsible for our health.  So we must pay something

towards health screening.  But I would accept that for  those

who  cannot  even afford $5, perhaps the CDC  could  consider

picking up the tab.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if the CDCs were set up for

cohesion and bonding of residents, why must the head of a CDC

be  a Mayor?  It is such an awesome position.  I think it  is

difficult for people to be close together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I think we did say that we wanted to

develop the CDC into a local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>



administration.  We need somebody to be accountable for CDC's

activities and programmes.  Since Government money  is  going

to  be  channelled  towards the CDCs to run  local  services,

somebody  ought  to be accountable for how public  money  was

spent.  Therefore, there should be somebody who is called the

Mayor  to be accountable for all these.  Having said that,  I

think  we have also talked about CDC's working style and  the

Mayor's working style.  I do not think the working style is a

very  awesome one.  In fact, our two Mayors spend  a  lot  of

time  meeting  people, encouraging residents to  support  and

come  for community self-help activities.  We read all  these

in  the  press.   I  must say I have not heard anyone  saying

that our Mayors are awesome characters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Vasoo, there is no bonus time.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, thank you very much

for allowing me to end the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for his reply

and  for  providing us the future direction of his  Ministry.

However,  I  would like to urge the Minister to persuade  his

Cabinet colleagues to review family policies, because many of

these family policies are at the moment segmented.  There are

too  many captains playing in the family field, each  playing

their own game, to some extent.  But I think there is a  need

to have a recess, so that we can get them to come together to

review   family  policies  and  to  come  up  with   a   more

comprehensive plan to help families to be stronger.  I  think

the  Minister would have to persuade them and maybe they need

a  directive from the Prime Minister to really look at it.  I

am   very  serious  because  family  policies  need   to   be

strengthened.  Various players are playing, like the Ministry

of Manpower, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health.  A

lot  of  the  Ministries are involved.  We need  to  look  at

family  policies  very critically, and I would  suggest  that

there  is a need for us to revisit these areas in order  that

we  can  find fresh strategies to deal with the problem.   We

are  a  compassionate GPC, because we have to spare time  for

GPC education.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Syariah Court has jurisdiction over all matters

pertaining  to divorce, custody, maintenance and division  of

matrimonial  property where the parties are Muslims  or  were

married according to Muslim law.  With the amendments to  the

Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) in 1999, the  Syariah

Court has been conferred additional powers that will make  it

more  efficient  and  effective in administering  justice  to

Muslims  in family matters.  After more than a year, I  would

like  to ask the Minister whether he could give us an  update

on the performance of the Syariah Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the sittings of the Select Committee on the AMLA

amendments, there were reservations on the amendments. One of

them is that they are afraid that more Muslims would turn  to

civil  courts when they should be going to the Syariah Court.

The  other is that the civil law applied by the civil  courts

may  contradict  Syariah law.  I wish  to  ask  the  Minister

whether these reservations are valid.  Specifically,  I  wish

to  ask how many Muslim couples have gone to the civil  court

to settle their matrimonial problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, the Administration of Muslim

Law  Act  and  the attendant Muslim Divorce Rules  came  into

force  on  1st  August  last year.  Since  then,  significant

improvements to the court system and its work procedures have

taken  place.  For example, four ad hoc Presidents have  been

appointed, two of whom are experienced syariah law trained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>



judges, and two are civil law trained judges, in addition  to

the  incumbent Senior President and President of the  Syariah

Court.  With their depth of experience, they will add to  the

development  of the Islamic law jurisprudence  in  Singapore.

In  fact,  night court sessions have also been introduced  to

better serve the public so that more cases could be cleared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Registrar, as you know, has been appointed to

conduct  pre-trial conferences (PTC) of cases daily, and  the

PTCs  have  been  effective  in  instilling  discipline   and

expeditious disposal of cases and enable the court to dictate

the pace and progress of these cases.



<br>3.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the court which has been significantly

improved is the introduction of the proxy power of the court,

which  empowers  it  to enforce its orders  relating  to  the

division  of  matrimonial property.  In other words,  if  the

husband refuses to transfer the flat or property to the wife,

because  he did not sign the transfer papers, the court  will

be  able to exercise that power and transfer the property  to

the wife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these appointments and procedures, the court has

made  significant  progress  towards  maturing  into  a  more

efficient judicial organisation without compromising justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the waiting time for a case to be heard is

about two to four weeks after the pre-trial conference.   The

number  of backlog cases had been very much reduced from  421

to 175 at the beginning of this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court has also gained the confidence of the Muslim

community  in  its  ability to dispense justice  efficiently,

speedily and fairly.  Thus far, there is no application  made

by parties to have their ancillary matters heard in the civil

court.  In other words, what has been feared that people will

go  to  the  civil  courts in droves has not  happened.   The

Syariah Court will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>



strive to further enhance the level of its services to mirror

the  standards  achieved and maintained by the civil  courts.

It  is  hoped that by doing so, it will continue to meet  the

high expectations of the Muslim community which it serves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when it comes to education, every Singaporean has

an  opinion,  sometimes a rather strong  one.   This  is  not

surprising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>



because most adult Singaporeans below the age of 45 have gone

through  the Singapore education system and know  the  system

well.   Furthermore, for those of us with children,  we  have

endured  the  triumphs and tribulations  as  they  progressed

through school.  In many cases, it is as if we ourselves have

gone through school once again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system could be visualised as a process

where  at  one end, in go young, bubbly and fun-loving  young

children, and at the other end, out come disciplined, trained

and  educated  young  adults.  From Primary  4  onwards,  the

school  children are graded every two years and  streamed  to

different ability streams.  They will move on to career paths

depending  on  their achievements.  Some 20%  go  on  to  the

universities, another 40% to the polytechnics and the rest to

ITE.   They would have been imbued with the Singapore values,

ensuring a strong Singaporean heartbeat.  We can affirm  that

our  education  system is an efficient and a well-oiled  one.

Of  course,  from  time  to  time,  there  are  hiccups,  for

instance,  the Straits Times' report on its front page  today

on the blunder in the administration of examination for third-year medical students.  In the year-end examination they have

just  sat, some old questions were inadvertently used.  As  a

result,  the students had been told to re-sit the paper  this

Saturday.  The University authority had rejected their appeal

to waive that examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that by bringing this subject here, we

will  bring  undue pressure on the University  administration

and  might be considered as uncalled for interference.   With

your  indulgence, I think it is nonetheless useful to discuss

some basic principles.  I believe that so long as no students

are  given  undue advantages through the use of  past  years'

questions  itself,  while  undesirable,  there  is  basically

nothing wrong.  So long as the syllabus remains unchanged,  I

believe  questions about the same topics are by and large  in

the   same   ballpark.    In  fact,  some   repetitions   are

unavoidable.  We all remember our "A", "O" level  days  where

we practised ourselves extensively on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>



past years' papers in the 10-year series.  Hence, I would say

that  in  handling such a blunder, the students, who are  the

innocent  parties  here, should not be unduly  penalised  for

enduring to sit through the examination one more time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, besides this, there are other issues of

concern.   Over the past decade, as our students become  more

proficient  in  scoring  high marks in  examinations,  it  is

beginning to become difficult to differentiate the very  good

from  the good students.  So, from time to time, we are aware

that  standards  were raised and the screw  was  tightened  a

little bit more.  As a result, stress in our education system

is  high.  Everyone's focus is on the examination results and

the  holistic  development of the person is  relegated  to  a

distant second place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students learn too much facts and problem-solving

methods  in a structured environment.  But we did  not  learn

enough   reasoning   and   problem-solving   skills   in   an

unstructured environment that would allow us to handle  real-life  problems.  Nonetheless, this system has served us  very

well  in  our economic development where up to now,  we  need

only  to  adopt  established technologies and procedures  and

improve upon them.  Furthermore, we are also able to cater to

the less academically endowed so that when they leave school,

they  have  acquired  some  basic  skills  enabling  them  to

function  in  an  urbanised  society  and  an  industrialised

workplace.   This, Sir, is not something to sneeze  at.   Now

that  we  have  arrived at the developed stage and  the  next

stage  of  our  economic development is knowledge  based,  we

recognise  that the focus and the emphasis of  our  education

system must change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the US economy becomes the centre of innovation and

wealth  creation, we are also becoming more inclined  towards

the US education system, to an extent that it is tempting  to

think that if we adopt more western education practices,  the

problems in our school will be by and large solved.  This  is

not  necessarily so.  It is useful to remember that many high

school graduates in the US have such poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>



command  of  reading and writing that the employers  have  to

send  these  new  workers for remedial  classes.   While  the

western  education  system might be  more  conducive  to  the

brighter  students, they could also be quite  unforgiving  to

the weaker students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to make the comparison less meaningful, our

bilingual policy is the cornerstone of our education  system.

As  a  result of our emphasis on bilingualism, our pupils  in

primary  school  only learn four subjects,  namely,  English,

Mother Tongue language, Mathematics and Science; the last two

combined  as  a single examination subject.  For many  pupils

with   Chinese   as   the  mother  tongue,   they   spent   a

disproportionately  high  percentage  of  their   effort   in

learning Chinese.  Some have told me that they spent as  much

as  60% of their effort on Chinese.  Consequently, few of our

primary  school  graduates have been exposed  to  other  more

interesting  aspects of human endeavours such as music,  arts

and history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must adapt our current system to cater to the

needs of the new economy while retaining what has worked  for

us  all  these  years.  The question is how to cater  to  the

creativity of the bright and yet ensure that the weak are not

left  by  the  wayside.  How do we reduce  the  stress  level

without  compromising the high standards we have attained  in

our  schools?   How  do we fully exploit technology  to  make

education  better tailored to the capability and interest  of

the individual students?  How do we encourage greater student

participation in sports?  The list is long and the journey is

an equally long one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since taking over the Ministry, the Minister has

instituted  many  changes.   For instance,  course  load  for

students  has  been reduced.  The compensation  packages  for

teachers  have  been  enhanced  to  render  teaching  a  more

attractive  career choice.  But the impact of  these  changes

would take some years to show results.  As we look forward to

a Singapore in the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>



millennium, would the Minister elaborate on his vision of the

education  system as well as the areas where he  would  focus

his  attention on?  Could he lay out the milestones where the

various  changes introduced by him would produce visible  and

tangible results?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

for many years, academic performance has been the focal point

in  our Singapore education system, as what Dr Wang has  said

just   now.   Examination  scores  are  more  important  than

anything else.  This is what matters most in admission to the

junior  colleges, universities and even jobs,  especially  in

the civil service.  School rankings depend on it, so does the

assessment  of teachers.  Academic performance by examination

scores  is  the  easiest  to measure,  just  like  output  of

workers.  Perhaps that is why such yardstick has been  around

for so many years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the needs of the new age of technology, the

Ministry is working out a new school excellence model that is

not  only  concerned  with academic  achievements,  but  also

achievement in areas like arts, sports, uniformed groups  and

physical fitness.  The new model widens the scope for schools

to be assessed - not just in their academic results, but also

in  other  areas.   With these new criteria,  it  means  that

schools can encourage students to excel in other areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a major leap and I applaud the Ministry. Having

been  steeped in the culture of academic excellence, it  will

take  some  time  for  teachers and parents  to  re-orientate

themselves to the new possibilities, especially when academic

performance  continues  to  matter  most  when  it  comes  to

admission to universities, junior colleges and jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in any education system, we must always bear in

mind that the aim of educating our children is to enable them

to  contribute to the community.  There is no point nurturing

wizards who end up caring for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have competition, but not at the cost of

neglecting other areas of life - the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>



camaraderie,  the  need  to care  for  others,  the  need  to

contribute  to community.  There should be enough  activities

in  school to let our young learn these values in life.  Only

then can we say that education in Singapore is a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the Ministry for having begun the process

of  revamping  the education system to meet the  needs  of  a

knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the measures that I cannot agree more is the

implementation of the double-degree programme at the NUS this

year,  allowing  undergraduates  to  earn  two  degrees  from

separate  faculties at the same time.  This  paradigm  shift,

according to NUS, is to give students a more well-rounded and

broad-based  education.  This is a good start.   I  hope  the

Ministry does not stop here, but allow such a programme to be

extended  to  other universities.  Also, the Ministry  should

consider  allowing  Singapore or even overseas  graduates  to

take  up  second  or even third degrees at our  universities.

The  rationale for this proposal is the same as the  one  for

the double-degree programme for existing undergraduates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits are many. Graduates can acquire more broad-based knowledge that they need at work. The option helps

them to become all rounders.  Graduates who want to pursue  a

second  career can do so, without having to spend  a  lot  of

money  overseas or leave their families.  Undergraduates  can

learn  from  those  who have been exposed  to  the  workforce

before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to open up our universities to provide more

options for Singaporeans if we want to inculcate a culture of

a lifelong learning in Singapore.  We have arrived at a stage

where  the  university  is  no  longer  a  place  to  acquire

knowledge  alone, but a place to search for further knowledge

and  development.  More changes and flexibility  have  to  be

introduced to bring this about.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in the next few

minutes,  I  would  like to touch on four areas:  first,  the

undermining of our traditional values; second, the importance

of a holistic education; third, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>



importance of multi-racialism; and fourth, the allocation  of

resources to our schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to a KBE dictates the need for change in our

education policies.  The importance and urgency of  the  task

are not in question.  We must imbue in our people, especially

our young, the capability to search and use information.   We

must  encourage our young to be more creative and innovative.

These  additional skills and aptitudes would make our  people

more  effective in the new economy.  I commend  the  Ministry

for  its  vigorous  response  to  this  challenge.   But  the

response  should not undermine the traditional virtues,  such

as hard work, effort and discipline, that we have worked hard

to  cultivate  in our society.  These values will  always  be

relevant.   In our push for change, we must not inadvertently

demean   these   traditional  values.   Take,  for   example,

creativity.   Are we overselling it?  Do we need everyone  to

be  "creative"?  The impression now given seems  to  be  that

unless  you  are  "creative", you will have no  role  in  the

future.   As some of my learned colleagues in the House  have

pointed  out earlier, many jobs that involve using our  hands

will remain.  Besides, is everyone good at being "creative"?



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my concern is not the call to our young to be

creative and innovative, to be willing to take risks,  but  I

am concerned that we may oversell these qualities, sometimes,

even to the exclusion of the traditional virtues.  It takes a

long  time, perhaps a generation or two to effect  a  mindset

change.   If  it is not done right, it will take  an  equally

long time to correct it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore needs wholesome and confident citizens

capable  of  adapting  to  and  operating  in  different  and

changing   circumstances.   We  must  be  able  to   function

effectively  as individuals, as members of our  families  and

communities in which we live and work and as citizens.  To be

able  to do so, Singaporean needs a holistic education.  This

is  a  task that our Ministry has set for itself to  provide.

One of the things the Ministry has done in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>



order  to  achieve  this  goal is to  establish  the  Desired

Outcomes of Education for the various levels of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be interesting to know the mechanism that the

Ministry has established to measure the achievement of  these

outcomes by our students.  Based on the results obtained,  is

the  Ministry  satisfied with what we have achieved  so  far?

The success with a holistic education is especially important

as  we  become a global city by plugging ourselves  into  the

international economic network.  What more can our schools do

to  enhance  this important goal of producing  wholesome  and

confident citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been very successful in bridging the

differences between our races and building strong bonds among

ourselves.   We  have  every  reason  to  be  proud  of   our

achievements in this area.  However, we must never  take  our

racial  cohesion and harmony for granted.  Some  may  say  we

have  arrived at our destination.  And even if  we  have,  we

cannot take for granted that we can stay here without further

efforts  and  care.  Recent events in Kosovo, India,  Nigeria

and,  closer  home,  in Indonesia, show how  deep-rooted  the

feelings  of race and religion are.  We must never take  each

other for granted, even if we can.  We must continue to build

on  the  respect  and understanding we have for  each  other.

With  more time and effort, our bonding will strengthen  even

further.   We must never relax this important aspect  in  the

education of our young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to the last issue of my cut. Some

people  have  advocated that more money should  be  spent  to

educate  our  good students so that they can be even  better.

We  need  capable people to lead.  This makes sense.   Others

have  advocated that more money should be spent to help those

who  are  less able.  They need more help to level up.   This

also  makes  sense.   On the latter line  of  argument,  many

parents  therefore  have  suggested  that  more  and   better

resources be deployed at the primary school level.  If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>



primary students have a good and strong foundation, they will

need  less  help  in  the future years.   The  allocation  of

resources for education is thus perplexing.  Just how has the

Ministry  of  Education been allocating its resources?   Many

would like to know how the money budgeted to the Ministry  of

Education  is  allocated to the schools.   The  neighbourhood

schools in my area and both elsewhere in Singapore could make

do with more help to become even better schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, over the last few

years,  there  have been several significant changes  in  our

education  system.  We have moved from an  emphasis  on  rote

learning  towards  greater creative thinking,  away  from  an

academic orientation towards a wider scope of methods through

which  students  can  express  themselves  and  be  assessed.

Curriculum  has been reduced in favour of that objective  and

we  also  have  improved infrastructure and facilities.   And

perhaps,  most  important of all, we also have  developed  IT

teaching  in  schools and used it as a vehicle  for  creative

expression.  All these are very important changes in  keeping

with  the  times  and they prepare us for the  so-called  new

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, a certain bias appears to have crept into our

vernacular.  We appear to talk of the old economy in somewhat

disparaging  terms  and the new economy in  somewhat  glowing

terms.  If I may illustrate.  In this House, we have numerous

references on the need to work at Internet speed, the need to

embrace the new economy, otherwise we risk being left behind.

The suggestion is also that if we do not do so, then we might

be  somewhat remiss in the task of governance.  In the media,

we  find front page coverage to young junior college students

who  have become entrepreneurs or technopreneurs, as the  new

vernacular  will suggest, taking risks and being prepared  to

fail  and  wear failure as a badge of honour.  We  also  have

less  than complimentary references in the media to  the  old

world  economy veterans, like Warren Buffet that he  has  not

embraced  the  new changes with as much speed  as  he  should

have.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are important messages in their own right.

But  they  should be kept in their context.  Ultimately,  the

Internet  and the new economy is just another way  to  create

wealth.  It does not represent a new paradigm for the way  we

organise  ourselves, or the way we govern ourselves,  or  the

way  we relate to each other.  And I think this is the  point

that  must  be  communicated  effectively  to  our  students,

through national education, and other measures, that we  must

be  fast but not hasty in decision making, particularly  when

it  comes  to  policy that affects millions of  Singaporeans;

that  we must be connected but not confuse connectivity  with

being  involved with everything, everywhere,  all  the  time;

that  we  must be informed, especially when making  important

decisions,  but  that  we should not be overwhelmed  by  this

information that is available out there, to be able to  sieve

out what is important and what is not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, the so-called Internet speed has its

limits,  particularly in terms of in what context it  can  be

applied.  You cannot have family relations at Internet speed,

you cannot parent your child at Internet speed and certainly,

you  cannot build a nation at Internet speed, with the values

of multi-racialism, meritocracy, integrity and diligence, the

values on which Singapore was built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think national education is the key to

maintaining that balance in our education system and I  would

urge  the  Minister to pay particular attention to  how  this

balance is brought about in the message we give our young  so

that  they do not get so enamoured of the wild wild  west  of

the  Internet that they forget the old home with  its  yellow

brick road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, my question

is  how is our education system being reviewed to keep it  in

step  with what is needed in the new economy?  We have had  a

great  deal of discussion both in and outside the House about

how  we  should  anticipate and meet the  challenges  of  the

knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have identified two goals, and I speak rather

apologetically after Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>



Iswaran  has  spoken.  First, to transform  our  universities

into what has been described as "incubators for inspiration".

Second,  to develop a pool of entrepreneurs willing  to  take

risks  and  a  large  group  of workers  with  a  thirst  for

knowledge and a high degree of creativity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are highly commendable objectives. They signal a

determination  to  transform our economic  culture  from  one

which  breeds conformity of thought and embraces prudence  to

one  which  celebrates intellectual dissonance  and  aims  to

remove the stigma of failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on the right track. There is no question that

the  system will, in a few years, throw up more entrepreneurs

and  innovators that we now have.  But that is not the point.

The  real  issue is whether we will churn out a few  more  or

many  more.  The answer, in my view, depends largely  on  our

education system.  I do not contend that the education system

should be tweaked to teach entrepreneurship.  I subscribe  to

the  view  that a person is either born with the stomach  and

inclination to go off the beaten track or he is not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in my view, the true question is not whether

the  education  system  can  nurture  entrepreneurs.   It  is

whether  it can avoid dampening, or worse, extinguishing  the

potential  of  the  few  who  have  it  in  them  to  make  a

difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be realistic. We do not have the numbers

which the United States or China or India enjoy.  They have a

far larger pool of school children.  It stands to reason that

their  odds  of  producing thinkers and innovators  are  much

shorter than us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot seriously compete on numbers. So we have to

concentrate on quality.  The question is: does our  education

system preserve or lengthen our odds in this game?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine our education system. It imposes

standards  and  norms, whether of behaviour  or  achievement.

This  is not a criticism. It is a fact.  From young, children

are  taught  that  there are prescribed  methods  of  finding

solutions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are made to believe that your test and examination

results reflect your ability and potential.  That has  served

the  country well.  But are we hurting our chances in the new

world?   I  was not surprised when I read that the report  by

the   National  Youth  Council  suggested  that  many   young

Singaporeans feel that scoring "As" is enough to ensure  them

a  bright future.  Can you take these same people, who for 12

years   have  been  told  that  they  should  play  by   long

established  rules  and  that  grades  are  everything,   and

suddenly  transform them into hungry and curious participants

of the new economy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's Straits Times carried a report that parents of

pre-schoolers believe that discipline is more important  than

creativity.   80% of parents who were interviewed  felt  that

pre-schoolers   should   have  worksheets.    This   is   not

surprising.   Singaporeans are very practical  people.   They

have become system smart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is going to be a mammoth task to change the mindset

of  administrators, principals, teachers, parents who have so

skilfully  adapted  themselves to the  system  and  are  very

comfortable  with  the existing norms.  Unless  we  make  the

effort and overcome the resistance, we will continue to  have

scores  of school leavers who will see no sensible reason  to

stick their necks out or go against the flow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of you will remember an athlete by the name of

Richard Fosbury.  Until 1968, for those who follow athletics,

high jumpers moved from first to the fourth gear and then  up

they went over the bar.  In 1968, Dick Fosbury came along and

he  did the unthinkable.  He moved from first to third  gear,

and  just  before the bar, turned direction, engaged  reverse

gear, and soared over it.  He won the gold medal but that  is

not as important as the fact that he changed the game.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the chances of our system preserving the spark

of a local Dick Fosbury?  Consider this.  In Mathematics,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>



our  children are taught that getting the right answer is not

enough.  The method must be right or marks will be  deducted.

He is taught that he has to stay in his lane. I am sure there

is  a  good  reason for that, but do you think  that  we  are

shortening or lengthening our odds?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must move away from prescription and regurgitation in

the schools. Children should be assessed not only on content,

but  also  on the ability to think on their feet  and  around

problems.  The  answer  does not  lie  in  giving  them  more

projects.  The sooner we realise it, the better because  most

of them will end up being done by the parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not going to be easy to develop a pool of

entrepreneurs and a creative workforce.  We need to find ways

to  preserve the potential of the very small numbers that  we

have.   It  will be a terrible waste if the education  system

continues  to  transform the street-smart  into  the  system-smart.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, we all

appreciate the need to have clearly defined desired  outcomes

of  education  so that we will not stray from  equipping  our

scarce   human  resources  with  the  necessary  skills   for

sustaining both our economy and society. We are also  mindful

of  the  competing demands for school time.  Many an argument

has  been made to allocate more time to deserving needs, such

as  national education, inculcation of values, sex  education

and the list goes on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to urge the Minister to seriously

consider  including  technology as a compulsory  subject,  at

least from the secondary school onwards.  This is not just to

make  them  entrepreneurs  or Net  savvy.   This  is  because

technology  literacy now ranks as high as language  literacy.

Without a working knowledge of technology or specifically  of

computers and the Internet, we will be handicapped. The world

is  now  a  little smaller if we go by traditional  means  of

acquiring   knowledge,  such  as  reading  hard   copies   of

newspapers and periodicals, books from the library  and  news

over  television. If we explore all that is at  our  disposal

via the Internet, we get the opposite effect, that is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>



information overload, too many sources, too many channels and

too  many  possibilities.   But  obviously,  to  operate  and

survive  in a global economy, we cannot afford to  limit  our

ability to do more and know more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we should aim at ensuring that our students

understand  the  Internet and related  technology  enough  to

navigate and choose.  With technology literacy, they  have  a

tool  which they can exploit to maximise their own potential.

Having  computer-based education in schools is not quite  the

same  nor good enough.  Students probably regard the computer

as  a  means to an end, say, completing a Mathematics lesson.

Beyond  the lesson, there is little understanding of  how  it

works.   Even  if  certain skills were  picked  up,  such  as

logging  on  and logging off and the differences between  the

different disk drives, the emphasis is still very much on the

content rather than the technology itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that we are experiencing ever-changing

needs for a knowledge-based and driven economy.  There is  no

doubt  that  technology is ever-changing  and  we  can  never

master it perfectly.  But it will be far better to be a  part

of  its  evolution  than  to have a  long  lag  after  proper

schooling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking for schools to incorporate the equipping of

such skills in a timely fashion as curriculum proper and  not

be  left  as  co-  or  extra-curricular activities,  such  as

leaving IT club to teach web design.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise a related issue

regardless of how technology is introduced in schools and ask

the Minister to help change the mindsets of those involved in

technology-related  education, from  being  a  teacher  to  a

facilitator,  so  as  to  allow innovation  to  spring  forth

spontaneously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in this

budget,  the  Ministry of Education made out a long  list  of

achievements  in its educational ideals.  However,  from  two

recent incidents, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>



cannot  help but ask myself what are the educational  results

that we have attained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have this random survey conducted by Dr Chan

Han  Ying  of  NUS  which revealed that  one-quarter  of  the

Chinese  students did not wish to be Chinese  in  their  next

life.   On  the  other hand, the vast majority of  Malay  and

Indian  students  wished  to remain  as  Malays  and  Indians

respectively in their next life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been implementing the unified education

system  and   bilingual education for many  years.   All  the

students from the various ethnic groups are educated  in  the

same  educational  system. How is it that there  is  a  great

difference in their basic sense of belonging for their ethnic

groups? Some commentators felt that this was a result of  the

impact  of western culture on Singapore and some people  were

saying  that  this  was an inevitable result  of  Singapore's

globalisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the ethnic groups in Singapore are

subjected   to  the  same  western  culture  and   the   same

globalisation.   How is it that the survey reveals  that  the

inclination of the Chinese students is so different from that

of the students from the other ethnic groups?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 30 years of nation building, all the

policies  of the Government have been such that the  emphasis

is  on  the  use  of  English as the main  stream.  This  has

affected  the Chinese community most. Apart from the language

and the family traditions, there is no effective method under

the  Government's policy to nourish their sense of  belonging

to  their  own ethnic group.  Unlike in the Malay  community,

when  the  Malays  go  to the mosque and attend  the  various

activities  connected therewith, their sense of belonging  to

their  own ethnic group is strengthened, and the use of their

language  enhanced.   On  the  other  hand,  apart  from  the

Government's   Speak  Mandarin  Campaign  and  some   related

activities,  there  is  nothing  very  much  in  our   social

framework  to  make  the ethnic Chinese in Singapore  enhance

their sense of belonging to their community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with the education system turning to use English as

the   main   medium  of  instruction,  learning  of   English

literature made compulsory in the secondary schools, and some

schools offering  European history rather than Asian history,

many   Chinese students have very limited knowledge of  their

own  history and their own literature.  No wonder they do not

have a sense of belonging to their own racial group. I do not

know  whether the aims of our education system  is such  that

we  want  to blur the students' sense of belonging for  their

own ethnic group in order to enhance their sense of belonging

to Singapore as a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second incident was this report on 2nd March in the

Straits  Times  that  one top student  from  a  neighbourhood

school  was  originally from a well-known  school.   However,

during  his  younger days, he committed a number of  offences

and  had criminal convictions. As a result,  many schools did

not  want to take him. Fortunately, this neighbourhood school

admitted  him  and gave him a second chance.  He  seized  the

opportunity, turned over a new leaf, and scored many 'As'  in

his  'O'  level examinations.  While we are talking  about  a

holistic  approach  to  attain our educational  ideals,  some

schools  are using this unilateral policy. Some schools  want

to  attain  high  ranking, and they are only  concerned  with

students  scoring   good results for  them  to  attain  their

target.  To them, it is better that those students who do not

behave  well  do not come as they may ruin the reputation  of

the  school.  If the mindset of the school administrators  is

such  that  they are  so eager for quick results and  instant

benefits, then how can we expect them to educate our students

in  a  holistic educational approach in order to  attain  the

desired outcomes of our education policy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, our drive to

develop   a   nation  of  entrepreneurs  with  the   required

creativity  to  invent  and innovate  and  to  inculcate  the

concept of life-long learning further reinforces the need for

us to re-look at our current system of education which served

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>



purposes  of the nation in the past and, which in my opinion,

requires  changes  in  a number of areas  if  we  are  really

serious  about  achieving  these goals  of  developing  every

Singaporean to his or her full potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that one of the key considerations of the

education  system that we have in place today is  to  achieve

efficiency  in the delivery of education and hence,  we  have

been   doing   things   like  streaming,  teacher   postings,

assessment, measurement of school performances and other like

things. While from the point of view of the system and  those

managing the system, this looks very good and the outcomes of

which  are easily measurable, the negative impact is that  we

develop  a  nation of people who fit into just one  model  of

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a nation of entrepreneurs capable of

participating in the knowledge economy, and I am  not  saying

that  every Singaporean needs to be an entrepreneur,  but  if

you want to get a few of them, then we really need to set our

sights into something very high.  At least some of them  will

make  it.  We need to ensure that our people will  always  be

able  to  adapt to changes by constantly learning new skills,

and  it  is time that we took a serious look at how we should

modify  our  education system.  Because  the  impact  of  the

education  system will only be felt 10 to 15 years  from  the

time  it starts, in my opinion, the issue has also become  an

urgent one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is whether we are looking at

the  right models of education from around the world  and  to

adapt  the  best practices to suit Singapore. In my  opinion,

our system basically trains our children for one-career model

of  life, very much like the traditional Chinese and Japanese

systems  which placed scholars among the top rung of society.

As BG George Yeo recently put it in one of his speeches, such

a  system actually prevented the Chinese from exploiting  the

benefits of trade and new technology and, therefore, they are

losing out in this competition to western countries.   In  my

opinion, we really need to look at some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>



western  models in order to achieve the new outcomes  of  our

education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without doubt, the Americans were the leaders for

innovation, technology and economic development in  the  past

century,  better  than any other nations  around  the  world.

Similarly,  they will have an excellent chance to remain  the

leaders  in this century.  I therefore feel that it is  about

time  we learned from the Americans and other western  models

of  education, not to copy them wholesale, but  to  pick  the

best  practices  among them and develop  our  own  model  for

Singapore.  I really feel that we can learn a lot from  their

systems,  which may not be the most efficient in  the  world,

but do produce the results. So, what good does it do to score

the   highest   marks   in  the   Science   and   Mathematics

competitions around the world when the desired outcomes of an

education system cannot be achieved? So I suggest that we  be

prepared  to give up some amount of efficiency in our  system

to achieve the end results for the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that we should re-look at the practice of

early  streaming of our children. This has been my pet  topic

for some time. The system basically divides our children into

categories and put the people of the same capabilities in the

same  place and segregate people of differing talents.   This

is  once  again good for efficiency, but bad in that it  does

not  allow our children to benefit from learning from  people

of  differing talents. I strongly believe in the strength  of

diversity  that  if they can learn from people  of  different

talents or different abilities, they probably would turn  out

to  be better students or adults in the future.  Our children

are  missing out on the important opportunity to  learn  from

others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us in this House, including the Minister,

came  through  an  education  system  that  mixed  people  of

differing  abilities together for many years  of  our  school

system.  I  am  sure that you must agree  with  me  that  the

outcome  has  not been a bad one, where all of us  have  been

able  to compete effectively with the world's best countries.

I would like to ask the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>



whether there is any other education system in the world that

practises streaming in the way that we do here in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are serious about the concept of life-long

learning,  then our current methods of measuring success  and

failure need to drastically change.  It is more important  to

ensure that a student has learned the ability to learn in the

future  than  to learn to score well in examinations  and  in

doing  so,  achieving academic excellence which we very  much

want our children to achieve today. Learning to score well in

examinations is not going to inculcate the value of life-long

learning,  so  we  really need to develop other  measures  of

success in our education system.  Similarly, the measures  of

creativity and EQ deserve more emphasis as we move ahead  and

ECA,   project  work  and  life  experiences  should  feature

strongly in our new measures of success. To be successful  in

the  21st  century,  we  need to  develop  a  more  adaptable

society, able to pick up new capabilities and skills all  the

time, and not just once in their lifetime.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am curious to know how the concept of

mass  customisation of our education system is working.   The

Minister announced this some time last year.  The question  I

have  is:   is  it really possible to implement  the  system?

Perhaps the Minister can share with Members of this House how

this system can be practically implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I would like to follow up on my

colleague,  Mr  Inderjit  Singh's theme  to  explore  further

afield  for  best practices in education.  With the  numerous

developments  on  the education front as well  as  the  fast-changing economy that we are trying to cater to, I would like

to discuss the role of the private sector in education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the private sector plays an active role in

both the pre-school and university segments.  There is a wide

variety  of  choices on both fronts and within the  desirable

framework; families



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>



can  decide the type of services they want for the  children.

However,   the  private  sector,  by  and  large,  does   not

participate in the provision of primary, secondary  and  pre-university education for Singaporeans.  Recently, the  Deputy

Prime  Minister, Dr Tony Tan, mentioned possible  alternative

routes    to    university,   including   the   International

Baccalaureate (IB). Pending a complete review to  see  if  it

should  be  offered  by schools across  the  board,  can  the

private   sector  meet  such  demand  in  the   interim,   in

particular, where students are unable to cope in the  current

school  system,  rather than to lose them, and  possibly  the

parents  as  well, abroad?  This could well  provide  a  much

appreciated alternative.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am going to

start  by  begging your forbearance, because I  am  about  to

bring up two old subjects and, being new in the House, I have

the advantage of not having heard the debates before.  I will

try however not to be too lengthy about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the single biggest stresser for Singaporean

families  is  worry  over  their children's  education.   The

Ministry  of Education has, in recent years, introduced  many

admirable  new  initiatives.  These  include  measures  which

address  factors that contribute to the pressure on students,

such  as curriculum review with a view to decrease curriculum

load  and the review of university admission criteria to  de-emphasise reliance on 'O' and 'A' level results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you talk to senior officers in MOE, they are

enthused,  convinced  and sincere about these  good  efforts.

When  we talk to parents and teachers on the ground, however,

we might be excused if we were to think that they were living

in  a different world.  The pressure continues unabated.  Why

this  incongruence?  Because for all the good intentions  and

sincere  efforts, certain fundamental issues  have  not  been

resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are anxious for their children on two counts.

Firstly, they worry about their children being able to access

tertiary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>



education  and  hence,  subsequently,  earn  a  good  living.

Secondly, they worry about their children being labelled from

an  early age as slow, stigmatised, socialised differently in

the system and written off as no- hopers.  As the changes  to

the  admission  criteria start making  their  impact  to  the

system, the first pressure point should ease.  However,  this

takes  time  to happen.  But the anxiety with regard  to  the

early  labelling  of  children will persist  so  long  as  we

continue with our policy of streaming children as young as at

primary  four.  The second pressure point remains as real  as

ever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, curriculum review notwithstanding, so

long  as ranking of schools remains, principals will continue

to  strive  to push their schools up the academic ladder  and

apply  pressure  on teachers who will, in turn,  continue  to

push  their  students.   Even the  additional  refinement  of

measuring  schools with most value added for their  students,

they still  measure this value added in academic performance.

No  amount of exhortations that it is not necessary  to  push

students  to  complete 110% of the curriculum  by  the  first

quarter  of  the year, so that the next two quarters  can  be

spent  on  revision and drills, and no amount  of  assurances

that  other achievements also count, will have any effect  so

long  as  the  Ministry continues to rank  schools  on  their

academic results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals and teachers will continue to be convinced

that  their assessment, progress and promotions are  tied  to

the  academic results of their pupils and institutions.   The

pressure  will  not  let  up.  I am not  at  all  denying  or

dismissing  all  the benefits and advantages of  ranking  and

streaming.  There were obviously good reasons why  they  were

introduced in the first place.  But as in any policies, there

are always two sides to the balance.  It is a matter of which

side  of  the  balance sits heavier.  And as time progresses,

sometimes  the balance shifts.  For ranking, on one  side  is

the  ability to benchmark and assess the schools, and provide

parents  with  information on how the schools rate.   On  the

other  side is the unhealthy competition that this engenders,

and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>



resulting  pressures that go right through the  system.   The

question is truly: what would we lose if we were to drop  the

system of ranking schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For streaming, on one side is the purported ability to

identify children who would otherwise not be able to cope, to

help them with the less demanding load.  On the other side is

the  labelling of the children at an early age with  all  the

attendant  consequences, to their self-esteem,  the  loss  of

opportunities open to other children not so labelled, and the

loss  to the system of late developers, and the loss  of  the

diversity, which Mr Inderjit Singh has just referred to.  The

question is truly: is there no other way to help along slower

children but to segregate them in this manner?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Minister has received many calls in the past

to  review the policies of ranking and streaming, but I  will

venture to ask him to do so again.  I believe it is time, the

balance  has tipped, because the pressures are weighing  very

heavily  on  the other side.  I am sure that many Members  of

the  Frontbench  would  also agree  if  only  they  were  not

constrained by the solidarity required of their positions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my plea to the Minister is to please pause, throw

out  previous pre-conceptions and premises, and review  these

two  policies.  Before I end, Sir, I would also like to  take

the   opportunity  to  invite  the  press   to   make   their

contribution  towards easing off on this undue  adulation  of

academic results.  We have just missed an opportunity as this

year's 'O' and 'A' results have just been released.  But from

next  year,  I  suggest  to them to  propose  a  blackout  on

coverage  of the top students in the PSLE, 'O' and 'A'  level

examinations.   All they are going to disappoint  are  a  few

proud  parents,  but  it would be their contribution  in  the

cause of promoting a saner society less preoccupied with  the

paper chase.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, one of the desired

outcomes  of  education is to have the  young  generation  of

Singaporeans  to  be  prepared as knowledge  workers  of  the

future.  The Ministry launched the IT Masterplan to equip our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>



young with skills for the knowledge-based economy.  IT skills

are  tools  that  should help our students learn  better  and

develop  the ability to apply what they have learnt.   To  be

able  to  teach  students  these skills,  obviously  we  need

teachers  who  are knowledgeable in the use of computers  and

have  IT  skills.  We know that the Ministry has  a  plan  to

train  teachers  in the use of the computer  and  IT  skills.

What  has  been the progress in this area?  Have  there  been

problems in training the older teachers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the IT Masterplan of the Ministry because

it allows our students to learn skills that they must have to

operate  in  the  KBE  era,  irrespective  of  whether  their

families  own computers at home or not.  The plan allows  our

students  to level up together.  But to ensure that  students

who  do not have computers at home have equal chance to learn

and  practise  IT  skills, we must have enough  computers  in

schools for them to use and practise.  The long-term plan  of

the  Ministry is to equip every two students with a computer.

Are  we anywhere near the target?  Do all schools, especially

neighbourhood schools, have equal opportunities to  teach  IT

skills to their students?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers too will be supplied with notebook computers at

a ratio of one computer for every two teachers.  Can teachers

really share computers when they have to prepare lessons  and

reports  using the MOE-supplied laptops?  Sir, I  would  like

the  Minister  to give us an update on the IT Masterplan  for

schools which has been implemented for the past two years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, on this cut, I would like to

address  two  topics,  namely,  single  session  schools  and

primary one priority allocation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a major step was taken on 2nd January this year by

MOE  when all remaining double session secondary schools were

converted  to  single session schools.  It is  a  significant

conversion  that  took  place  quietly  without  causing  any

disruptions.  Conceptually, a conversion of this scale  would

require  having twice as many schools this year  compared  to

last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>



year.   That the schools were able to do so in a clean  sweep

point  to  the tremendous amount of planning and effort  that

have gone behind the scene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the school children have greater access to

the school facilities, I would urge the teachers and students

to make full use of the facilities.  We should avoid carrying

on business as usual.  We should aim to make attending school

a more enriching experience for them.  Furthermore, we should

aim,  through  core curriculum activities, to  create  common

educational experience that will imprint the Singapore  value

on these students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the Minister whether the

Ministry is monitoring how schools are adapting to the single

session  schools  and  whether  he  is  satisfied  with   the

situation.   I understand that there is some resistance  from

some  parents  regarding single session school, because  they

have  grown used to half day schools.  Many had made  use  of

the  half  days  to  send their children to other  enrichment

programmes and part-time religious education programmes  such

as  part-time madrasahs.  For these students, single  session

schools actually take away their half days that they used  to

have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this point, I think it is useful to point out

that  half  day  schools are actually not the  norm  in  most

countries.  In fact, half day schools in Singapore are  left-overs  from  the  time  when the nation experienced  a  rapid

population growth in its early days of nationhood.  Now  that

we are back to the norm, it is up to the parents and teachers

to fully exploit the opportunity to benefit our students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the allocation of primary one places, the recent

case  of Michael Ong who wrote to the Minister regarding  his

long  school  day  struck  a chord with  many  people.   Many

questions were asked. Why should pupils spend so much time on

commuting, for instance?  Should not the pupils in general be

allocated  schools closer to their homes?  In  Michael  Ong's

case, his father actually has clarified their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>



position.   Nevertheless,  his case  highlighted  the  unique

primary  one  allocation  scheme in  Singapore.   Under  this

scheme,  parents  sometimes would go to the  extreme  to  get

their  children enrolled into their choice schools.  I wonder

whether the Minister will review the scheme to see whether it

is  still  relevant  or  whether it could  still  be  further

improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Education

has  initiated  a  change  in the  direction  of  the  school

curriculum towards a more open and creative path.  The change

proves  to  be  most  timely in view of the  demand  on  more

creative  line  in  the IT age.  The emphasis  on  creativity

would enable us to prepare our younger generation to face the

new  challenge of the demand posted by the rapid  development

in  the Internet and IT.   The policy is already in place for

a  few  years.   I would like to know from the  Minister  the

progress made so far and whether there is a need to implement

more  changes in view of the fast pace of changes.   I  would

also like to know how the schools as well as the students and

the  teachers are responding to the change.  I have  received

feedback  both  from teachers and parents that  although  the

policy  is  in place, the implementation is hampered  by  the

fact that the rigid system of recognising  the achievement of

the  students based purely on the academic performance  still

remains.   The  entrance  to schools,  junior  colleges,  the

polytechnics or even the universities is still based strictly

on the grades achieved.  One point short of what is required,

he is out.  For many, their career is over.  No consideration

is  given  to  ECA  performance.  It  is  not  important  how

committed the student has been or how good leadership he  has

shown.    Therefore,  some  of the parents  have  told  their

children  not to be too active in taking part in  many  ECAs,

but to concentrate more on their study as taking part in more

ECAs may affect their academic results.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranking of schools also led to some principals to

demand  that  their  students  obtain  the  highest  academic

results at all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>



costs  in  order  to make the school look  good.   With  this

mindset still prevailing, can the Minister tell us how can we

ensure  that the education of our students be more  open  and

creative,  learn how to think instead of how to  memorise  in

order to remain relevant in this fast changing world?



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

have  six  suggestions  for making secondary  school  life  a

little   more  interesting  for  the  total  development   of

students.  These came from teachers and students whom  I  had

conversations with.  I notice in the gallery there  are  some

young  minds.   I  hope they listen to this closely.    These

suggestions   are  not  about  Internet  and  technology   or

technopreneurship.   It  is more about  nurturing  the  self,

connecting   the   self  with  community,  about   developing

emotional intelligence and multiple intelligences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ages of 13-16 are the most restless, rebellious

and  uncertain.  Students in this age cohort do not need more

structures and conformity in their learning experience.  They

need  diversity, creativity and application of their  talents

and interactive relationship to enjoy the learning process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These suggestions are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Regularise internship programmes in secondary

schools.   Students are getting bored with simply staying  in

schools.   They  are restless and want to get connected  with

the  reality  of  work.  Can we encourage  a  tie-up  between

schools  and private as well as public sectors which  provide

internship programmes for secondary 3 and 4 students so  that

they learn the values of work, leadership and organisation of

management  by  shadowing  a  manager  and  observing   board

meetings,  etc.   We  could credit the hours  spent  with  an

organisation as part of character development component or as

an   extra-curricular  credit.   I  had  the  opportunity  to

experiment this with Raffles Girls Secondary School and  with

Nanyang   Girls  School.   It  had  proven  to  be   mutually

satisfying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Develop mentoring programmes. Students love to hear

stories and old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>



people  love  to tell them.  Could we encourage old  persons,

not  necessarily teachers, to speak to students or work  with

them on specific programmes?  Story-telling as an art form is

a  new  teaching method that should be encouraged and  it  is

best done by an interesting and educated elderly person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Writing neighbourhood stories. As part of nation-building programmes, students should be encouraged to write

stories  about  their homes and neighbourhood, including  the

CDCs  and other social institutions within the vicinity  that

they  live in.  This exercise offers enriching essay  writing

materials and it helps to plug our students to the real  life

of Singapore.  The Joo Chiat story published by Joo Chiat CCC

was a case in point.  If students were invited to participate

in  the  project,  I  am sure they would  have  enjoyed  that

thoroughly  and  it would be a good bonding  process  between

students and their neighbourhood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Student mix in overseas field trips. I have read a

number of reports by students who have been abroad with their

schools to do community work. The experiences that they  have

accumulated  were  invaluable and I hope  the  Ministry  will

expand  the  subsidies  to include  more  students  from  the

neighbourhood schools to go on such trips.  It would probably

be  a good experiment to mix a SAP school and a neighbourhood

school in such a field trip to achieve social integration  at

some level among students from different backgrounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Community service. I have asked for more community

service  for  students  in other sittings.  So  I  shall  not

belabour  the  point here.  I hope the Ministry  will  review

this  in  a  concerted  manner with the National  Council  of

Social Service and neighbourhood community agencies to render

the  experience a fruitful community bonding process so  that

students  will experience the growth of a community  and  how

they can contribute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the implementation of the revised criteria into

NUS  and  NTU will shift the emphasis from a purely  academic

criteria to one which encourages total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>



development of the individual.  This direction, I hope,  will

moderate  the  school  of thought that  believes  in  getting

distinctions as the "be all and end all" of all students.   I

hope  the  Government's  continued  emphasis  on  merit   and

scholarships will be looked into.  While we want  to  nurture

the  creme de la creme of the nation, this should not be over

emphasised  at  the  expense of the  majority  who  are  non-scholars.  I  am  glad  to hear that  MOE  was  looking  into

developing niche areas like sports as a desirable outcome  in

student development.  By broadening the school curriculum  to

include interesting bits that are non-academic in nature,  we

reap  the  benefit  of  discovering  and  strengthening   the

diversity of talents in our student population.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Thank

you,  Sir,  for allowing me to come into the debate  at  this

point  in time.  There are many cuts and I think I will  take

the  cuts  as  they come along so that we can have  a  better

exchange.   First of all, I would like to thank  Members  for

their comments and suggestions.    As usual, there is quite a

diversity of views, not all of them are consistent with  each

other.   If I implemented all of them, we will have quite  an

argument over whose view would prevail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past two weeks, there has been extensive

debate  in the House on how Singapore can continue to  thrive

in the "new" economy.  Education has been cited as one of the

factors critical to Singapore's success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Dr Tan Boon Wan, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and

Mr  Davinder Singh and others have asked how the Ministry  of

Education  (MOE)  is  going  to  help  our  young  meet   the

requirements  of  the  new  economy.   Have  we  changed  the

education system?  Is our education system suitable or not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me say that our education system is a

remarkably  strong  one.  It is a strong  one  for  our  good

students.   It  is also a strong one for our  weak  students.

Some Members have asked whether we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>



looked  at the systems in other parts of the world,  and  the

answer  is  yes.   One of the things that I have  consciously

done,  and  which  I  have encouraged  the  officers  in  the

Ministry  to do, is to go and look at what others are  doing.

I  would  say  that  after  looking,  I  still  come  to  the

conclusion that our education is one of the strongest in  the

world, catering to the weak students as well as to the strong

students.   While we may criticise our education system  and,

very often, we are our own harshest critics, and it is as  it

should  be,  we  should remember that it  is  a  system  that

substantially  works  very  well  and  that  when   we   make

adaptations to it, it is to strengthen the system and to make

it  better, and not to dismantle the whole system  and  throw

away parts of it which really are working very well and which

many  other countries are coming to Singapore to have a  look

at.   When  I  visit  other countries  I  ask  them  as  many

questions  as  they ask me.  So bear that  in  mind  when  we

discuss our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the Ministry of Education has

taken a hard look at what we are doing. Re-examining and  re-affirming  fundamental beliefs and practices where these  are

still  relevant,  and setting in place necessary  changes  to

take our education system to the next stage of development.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.55 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1998, the Ministry published the Desired

Outcomes  of  Education, which set out the end-objectives  of

formal education.  These outcomes encapsulate  the skills and

values which are important for our young to have, not just in

the  new economy, but also in the new globalised world.   How

do  we  keep our people as one, united and cohesive? We  have

also introduced measures to bring us closer to achieving  the

Desired Outcomes.  These include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiating key programmes, such as the IT Masterplan,

National Education, and the Community Involvement Programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the way that we assess students and appraise

schools  to  re-orientate the focus of the education  system;

basically changing what counts.  Because if we do not  change

what counts, then the behaviour, as many Members have pointed

out,  will continue to be the same.  But we have to strike  a

balance  between what counts. Among the things that  count  I

think that it is still important for students to do well.  It

is  still important for them to do well in examinations.   If

we want to be creative, we have to start from some basis.  An

architect cannot design a house if he does not understand the

mechanics  and the basic relationships between  things.   The

house  may  not  stand.  So we have to have the  basics  upon

which  we  can  build so that people do have a platform  from

which  to  lead further forward.  One example  that  we  have

changed is  the  new university admission system which  moves

away  from the current reliance on the `A' level examinations

towards  a more well-rounded evaluation of a person's ability

and  potential.  Other  areas  that  we  have  introduced  to

recognise  other areas of achievement are Edusave Awards  for

Sports, the Arts and Community Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I also shared with Members the important

shift  we  are  making  in  the  education  system,  from  an

efficiency-driven  system  to  an  ability-driven   paradigm.

Under  this  new paradigm, the emphasis will be on developing

and  harnessing of the talents and abilities of every  child,

to  the  maximum  extent possible, through a mass  customised

approach in Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has asked whether it is really

possible  to  mass customise education.  To some extent,  our

education system is already mass customised.  Since 1980,  we

have    ability-based   streaming.    This    has    provided

opportunities for students of different aptitudes to learn at

a  pace  that  they are comfortable with. I  know  that  many

Members  have raised a number of times, Dr Lee for the  first

time  for  herself, but many times for the rest of us,  about

streaming.   Actually, streaming has provided the opportunity

for students of different abilities and aptitudes to progress

and do well in education where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>



otherwise  they  may  have dropped out.  The  statistics  are

there to  be seen.  In 1980, before streaming, nearly 24%  of

the P1 cohort attained  5 `O' levels or more. With streaming,

the proportion attaining at least 5 `O' levels has increased.

It  was 59% last year.  So streaming has allowed many more of

our  students  to benefit from the education  system  whereas

otherwise they might have not.  Because if we have  a  system

in  which everybody is forced to take four years to take  the

'O'  level  and  it is the only benchmark, then  many  people

would not be able to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our system today, if you can do it in four years, you

do  it  in four years.  If you need five years, you do it  in

five years.  If 'O' level is not your cup of tea, and you are

more  inclined towards something practical and so  on,  there

are  other programmes that you can take, and you can move  on

to  post-secondary education and further education, and there

are cross-over paths.   So the doors are not closed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Inderjit Singh is probably looking at the

past with rose-tinted spectacles.  If I recall, when I was in

school,  we  always had people being collected in classes  of

different abilities.  We have "A" class, "B" class, "C" class

and  so forth.  I am not sure which school Mr Inderjit  Singh

went to.   But most of us have been to schools where that has

been  the  practice.  Teaching students in  a  mixed  ability

group poses considerable problems because some students would

be  bored, some cannot cope and the teachers would  not  know

where  to pitch the lesson.  But outside the class, in  other

settings, the students work together, play together  and  mix

together.    I  remember  in  my  school,  we  idolised   the

sportsmen.   They  may  not have been  the  top  in  academic

performance but they were the top in sports. So there  was  a

mixing and mutual respect among the different students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mass customisation of education has also taken place in

other ways.  We have introduced programmes to cater to groups

of  students with special abilities or who need more support.

For example, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>



have elective programmes in languages, art and music already.

We have the learning support programme for P1 and P2 students

to  boost their English proficiency level because some of the

students  come  to  P1  and P2 and have difficulty  with  the

language.  And because of difficulty with the language,  they

have  difficulty with the other subjects.  So we have managed

to  mass  customise for these children so that we  can  boost

their   reading  age  and  the  programme  has   been   quite

successful.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some Members have pointed out, the Ministry is also

encouraging  autonomous  schools to develop  niche  areas  to

nurture the talents and abilities of their students, and  has

widened the entry requirements so that those with talent  and

interest in these niche areas, but who may not have qualified

strictly  on academic results, can still gain admission.   So

this is another signal that there are other things which  can

be  considered other than pure academic results.  But, do not

forget, academic results are still important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next several years in Education will focus on the

implementation  of strategies and plans to encourage  further

mass  customisation of education on a wider scale, so  as  to

bring about ability-driven education in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has asked what are our areas of priorities. I

will  focus  on  the four key areas that we are  working  on.

They are: hardware and infrastructure; the curriculum; school

management; and people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, touch briefly on hardware and

infrastructure.  Dr Wang and Mr Hawazi Daipi have asked about

the  progress  of the Single Session Programme for  secondary

schools and the IT Masterplan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that with the exception

of  four  secondary schools whose transition  to  the  single

session system is tied to the completion of their new  school

buildings, MOE has met



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>



its  target of having all secondary schools go single-session

by this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the IT Masterplan is also progressing

as  planned.  It is currently at the half-way mark, and  thus

far  has  met  all  its targets, and this has  put  Singapore

really at the forefront in the world in terms of readiness of

our  schools, teachers and students for IT.  I  will  ask  Mr

Peter Chen to elaborate on the status of these two programmes

a little later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, putting in place the hardware and infrastructure is

necessary  but not sufficient.  We also need to  ensure  that

the  "software"  in our education system is  aligned  to  the

Desired  Outcomes.  Let me mention two at this  point  -  the

curriculum and school management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Desired Outcomes spell out the general attributes

which  our young should possess at the end of each  stage  of

formal  education.  But these outcomes need to be  translated

into  specific  skills and values which the  curriculum  will

deliver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has spent some time, over the past year,

thinking  through  and distilling from the Desired  Outcomes,

the set of core skills and values which schools should aim to

develop  in  their  students.   I  would  ask  the  Clerk  of

Parliament  to  please distribute the  handout.   [Copies  of

handout distributed to hon. Members.].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight core skills and values have been identified. They

are:  Character  Development; Self-Management Skills;  Social

and   Cooperative  Skills;  Literacy  and  Numeracy   Skills;

Communication    Skills;   Information   Skills;    Knowledge

Application Skills; and Thinking Skills and Creativity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that this is [indicating] supposed to look

like  a tree, with the leaves up there, and the stem and  the

branches.  So basically what happens is that the core  skills

are  the ones which are the horizontal bars at the bottom and

they are taught, delivered through the curriculum, which  are

vertical  bars,  and  the tree grows  and  flowers  into  the

Desired Outcomes of Education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are being used now as part of the framework for the

revision of the various syllabuses which is now ongoing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran, Mr Kenneth Chen, and Mr Davinder Singh have

all  raised  issues related to how we can  achieve  this,  in

particular,  the progress made by the Ministry in  developing

thinking  skills  and creativity, and strengthening  National

Education in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, thinking skills and creativity. Since last year,

we  have  implemented the Thinking Skills  programme  in  all

secondary  schools,  and it has worked  well.   Students  now

apply  these thinking skills to the learning of the different

subjects  in  the  curriculum.  The  feedback  that  we  have

received  has  been positive - the programme has  helped  the

students  to enhance their ability to think rationally  about

issues,   to  approach  problems  creatively,  and  to   make

decisions confidently based on sound judgement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Thinking Skills programme, the Ministry is

also  introducing  Inter-disciplinary  Project  Work  to  all

schools  over  this year and next year.  And eventually  when

the  system has settled down and we are confident of  it,  it

will   become  a  requirement  for  entrance  to  university.

Through  such  project work, students get to  appreciate  the

inter-connectedness of disciplines, acquire  useful  problem-solving and communication skills, and learn to work in teams,

all of which help to develop their creative capacity.  As  Mr

Davinder  Singh suggests, parents will then do  the  projects

for  the students.  There is not much that I can do about it.

Parents can do the homework for their children too.  I  think

parents  have to allow their children to learn on  their  own

and to grow and develop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, I informed this House that we had made a

cut in the current syllabuses while a comprehensive review of

the  syllabuses for all subjects is carried out.  The revised

syllabuses  and  instructional  materials,  which  will  give

greater  emphasis to the development of critical and creative

thinking  skills, and these core skills and  values  will  be

rolled out from next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to National Education. This programme

was  implemented  in schools since 1997.  Within  the  formal

curriculum,  National Education is incorporated  into  Social

Studies,  History, Geography and a few other subjects.   This

is  reinforced  by  the many programmes and activities  which

students  take part in.  Our students now commemorate  events

like  Racial  Harmony Day and International  Friendship  Day.

They   also  participate  in  activities,  such  as  Learning

Journeys, where they visit key national institutions such  as

sewerage treatment plants and refuse disposal plants.   These

are  all very instructive when you go and visit these plants,

and you get to learn what are the constraints of living in  a

city  and  how and why the streets are clean and the  air  is

fresh,  and  we  have  quite a healthy city.   Through  these

activities,  they  learn  about  respect  and  tolerance  for

Singaporeans  of different race and religion, and  acquire  a

deeper  understanding  and appreciation  of  the  challenges,

constraints and vulnerabilities facing Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of National Education, our students also take

part  in  the  Community  Involvement Programme,  where  they

undertake  projects to serve the community.   We  can  debate

about  whether the number of hours is enough and so on.   But

that  is a question of degree.  Last year, more than  400  of

our  JC  and  CI students participated in community  projects

outside of Singapore, in regional countries such as Malaysia,

Thailand,  Myanmar,  Vietnam  and  Nepal.   This   was   very

successful and we are working together with other agencies to

see how we can expand this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Education programme has contributed greatly

to a stronger social conscience and our students have come to

value  and  appreciate the good life they enjoy in  Singapore

and not to take things for granted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the National Education programme, many of the

core  skills and values are best learned not in the classroom

but  through activities outside the classroom.  Someone might

develop another Fosbury flop.  You never know.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE's recent move to re-name "Extra-Curricular

Activities" as Co-Curricular Activities is to send  a  strong

signal  to  our  principals,  teachers,  students  and  their

parents  that such activities are no longer "extra", but  are

an integral part of the curriculum and the development of the

students and the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also reinforced this emphasis on Co-Curricular

Activities   through   other   initiatives,   such   as   the

introduction of Sustained Achievement Awards for schools, and

a  new  category of Edusave awards, I mentioned earlier,  for

sports, arts and community service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community too can play its part in promoting

participation  in  co-curricular  activities  -  I  think   a

suggestion raised by Mdm Claire Chiang, she said only six,  I

wish  she  had more.   The schools, I am sure, if  they  find

them interesting and useful, will take them up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we can put in place key programmes like Thinking

Skills and National Education, and delineate core skills  and

values  which  the curriculum should deliver,  and  encourage

participation  in  areas which help  to  develop  these  core

skills and values, there is no set formula for achieving  the

Desired Outcomes.  Every child is different.  Each school has

to decide how best to meet the needs of its students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that curriculum time and resources are limited, it

is  important for school leadership to recognise that  it  is

not  possible  for them and their teachers to  do  everything

that  might  be  beneficial to students -  even  with  single

session schools.  With single session schools, the temptation

to  do ever more and more in the schools is very, very great.

But trying to do too much within the school curriculum and in

the schools can be counter-productive.  Students and teachers

will  be  overburdened.  They need some space and some  time.

So schools need to prioritise to ensure that the workload for

students and teachers remains manageable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help schools do so, the Ministry is working out

guidelines on how the different subjects and activities which

make  up  the  curriculum today contribute to developing  the

eight  core skills and values.  The guidelines will  be  made

known to schools later this year.  And this helps the schools

to  manage  their  time  and allocate  their  resources  more

effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move now to school management. We are unlikely to

produce  creative students unless we have innovative schools.

So  the  processes have to change.  I agree with the  Members

who  have spoken on the subject.  It is important to have the

right systems and policies in place in managing the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry recognises that mass customisation requires

a  judicious  mix  of  national policies  as  well  as  local

adaptations  and  initiatives.   For  example,  we  have   an

Education  Innovation Fund which was started at  the  end  of

1998.   There are 20-over projects running. Schools can apply

for  it,  and  they can try things.  There are  also  Cluster

Funds.   Schools can draw on these resources and try  things,

and  we  encourage  them.  Schools know the  needs  of  their

students better and also what their teachers are capable  of.

Hence, we plan to steadily give schools more autonomy:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the School Cluster scheme will be rolled out to

another  82  schools this year.  They add to the 168  schools

which  are  already grouped in 20 clusters.   The  scheme,  I

think, has been well-received by the schools, and it will  be

eventually  extended to all schools.  When that is  finished,

there will be about 40 clusters altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MOE will double the number of autonomous schools

from   the  current  number  of  18,  in  the  coming  years.

Autonomous schools will be given greater flexibility in their

student   intake  to  help  them  develop  into  schools   of

distinction  in selected niche areas.  By doing so,  we  hope

that they will spark new ideas and help uplift the quality of

the entire school system; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we are also reviewing how the Ministry HQ can be

better organised to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>



support schools.  We are not quite prepared yet to allow more

private  sector involvement in the primary and the  secondary

school sectors, although we have independent schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we give schools more autonomy, we need to ensure that

their  efforts  are  directed towards achieving  the  Desired

Outcomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help schools focus on the Desired Outcomes and to

reflect on what they are doing, the Ministry has adopted  the

School Excellence Model for all schools this year.  The Model

broadens  the  scope  of the way schools  are  appraised,  by

moving beyond academic grades to school achievements in other

areas which contribute to the Desired Outcomes.  Emphasis  is

given  not  only  to  results but the  processes  applied  to

achieving the results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there has been extended discussion on ranking.

We  are not the only people to do ranking.  We did not invent

this  idea.   In  fact, ranking was going on  in  many  other

countries already before we started.  In fact, our ranking is

a  very  mild ranking system.  We do not rank primary schools

at  all.  Some countries do.  We only rank the top 40  or  50

secondary schools, not all 160 or 170 of them.  So  it  is  a

very  mild form of ranking by comparison with the ranking  in

other places.  In many  states in the United States, they are

adopting  ranking with a vengeance.  They rank  schools  from

the  top to the bottom, every single one of them.  In the  US

and  the UK, the avowed aim of ranking in some places  is  to

name  and shame, so that schools will buck up and get on with

the work that they are supposed to be doing.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our ranking system is a very, very mild one, and it

serves  a  very useful purpose.  You will want to  know,  and

parents  want  to  know if there are two schools  which  have

roughly  the same resources, the same students at entry,  and

they produce quite different results.  Any sensible system of

management must know that such differences have occurred



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>



and  it  will  want  to know why and find out  so  that  best

practices can be transferred from one school to another.   If

we  do  not have a system for measuring such things, it  will

all be hit and miss.  There will be no method of knowing what

happens.  And in any case, it is a fiction to believe that if

we do not rank schools, people do not know.  Everybody knows.

Before  we ranked schools, people knew which schools were  at

the  top  and  which schools were not at the top.   It  is  a

fiction  to believe that if the newspapers stop reporting  on

who  the top student is, nobody will know who the top student

is.  These are things which parents legitimately want to know

and  we  should  help  them  to know  and  provide  them  the

information rather than hiding the information from  them  in

the  belief that if we did so, they would not know and nobody

would know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Ong Ah Heng for his comments on

the  School Excellence Model.  I agree with him that it  will

take  time  to  change  the  culture  in  schools,  and   the

perception  of  teachers  and  parents.   Feedback  from  the

schools which participated in the field-testing of the School

Excellence Model has generally been positive.  There  are  of

course  one  or two little things which have to be  resolved.

The  schools  have found the Model to be a  useful  tool  for

carrying  out  self-appraisal of how well they are  achieving

the  Desired Outcomes, and they have also found it useful  in

integrating and prioritizing the different initiatives in the

school.    It has helped them to re-orientate the outlook  of

their  teachers, to view education provided by the  different

departments  in  the  school in a more  holistic  and  inter-connected way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the measures mentioned earlier to give schools more

autonomy, and the School Excellence Model in place  to  guide

them towards achieving the Desired Outcomes, the Ministry  of

Education is confident that we can further mass customise  to

bring  about  ability-driven education in  our  schools,  and

create an innovative culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, the Ministry will continue to give

every support to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>





principals, teachers, and our HQ officers as well,  sometimes

they  are very much maligned to do their jobs well.  To solve

that  problem, we post the HQ officers and the teachers  back

and  forth.   There is a natural tendency for people  in  the

headquarters to say, "Well, the people in the schools  really

don't  know  what  they are doing.  You give  them  a  simple

instruction,  they  can't follow."  And  the  people  in  the

schools  would say the people in headquarters really  do  not

know  what  they  are  doing either because  how  could  they

possibly  give such an instruction, unless they  are  totally

ignorant of what is happening in the school. The way to solve

it  is to post them back and forth.   So in the end, they end

up   scolding  themselves.   That  will  solve  the  problem.

Several  Members are scheduled to speak later on the  subject

of teachers.   So I will elaborate on the people issues after

I have had the benefit of their views and suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members have asked how would we know how

successful  we  are.   What are the  benchmarks?   There  are

quantitative   measures,   such   as   ranking,   comparisons

internationally,  and so on.  But there are  others,  perhaps

more  long term, more intangible measures, but more important

ones which we may not be able to measure very well.  Will our

people  remain employable in the future?  Will we  really  be

able  to  venture  forth with new inventions, technopreneurs,

and so on?  It is very hard to measure that and attribute  it

and make the connection directly with the education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will our nation remain cohesive and united? The

education system has a part to play in it but it is  not  the

only  player.   Some  of  these  things  are  intangible  and

imponderable and we will not know.  We will know when we will

have  succeeded, we will know when we will fail, but  to  try

and  measure it along the way is not so easy.  But as Members

have said, we cannot stand still.  The world is changing, the

environment around us is changing.  So we must move on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude this section, when I visit schools, the

principals and teachers I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>



spoken  to  have  welcomed the increased  autonomy  as  being

timely.  They see it as an opportunity to bring out more from

every  child,  to  raise the quality of education  to  a  new

level.  This augurs well for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I in the Ministry HQ will give them

our  full support.  But our efforts alone will not be enough.

We  will also need parents, the community, and in particular,

Members of this House, to continue to give their support  and

ideas  as we strive to help them meet the challenges  of  the

new economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will request Mr Peter Chen to give an update on the

IT Masterplan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh wants to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, as far as I remember, we have

no  streaming  in our primary school.  The only  time  I  got

segregated from the rest of my classmates was after  my  PSLE

examination.  And the next streaming was at secondary 3  when

we  were  streamed to Science or Arts stream.  So the  system

that  I  went  through did not have any streaming  until  the

PSLE.   So  I actually cannot understand the system  that  he

went through.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> We have been in schools and there

have  always  been A classes, B classes and C classes.   That

also  is  a  form of ability streaming.  I am sure  that  the

school that Mr Inderjit Singh went to must have had some form

of that too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> To clarify, the day that I went into

my  class, we never streamed after that.  In fact,  I  cannot

remember  whether  it was A or B.  But we went  through  that

together,  none  of  my classmates got  segregated  into  the

various streams as we went along.  Yes, it might have been  A

or  B.   But  we had nothing to measure how we were  streamed

into A or B the day that we went into primary 1.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> It seems this is clarification time.

May  I get the Minister's clarification on my comment on  the

requirement for the 3rd year medical students having to resit

their examinations?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> My apologies. There were two

points  that  Dr Wang raised, one was the third year  medical

students examination.  The other one was P1 registration.  P1

registration is a very complex matter.  We try  to  strike  a

balance  between  many, many factors.  If  Dr  Wang  has  any

suggestion  on how I can solve this problem, please  tell  me

and I will implement it straightaway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 3rd year medical examinations I think this is a

matter  which I will leave to the university.  The university

has to take these things seriously and I am sure they do, and

the  academic  matters  are matters  for  the  university  to

settle.   And they have to make sure that the integrity,  the

reliability of the assessment system that they have including

the examination is maintained and the people have confidence.

So  this is a matter which I will leave to the university  to

resolve  and I am confident that they will get to the  bottom

of  this.   If there is a mistake made, they will correct  it

and they will restore the confidence in the system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not responded

to my speech.  I do not know whether he is going to respond.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I am unable to respond to Mr Low's

speech  because  he made some very general remarks,  some  of

which  can be attributable to the education system, but  some

of  which  cannot.  So I am not quite sure how to respond  to

his  speech.  It seems to me that Mr Low was suggesting  that

we  go  back  to a segregated education system where  we  put

emphasis  on Chinese, and so forth.  We had a long debate  in

this  House on SAP schools, and whether they are suitable  or

not.  I am not sure what Mr Low was suggesting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, in fact, I asked a specific

question as to whether the survey that I referred to is  part

of  the  desired outcomes that the Ministry aims to have  and

whether  it  is the objective of the Ministry  to  promote  a

sense  of  national identity and thereby minimise the  ethnic

identity.  It is specific.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, this was not a survey

conducted by the Ministry.  So I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>



unable  to  comment on the detailed results.  But whether  or

not  we  want to build national identity, the answer is  yes.

Whether we want to have the students understand their  ethnic

roots,  the  answer is yes.  But if I heard Mr Low correctly,

he  was asking to go further than that.  He was asking why we

have not done more for the Chinese sense of identity, and  he

was  attributing it to our teaching English in  the  schools,

and  so on.  I am not sure exactly what Mr Low is suggesting.

But  it  seems to me that he was suggesting quite a departure

from  what  we  have as principles in our national  education

system  and  perhaps even advocating going back to  where  we

were in the 50s.  I would not support that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> I just want to follow up on Mr

Inderjit Singh's point because it seems in response to me the

Minister  has  said that there were a lot of  benefits  after

streaming  came  in.  The results became a  lot  better.   In

response  to  Mr Inderjit, he said that there  was  streaming

before  in the form of A, B and C classes.  So I am not  sure

what was the streaming before, in whatever form, or was there

no  streaming  before, and therefore all those good  results,

were  they that clearly identifiable to streaming in the  way

that we have it now.  The other point which I want to say is:

is  there  not  some other way of helping the  slow  students

apart from this very clear and distinct segregation?



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh was making the

point  that  students were never segregated  in  any  way  by

ability.  And the point that I was making is that that is not

true.   That has been going on for quite a long time  in  the

schools as it goes on in practically every school system that

I  know of.  Specifically, on streaming, the time that I  was

going  to school and probably the time Mr Inderjit was  going

to  school, I am not sure how much younger he is, we did  not

have such a wide variety in streaming.  In fact, for many  of

the  students  who  were  unable to cope,  they  just  simply

dropped out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as recently as seven years ago, before we

introduced the Normal (Technical) stream in the secondary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>



schools, something like 15% of our students were not going to

secondary schools, because they went to Primary 6, did not do

well, went to Primary 7 and Primary 8.  And some of them went

to  the  old  VITB, and some left and went to the  workforce.

But  with the Normal (Technical) stream, for example, in  our

secondary schools, these students now have the opportunity to

go  to  secondary schools when they otherwise might not have.

In  these four years in the secondary school, they get a much

stronger  foundation in Mathematics, in Science, in language,

which  allows them to go on to post-secondary education.   Mr

Peter Chen is very proud of the fact that something like  75%

of  them have gone on to ITE, something which they would  not

have been able to do before.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I thought the Minister would

not  want to respond because the survey was not conducted  by

the  Ministry  or  not  related to the Government.   But  the

second part of my speech is related to the Ministry, ie,  the

school's  attitude  towards students  and  failing   to  give

students  a  second chance.  Is their attitude  going  to  be

helpful  in bringing out the results of the Desired  Outcomes

of Education?



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> In the particular case of this

student,  he  did  go  to school and he  did  get  very  good

results.  So I am not sure what point Mr Low is making.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the point is that there were

schools  which refused to accept him.  Of course, he went  to

school  at the end of the day.  But the fact is that  he  has

gone  through quite a lot of schools and obviously there were

schools  which  had  the  attitude that  since  he  had  this

problem, it was better for them not to accept him.   Is  this

the right attitude of the schools?



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Low was making a general point

that  these  people do not have a second chance.  This  young

man  had a second chance and he did very well in school.  And

I   am   very  happy  for  him.    When  students  run   into

difficulties,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2388</b></font><br><br>



they sometimes find it better to move to another school, to a

new environment, where they can make a fresh start.  That may

be  a  sensible thing to do, than to continue in  the  school

that he is currently in.  And sometimes because of that, they

blossom, they solve their problems and they do well.  If that

is  the  case,  then that is good.  Sometimes,  when  meeting

students   who  have  had  difficulties  in  the  past,   the

principals would want to talk to the students and the parents

and  say, "Look, are you willing to buckle down, resolve  not

to get into the difficulties that you had in the past, buckle

down  and  get down to work?  If you are, come.  If  you  are

not,  even if you come to this school or that school and  you

continue  with your past practices, you are not going  to  do

well."   When faced with such a choice, sometimes they buckle

down,  and  they  get down to work.  They  get  their  second

chance and they do well.  Sometimes, they do not.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. RAdm Teo, I think that is enough.

We have to proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> One more clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Just one more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Will there be a situation whereby

every  school  will  say that the student refuses  to  buckle

down?   Is it possible that a student who may have made  some

mistakes in the past could end up with no school to go to?



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> If there are students who wish to

continue with their education and no school would admit them,

please  let me know.  I know of no such case.  But  if  there

are  students who do not take their education seriously, they

go to school and create difficulties, not just for the school

but  for  the other students, and make it difficult  for  the

other  students to study, then, I would think very  carefully

about whether or not we want to insist on having that student

attend  school  and  sit in the class. I have  received  many

letters from parents on subjects like that too, complaining,"

Why did you allow this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2389</b></font><br><br>



student  to continue in this class where my child is  because

he  is  creating a nuisance?"  But the schools  actually  try

very  hard  to  allow the students to stay. The teachers  are

very compassionate and they try their very best to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Sir, thank you for finally allowing me to come in at

this stage to speak on behalf of my Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last few years, the Ministry of Education

has  rolled out various initiatives to put in place  hardware

and  infrastructure that will support our schools in bringing

about  an  ability-driven education.  I will  now  take  this

opportunity  to share with Members our progress  in  some  of

these initiatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi has asked about the status of the

Masterplan  for  IT in Education that was launched  in  1997.

The  Masterplan, which is being implemented in three  phases,

has met all its targets thus far:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 1 involving 22 schools has been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 2, involving another 108 schools, will be

completed  by  the  middle of this year.  These  schools  are

fully-networked  and  have  access  to  MOE's  Intranet,  the

Internet and Singapore ONE.  Start-up targets for students to

computer  ratio have also been met.  I wish to  explain  here

that the target that has been met is the start-up target, and

for  secondary schools and junior colleges, the  ratio  is  5

students  to  1.  The Ministry of Education will  review  the

need to go beyond this particular ratio.   We will  go beyond

this  ratio when we are satisfied that the equipment  can  be

fully made use of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some concern that neighbourhood schools

may not have enough computers for their use.  I would like to

point  out also that although the overall ratio is 5:1, there

are  some  segments  in our schools, and  in  particular  the

Normal  (Technical) Stream, the ratio is  much,  much  better

than  that.  It is a matter of need, and whether or  not  the

equipment can be well used.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some concern expressed that teachers

themselves  may not have enough computers.  I would  like  to

point  out  that  there  is a computer  purchase  scheme  for

teachers. Under the scheme for desktops, teachers pay 80%  of

the  cost, with MOE subsidising the balance, and if it  is  a

laptop  or  notebook, teachers pay only 60% of the cost,  the

rest  being borne by the Ministry.   To date, there are 8,000

teachers  who have taken advantage of the scheme.   All  this

has  enabled  about 15% of formal curriculum  time  in  these

schools to be IT-enriched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full implementation of the third and final phase of the

Masterplan  for the remaining schools has already begun,  and

is scheduled to finish in the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the setting up of a central unit to source, review

and  recommend suitable resources, schools can  now  purchase

from a wide selection of courseware and electronic resources.

In  areas  where there is a lack of good educational software

in  the  market,  the  Ministry has collaborated  with  local

industry to produce the software.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole-school approach has been adopted in the training

of teachers to create a critical mass of teachers who are IT-savvy  and  help  the IT culture take root  more  quickly  in

schools.   We  have  so far completed IT training  for  6,500

teachers  in  the Phase 1 and Phase 2 schools.  By  September

this  year,  another 15,500 teachers in the Phase  3  schools

will  be IT-trained.  Teachers receive an average of 40 hours

of training in IT.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some concern expressed whether or not the

older  teachers may be able to cope with it.   I  would  also

like to point out that under the training programme, there is

an  arrangement  called  "hand holding  sessions".  In  these

sessions,  the  teachers and colleagues and their  peers  all

come together and those who are IT savvy will help the others

who  are  less  so  in sharing their knowledge  and  even  in

designing  courses which are IT-enriched.  There  is  special

attention given to this.  We know that not all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>



teachers  can move at the same pace, just as not all students

can move at the same pace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Masterplan goes beyond the provision of

hardware,  infrastructure and training.  It has also  put  in

place  a  clear policy on the use of IT in education that  is

widely  supported by principals.  This has  helped  to  bring

about  a mindset change in the way schools make use of IT  in

their instructional programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our students are reaping the benefits of the IT

Masterplan  not  only through IT-enriched lessons,  but  also

participation in IT-based projects with students  from  other

schools, both local and overseas.  These projects have helped

to   broaden  the  outlook  of  our  students,  and  provided

opportunities for them to learn IT and teamwork skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has asked MOE to consider including

technology  as  a  compulsory subject.  We  share  Mrs  Lim's

objective of ensuring that our young are technology literate.

We have chosen to achieve this objective by first building  a

strong  foundation in Mathematics and Science throughout  our

entire  education system, and also by infusing IT in subjects

and  other learning activities.  Our aim is for our  students

in  general  to  learn to make the best  use  of  information

technology  in particular in their own learning, rather  than

for  them  to  study the subject of technology in  isolation.

But  for  students  who are technically inclined,  there  are

specialised subjects like Computer Applications and Computing

which they may take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is also widely acknowledged internationally to

be  a  leader in the use of IT in education.  In  the  recent

Second Information Technology in Education Study (SITES),  an

international   study   involving  26   other   participating

countries  and  economies, including  Japan  and  Hong  Kong,

Singapore  was  ranked  top in having a  clearly  articulated

policy on the use of IT, the provision of some of the world's

best  computers and peripherals to schools, and  IT  training

for its teachers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>



Our  students  have  also  won top  awards  in  international

website   design   competitions  like   Thinkquest   Internet

Challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to Single Session Programme for secondary

schools.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen has asked about the Single Session

Programme  for  secondary schools and how these  schools  are

adapting to the single-session system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the Single Session Programme is a

significant step forward for our secondary schools.   It  has

allowed  schools to benefit from greater flexibility  in  the

use  of  curriculum  time and resources,  a  wider  range  of

enrichment  programmes  to  cater to  students  of  different

abilities  and family backgrounds, and a more vibrant  school

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single-session system is still relatively new for

many  of  our  schools  and  MOE  has  been  monitoring   its

implementation.   So far, we are generally pleased  with  the

ways  schools have made use of the single-session  system  to

enrich  the  learning experiences of their pupils.   We  will

continue  to  provide advice and guidance to the  schools  in

their  implementation,  and help them  to  strike  a  balance

between  optimising  the  use  of  their  resources  and  not

overloading our teachers and students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has suggested during the Budget debate

last  week that we boost the number of construction  projects

by building new schools and upgrading old ones.  The Ministry

of  Education builds and upgrades schools to meet educational

objectives.   If these activities provide a welcome  stimulus

to  the construction industry, it will be an added bonus.  In

the  last  two  years, we have been constructing  new  school

buildings  at  the rate of about 12 per year.  Members  would

also be aware that in May last year, my Ministry launched the

Programme  for  Rebuilding  and  IMproving  Existing  schools

(PRIME).  Under PRIME, a total of 290 schools will either  be

rebuilt  or  upgraded  over a period of  seven  years  at  an

estimated cost of $4.5 billion.  Thereafter, we will  upgrade

schools to the prevailing standard once every 5 years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIME will be implemented in 5 phases. There are 96

schools in Phase 1.  To date, the construction for 9 of these

schools has been completed and construction for most  of  the

other schools is scheduled to complete by the end of 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, putting in place the necessary hardware and

infrastructure  has  great influence on total  education  and

children's achievement in school.  The Ministry will continue

to   strive  to  provide  the  best  school  facilities   and

environment  to afford students a broad range of  educational

activities and programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

in  October  last  year, the Ministry of Education  announced

that  it  was  retraining  more than 8,000  English  language

teachers   on   the   teaching   of   English   Grammar   and

conversational skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people cannot help asking what has gone wrong with

our  education system that so many English language  teachers

have  to be retrained.  I hope that by doing so, the Ministry

of  Education will not deal a heavy blow on the morale of our

teachers, and I sincerely hope that the parents will not lose

their confidence in the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to 10 years ago, our primary and secondary

students  are consistently scoring better results in English.

This is mainly attributable to the efforts of the teachers in

preparing   the students for the examinations. But now,  they

are  sent  back  to  the classroom for retraining.  I  think,

basically,  the problem does not lie with the  teachers,  but

rather it was because the Ministry of Education had failed to

take  into  consideration the expectation of the  public  and

private  sectors on the school graduates.  As such,  I  would

like  to  appeal  to  MOE  to  touch base  with  the  various

Government  agencies and the business community to  establish

the  actual  requirement of the employers on the  proficiency

level of the graduates in conversational and written English,

so  as  to  set  the appropriate and relevant   standard  for

passing, for the teachers and students to follow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bilingual education policy, in order for our

students to spend more time and energy to learn English,  the

learning  of the mother tongue is lowered to that of   second

language  or  even to a "B" standard.  Psychologically,  they

would  not be able to put in full efforts to learn the mother

tongue  well.   Consequently, when  they  leave  school,  the

standard  of  their  mother tongue  proficiency  will  be  so

inadequate that it will be rendered useless.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to feedback from the business community,

generally  speaking, there is plenty of room for  improvement

in  the  ability  to  write  Chinese  and  English   for  our

university  graduates. Therefore, the Ministry  of  Education

should  look at this matter squarely, and conduct a  thorough

review  to improve our bilingual policy.  This is  to  ensure

that  graduates  of  our  primary and secondary  schools  and

tertiary institutions have enough proficiency in both English

and   their  mother  tongue  to  prepare  for  their   future

employment,  and  do not treat the passing of  the  requisite

examination as the sole purpose of learning these languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also announced that we must use the

teaching  of the mother tongue to inculcate understanding  of

the students' own mother tongue culture and heritage, and  to

enhance their moral values as well as a sense of belonging to

society and the nation.  But for those who have opted for the

mother  tongue  (B) paper, because of the constraint  in  the

contents  of their lessons, they may lose the opportunity  of

learning  the  moral  values through the learning  of  mother

tongue.  I do not know whether the Ministry of Education  has

any remedy for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year on 19th March, at the sitting of

Parliament, I proposed that the Ministry of Education  should

introduce  Malay  language  as a non-examination  subject  in

primary  and secondary schools.  I am glad to  know that  the

Chinese  High  School  and Nanyang Girls'  High  School  have

already introduced such lessons.  I suggest that the Ministry

of Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>



give  substantial  assistance  in  sending  more  good  Malay

teachers to conduct such courses in more schools so that more

students   can  learn  Malay,  thereby  strengthening   their

understanding of the Malay language and culture, and laying a

stronger  foundation for the promotion of our social  harmony

and friendly ties with our neighbouring countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have a slightly different

view.   I  think at least the  result of what the Member  was

talking  about  is  that  our university  graduates  are  not

proficient  in both English and Chinese languages   precisely

because we have had too much emphasis placed on mother tongue

in our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the recent changes in allowing

students the flexibility in choosing different mother  tongue

options  through the implementation of the CL(B),  ML(B)  and

TL(B) options are good and timely.  That is going to make  it

even  more difficult to be proficient.  I feel that all  this

time,  we  have placed too much emphasis on mother tongue  in

deciding  on  the  streaming  of  students,  computation   of

aggregate  marks  for the PSLE and other  school  examination

levels.   This  has  resulted in unfair ranking  and  student

performance measurements.  Many students who did very well in

all  other subjects, but did badly in the mother tongue  were

penalised by streaming them to lower streams or in  them  not

getting the best subject options in secondary schools.  While

I  am  not  doubting the importance of learning one's  mother

tongue,  I however feel that it is about time we changed  the

way  we  treat  this subject as compared to  the  other  more

important  subjects in the school system.  Mother  tongue  is

important  but, as a subject, I think we need  to  reconsider

how we treat it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not going to create successful knowledge

workers  by  doing well in the mother tongue  subject  alone.

But because of the importance and heavy weightage we place on

this  subject  in deciding things in our school  system,  our

children end up spending a disproportionately longer time  in

studying this subject,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2396</b></font><br><br>



and  I think some Members talked about a lot of time is spent

on  studying the mother tongue, tuition and extra classes and

so  on,  so much so that you leave very little time  for  the

three  other  important subjects  - Mathematics, Science  and

English.   I  therefore feel that it is about  time  that  we

stopped  using  the mother tongue subject  as  a  restrictive

gauge to measure a student's academic ability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister three questions.

First  of all, will he consider changing the education policy

to  place  less  weightage on the mother  tongue  subject  in

computing  the  landmark  examinations'  aggregate  score  by

placing  more emphasis on subjects like mathematics,  science

and  English?  While we can still place some weightage on it,

I think the weightage needs to be much reduced, and we should

emphasise  more on the other subjects.  Because we are  using

this  to measure whether the student did well or not, whether

this student is going to become a scholar or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in practising streaming, will he consider

excluding completely the mother tongue subject as a criterion

for  measure?   While we can measure all the other  subjects,

maybe we should not use mother tongue as a criterion.   As  I

mentioned, the current practice is unfair for those  who  may

have  done  very  well in other subjects but  not  in  mother

tongue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, will he relook at the university admission

criteria  and maybe we should exclude this mother tongue pass

requirement  at  'O'  levels  as an  admission  criterion  to

university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel we have already achieved our objective of

requiring  every Singaporean to learn his mother  tongue,  in

order  not to lose our traditions and cultures.  But  I  feel

that  we  now  need to look into the future and not  let  the

mother  tongue  be an obstacle in developing  our  own  local

talents to be world ready.



<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I welcome the

steps  by  the Ministry of  Education to upgrade the learning

of  Malay  language in schools.  I am very impressed  by  the

policy of the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>



Education  to  allow every Malay to study Malay language  all

the time and also to the highest level that he is capable of.

Having  reached the objective of ensuring that Malay students

are taught effectively, we have to give focus on the standard

of the Malay language among our students.  Often, we find and

we  meet  our Malay students who speak Malay in poor  syntax.

The  syntax  is based on English.  Often, their speeches  are

mixed with English words.  If we want to upgrade the standard

of  our  Malay  language, it is important that we  take  firm

action  to  draw up good teaching programmes so that  we  can

produce students who have a high proficiency in Malay.  These

are  the students who will be taking Malay at a higher  level

from primary five to university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language is the spirit of the people and language

reflects  the  identity  of the people  and  community.   The

language  is  to channel our heritage to the next generation.

So it is very important for us to focus on our young students

so  that they can learn Malay at a higher standard.  I  would

like to ask the Minister for Education what are his plans  to

upgrade the learning of the Malay language in the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education will be conducting a

programme to develop talent called MAS or gold glitters.   We

hope that the talents will glitter and this will start in the

Bukit  Panjang High School next year.  If this plan succeeds,

I  would  like to ask whether this plan can also be conducted

in  other  schools in the eastern part of Singapore,  because

there are many Malay students living in the eastern area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to move to the achievements of Malay

students at PSLE, 'O', 'A/O' and 'A' levels.  I would like to

ask  how many Malay students have achieved A star at PSLE and

A1  in  the  'O' and 'A/O' levels.  I have received  feedback

from  a number of students in the better schools in Singapore

that they find difficulty in achieving excellent results, ie,

A1 at 'A' and 'A/O' levels.  Is this true?  And what would be

the  comparison  with  the  results  in  Mandarin  and  Tamil

subjects?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister for Education

whether excellent Malay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>



students  who achieved the top 10% or 20% will be allowed  to

learn  Mandarin, as a third language at secondary  level.   I

understand that they are allowed to take German, Japanese and

French.   I would like to suggest why not we allow  them,  if

they  want  to,  to  learn Mandarin  as  well.   I  say  this

following  from  the  steps taken  by  two  SAP  schools,  as

mentioned  earlier  by Mr Tay, ie, Chinese  High  School  and

Nanyang  Girls'  High  School, to allow  their  students  the

opportunity to learn Malay at secondary one and two.  I think

this  is  a  step ahead towards closer relations between  the

communities in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I would like, first of

all,  to  declare  that I am a member  of  the  Malay  Review

Committee formed by the Ministry of Education to improve  the

teaching  of Malay in schools.  As a member of the committee,

I  chair  an advisory group which obtains feedback  from  the

community on the problems in learning and teaching of  Malay,

and the means towards improving them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Malay community supports the decision of

the  Ministry  of  Education to meet  the  needs  of  various

interests in relation to the teaching of Malay.  The  concern

is  the  need  to  enhance the proficiency in  Malay  amongst

students  and  to give opportunity for capable  students  who

want  to  take higher Malay to do so.  This has been done  at

secondary  and junior college levels.  It is also a  proposal

that  teacher  candidates with the capability be  allowed  to

take  Malay  studies up to honours level.  The  Ministry  has

taken  steps  to open degree course studies to honours  level

for capable teacher candidates at NIE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are not able to study Malay as a second

language,  like other students, are given the flexibility  to

take  the Malay (B) subject.  This has also been welcomed  by

parents.   I believe Indian parents also welcome the decision

by  the  Ministry to allow students taking Tamil language  to

take TL(B).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, generally, the Ministry's decision relating to

second language teaching is good, I would like to suggest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>



that  a  number  of feedback and suggestions  raised  at  the

previous session be given attention, particularly on the need

to  give  wider  opportunities to Malay teachers  to  upgrade

their  knowledge on Malay language and their ability to teach

the  subject.   This  is because there are  concerns  on  the

quality  of  teaching staff, particularly young teachers  who

studied  Malay at only second language level  when they  were

in  school.   To overcome this situation, among  the  younger

teachers,  there  were  suggestions that  the  Malay  Studies

Department  at  the National University of Singapore  or  NIE

offer  honours and MA courses to eligible candidates in Malay

language.  In other words, they want wider opportunities  for

eligible candidates.  Among younger teachers who teach  Malay

language  as ML2, there is also hope that wider opportunities

be open to them to upgrade their skills in using and teaching

Malay.   I think this reflects their desire to be better  ML2

teachers and I would support their hopes.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, they should have teachers who are able

to  impart  moral  and cultural values in Malay  through  the

teaching of second language generally.  We should upgrade the

abilities  of  the  second language teachers,  including  ML2

teachers,  by  using better and more interesting  methods  so

that  students  will be motivated to learn the  subject,  not

just  to pass examinations or to go to institutions of higher

learning,  but  to appreciate the language as an  element  of

their  culture.   We need more teachers who  are  capable  of

teaching  the  language because generally Malay students  are

less proficient in speaking Malay.  Our teachers should be an

example  and motivator for the development of more  effective

speakers  of  Malay  in the country.  Besides  improving  the

curriculum,  this  can  be achieved  if  the  skills  of  our

teachers in speaking and using the language and also to teach

the language are upgraded.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, the recent initiatives announced by

the Ministry of Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>



arising  from  the review of the Tamil language teaching  and

education  in our schools has been welcomed by the community.

I  have  had the privilege of being a member of the Committee

that  the  Minister chaired to review the education of  Tamil

language  and  also chaired an Advisory Committee  to  obtain

feedback from the community on this matter.  I must say  that

in  general the recommendations accord well with the feedback

we   received   from  the  community,  in   particular,   the

observations pertaining to the standard of the language as it

is  taught  in our schools and the methodology  used  in  the

teaching  of  the  language.   In particular,  the  community

welcomes  the  Minister's assurance  and  commitment  on  two

counts.   The  first was that the standard of Tamil  language

would  be set at a level appropriate to our circumstances  in

Singapore  and at a level which would also enable  reasonable

students   with  reasonable  effort  to  achieve   reasonable

results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two reasons why this is important.

Firstly,  a  growing proportion of students from Tamil  homes

speak  English as the main language.  In fact, more than  50%

use  English predominantly in their home and this  proportion

is  likely to increase as the trend suggests.  Secondly,  the

social and cultural context in Singapore is different to that

in  India or, in particular, Tamil Nadu, which would be  used

as  a  benchmark for Tamil.  Therefore, any standard that  we

derive  from such external sources must be suitably  adjusted

for our local context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of the Minister's assurance pertains

to  the  accessibility  to Tamil language  during  curriculum

hours  in our schools and there the Minister stated  that  it

would  be  maintained at the present levels.  In  particular,

three   out  of  four  primary  schools  offer  Tamil  during

curriculum hours and more than half of the secondary schools,

I  believe 53%, offer Tamil during curriculum hours as  well.

In addition, the Ministry will be enhancing this availability

at  the  secondary level through cluster schools.  These  are

all  very welcome initiatives on this score because this  has

been  the  bane of many students and, for that matter,  their

parents, who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2401</b></font><br><br>



taking  Tamil  because  they have to miss  out  on  the  core

curriculum  opportunities as well as  remedial  opportunities

that might have occurred outside curriculum time because they

have  to  go  for classes in Tamil as well.  With the  review

complete, the key aspect is implementation and ultimately the

success,  it  would  seem, resides with  whether  the  policy

objectives are realised in the syllabus, the textbooks and in

the classrooms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I would like to ask the Minister how the

implementation  of  these initiatives  will  be  managed  and

whether  there  would be scope for continual input  from  the

community or, at least, certain parts of the community  which

may  have  knowledge that would be of value to the  Ministry.

Secondly,  the  teachers  would be the  key  agents  of  this

change,  not just because they are teaching the syllabus  but

also  because  they are the embodiment of  the  language  and

would  therefore be a model for these students  in  terms  of

what  teaching  and  learning the language  is  about.   What

opportunities  will  be made available  for  TL  teachers  to

enhance their own training and development?  I would like  to

ask  the  Minister,  in particular, two questions.   Firstly,

what  proportion  of Tamil teachers have tertiary  education?

Secondly,   whether  there  are  plans  to  introduce   Tamil

education  or  training  in Tamil language  teaching  at  the

tertiary level at our NIE?



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I put in a cut about

Promoting Malay Language in our Schools and in my position it

is  not  about mother tongue, it is really a cut on promoting

Malay language in schools. Therefore, it is really about  the

other  tongue.  The Minister has earlier asked me to  put  in

more  suggestions  for enriching the school  curriculum.   So

this is my seventh suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has replied to me in the last sitting that

if any school wishes to include Malay as an optional and non-examinable  subject  in  their school  curriculum,  they  are

welcome  to  do  so.  He cautioned me not to set  unrealistic

targets  as  learning  two  languages  is  already  difficult

enough.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make three points here. In the early

60s  before  the  independence of Singapore,  we  all  learnt

Malay, Chinese and English at primary level.  What I remember

is  Malay was taught as a conversational language without our

Malay teacher forcing us to read, write and take tests on it.

It  was  relaxed and entertaining and I did not remember  the

resistance   to   it,  which  explains   why   perhaps   more

Singaporeans in the age cohort of 45-50 today all speak  some

Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore the method of teaching and the climate

of  learning developed by the teacher which has the effect of

our responsiveness to the language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point about learning to speak Malay is an

inter-personal one. A language is a great facility in drawing

different nationalities closer.  In the neighbourhood which I

stayed  in,  at Race Course  Road, which parallels  Serangoon

Road,  the  multicultural  mix of Malays,  different  Chinese

dialect  groups and Indians in a relatively low-income,  low-educated  neighbourhood, the Malay language was the  mode  of

communication between these different groups. The result  was

a  colourful  one,  every ethnic group spoke  a  splatter  of

phrases in different dialects and languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the critical role of Malay in forging

regional  ties.   Sir, we are surrounded by a  Malay-speaking

world.  The usefulness of learning Malay to facilitate cross-cultural communication and promote regional closeness  cannot

be  ignored.  We do not need to compel every school to  adopt

the  Malay  Language  policy, but some  encouragement  is  in

order  to help nurture some cohorts of Singaporeans  who  can

serve  as bridges, networkers as well as broker on behalf  of

Singapore   in  its  commercial,  political  and   diplomatic

development  in  the region.  Language is the key  ingredient

that  sparks the emotions of connections between people.   In

view  of  the pressing political developments around us,  the

ability   to   use  the  Malay  language  as  a   medium   of

communication, a tool in defining friendships and  mobilising

resources will become increasingly important.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the men and women who teach our

children  are key to our education system. On their shoulders

are  placed  the heavy responsibility of  transmitting  their

knowledge  and  inculcating values.  Only the  committed  and

dedicated will choose teaching as a career.  They deserve our

highest  respect.  Because of our system and because  of  our

need to produce high academic results, the teacher's life  is

a  stressful one.  Fortunately, in recent years, compensation

packages  for  teachers have been approved.   While  this  is

definitely  welcomed, many teachers still find administrative

workload on the heavy side.  Would the Ministry explore  work

flow  improvement  process through  the  use  of  information

technology to provide relief in this area?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch upon the age profile of

teachers.   For  many years until recently,  not  many  young

people were attracted into the teaching career.  As a result,

Sir,  if we look at the age profile of teachers, we will find

two  things:  basically a U-shape curve.  There  is  a  group

closer  to  the age of retirement and there is another  group

who has just joined the teaching career after graduating from

NIE.   So this presents some concerns and some opportunities.

Let me describe the concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that within a very few years most of our

experienced teachers would have reached retirement age.  With

their  retirement, the core of teachers would have  become  a

relatively  young one that impact with the loss of experience

on  the  ability  of  schools to educate  our  young  and  to

inculcate correct values.  Another aspect of challenge  faced

by  some  of  the older teachers is the need to  learn  about

computers  and  to  incorporate IT into their  teaching.  For

some, the challenge is indeed a great hurdle.  I believe some

of  the  older  teachers do not even have the basic  keyboard

skills.   Furthermore, the teachers are also concerned  about

the  loss  of authority and stature in front of the  students

when  the  students  and  pupils are probably  more  computer

literate and network-savvy than they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to a few teachers and some of them would

prefer to continue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>



their  old  ways of instructions and leave the new innovation

in  teaching to their younger colleagues.  If this is  indeed

their  desire, could the Ministry accommodate these teachers?

The  opportunity is that with the retirement of these  senior

teachers, the Ministry would probably be able to push the use

of computers more extensively in teaching and administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next topic I would like to bring up on this cut

is  the  pupil-teacher  ratio, a  topic  of  interest  to  my

colleague,  Mr  Chiam as well.  The Ministry  has  maintained

through  all these years that pupil/teacher ratio is not  the

key  determinant of the effectiveness in teaching.   This  is

probably  true in the range of the ratio that we are confined

to.  I am more interested in the effectiveness of teaching in

primary one, in particular, in the first few chaotic weeks of

the  new school year.  Many teachers told me that they  spend

more  time maintaining discipline and keeping order in  class

than  teaching the new pupils.  I wonder whether the Ministry

will  consider  having teachers' assistants  in  primary  one

classes to help the teachers, perhaps the trainee teachers in

NIE could be mobilised to help in this particular area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): MOE has been taking a

long-term  view and has been correct in its judgement when it

formulates  education  policies to  identify  talents  to  be

nurtured  to meet the needs of the nation and society.   This

is  to be applauded.  I do not agree with the views expressed

by Mr Inderjit Singh.  Only a small minority of students find

it  difficult  to  study the mother tongue.  Therefore,  they

should  not  undermine the interest of the  majority  of  the

students.  The bilingual education policy must be continued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, MOE published a report by the Chinese

Language Review Committee. Many of its recommendations on the

teaching   of   Chinese  language  have  been   adopted   and

implemented.  This  includes the  modification  of  syllabus,

revision  of textbooks and the teaching of Chinese literature

and  history in order to supplement the teaching and learning

of mother tongue and to train more students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>



to  have  a better command of the mother tongue, culture  and

language,  in  order  to be effectively  bilingual.   But  to

achieve  such objectives  we must have enough CL teachers  to

help implement such policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what is the shortfall of CL

teachers  in both primary and secondary schools.  Will  there

be  a  shortage of CL teachers in the next five to 10  years'

time?   What measures are being contemplated by the  Ministry

to tackle the problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a language teacher's task is not just to impart

language  skills  to  the students.  He must  also  inculcate

correct  values among the students and teach them to be  good

citizens.   In this regard, CL teachers have all along  taken

upon  themselves  the sacred duty of imparting  knowledge  as

well as instilling moral values in the minds of the students,

thus  achieving the twin objects of mother tongue  education.

The  locally trained CL teachers are able to not only  impart

language skills to the students but instill in them a  strong

national  identity.   Today, we are faced  with  the  serious

problem  of a shortage of teachers.  Immediate steps must  be

taken  to  train  more CL teachers.  We  should  not  be  too

dependent on foreign sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those foreign CL teachers we have recruited, are

they  required  to  undergo  some  orientation  programme  in

Singapore to understand our local situation here before  they

are  deployed  to  teach  in our schools?   This  is  because

different countries have different education objectives.  Are

these foreign CL teachers familiar with our educational goals

and  objectives  of  our mother tongue  education?   This  is

something  which we should take note of.  Is MOE  considering

retaining the good foreign teachers and let them take on more

important roles in our educational system?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that recruitment of foreign CL teachers

should  be  just an interim measure.  In the long  term,  the

solution  lies in training more young Singaporeans to  become

mother tongue teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, first of all, I

would like to respond to what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2406</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Low Thia Khiang has said just now about the survey by the

NUS on the Chinese students in Singapore who aspire to be  of

other  races  in  their  next life.   Personally,  I  am  not

surprised  by  this  finding because  our  young  people  are

constantly  influenced  by  the western  culture  surrounding

them.  Recently, when I was in Shanghai, I was told that many

people  in  China are also aspiring to become Americans.  The

young people in China receive their education in Chinese.  To

each  and  every  student in China, the Chinese  language  is

always the first language.  In fact, it is their one and only

national language.  Based on Mr Low's reasoning, they  should

not  aspire to be anything but Chinese. Yet, the Shanghainese

also  want  to  become  Americans.   So  when  the  Singapore

students aspire to be foreigners in their next life, I  think

there is nothing to do with the education they receive here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the subject which I have filed an

amendment.  Under our educational system, from the  old  days

until  today,  students from primary one right up  to  junior

college  were  passively sent to attend classes conducted  by

teachers appointed by the schools.  Of course, to the primary

school  and  the  lower secondary school  students,  this  is

necessary.   But with Singapore becoming a developed  country

and  with the rapid emergence of the knowledge-based economy,

competition in the future society will certainly become  more

and  more intense.  So when students go into society and face

competition, they will have to depend on their own wisdom and

their  own  hard  work  to  solve their  problems.   But  the

education  handed down by the teachers in their student  days

will be a source of great strength to back them up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to learn new things, I think our educational

model  and  educational  methods should also be changed.   In

the  past,  the traditional model was such that the  emphasis

was  on  memorising  knowledge and good  examination  skills.

This  must  be  substituted by cultivation of creativity  and

development of  characters.  The students and teachers should

establish a kind of interactive relationship between them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the MOE should consider allowing students from

Secondary 2 onwards to have the right to choose the  teachers

they  like.  If a teacher is very popular and his class  size

is  so big, say, more than 35 students, then arrangement  can

be made for his lessons to be conducted in the larger lecture

theatres.   In the primary schools, the students may  not  be

experienced  enough to know whether the teacher  is  good  or

bad.  When the students go to secondary one, they may not  be

familiar  with the new school environment.  So let them  wait

until  secondary two, then they should be allowed  to  choose

the teacher of their own choice.  This is a new creative type

of   school  planning.  The  teachers  can  have  a  sort  of

competition among themselves.  It will also motivate them  to

do their work better.  Then the students will be attracted to

come and learn under them.  In the old days when the students

were attending classes by certain teachers whose teaching was

dull and uninteresting, they were bored and hence  lost their

interest in the subject.  But if they can choose the teachers

they like, they will be inspired  to learn better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the school adopts this method where the students

can  choose their own teachers, promotion of the teachers can

be  based  on  the  number of students  they  have  in  their

respective  classes in addition to the results  that  he  has

produced  by  his  teaching.  Of course,  we  have  to  avoid

letting some teachers pleasing their students by deliberately

setting  some easy questions so that the students  can  score

higher  marks in their examinations or could give tips before

the  examinations.   The schools should then  conduct  common

tests or common examinations, as a precaution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, teachers have not only to know how to teach

the  subjects, they should also care and love their students,

so  as  to  cultivate them and to invoke their  interest  and

confidence  in their learning.  If a teacher can transform  a

student  from  a  problem student to an outstanding  student,

then he or she is a valuable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>



teacher.  So,  good teachers should be commended and promoted

and  be  given an increase in their salaries.  On  the  other

hand,  those  not so good teachers should be eliminated.   We

should  not  allow these bad teachers to exert bad influences

on  the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if we want to reform any traditional method,

we cannot just change it overnight, like the way we change  a

computer.   It has to be a gradual process. Put in  some  new

ideas to the old system and gradually replace the old system.

Perhaps some people will say this will remain just an  ideal.

But I feel that this is something to be considered seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we will talk about computers. Computers are very

popular now.  Everybody now knows how to use a computer.   We

can  teach by means of computers.  One teacher can teach many

students  at the same time.  Nowadays, we have a lot  of  new

teachers.   In  the old days, we had a shortage of  teachers.

But  now we have an ample supply of teachers.  I think if  we

have  this  enthusiasm to fully develop our human  resources,

this  will  be a very creative way to help Singapore  develop

into  a  knowledge-based  economy and  to  develop  our  high

technology.  I hope MOE will consider my suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, teachers are critical national

resources.   They help to educate our children.  We  need  to

have  enough teachers to meet the needs of our schools.   But

do  we have enough teachers in our Ministry?  Not only is the

total  number  of  teachers  important,  but  there  must  be

sufficient numbers of them in the various disciplines.  Here,

again, how do we fare in this latter criterion?  How many new

teachers did we recruit in the past two years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers are committed and dedicated but some have

found  the  job  stressful and unsatisfying and,  thus,  they

leave.   Could  the Minister share with us how many  teachers

left the service again in the last two years and how many  of

those  who  resigned were already trained?  Where  a  teacher

resigns,  this  is  a  waste  of valuable  resources  to  the

education service, especially when he or she is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>



already  trained  and productive.  Did the Ministry  make  an

effort to find out why these teachers decided to throw in the

towel?   What  has the Ministry done to retain our  teachers?

What more can the Ministry do in this area?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the continued strengthening of the economy, I would

also  like  to ask the Minister for his view of the situation

this year.  Sir, I think it is important for the Ministry  to

reassure  our teachers of their importance and that  it  will

make all possible efforts to provide teachers with meaningful

and satisfying careers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, with the improvements in the

salary  and  career package of teachers, we have successfully

attracted  candidates  into  the teaching  service.   Indeed,

every year we see more and more graduates interested to  take

up the challenges of the teaching profession.  The stories of

the   dedication,  innovations  and  care  given  by  today's

teachers are heartwarming, to say the least.  Moreover, there

have  been  tremendous changes in the curricula, training  of

teachers  and  policies in the last  couple  of  years.   The

annual  recognition given to teachers and chances of speedier

promotions for young teachers have helped attract new trainee

teachers.   While the Ministry has been able to recruit,  has

it  been  able to retain?  How many young teachers  left  the

service immediately after they have completed their bond?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of recruitment of teachers, we must

indeed  try to get the best candidates to teach our students.

Towards this end, the Institute of Education and MOE normally

recruit   those  who  study  what  are  called  the  teaching

subjects.  Do we really need to restrict ourselves in teacher

recruitment as at primary level any graduate should  be  able

to  manage  teaching Mathematics, English and Science?   Many

subjects  are  increasingly becoming  multi-disciplinary,  so

there is room for graduates who may not have studied specific

teaching subjects to be recruited into the teaching service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising this matter as I have been approached

by residents whose applications to get into NIE have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2410</b></font><br><br>



rejected  presumably because they are not holding degrees  in

teaching  subjects.  Interestingly, at least one of them  has

been   teaching   as  a  relief  teacher.    Further,   their

applications  have been rejected without any reasons  stated.

This gives rise to general unhappiness among those affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it might be useful in cases of rejection that there

should  be  reasons  given  why  some  degree  holders   were

rejected.  Perhaps there should be clearer guidelines so that

those  who are unsuitable need not apply in the first  place.

I  can only say, from feedback given, that it is particularly

difficult  for those who have applied, because they  seem  to

have  a  passion  for teaching, to be rejected  out  of  hand

without any explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, should it not be possible to have an appeal

board  to  reconsider those applicants  who  really  want  to

teach?   Perhaps,  after  a period of  time,  the  Board  can

consider  the applications of those who were rejected.   This

would,  in  effect, form a cooling off period on  both  sides

where  an opportunity to re-consider can be taken.   Then  if

the  candidate is exceptionally keen and has the aptitude  to

teach  and  decide to follow through with an  appeal,  should

there not be some latitude given to those who are in earnest?



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, like Dr Tan Boon Wan and Mr

Hawazi Daipi before me, talking on the subject of recruitment

and   retention   of   teachers,  a  fair   amount   of   the

dissatisfaction  we  hear  expressed  by  parents  would   be

alleviated  if  we  had more teachers.  We can  have  smaller

class  sizes, more attention to students, better  interaction

with  parents.  The problem, it seems to me, however, is  not

at  all  an  unwillingness  to  provide  more  positions  for

teachers.  The problem is in filling those positions  already

provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget book, if I read it correctly, I note

there is an establishment of 31,169 for the Education Service

last  year, FY99, of which only 24,842 positions were filled,

and that actually gives us quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2411</b></font><br><br>



a  staggering vacancy position of 6,327.  In this year's main

Budget  Statement,  we  hear again  of  an  additional  2,344

positions  created  for MOE in general to  take  care  of  an

increased  student intake.  I can imagine  the  challenge  in

finding enough new recruits and I am sure there is difficulty

as well in retaining existing staff.



<br>6.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wonder if the Minister could give us the

whole picture to share with us the Ministry's efforts in this

area,  how  successful  our efforts to recruit  locally  both

trained teachers as well as young people into NIE programmes,

how  we  might be supplementing this with foreign recruitment

of  teachers  both in the interim as well as for  the  longer

term,  how we could relieve teachers of administrative duties

so  as  to  optimise use of their time, and in  fact,  saying

that, is there also a problem in finding administrative staff

because our manpower position in Singapore is very difficult.

How  successful have been our efforts to retain teachers?   I

know  there have been a lot of efforts made in terms  of  new

promotional grades, through remuneration packages.  In  fact,

whatever  other initiatives that the Ministry has  taken  and

planned  in its effort to fill the vacancies in the Education

Service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, by

now,  I  am fully aware of the long list of requests made  to

the Minister by Members of this House.  But, nevertheless,  I

want to add mine to that list.  Specifically, Sir, I want  to

make  a  pitch for sportsmen and hope that the Minister  will

consider expanding employment opportunities for sportsmen  in

schools and within his Ministry.  Specifically, I would  like

to  ask whether there are existing recruitment policies  that

allow our sportsmen to be employed as PE teachers or coaches,

or  if not, whether the Minister would consider changing  the

recruitment policies and organise the structure to make  this

possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now have seen the growing number of people who

want to take a career in sports.  But the harsh reality about

sports  is  that  they have very short career lifespan,  and,

certainly, many hope to become teachers.  And we do not  have

that  many sports associations, and all that, to employ  many

of  them.  I hope for the accomplished ones, people who  have

done  well, at least at the national level, or until national

level, I am sure we can find ways where we can employ them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, if they are good enough to become coaches for

professional leagues, I am sure they can be good  coaches  in

schools as well.  Now you see a lot of very formal structured

certification programmes in place and recognised world  wide,

or  regionally, and I am sure we can also use this as one  of

the admission criteria.  Certainly, we know of many sportsmen

who are personalities themselves who can inspire students and

I  can  think of some who are actually good role  models  for

students.  Unfortunately, not many can qualify to be teachers

if  we use the normal admission criteria.  But I hope this is

one  area that we can make an exception.  If you look at some

places  like  the  US, for example, basketball,  or  baseball

coaches,  had  seen accomplished sportsmen in  their  earlier

years.  I hope the Minister would seriously consider, if  you

cannot employ them as full-time in one school, perhaps, part-time, or have a cluster of schools to do that.  I think  this

is  important  so  that  while we not  only  allow  for  more

flexible  recruitment, we can also help people who contribute

to  Singapore, people who want to make a career in sports  to

see that they have very long and successful careers.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, earlier I shared with Members

the  Ministry's  efforts  to  build  up  the  "hardware"  and

"software"  of  our education system and now we  are  talking

about  what  is the heart of the whole education system  and,

that is, the 24,000 teachers who make up our teaching force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the recruitment, retention and

staffing situation, which Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2413</b></font><br><br>



Hawazi  Daipi, Dr Tan, Dr Jennifer Lee and others have  asked

about.   Over  the past few years, the Ministry has  made  it

more  attractive to join and remain in the  Education Service

through   more  competitive  remuneration,  better  promotion

prospects,   strong  emphasis  on  continual  upgrading   and

professional  development.  We hope also  that  our  teachers

will  derive more professional satisfaction in their work  as

schools   get   more   autonomy  and   teachers   have   more

opportunities to try out their own ideas for the  benefit  of

their students.  I have always considered teaching as one  of

the most satisfying jobs because you see the children grow in

front  of  you  and they always remember later  on  in  life.

People walk up to you and say, "Hello."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these efforts, we have been able to

recruit  more teachers.  I am happy to report to  this  House

that  last  year,  1999,  we recruited  3,300  teachers,  the

largest  number that we have recruited for as long as  I  can

think  perhaps  the largest number we ever  recruited.   This

exceeded our target of 3,000. We were able to do so  in  part

due  to  the economic downturn, and because we were  able  to

attract people from previous cohorts of job entrants who were

keen  on  teaching but at the time when they entered the  job

market, found the previous employment terms unattractive.  We

do  not expect to be able to sustain such a recruitment rate.

A  more realistic recruitment rate is between 1,700 and 2,000

a  year.   In the previous two years, 1997 and 1998, in  1997

the  economy  was still quite strong, we had  been  averaging

2,100  teachers a year.  This is double the average of  1,000

teachers per year that we had been recruiting prior to 1997.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual resignation rate among trained teachers has

also  remained quite stable in the last few years,  averaging

about  2%,  that  is, about 400-500 teachers  a  year.   This

figure may look large, but is very reasonable given the  size

of  the teaching force.  If 400 teachers resign in a year, it

is  slightly  more  than  one per school  which  I  think  is

manageable.   And teachers resign for a number  of  different

reasons: some go and look after their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2414</b></font><br><br>



families, some want to try something else, and some come back

after  that,  so  that  is all right.  The  figure  is  quite

reasonable  when compared to the rest of the  civil  service,

and  certainly very reasonable when compared to  the  private

sector where turnover rates are typically double digits.   So

2% is quite reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee has expressed concern at the few

thousand  vacant teaching posts in MOE.   I have  to  explain

what  is  happening.  We can only employ people if there  are

posts  for  them.  And we employ people as soon as they  join

the  teaching  service, that means, before they  go  to  NIE,

while they are in NIE, while they are overseas, and so forth,

so  the  number  includes all these.   And  the  Ministry  of

Finance  has been very supportive in giving us posts so  that

we  can recruit them if we are able to do so.  So that is the

reason why there is a very large number of such posts and the

vacancy  rate looks quite alarming.  But in fact, the vacancy

rate is much more reasonable than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the more important figure is what we actually

have in the schools.  One of the things we have been able  to

do in the last few years also is to create new teaching posts

in  schools in anticipation of being able to fill  them.   In

the  last  two years, we have increased the establishment  in

schools by 1,500 posts, and not all of this increase has been

filled  yet.  The actual number of trained teachers has  gone

up by 1,000 from 22,500 in 1998 to 23,500 at the end of 1999.

So  we  had 1,000 more trained teachers in the space  of  two

years.   The other teachers that we have recruited are  still

in  the  pipeline being trained and they will come  into  the

system  soon.  We have about 380 schools.  So, put in another

way,  over the last two years, every school in Singapore  has

on  average three more teachers than they had two years  ago.

So  that is a welcome increase, with more shoulders to spread

the  load  on in the schools.  But because we have  increased

the  establishment, there are still additional posts  in  the

schools yet to be filled.  The situation will improve in  May

this  year, when about 1,700 NIE graduands will be posted  to

schools upon completion of their pre-service training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has asked whether a better pupil-teacher ratio at the lower primary level will be beneficial

to  children's  education.  I think we have to  differentiate

between  class size and pupil-teacher ratio because  a  class

size  is  how many students there are in a class,  while  the

pupil-teacher  ratio  is  how  many  teachers  there  are  to

students and that may not be directly related to class  size.

Smaller  class  size   is  only one  of  many  factors  which

influences  the  quality of education.  The  quality  of  our

teachers, the curriculum, the school environment, all play  a

part  in  determining their level of educational achievement.

We need to take a total perspective of all these factors.  Of

all  these  factors,  teacher quality  is  perhaps  the  most

important.   In the end, whatever we may say in the  Ministry

of  Education HQ, or for that matter whatever we may  say  in

this  House,  as  pointed out by a number  of  Members,  what

actually  goes  on in the classrooms is what  determines  the

quality  of  education  that  is received.  The  delivery  of

education  is,  ultimately, at its heart, a completely  human

enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain quality in the teaching profession, the

Ministry aims to recruit those with teaching aptitude roughly

from  about  the  top one-third of each cohort.   We  have  a

cohort  of about 40,000 a year, and one third is about 13,000

people.   If we recruit 2,000 a year, we have to recruit  one

out of every six-and-a-half persons in this cohort.  I am not

optimistic  that we will be able to recruit  many  more  than

that.   Any significant reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio,

even at the lower primary level, is likely to lead to a sharp

drop  in  the quality of our teachers.   And we have  to  ask

ourselves whether we are better off if children are taught in

smaller  classes but taught by teachers of low  quality.   So

this is a trade-off that we have to think about.  And I think

teacher quality is probably the most important factor in  the

quality of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do recruit teachers who are in the so-called non-teaching subject areas, particularly for the primary schools,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>



we have been doing so for some years now.  The way we recruit

teachers   is  actually  to  have  an  interview   panel   of

experienced  teachers who will talk to the aspirants  to  see

whether  they are suitable, ie, those who are called  up  for

interview.  In some cases, when we offer the appointment,  it

is  not  so  much  that  we are not  prepared  to  offer  the

appointment, it is that the level of the appointment that  we

are  offering is not something which the applicant  is  happy

with.  So the applicant declines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For class size and pupil-teacher ratio, the Ministry's

philosophy is not to adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach  of

stipulating  a smaller class size for our schools.   Instead,

our  approach  is  to build up and maintain  a  high  quality

teaching  force by recruiting and retaining as many  teachers

as  possible  -  with the right qualities  -  in  order  that

schools  can be given the additional resources.   As  I  have

explained   earlier,  we  have  succeeded  in   doing   that.

Principals  have the flexibility to decide  on  how  best  to

organise and deploy their teacher resources, according to the

needs  of  their  students and the nature of the  activities.

Some  schools where they think they need to give the students

a  boost  in  English have organised it in such  a  way  that

teachers give more attention to students.  Some schools where

they think that teaching in larger classes and lecture halls,

and  so  forth, works better, well, they have done that  too.

So  we  can  leave  that with principals  to  experiment,  to

innovate and see what works best  given the teachers and  the

students that they have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the larger number of teachers recruited in recent

years,  and  stable  retention, we have  been  able  to  give

schools  more  teacher resources.  In particular,  there  has

been  a  net increase of almost 2,000 primary school teachers

since 1996.  This is quite significant.  This has enabled  us

to  lower the pupil-teacher ratio in the primary schools from

26.5 to 25 during this period, even though pupil enrolment in

the  primary schools has increased by about 37,000 or  13.6%.

Even  in  the face of that, we have been able to improve  our

pupil-teacher ratio. If we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2417</b></font><br><br>



maintain  our  recruitment rate, we may be  able  to  improve

this,  but gradually over time.  I do not expect any dramatic

or sudden changes to pupil-teacher ratio.



<br>6.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan and Dr Jennifer Lee have raised the

issue of teacher workload.  The Ministry recognises that  new

initiatives mean greater demands on the schools and teachers.

Our teachers support these new initiatives as they feel these

are  good  for the students.  Being dedicated teachers,  they

want  to  do  more  for their students.   Their  efforts  are

commendable.  However, while they have the students' interest

at  heart,  school leadership and teachers need to prioritise

in  order  to  focus  on  the key essentials,  so  that  both

students  and  teachers  are not  overburdened.   This  is  a

balance  that  they  have to strike  and  in  single  session

schools  where the schools are available for the  whole  day,

there  is  a  great temptation to do more and more,  but  the

correct balance has to be struck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to the selection and training of teachers. Mr

Hawazi  Daipi  has  asked  about  the  selection  of  trainee

teachers,  particularly  those  who  obtained  their  degrees

overseas.   I  have already covered that just  now.   We  set

stringent  criteria for the selection of teachers, regardless

of  where  they  have obtained their qualifications,  whether

local or overseas institutions.  Candidates are assessed  not

only on their records, but also their aptitude for teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua has suggested allowing students to pick

and   choose   their  teachers.  Teaching  quality   is   not

necessarily  a  function of popularity.  Nevertheless,  I  am

open.   Any school which wants to try it is free to go  ahead

and do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With large numbers of new teachers joining the Education

Service,   teacher  training  has  taken  on   even   greater

significance.   Over  the  past  two  years,  the   Ministry,

together  with the National Institute of Education, has  made

important changes to the teacher training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>



system to ensure that it remains aligned to the needs of  our

education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of this is the framework for continual

teacher  training  which NIE will be implementing  from  next

year to encourage serving teachers to continually update  and

upgrade  themselves.   To  complement  this  framework,   the

Ministry  will  continue to expand the scope of opportunities

for  serving teachers to pursue upgrading courses through its

various study leave and professional development schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli has asked about sportsmen becoming teachers

and  coaches.  We already have a number of teachers  who  are

national sportsmen. We have people like Lee Wung Yew, Mah  Li

Lian,  Melanie  Martens, and so on.  But  not  all  sportsmen

would  necessarily make good teachers nor even good  coaches.

We  have quite a number of sportsmen as coaches already.  And

for  those who are able to do so, we are, in fact, more  than

happy to have them for precisely the reasons that Mr Zulkifli

has mentioned.  They are good role models.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group of teachers whom we will be providing greater

upgrading  opportunities to are the  mother  tongue  language

teachers.    I am pleased to inform Members that with  effect

from   Academic   Year  2000/2001,  the  Ministry   will   be

introducing  a  new award to sponsor mother  tongue  language

teachers  for full-time undergraduate studies in  the  mother

tongue  languages.  Under the award, teachers  will  be  paid

salaries  for up to two years while undergoing the  full-time

programme.   The  award, which is tenable  both  locally  and

overseas,  will  complement other improvements  made  to  the

teaching   and  learning  of  the  mother  tongue   languages

announced  over  the  past year.  This will  be  particularly

useful to our Tamil language teachers. Because of the numbers

involved,  I do not think it is practical to organise  degree

level  programmes in Singapore. This is an  avenue  which  is

open  to  them which they can make use of. I do not have  the

statistics on the number of tertiary educated Tamil  language

teachers. I can provide them to the Member later.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked about opportunities for upgrading for

Malay  language teachers. We have just introduced an  Honours

programme in NIE for Malay language and I would like  to  see

how  this programme develops first before taking any  further

steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked about Chinese language

teachers.  The Ministry has been able to recruit about  60-70

Chinese language teachers per year for the secondary schools.

This  is  sufficient  to  meet the  needs  in  the  secondary

schools.   We  do  recruit a small number  of  teachers  from

overseas  and  they are subject to stringent criteria  before

they  are deployed to secondary schools.  They do go  through

an  induction  programme before doing so  and  this  includes

national education and the Singapore education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in primary schools is different. There

are  many  older  CL  teachers.  As these older  CL  teachers

retire,  the  need to fill vacancies in the  primary  schools

becomes greater.  We have several measures to recruit as many

Singaporean teachers as possible.  We have introduced the  4-year mother tongue language Diploma in Education. We have the

Postgraduate  Diploma  in Education  to  provide  "conversion

training"  for  graduates who did not  specialise  in  CL  at

university,  but  who  have good grades.  We  also  have  for

retired Chinese language teachers to be re-employed to  teach

Chinese  language.  This scheme has been quite well-received.

As  at  end-January  this  year, about  100  retired  Chinese

language  teachers  have been re-employed under  the  scheme.

This will help to smooth out the retirement pattern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to meet the demand for Chinese language primary

school teachers using this multi-pronged approach.  If  there

is  a need, we will recruit from overseas.  However, we would

prefer  Singaporean Chinese language teachers in the  primary

schools because the teaching of mother tongue language at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>



the  primary  level  has  a  significant  element  of  values

transmission  which requires familiarity with our  own  local

environment and social contact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for upgrading opportunities for serving non-graduate

Chinese  language teachers, there are many avenues  open  for

full-time  and  part-time courses.  One  example  is  the  BA

degree  run by OUDP in collaboration with the Beijing  Normal

University.  Since its inception in 1999, I am told  a  total

of 155 serving teachers have enrolled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to languages in the school. Why are we

retraining English language teachers?  It is because we  felt

that  we  need to strengthen the teaching of English language

in  schools  and to return to teaching a little more  grammar

than  we  were before. We did a re-evaluation as we  do  from

time  to time, and we felt this was necessary and so this  is

one  of the things we are doing for English language teachers

in  school.   We  must  understand that from  time  to  time,

teachers need to be retrained. So re-training of the teachers

is  something  which should be expected and  normal,  and  it

should  be  welcomed  and  not seen  as  something  which  is

fundamentally wrong with the education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Tay Beng Chuan and Mr

Peh  Chin Hua do not quite agree on the importance of  mother

tongue languages in the school.  But a bilingual policy is in

place  and we need to have this bilingual policy for  reasons

which  I  have  explained earlier.   English  is  a  unifying

language  and  is a language for international  communication

and  business.  Mother tongue is for values transmission  and

to have an understanding of our ethnicity and culture so that

we have a cultural ballast in this new globalised world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh feels that there is too much emphasis

on  mother tongue and streaming and so on.  The weighting  of

the four subjects at the PSLE has been adjusted over time and

currently, it strikes a good balance between our various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2421</b></font><br><br>



objectives  that we have described, and there is no  need  to

change this. We do not intend to do so.  It is not true  that

there  are  many students channelled to the Normal stream  in

secondary  schools  who are not doing well  in  their  mother

tongue,  even  if  they have scored top marks  in  the  other

subjects. While there are students who score within  the  top

30%  in  English, Mathematics and Science, but bottom 30%  in

mother  tongue language in PSLE, none has been channelled  to

the Normal stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming at P4 is based on performance in English,

Mathematics   and  mother  tongue,  while  the  PSLE   counts

performance  in 4 subjects, only one of which is  the  mother

tongue  language.  As you go to secondary school, the  mother

tongue  language is in fact de-weighted because it is only  a

threshold  requirement to get D7 to go on to the next  level.

We have also  introduced the syllabus `B' for students facing

exceptional difficulties so that they would continue to learn

their mother tongue, get some cultural transmission, and  get

some foundation so that later on in life, if they do want  to

pick  it  up  again, they have some foundation. This  is  not

meant  for  the  general students but for  students  who  are

facing exceptional difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Iswaran for his comments on the

various  mother tongue language reviews.  In  line  with  the

recommendations from these reviews, the Ministry is currently

revising    the    syllabuses,    instructional    materials,

examination  formats  and  so  on.   Mother  tongue  language

teachers  in  all schools have been briefed on  the  changes.

Workshops  and  group discussions will also be organised.  We

will  see  how we can continue to include feedback  from  the

community as we implement these programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Ibrahim Othman's query regarding

students  who  are  eligible for the Malay language  elective

programme, they are either within the top 10% in PSLE, or  in

the  top 11-30% who have done well and have scored either  an

`A*'  in  Malay  language or a distinction  in  Higher  Malay

language, and at least an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2422</b></font><br><br>



`A'  in  English  language so that they  can  cope  with  the

heavier  study  load.  Likewise, those who  qualify  for  the

Malay  language elective programme at the JC level must  have

scored at least a B3 in Higher ML or an A2 in ML in their `O'

level examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ibrahim has also asked whether the standard for A1 or

A*  in Malay language in the `O' level examinations and other

examinations  is set too high.  The standards of  the  papers

and  the marking are subject to careful control of difficulty

level  and  to ensure consistency in marking. I  can  confirm

that it is not any more difficult for Malay students to score

an `A1' or A* in Malay language in the `O' level examinations

or  any  other examinations, than for Chinese students taking

CL  and Indian students taking TL.  Our statistics bear  this

out.   For  the EMAS programme, in fact, we are just starting

it  up  in  Bukit Panjang and we will see how  this  develops

before we take any further steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Tay Beng Chuan and Mdm Claire Chiang have

suggested  again that MOE conduct non-examination courses  in

Malay  language.  My position remains the same. We have heard

views of Members that studying two languages already is quite

a  load.   I  would let them persuade Mr Inderjit Singh  that

doing even more than that is good.  And we can leave it as an

option  to those schools who think it is a good idea for  the

students  to  do it on an enrichment basis.  But  I  have  no

intention  of  making  it compulsory.  Mr  Ibrahim  suggested

allowing  top  Malay students to take Chinese. I  will  think

about  it and see whether that is possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said in this House last week, I would provide

some flexibility to the schools to decide on how to implement

some  of  these  programmes and not  mandate  them,  as  some

Members have suggested.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister
