A childcare subsidy of up to $150 per month is available for children who are enrolled in childcare centres.&nbsp; &nbsp;These subsidies are for the first to fourth child.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that low-income families will need additional support so as to lower their financial burden and provide good early childhood development programmes for their children.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My Ministry has therefore been providing additional assistance to low-income families through the Centre-based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC).&nbsp; CFAC is a means-tested scheme, targeting at families that earn $1,500 and below per month. It provides additional childcare assistance of up to $265 per month for each child who attends full day care, depending on the family's income.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 634<p> This subsidy is provided for the first to fourth child. The families may also apply for a one-time Start-up Grant to help them pay the initial costs of placing the child in a childcare centre for the first time.&nbsp; The Start-up Grant can help to cover expenses such as the registration fee, one month deposit, the first month's fees and uniforms.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With additional childcare assistance, low-income families can therefore expect Government subsidies ranging from between $130 and $415 per month per child to offset the cost of sending their children to&nbsp; full-day childcare.&nbsp; In other words, if a mother would like to send her child to a typical childcare centre run by a Voluntary Welfare Organisation, she&nbsp; needs to pay between $35 and $320 per month for each child.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CFAC subsidy therefore already takes into account the family's income level.&nbsp; Families with more children who go to childcare centres will also get more subsidy under CFAC, as the subsidy is given on a per child basis.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government reviews CFAC subsidy rates every two years to ensure that childcare remains affordable for low-income families.&nbsp; We will continue to provide additional assistance for low-income families to send their children to childcare, as we recognise the importance of providing developmental opportunities to these children. At the same time, the assistance will help to facilitate the entry or re-entry of the mothers into the labour force, so that they can work and supplement the families' incomes.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS OFFERING HELP TO TRAFFICKED VICTIMS--><p align=left>Column: 634<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS OFFERING HELP TO TRAFFICKED VICTIMS</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Support--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Support)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: char">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community <p align=left>Column: 635<p>Development, Youth and Sports what is the nature of the support given to non-governmental organisations that do offer help to trafficked&nbsp; victims.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (for the Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are very few cases of human trafficking in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Our strong legal framework and strict enforcement ensure that this number remains low. The small numbers notwithstanding, the Government has in place a comprehensive process to ensure that appropriate assistance is extended to victims of trafficking and victims who are in need of protection. This process involves the Police, the Courts and Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) that offer assistance to persons in need.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The support services provided by VWOs range from providing counselling and translation services, to providing temporary shelter to victims, if necessary.

These funds allow the agencies to run programmes and services not only for victims of trafficking, but also for other victims in need of protection. In the last two years, the Government has provided approximately $435,000 to agencies running victim assistance programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Government funding for such agencies has actually increased by 35% from approximately $185,000 in 2002 to approximately $250,000 in 2003.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The agencies are also part of a larger network of VWOs that provide platforms<p align=left>Column: 636<p> for coordination with relevant agencies as well as sharing of knowledge and expertise.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the World Health Organisation and the International Society for Infectious Diseases, there is a global upsurge in dengue cases this year.&nbsp; In some countries, the total number of dengue cases doubled in the first six months of 2004 compared to the same period last year. In our region, we are seeing the same increase too. WHO had recently issued a dengue alert for <st1:place>Southeast Asia</st1:place>.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of 18th September this year, a total of 5,248 cases were reported, a 48% increase as compared to the same period last year.&nbsp; Recently, our weekly dengue cases peaked at 332 in the week ending 28th August.&nbsp; This is higher than the weekly peak of 258 cases recorded last year.&nbsp; Although the figure has come <p align=left>Column: 637<p>down to 263 for the week ending 18th September 2004, we are still unable to determine if the situation has stabilised.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dengue is cyclical in nature.&nbsp; Every year, we see dengue cases building up during the warmer months of July to September. We are now in this traditional peak period.&nbsp; In fact, the weekly average of dengue cases is now 142 cases, as compared to 68 cases reported in the early part of this year.&nbsp; This is also higher than the weekly average of 96 cases reported over the same period last year.&nbsp; Hence, we must continue to be vigilant.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; NEA has stepped up mosquito control surveillance, inspecting more than 228,000 premises and conducting more than 21,000 ground surveys since the beginning of this year. This is an increase of 10% over the same period last year.&nbsp; We are seeing some improvements.&nbsp; Today, only 5% of schools inspected were found breeding Aedes mosquitoes, down from 25% before 1999.&nbsp; For construction sites, less than 15% inspected were found breeding mosquitoes.&nbsp; This is down from 30% last year.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of households breeding mosquitoes has however continued to increase in recent years. From the 228,000 premises NEA inspected, it is found that 60% of mosquito breeding cases involved indoor breeding.&nbsp; For HDB flats, the number of households found breeding mosquitoes has increased from 6 per 1,000 households in 1999, to 18 per 1,000 last year, and 16 per 1,000 as at 11th September this year.&nbsp; For condominiums, it has more than doubled, from 12 per 1,000 households in 1999, to 26 per 1,000 last year, and 29 per 1,000 households as at 11th September this year.&nbsp; In landed housing, the number has nearly tripled from 19 per 1,000 households in 1999, to 47 per 1,000 last year, and 60 per 1,000 as at 11th September.&nbsp; We must reverse the trend, <p align=left>Column: 638<p>and we can only succeed if we have the cooperation of the community.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, the NEA initiated a community project known as "Mozzie Attack" in April this year. The aim was to encourage greater community involvement and ownership. Starting with 10 constituencies, household members and maids were trained to detect and eliminate potential breeding sites. The response from the community has been encouraging.&nbsp; To-date, some 2,000 volunteers have been trained on dengue prevention and have become members of the Dengue Prevention Volunteer Groups (DPVG).&nbsp; The number of constituencies involved in the programme has also increased from 10 to 28.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NEA aims to expand the Mozzie Attack programme to all 84 constituencies over the next 12 months. We hope to see more volunteers coming forward.

Progress in the last three years has been encouraging.&nbsp; In January 2004, out of the total number of 3,438 pre-school teachers, 2,216 (64.5%) have received certificate or diploma training. With 1,160 teachers currently undergoing training, by the end of this year, 84% of pre-school teachers will have been trained at certificate or diploma level. These new standards, when fully in place from January 2008 onwards, will have a positive impact on the quality of education in the kindergartens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further expand teachers' capability to bring about quality learning outcomes, the Ministry&nbsp;has been conducting workshops, seminars and sharing of best practices for kindergarten teachers and principals. This wide range of professional development opportunities promotes continuous learning among pre-school professionals and, we believe,&nbsp;is an important part of the Ministry's effort to enhance the quality of kindergartens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the quality of the teachers, MOE recognises that the extent of individualised attention given to the <p align=left>Column: 643<p>children also has an impact on the quality of the pre-school experience.&nbsp; Hence, the Ministry has&nbsp;recommended the following teacher-pupil ratio:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nursery:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;1 teacher and 1 teacher-aide to 15 pupils<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kindergarten 1: &nbsp;1 teacher to 20 pupils<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kindergarten 2: &nbsp;1 teacher to 25 pupils</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These recommended teacher-pupil ratios are stated in the Kindergarten Manual that has been distributed to all kindergartens. Presently, 83.2% of kindergartens&nbsp; have met these teacher-pupil ratios. Kindergartens in new housing estates tend to have teacher-pupil ratios that are higher than the recommended guidelines. These kindergartens have been advised by the Ministry to work towards meeting these ratios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens in kindergartens, though important, is just one aspect of a child's development. What happens at home is equally important; in fact, some would say more important. Parents have a critical role to play in the upbringing of their children, and it is therefore&nbsp;important that they actively take up this challenge and raise their children well. We agree that it is necessary to help some parents understand the importance of developing children in a holistic manner. The best people who can explain this to the parents are the teachers and principals who come into contact with the parents regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support pre-school educators in their efforts to persuade parents, the Ministry has published and distributed a booklet called "Nurturing Early Learners". This booklet helps teachers and principals explain to parents what it means to prepare their children for lifelong learning.&nbsp; We have very good feedback on this booklet. Many kindergartens have <p align=left>Column: 644<p>purchased extra copies and have indicated that they will be using them for their orientation programmes at the end of this year or when giving talks to parents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For children in child care centres, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) encourages strong centre-family partnerships in the holistic development of young children. This is achieved through a sense of shared responsibility and common vision amongst staff and families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of parents whose children are not in pre-schools, MCYS also partners community organisations such as maternity hospitals, libraries, family service centres, Voluntary Welfare Organisations and corporate Family Life Ambassadors as well as community self-help groups in the delivery of parenting programmes. These programmes empower and guide parents to take a proactive role in the proper upbringing and development of their children.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</B>&nbsp; Sir, may I know whether MOE has data on the number of children that do not attend pre-school?&nbsp; Secondly, what is the long-term impact on a child missing pre-school in the child's primary school education?&nbsp; Does MOE have any study on this?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</B>&nbsp; We do have data on students who missed pre-school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have it with me because the Member did not ask the question.&nbsp; But I would say that the Ministry of Education does have various early intervention programmes in primary schools.&nbsp; For example, we have the Learning Support Programme where, at Primary 1, we identify pupils who are weak in language and Mathematics and we give them an enhanced programme.&nbsp; What happens is that we take these children out of the class and put them in a smaller group to give them special coaching.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 645<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experience of this programme has been very good.&nbsp; By the end of Primary 1, more than two-thirds would have reached the required standard and can catch up when they reach Primary 2.&nbsp; By the end of Primary 2, virtually all would have caught up.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:PROGRAMME TO GROOM STUDENTS AS BICULTURAL ELITES --><p align=left>Column: 645<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>PROGRAMME TO GROOM STUDENTS AS BICULTURAL ELITES </span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Implementation--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Implementation)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Question stood in the name of Mdm Ho Geok Choo -</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; To ask the Minister for Education (a) how the new programme to groom the identified students as bicultural elites will be implemented using the space created by the integrated programme; (b) why are we confining the new programme to only two schools which are supposed to be able to get things ready in a short time; (c) how will non-scholars be assisted to embrace the new programme; and (d) what will be the desired outcomes for these non-scholars.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</B>&nbsp; Question No. 6, Sir.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bicultural Studies Programme is a key plank in our efforts to groom a core group of students with a confident grasp of the Chinese Language and culture, and contemporary developments in China. It is being introduced in three schools, Dunman High School, Hwa Chong Institution and Nanyang Girls' High School, from next year. These schools were chosen because they are SAP schools and offer Integrated Programmes. They have both a conducive school environment for developing an understanding of Chinese language and culture, and the time and space to run in-depth programmes, including an extended period of immersion in China for the <p align=left>Column: 646<p>students following the Bicultural Studies Programme.&nbsp; In addition, the three schools have strong and established linkages with schools in China, which will be an advantage in their immersion programmes. The three schools were therefore natural choices, and in fact had already been working to introduce various elements of Chinese language and China-related studies into their Integrated Programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were ready and did not have to rush to come up together with a new programme or new approach to meet MOE's needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While not all students in the Bicultural Studies Programme in these three schools will be awarded the new SAP scholarships, we expect all of them to undertake a broadly similar course of study, at the secondary and JC levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bicultural Studies Programme builds on our other existing projects and&nbsp;efforts to nurture an abiding interest in students for the Chinese Language and to encourage those who are able to master the language to go as far as they can. First, a significant group of students in each cohort take Higher Chinese Language (HCL), which is offered from the primary to JC levels. This year, in fact, we have 25% more students taking Higher Chinese in our secondary schools.&nbsp; Second, we have 25 SAP schools at the primary and secondary levels, each with their own programmes to nurture an interest in the language and culture. Further, we have the Language Elective Programme (Chinese), offered at three junior colleges and catering to about 150 students, which aims to deepen students' appreciation of Chinese Language and Literature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bicultural Studies Programme goes further than these other programmes, but by no means detracts from them. Each of these programmes is essential. In different ways and to different extents, they will groom<p align=left>Column: 647<p> students with a good foundation in Chinese Language, history and culture, and an understanding of contemporary China. Some students, particularly those on the Bicultural Studies Programme and LEP (Chinese) are also likely to pursue further studies in universities in China. Ultimately, these programmes, taken together, aim to develop a group of students in each cohort with a lifelong interest in the Chinese language and culture, and the ability to help Singapore engage with China in the years to come.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:LRT AND MRT/NEL STATIONS--><p align=left>Column: 647<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If I may refer&nbsp;the Member to the Potong Pasir Town Council's accounts, just as an example. &nbsp;Potong Pasir has a balance of $8 million in its sinking fund.&nbsp; If&nbsp;he does the cyclical repairs for the 12 blocks that&nbsp;he is&nbsp;right now doing, it will cost&nbsp;him $4 million.&nbsp; So&nbsp;he would have $4 million left.&nbsp; But if he were to do upgrading in a manner&nbsp;which&nbsp; allows lifts to stop at every floor, that would cost another $12 million for this LUP, which means&nbsp;he will be short of $8 million.&nbsp; So the Potong Pasir Town Council really does not have sufficient&nbsp;balance in its sinking fund to do major lift upgrading works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Member's second question is whether or not Potong Pasir Town Council will get the Government's Lift Upgrading Programme.&nbsp; To-date, the Government has done about 600 blocks of LUP and there are about 3,000 eligible blocks remaining.&nbsp; So we have completed roughly 17%.&nbsp; Lift upgrading is selected based on several criteria, ie, the block configuration, the needs of the residents, the geographical spread, and also the degree of support from the residents.&nbsp; We need to bear in mind that it is the whole range of Government policies and programmes that bring about budget surpluses that allow us to do such improvement <p align=left>Column: 651<p>programmes.&nbsp; Hence, all things being equal, residents who support and vote for the Government policies would be given higher priority in upgrading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B>&nbsp; With due respect to the Minister of State, I have been the Chairman of the Potong Pasir Town Council for 15 years now.&nbsp; And I think we know what funds can be used for lift upgrading and what funds cannot be used.&nbsp; I can assure the Minister of State that we do have sufficient funds in the sinking fund to carry out both our Lift Upgrading Programme at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh, and also the R&amp;R works that we are going to do at Potong Pasir estate.&nbsp; Of course, we have to get permission from HDB to do our lift upgrading at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh.&nbsp; But the HDB specifically says, "Ok, you can go ahead and do lift upgrading.", but they do not allow us to make the lifts to stop at every floor.&nbsp; So I want to know what is the reason.&nbsp; We do not spend $12 million, as the Minister has said.&nbsp; The lift upgrading for 29 lifts only cost us just over $2 million.&nbsp; I do not know where he gets his figures from.&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B>&nbsp; Sir, as I said earlier, the town councils are free to do lift upgrading, including providing for lift access to every floor.&nbsp; What it cannot do is to use the sinking fund for such major structural works which include&nbsp;lift&nbsp;stops at every floor.&nbsp; And this is quite plain.&nbsp; Sinking fund is provided for all sorts of cyclical works, not just lift upgrading works.&nbsp; It could be replacement of&nbsp;lifts,&nbsp;water systems, and so forth.&nbsp; So if a particular town council were to use its sinking fund purely to do major structural upgrading works, like allowing lifts to stop at every floor, then it would be an inappropriate use of the sinking fund.&nbsp; Just a back-of-the-envelope calculation, for a 4-room flat, the Member would know that we collect about $50 per<p align=left>Column: 652<p> month for S&amp;CC.&nbsp; So&nbsp;multiply that by 12, it is about $600 a year.&nbsp; And if one-third of $600 is set aside for sinking fund, that is $200.&nbsp; To do a lift upgrading programme which allows a lift to stop at every floor would cost per benefiting unit something like $4,000&nbsp;at the lowest, that is, for&nbsp;common corridor type of flats.&nbsp; You take $4,000 and divide by 200, it will take you 20 years.&nbsp; You will have to collect 20 years of sinking fund from the residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam also has six segmented blocks and those cost a lot more,&nbsp;six times more or $24,000 to do lift upgrading works per benefiting unit. &nbsp;This means 20 x 6, or 120 years of collection of sinking fund from the residents before such works can be completed.&nbsp; So I think my numbers are clear.&nbsp; We have done our research.&nbsp; It will be very difficult and inappropriate for the town council to use&nbsp;its sinking fund for such purposes.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong</B>:&nbsp; I think the Minister of State does not know what is happening at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said lift upgrading, actually what we are doing is replacing all the lifts there.&nbsp; We are ripping off all the old lifts which are about 30 years old, throwing them away and putting new&nbsp;computerised motors in them.&nbsp; And all these are paid for from the sinking fund.&nbsp; We have checked with&nbsp;HDB and we are allowed to use the sinking fund to replace the lifts, and I believe the Minister also said that earlier.&nbsp; When we talk&nbsp;of upgrading,&nbsp;it is a general term, but what we are actually doing is that we are replacing all the lifts there, and we do have enough funds for them.&nbsp; As I said, the total cost is just over $2 million.&nbsp; As the Minister has mentioned, we have got $8 million.&nbsp; I think we do have enough money.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that&nbsp;we have replaced the lifts in its present situation ---</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B>&nbsp; I still want to know the reasons why we are not allowed to make the lift to stop at every floor, especially the point block flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;No reasons are given.&nbsp; They said,&nbsp;we cannot.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; We have got&nbsp;enough money.&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:&nbsp;</B> Sir, Mr Chiam maintains that the Potong Pasir Town Council has enough money.&nbsp; It is granted that they have enough money to do the normal cyclical works which may even include replacement of the lifts.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he is suggesting now is to allow the lift to stop at every floor.&nbsp; What that means is that you&nbsp;will have to do major structural works, creating lift landings where there are none today, knocking off part of the walls to create the lift landing.&nbsp; And for the six segmented blocks that Mr Chiam has in Toa Payoh Lorong 8, of which I have visited,&nbsp;he will need to create extra lift shafts on top of just creating the access to every floor.&nbsp; And our estimation -&nbsp;and we have much experience in doing lift upgrading works -&nbsp;for a single segmented block is that&nbsp;the lift shafts would cost $1.8 million or so.&nbsp; And upgrading of the lift landing to serve every floor is about $400,000.&nbsp; So the total cost is&nbsp;$2.2 million.&nbsp; So that is $24,000 per unit, considering the number of benefiting&nbsp;units there.&nbsp; So as I have just calculated, if&nbsp;he wants to use S&amp;CC for this purpose, then he will need to collect 120 years worth of S&amp;CC funds from his residents just to do this major lift upgrading work, which is clearly inappropriate because the town council would still need to commit the sinking fund for all other kinds of works that it needs to do in its cyclical repairs.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And at the moment, our contract price with the contractors is that the lifts are put in place with the machine&nbsp;to stop at every floor.&nbsp; So when permission is given, what we need to do is just to knock a hole in the wall, make a door for the lift to stop.&nbsp; It is easily adjusted.&nbsp; So the cost would not be as great as what the Minister says.&nbsp; I cannot give&nbsp;him offhand how much the contractors will charge us for knocking down the walls at every floor.&nbsp; But that is the situation and we do have enough money.&nbsp; So the money is not the question.&nbsp; But&nbsp;we still do not know the reasons why permission is not given.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B>&nbsp; Sir, even for point blocks,&nbsp;HDB's experience, after conducting over 600 blocks of LUP, shows that it costs something like $600,000.&nbsp; Therefore, for the&nbsp;benefiting units there, it would cost about $8,000 per benefiting unit.&nbsp; So let me repeat again.&nbsp; If it is $8,000, it would take 40 years to collect S&amp;CC charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if the Member proceeds to do so just for the six point blocks, even if it costs $600,000&nbsp;per block and&nbsp;multiply it&nbsp;by 6,&nbsp;that is&nbsp;$3.6 million.&nbsp; That would be almost half the $8 million that the Member would have.&nbsp; The Member would have to justify to the rest of the residents why half of the sinking funds is committed to benefit only&nbsp;six blocks out of the 61 blocks that he has at Potong Pasir.&nbsp;</p></div></span>		<p align=left>Column: 655<p>			<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Regulation can never protect investors&nbsp;from investment risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho was also concerned about overly aggressive behaviour by fund managers in recommending investment products. &nbsp;The Financial Advisers Act&nbsp;sets out market conduct rules regulating the sales and advisory process of all investment products.&nbsp; Recommendations on investment products must have a reasonable basis, taking into account the investment objectives, financial situation and particular needs of the person to whom the recommendation is being made.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS also provides quite regular&nbsp;guidance to the industry on the standards we expect of them.&nbsp; For example, we have made known our views on how remuneration should be disclosed.&nbsp; We will also be issuing a paper to highlight good practices observed in the industry, as well as guidelines to deter undesirable churning of products.&nbsp; Investors who feel that they have been subject to mis-selling or misrepresentation should first take up the matter with the financial adviser or the institution involved, failing which, <p align=left>Column: 657<p>they can turn to the existing industry dispute resolution schemes.&nbsp; We currently have the Association of Banks' Consumer Mediation Unit and the&nbsp;Insurance Dispute Resolution Organisation (IDRO), both of which were set up last year.&nbsp; But we are taking this further.&nbsp; MAS is also facilitating the setting up of an industry-wide integrated dispute resolution mechanism for all financial products and service providers.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho asked about initiatives&nbsp;to ensure that investors are more educated and better informed.&nbsp; The Government launched a national financial education programme called MoneySENSE in October last year.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;a collaborative effort involving several Government agencies, MCYS, MOE, CPF Board,&nbsp;People's Association and,&nbsp;of course, the MAS, and&nbsp;industry associations and various other community organisations.&nbsp; It aims to help Singaporeans acquire skills and knowledge to better manage their finances and make well-informed financial decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MoneySENSE has issued consumer alerts and tips to guide&nbsp;consumers&nbsp; when they deal with financial advisers and to help them make sense of the various investment products.&nbsp; MoneySENSE has also organised a number of seminars and workshops&nbsp;covering topics, such as basic money management and&nbsp; financial planning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial education, however, has to be a long-term, sustained effort.&nbsp; We have to continually raise awareness among consumers of the risks inherent in any product that offers high returns, and of the need to seek information and advice before committing to investing in a product.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For securities and funds, it is a highly regulated environment.&nbsp; There are prescribed rules that&nbsp;have to be observed, whereas if I were to sell ostrich eggs in Singapore, this is an area of investment which is quite unregulated and, therefore, investors who put money in ostrich eggs are more exposed than those who put money in funds.&nbsp; Or, for that matter,&nbsp;in property investments overseas&nbsp;which are promoted by agents.&nbsp; Would the Minister just highlight to us as to whether or not the Government intends to take a consistent approach in regulating this manner of investments?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>: Sir, the short answer is "No".&nbsp; We do not intend to regulate ostrich eggs or, for that matter, the wide variety of other eggs that might be offered on the market.&nbsp; It is not possible.&nbsp; It is important that we have a transparent system of regulation for all financial products, and I think in the last few years we have made good progress on that.&nbsp; The Financial Advisers Act streamlines both the regulations as well as the codes of best practices across securities firms, insurance firms and the banks, as well as independent financial advisers.&nbsp; That is a major step forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are doing now is to take forward the dispute resolution mechanism.&nbsp; It starts off with the banks - any product&nbsp;distributed by a bank.&nbsp; The&nbsp;insurance industry,&nbsp;both the life insurance and general insurance associations have also got together to set up IDRO,&nbsp;which is working quite well.&nbsp; But there are gaps in terms of fund management products, financial advisers and so on.&nbsp; So, now we are working to integrate all dispute resolution mechanisms, and that should be ready by sometime early next year.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So, sometimes they do not fit within the same template.&nbsp; But certain guidelines on best practices can be formed.&nbsp; At the very least, the best practices of existing players can be shared within the industry and, over time, consumers will know that that is the best practice they should ask for when they deal with the financial adviser.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp; I would put it another way.&nbsp; Consumers, when they enter financial markets or deal with a financial institution, do have a certain expectation of regulation, and the obligation is on us to ensure high standards of disclosure and&nbsp;proper dispute resolution mechanisms.&nbsp; But if we go into either ostrich eggs or some other exciting product offered by an unregulated institution, then we go in with our&nbsp;eyes open.&nbsp; We take our own risks.&nbsp; Most retail investors do not&nbsp;go into these products.&nbsp; The individuals who do so are those who know full well that this is an unregulated market.&nbsp; That is usually why very high returns are promised - because there&nbsp;is very high risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also&nbsp;not be practical for the Government to provide any assurance or regulation over all these new products and players who are really not part of the financial industry.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as at end December 2003, there were about three million CPF members, of whom about 30%, or 877,000&nbsp;members between the ages of 25 and 54, had not contributed to CPF for the preceding three months.&nbsp; Although these members were what we called "inactive", it does not mean that all of them had insufficient CPF savings to cover their retirement needs.&nbsp; For example, some may have other sources of income but opened their CPF accounts in order to qualify for Economic Restructuring Shares and other similar benefits.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's Labour Force Survey estimates that there are 320,000 married<p align=left>Column: 661<p> females between the ages of 25 and 54 who are not working.&nbsp; Of these, 305,000 are homemakers or home care givers taking care of children, elderly or sick relatives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho also asked for the working poor.&nbsp; I presume this means those who may not have enough for retirement even if they are employed. &nbsp;This is difficult to quantify, as there is no universally accepted definition for the working poor.&nbsp; So, let me instead use the&nbsp;Minimum Sum&nbsp;as a measure of adequacy.&nbsp; In 2003, of those active CPF members turning age 55, about 40% had set aside the full Minimum Sum.&nbsp; Our projections show that of those active members aged 45 last year, half will be able to achieve the Minimum Sum when they turn 55 in 10 years' time in 2013.&nbsp; In our longer-term projections, even at a CPF contribution rate of 30%, 76% of new CPF members who contribute regularly to the CPF from the time they start work and are prudent in using CPF for housing, will be able to meet the Minimum Sum of $120,000, in 2003 dollars, when they retire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our CPF system serves as the cornerstone of our retirement provision.&nbsp; It is a sound and sustainable system.&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked how we can help all Singaporeans, including those vulnerable groups, prepare financially for their old age.&nbsp; As this is an oral answer session, I propose not to go into a lengthy discourse, but touch briefly on key points.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, we help people save enough in their CPF by helping them stay employable as long as possible through reskilling and skills upgrading.&nbsp; We should help them save enough for their expected life expectancy, which is why we will gradually raise the Minimum Sum to $120,000 in 2003 dollars by 2013.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we must curb excessive consumption&nbsp;on housing and medical<p align=left>Column: 662<p> care.&nbsp; For example, we have tightened the rules on the use of CPF for property purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;As medical expenses form a potentially large component of consumption, we must stretch the Medisave dollar.&nbsp; MOH has recently announced that they are reviewing MediShield for this purpose.&nbsp; Individuals can also reduce their medical needs by maintaining healthy lifestyles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must emphasise the extended family as the social and financial support unit.&nbsp; We allow and encourage top-ups for spouses and parents.&nbsp; Family members can use their Medisave accounts for each other. &nbsp;For non-working spouses, we encourage their working spouses or children to top up their CPF Minimum Sum.&nbsp; For the&nbsp;Year of Assessment 2005, we have increased the tax relief ceiling for a member who tops up for his parents and grandparents who are aged 55 and older using cash, from $6,000 per year to $7,000 per year.&nbsp; This tax relief has also been extended to include non-working spouses who are at least 55 years old and who earned less than $2,000 in the preceding year.&nbsp; CPF Board will continue to review the topping-up conditions so that more members can benefit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from CPF, we must also help members find other sources of income.&nbsp; Most Singaporeans are home owners. &nbsp;With HDB's relaxation of rental rules, there are now 250,000 homes that can be rented out fully or in part.&nbsp; For the elderly and those not working, they should consider their home as a potential source of income.&nbsp; We will continue to explore workable options to monetise their housing assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government recognises that there are vulnerable groups who may have difficulty preparing adequately for retirement under the CPF system. &nbsp;We must help them to find employment and to upgrade their skills.&nbsp; We will work closely with community and union partners in this effort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 663<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In years of surpluses, the Government helps these Singaporeans by topping up their CPF.&nbsp; Since 1995, we have&nbsp;disbursed about $4 billion to CPF members. &nbsp;For Singaporeans who lack any family support and need&nbsp;financial assistance, various public assistance schemes and Medifund provide a safety net.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In fact, we consider this as part of education.&nbsp; There are many opportunities and platforms in our schools for them to discuss and debate national and international issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as part of the school curriculum itself, such as in History and Social Studies classes and the General Paper for junior college students.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some schools in addition&nbsp;also conduct lessons in Parliament style to engage their students, who play roles as Members of Parliament. For example, Dunman High School and Victoria School organise a <p align=left>Column: 674<p>yearly Moot Parliament for their Secondary 3 students to simulate the debate of national issues and the tabling of Bills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry&nbsp;also organises the annual Pre-University Seminar for 500 or so students from all our junior colleges and centralised institutes over a period of&nbsp;six days. The seminar provides an important opportunity for students to discuss national issues of importance, to engage Ministers, as well as&nbsp;industry and community leaders, and to throw up new ideas of their own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our polytechnics and universities too, there are more channels for such exposure to national issues. The Polytechnic Forum is organised every year where student leaders from all&nbsp;five polytechnics come together to discuss national issues such as the Remaking of Singapore. In our universities, students can participate in a wide range of student organisations or attend seminars on national issues.&nbsp; In NTU, for example, there is a range of societies such as the Current Affairs Society, United Nations Student Association, and the Students' Feedback Unit. In NUS, they have the Political Science Society, where students debate national issues of the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise for our ITE students, the ITE Student Seminar is held biennially. Each Seminar is organised with a theme where political leaders and prominent corporate leaders from both the private and public sectors are invited to speak to the students. The students are given opportunities to engage the speakers, as well as interact amongst themselves, exchanging views and making presentations on Government policies and current affairs of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside of our schools, our students get involved in other channels to discuss<p align=left>Column: 675<p> the issues of the day, or to contribute their ideas. A good example is Channel I's "I-contact" programme, which got students to exchange ideas with Ministers on issues that matter to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Education&nbsp;will continue to review the various programmes and channels through which we can encourage our students to engage and play a responsible role in school as well as the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But, when you talk about a students' parliament, "parliament" connotes certain things.&nbsp; When you pass resolution, there must be some follow up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be only one Parliament in the land, and that is this House.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the&nbsp;Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts)</B>:&nbsp;The broadband market in Singapore is making good progress.&nbsp; Broadband adoption is rising and the household penetration rate has increased from 27% in June 2003 to 38% in June 2004.&nbsp; Prices have also fallen.&nbsp; Since 2001, residential broadband prices for unlimited<p align=left>Column: 678<p> access plans have fallen by up to 67%.&nbsp; There are also low cost packages for novice users with low usage.&nbsp; Our broadband access speeds have gone up and consumers now have a choice of services with speeds of up to 3 Mbps for cable modem access.&nbsp; We estimate that about 40% of broadband subscribers in Singapore are on access speeds of at least 1.5 Mbps.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chia mentioned that there are jurisdications where access speeds are significantly higher than Singapore's and prices are lower.&nbsp; We must be mindful comparisons may not be "apple to apple" and there may be other charges such as separate line rental charges along with the broadband access charges.&nbsp; The underlying cost structure also varies from place to place and each country has a different market size, usage profile and competition from alternatives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and China cited by Mr Chia, Singapore operators have the smallest user base&nbsp; to recover costs from.&nbsp; Also, unlike Korea and Japan where users access local-language content hosted locally, the majority of Internet traffic in Singapore is to access content hosted outside Singapore and this comes at a higher cost.&nbsp; Lastly, with relatively low fixed line rates, the substitution of broadband for dial-up access is not as compelling for some users, unlike the case in the other countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A point to note also is that aggressive price competition taking place in other markets may not be sustainable.&nbsp; For example, according to a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit in April, major broadband access service providers (BASPs) in Korea were facing financial difficulty due to aggressive price cutting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, IDA will continue to press on in its efforts to promote sustainable broadband adoption on several fronts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 679<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, to encourage greater competition, IDA is supporting technical trials in alternative broadband technologies that can lower deployment cost and increase access speeds.&nbsp; IDA will be making radio frequency spectrum available for the deployment of wireless broadband technologies and is working with the industry&nbsp; to pilot several wireless broadband services which would promise higher speed at lower cost.&nbsp; If successful, these new technologies can be deployed to enhance competitiveness of our broadband market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, IDA has put in place measures to overcome the lack of effective competition in infrastructure such as facilitating the introduction of wholesale broadband access services.&nbsp; IDA's ruling to require SingTel to offer its Local Leased Circuits to Facilities Based Operators at a discount should further reduce the cost of service providers who rely heavily on LLCs to provide telecom services to end users.&nbsp; These cost savings may then be passed on to end users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IDA will continue to explore other options, including both developmental and pro-competition measures, to encourage broadband development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chia also asked if both price and speed of broadband services would impede Singapore's development into an international and regional information hub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While broadband costs and speed are considerations, there are other important factors like international and regional connectivity, prices of other infocomm services, intellectual property protection and trade links with other countries that contribute to our hub status. Singapore fares well in all these areas. For example, we have 21 Tbps submarine cable capacity and over 13 Gbps direct connectivity to more than 20 countries.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 680<p> We were also ranked top in Asia for Intellectual Property Rights Protection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chia also asked whether allowing telcos and service providers to tie down existing customers through the use of contracts and high termination fees would result in inefficiencies and poor service standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of commercial practice, BASPs set minimum contract periods and termination fees to ensure a reasonable return on the cost of new customer acquisitions, like cost of a "free" or subsidised modem, gifts or discounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no evidence that such practices have compromised quality of service and service standards have been good. For example, since 2003, their network availability has been generally above 99% and their service activation time from the date of receipt of an application has been generally less than&nbsp;five days.&nbsp; Nevertheless, IDA will continue to monitor the situation and where the need arises, IDA will consider additional measures to remove any anti-competitive actions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The High Court only hears contested applications for the division of matrimonial assets under Part X of the Women's Charter, where the assets are worth $1.5 million or more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties in family law proceedings can currently appeal against an order made by the Subordinate Courts to the High Court and lodge further appeals against the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in civil cases, there are some qualifications on the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Section 34(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act provides that the leave of court must be obtained, for example, where the subject matter at the trial is $250,000 or less. In family law cases, it is not possible to quantify a divorce or custody matter in monetary terms in most cases. Hence, in practice, family law proceedings heard by the Subordinate Courts have two tiers of appeal as a matter of right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Why there should be only one tier of appeal as a matter of right</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These amendments were proposed by the Supreme Court to address an anomaly. With respect to civil proceedings (other than family law matters), which are<p align=left>Column: 683<p> heard in the Subordinate Courts,&nbsp; a party has, subject to certain statutory conditions, the right to appeal to the High Court. Leave is needed for a further appeal to the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; However, in family law cases, parties currently have the right to appeal from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court and then make a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, without having to seek leave. This is an anomaly which needs correction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the interests of finality, there should be only one tier of appeal as a matter of right for family cases, with a second appeal only with the leave of court. The general position in Singapore for civil cases, other than family cases, is only one tier of appeal as a matter of right. This is because having an automatic second tier of appeal delays a final decision on the matter and increases costs for litigants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family cases do not generally involve complex issues of law or matters of public interest. Most of the appeals in family proceedings before the Court of Appeal deal with disputes over the facts of the case. Such cases that involve disputes on factual matters, there is no need for more than one tier of appeal.&nbsp; As a matter of principle, the Court of Appeal's resources would be better utilised to deal with questions of law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where civil judgments of the Subordinate Courts are appealed to the High Court, leave is granted for a further appeal to the Court of Appeal if certain established principles are satisfied. Leave is usually granted where there is a <I>prima facie</I> case of error of law, a question of general principle to be decided for the first time or a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to public advantage. With the passing of this Bill, similar principles will apply to appeals to the Court of</p><p>Appeal in family proceedings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 684<p><p><I>Proposed amendments&nbsp;<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will insert a new provision, in section 34(2), to require leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal where the High Court makes an order in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction with respect to any proceedings under the Adoption of Children Act or under Part VII, VIII or IX of the Women's Charter. Divorce proceedings, including division of matrimonial assets, summary applications to resolve disputes between husband and wife as to possession of property and proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act were originally heard by the High Court. These proceedings were transferred to the Subordinate Courts by a&nbsp;1996 Order of the Chief Justice, made under section 28A. A new complementary provision will be inserted in section 28A of the Act to allow the Chief Justice to make such provision governing appeals relating to proceedings transferred to the District Court, including provisions to restrict the right of appeal. The Chief Justice intends to specify by Order that leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal is required in family proceedings transferred to the District Court for hearing in the first instance. Lastly, a new provision will be inserted under section 34 to clarify that where family law proceedings are heard by the High Court in the first instance, the monetary limit in section 34(2)(a) does not apply to an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> Sir, my complaint is against clause 2 of the Bill.&nbsp; This clause makes an amendment to the principal Act whereby the Chief Justice is given the discretion to stop an appeal, amongst other provisions, which he can make when a case is transferred to&nbsp;a District Court.&nbsp; As an Opposition Member, I cannot allow, consciously, the legislature<p align=left>Column: 685<p> to diminish the rights of a litigant, especially the right of appeal.&nbsp; A litigant must be allowed, all the way, to exhaust his remedies in a court of law.&nbsp; How else can he seek justice except in a court of law?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the case of the former&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mr Anwar Ibrahim.&nbsp; If he were not allowed to appeal, he would not have a chance to clear his name in respect of the sodomy charges levelled against him.&nbsp; He appealed against the charges and he succeeded.&nbsp; He was released pending the hearing of his appeals against other charges which he was convicted of in the first instance.&nbsp; After successfully appealing against the sodomy charges, he, at least, was temporarily released so that he could go to Germany for his medical treatment, and also an opportunity to reunite with his wife and members of his family.&nbsp; If he were not allowed to appeal, as we are now legislating here in Singapore, he would still be tainted with the sodomy charges and would still be languishing in prison without the benefit of getting medical treatment and reuniting with his family and friends.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know that the policy of the courts, since&nbsp;the 1990s, has been to administer the judicial process swiftly and efficiently.&nbsp; Much of the backlog of&nbsp;cases has been quickly dealt with.&nbsp; The aim in the courts is, of course,&nbsp;to complete a case within 12 months under the workplan to administer the courts implemented by the Chief Justice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I applaud the courts'&nbsp;policy in promoting efficiency and cutting out delays in the cases that are brought before the courts, I am of the view that efficiency in our courts cannot be achieved at the expense of the rights of the public.&nbsp; A member of the public has the common law right of seeking justice to its ultimate end.&nbsp;&nbsp;One famous English<p align=left>Column: 686<p> judge said, "Justice must not only be done but seen to be done."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the amendment in clause 2, how can justice be&nbsp;seen to be done in Singapore when the right of appeal is eventually not even accorded to a litigant?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wish to mention that these days, the sentences meted out in appeals heard before the Chief Justice&nbsp;are not always&nbsp;more lenient.&nbsp; On the contrary, we have read in the papers that sentences on appeal before the Chief Justice can be double.&nbsp; And when the sentences involve caning, doubling the sentence can be a very painful experience.&nbsp; So the sentences meted out on appeal is a deterrent to those defendants with frivolous&nbsp;appeals without any merit.&nbsp; Those defendants normally are advised by their solicitors not to appeal, and they normally take heed of the advice of their lawyers.&nbsp; The sentence in the appeal in the High Court is a strong deterrent on would-be appellants with frivolous appeals, and those appellants would normally give up the idea of appealing before the Chief Justice.&nbsp; In this way, there is no fear of taking up the court's time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this amendment involves the taking away of a litigant's right of appeal.&nbsp; To me, this is an important amendment, and I say that&nbsp;there should be further discussion on it.&nbsp; I therefore call on the Minister to place the Bill before a Select Committee and let the public have their say on the matter.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Chiam has come here with a prepared speech which he had to deliver.&nbsp; But had he listened to what I said in my Second Reading speech, he would have realised that the thrust of his points is misconceived and totally unwarranted.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thrust of his complaint about clause 2 and about the Bill is that somehow the inherent right of appeal has <p align=left>Column: 687<p>been dismembered or suppressed.&nbsp; But that is not the case.&nbsp; As I took pains to explain, this situation covers a category of family law cases which, at one time, was heard in the High Court, but they are now heard in the Subordinate Courts because they were transferred by order of the Chief Justice.&nbsp; Had they not been transferred to the Subordinate Courts, the parties, in these cases, would have one tier of appeal&nbsp; -&nbsp; from the High Court to the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; They have now been transferred to the Subordinate Courts.&nbsp; And in all&nbsp;civil cases heard in the Subordinate Courts, in&nbsp;the first instance, there is a right of appeal only to the High Court, and there is no further automatic&nbsp;appeal as a matter of right to the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; It is by leave of the court.&nbsp; Therein lies the anomaly.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, for this category of cases which originally the court of first instance was the High Court,&nbsp;now, because they are transferred to the Subordinate Courts, the Subordinate Courts hear them in the first instance.&nbsp; The anomaly was not rectified. They have a right of appeal to the High Court and right of appeal to the Court of Appeal without leave.&nbsp; So there is an anomaly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me add that there is no curtailment of the right because he has the recourse of appeal to the Court of Appeal, but with leave.&nbsp; And the statistics in the Supreme Court show that in most cases where it involves questions of law or allegations that an error of law has occurred, the court does grant leave.&nbsp; So there is no injustice and&nbsp;there is no suppression of the inherent right of appeal.&nbsp; It is to bring this system in line with the prevailing system for all other civil cases.&nbsp; So all the spectre of injustice that he raised here, including analogy with Anwar's case, is totally misconceived.&nbsp; It was a fairly good speech but for a wrong occasion!</P></span></div>					<p align=left>Column: 688<p>				<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> &nbsp;Sir, I am sorry that my reading of the Explanatory Statement seems to differ from the Minister's reading of it.&nbsp; To clarify my point, I just read this statement and see whether the House thinks I am right or the Minister is right:<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Clause 2 amends section 28A(2) to empower the Chief Justice, when making any order for the allocation of proceedings to the District Court under the section, to also make such provision governing appeals relating to such proceedings as he thinks fit, including provisions restricting the right of appeal."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I understand it - if I can still remember my procedure - some cases can be tried in the High Court but they are transferred to the Subordinate Courts.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, we are giving the Chief Justice legislative power to make certain provisions limiting probably the number of witnesses or the time,&nbsp;but including in that provision is the stoppage of the right of appeal.&nbsp; That is my understanding of this section, unless I am wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the right of appeal, under these circumstances, is that the litigant is denied of the right of appeal.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, all I need to say is that he has to read that provision in the context of the totality of the Bill and also with regard to the intent of the Bill, as I have explained in my Second Reading speech.&nbsp; If the Member thinks that this provision entitles the Chief Justice to completely prevent a litigant from making any appeal, that is obviously not a correct reading of the provision and that is certainly not the intent of the Bill.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> Sir,&nbsp;as I understand it, the right of appeal can be stopped by legislation, and this is exactly what we are doing.&nbsp; We are legislating to deny a litigant a chance of appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament can stop a court from giving that right of appeal, and this is what we are doing, and this is my fear.</P></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 689<p>					<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can do no more than to state and reiterate that that is a misreading of the Bill and that is not the intent of the Bill.&nbsp; And may I take this opportunity also to say that the second part of his speech where he went on sentences of the court, I think this had been dealt previously on other occasions by my colleague, Senior Minister of State Assoc.

We had consulted the Lands Surveyors Board and the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers on these amendments.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Surveyors Act was enacted to establish a system of registration of surveyors to meet the demand for cadastral surveys in Singapore.&nbsp; The Boundaries and Survey Maps Act was enacted to provide for the appointment, powers and duties of the Chief Surveyor pertaining to the marking and surveying of lot boundaries; publishing and maintaining survey maps in manual and electronic forms; and establishing a coordinated cadastre.&nbsp; The amendments can be divided into three categories, namely, amendments relating to the land surveying profession, amendments relating to land surveying and some consequential and related amendments.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt"><I>Amendments relating to the land surveying profession</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tune with the business environment and as part of our free trade agreement obligations, the Bill removes certain&nbsp;restrictions imposed on multi-discipline corporations and partnerships which supply survey services.&nbsp; The Professional Engineers Board and Board of Architects have also abolished similar requirements. First, the requirement that registered surveyors or allied professionals must hold at least two-thirds share in a limited corporation will be removed. Second, it is no longer a requirement that all the directors of a limited corporation must be registered surveyors or allied professionals. And third, the registered surveyor who has control and management of the business of a corporation&nbsp;need not be ordinarily resident<p align=left>Column: 691<p> in Singapore.&nbsp; The amendment is found in clause 7.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Chief Surveyor is concurrently the President of the Land Surveyors Board.&nbsp; The Bill seeks to separate the functions of the Chief Surveyor and those of the President of the Land Surveyors Board by amending section 4 of the Land Surveyors Act.&nbsp; The Chief Surveyor will continue to oversee, regulate and set the standards required in the conduct of cadastral surveys within the ambit of the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act while the President of the Land Surveyors Board will continue to oversee the professional learning, standards and conduct of all registered surveyors through the Land Surveyors Act.&nbsp; With two persons, there will be better checks and balances in promoting and regulating standards in the surveying profession.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect this, the Bill transfers Part IX, on Conduct of Cadastral Surveys, of the Land Surveyors Act to a new Part IIA in the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we further propose to remove the requirement that Assistant Surveyors be approved and registered by the Land Surveyors Board.&nbsp; This is in line with Government's move to cut rules and reduce business costs.&nbsp; The registration requirement was imposed so that surveyors would employ Assistant Surveyors with the necessary qualifications. However, this is an unnecessary safeguard since registered surveyors are responsible for the cadastral surveys they do. As registered surveyors, they are accountable to the Land Surveyors Board for their work.&nbsp; Allied professionals, such as architects and engineers, do not register their assistants under their Acts.&nbsp; Countries with similar cadastral systems, like Australia and New Zealand, also do not approve and register Assistant Surveyors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 692<p> To foster re-learning and upgrading of the professional knowledge and skills of practising surveyors, clause 5 of the Bill empowers the Land Surveyors Board to introduce continuing professional development as an additional condition for renewal of a surveyor's annual practising certificate. Architects and professional engineers have similar requirements.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 35A is introduced to empower the Land Surveyors Board to appoint a lawyer for any investigation, hearing or appeal conducted by an Investigation Committee or the Board or on an appeal to the High Court.&nbsp; Also, a&nbsp;new section 35B will empower the Board to recover the cost and reasonable expenses related to these disciplinary proceedings from the registered surveyor, licensed corporation or partnership, as the case may be.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt"><I>Amendments relating to land surveying<br></I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the Bill makes consequential amendments to the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act to enable the electronic submission of survey records and documents by surveyors as part of our e-Government initiative.&nbsp; Currently, the Act only allows hardcopies of survey records and plans to be submitted.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also empowers the Chief Surveyor to generate new maps from the coordinated cadastre established under section 7 of the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act, and to declare that the new maps supersede the maps published under the repealed section of the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt"><I>Consequential and miscellaneous amendments</I><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, other related and consequential amendments to the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act are:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, to decriminalise the failure to give information to a survey officer. This<p align=left>Column: 693<p> is no longer necessary as all the survey districts have been surveyed and the survey maps have been published.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, to clarify that assistants employed by registered surveyors may also enter sites to conduct cadastral surveys subject to conditions imposed by the Chief Surveyor.&nbsp; This is because physical measurements on the ground are usually done by assistant surveyors.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, to state in the Act what is the current position that registered surveyors are primarily responsible for the accuracy of their cadastral survey plans although such plans have been approved by the Chief Surveyor.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, to empower the Chief Surveyor to refuse to approve any survey plans if an encroachment has been created by the developer and it has not been resolved. Currently, under the Act, the Chief Surveyor can only refuse to grant approval to a survey plan in two very narrow situations, ie, where subdivision permission has not been obtained and where survey fees have not been paid. Arising from a recent case, to protect the public interest, this amendment seeks to provide an additional ground which will operate in situations where encroachments are created as a result of new developments.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fifth, to remove the limitation period of one year for surveyors to bear the cost of rectifying errors in their cadastral surveys.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consequential and technical amendments are also made to the Land Titles Act and Land Titles (Strata) Act to remove the current requirement for registered surveyors to deposit two sets of the strata title plan; one with the Chief Surveyor and the other with the Registrar of Titles. Under these amendments, registered surveyors will need to deposit only one set of strata title plan with the<p align=left>Column: 694<p> Chief Surveyor.&nbsp; This is possible because the Chief Surveyor and the Registrar of Titles are now part of the Singapore Land Authority and their work processes have been integrated. Overall, surveyors will appreciate this streamlining arising from workflow improvements.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As the Chairperson of the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers, whose primary objective is to ensure high standards of professional practice among its members, I am pleased that the Act now specifically requires registered land surveyors to fulfill certain minimum continuing professional development requirements before they can renew their practising certificate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land surveying has become highly technical and increasingly sophisticated due to rapid advances such as in the area of satellite-based GPS site surveys and digital technology.&nbsp; It is imperative that land surveyors continuously upgrade their skills and competencies; otherwise, they may become obsolete.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am also pleased that the Act will be changed to bring the provisions relating to multi-disciplinary professional services, including those of surveying services, in line with those of allied professionals.&nbsp; Essentially, the amendments make it easier for&nbsp; multi-disciplinary firms</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

For instance, in the case of limited companies, as the Minister of State has noted, there is now no requirement that only a registered surveyor or an allied professional can be a director of the company in order for the Land Surveyors Board to grant a licence to that company.&nbsp; All that is required now is that there is a prescribed number or proportion of directors stipulated in the Articles of Association of the company who are registered surveyors or allied professionals.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is now no requirement that the director of the company who is a registered surveyor must be a resident of Singapore.&nbsp; This move is very liberating and could introduce fresh talent from overseas into the local profession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, whilst I feel that many of the amendments proposed are progressive, there are two amendments which are of concern to the surveying profession and could impinge negatively on the industry and end users of the surveying services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it relates to the abolishing of registration of Assistant Surveyors.&nbsp; Sir, the present requirement for assistant surveyors to possess the necessary minimum qualifications recognised by the Board and to be registered with the Board has worked well and helped ensure minimum practice standards in the industry.&nbsp; This is because whilst the registered surveyor is ultimately responsible for the survey, the assistant surveyors are crucial&nbsp;in the surveying job as they are the ones who undertake and supervise the bulk of the on-site work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, abolishing the requirement for the registration of assistant surveyors is akin to telling a brain surgeon that he does not need to have a qualified nurse in the <p align=left>Column: 696<p>operating theatre or a professional civil engineer that he can do without a qualified clerk of works in a major subterranean operation.&nbsp; Registered land surveyors, when faced with a credit crunch during a downturn, may be tempted to cut costs by hiring assistant surveyors without the prerequisite knowledge or skills since he is now allowed to do so under the proposed amendments.&nbsp; Of course, surveying work is not life threatening, and the medical analogy might not be the most apt, but the outcome of land surveying work has significant impact on land disputes, title issues, and property prices - all matters of concern to the ordinary Singaporeans.&nbsp; I see the amendment as a step back in the maintenance of high professional standards in surveying practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill seems to send out conflicting signals.&nbsp; On the one hand, CPD is now stipulated as one of the requirements for the renewal of a registered surveyor's practising certificate.&nbsp; This would help uphold professional practice standards in the face of rapid technological changes.&nbsp; Yet in the same Bill, registration of assistant surveyors is now to be abolished to the potential detriment of professional standards.&nbsp; I believe the&nbsp;cost of providing a registration system for assistant surveyors will be more than justified by the downside of significant costs, delays and inconvenience to all stakeholders, including home owners, that could result from surveying errors.&nbsp; Registration is but a small price to pay.&nbsp; If this Bill were to be passed without amendments made to the proposal to abolish the registration of assistant surveyors, then, at the very least, I would like to urge the Minister to consider including in the Cadastral Survey Directive issued by the Chief Surveyor from time to time to require registered surveyors to employ assistant surveyors who have certain prescribed minimum qualifications.&nbsp; This would help maintain some minimum standards among assistant surveyors <p align=left>Column: 697<p>employed in the industry.&nbsp; Otherwise, anyone, including a foreign work permit holder, could become an assistant surveyor under the proposed amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point relates to the repeal of Part IX which relates to conduct of cadastral survey.&nbsp; The Bill states that Part IX of the present Act is to be repealed and re-enacted with minor amendments in the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act.&nbsp; Under its present form, section 39(3) of the Act provides for two circumstances under which the Chief Surveyor may withhold approval of any plan, as has been reiterated by the Minister.&nbsp;These are (1) if the subdivision permission, as required under the Planning Act, has not been obtained, or (2) when the survey fee payable has not been paid.&nbsp; Section 39(3) is to appear as section 11D(3) in the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act.&nbsp; The two circumstances are now spelt out under sections 11D(3)(a) and (3)(b).&nbsp; In addition to these two circumstances, there is now a new&nbsp;circumstance stipulated under which the&nbsp;Chief Surveyor may withhold approval.&nbsp; This is section 11D(3)(c) which states that approval may be withheld if the registered surveyor has not certified that any encroachment created by the purchaser or owner of a parcel of land being surveyed has been resolved.&nbsp; This new provision appears to have been included due to the recent encroachment issues highlighted by that of Escada View, a housing development built by the bankrupt Grandlink Group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the new provision would seem to imply that the Chief Surveyor may withhold approval for any encroachment which has not been resolved, regardless of whether it is a new encroachment or one arising from an existing structure.&nbsp; Furthermore, this section seems to place the onus of resolving the encroachment issue on the registered surveyor since approval may be withheld if the registered surveyor has not certified that the encroachment has been resolved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 698<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it would be relatively easy to resolve new encroachments of, for example, a developer building a boundary wall which encroaches onto an adjoining piece of land.&nbsp; This is because the party responsible for the encroachment is easily identifiable.&nbsp; In such instances, the developer responsible for the encroachment under common law would have to tear down and rebuild the boundary wall.&nbsp; However, if the encroachment is due to an existing structure, such as a retaining wall or boundary wall which was built even before the new developer or owner came onto the scene, determining the party or parties responsible for such encroachment could be cumbersome.&nbsp; Investigations would have to be made to determine if construction was done jointly with the existing or previous neighbours or was previously required by the authorities.&nbsp; Furthermore, complications can arise.&nbsp; In the case of a non-structural boundary wall, which was built long ago, at a time when building plan submissions for the erection were not required, there could be no record of encroachment in the land registry.&nbsp; In such instances, only the courts can determine with finality who created the encroachment and how it can be resolved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolving such encroachment issues would be beyond the scope and responsibility of the registered surveyor.&nbsp; The registered surveyor's professional duty would be only to determine if there is an encroachment and to highlight such encroachments to the developer and the authorities.&nbsp; It would be grossly unfair to place the onus of resolving such encroachment issues on the registered surveyor, which the proposed new subsection seems to do.&nbsp; If a development has been completed on land with encroachment, completion of sales for all subdivided units will be delayed if the Chief Surveyor does not approve the<p align=left>Column: 699<p> certified plan, even though the encroachment may only affect one of the subdivided lots and not all the subdivided lots in the development.&nbsp; Purchasers of units on the subdivided lots could be inconvenienced.&nbsp; More importantly, they face the prospect of incurring extra costs as a result of the delay in completion of the sale and purchase.&nbsp; The developer could also face legal action by all&nbsp;purchasers of the development for the delay in&nbsp;completion of the sale and purchase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for such complex encroachment issues, which cannot be quickly and easily resolved, the Act could allow the certified plan to be approved and the encroachment registered with the land registry.&nbsp; In this way, purchasers whose subdivided lots are not affected by the encroachment can complete their sales, leaving only the affected purchaser and/or the authorities and the developer to resolve the encroachment issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I would like to urge the Minister to look into these two areas of concern arising from the proposed amendments which I have highlighted and make provisions to overcome the possible negative repercussions, if not in the Act itself, then at least in the Cadastral Survey Directive issued by the Chief Surveyor from time to time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these suggestions, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Dr Amy Khor for supporting the Bill.&nbsp; Indeed, as she says, the Bill will introduce processes that will improve and streamline the surveying profession, both its regulation as well as&nbsp;the processes of surveying.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me address Dr Khor's two points.&nbsp; Her first point is that, with the <p align=left>Column: 700<p>doing away with the registration of assistant surveyors, that may lead to a drop in standards.&nbsp; Sir, I think Dr Khor's point can be met with two checks that are in place.&nbsp; Sir, the first check is, as&nbsp;Dr Khor quite rightly points out,&nbsp;that the registered surveyor under the Land Surveyors Act remains primarily responsible to the Chief Surveyor.&nbsp; As a professional, he is accountable for what he does.&nbsp; So following the practice of&nbsp;allied&nbsp; professionals like the architects and engineers, where their assistants are not required to be registered, the amendment is now made to also do away with the registration of assistant surveyors.&nbsp; Because, essentially, the assistant surveyors work under the guidance, direction and supervision of the registered surveyors.&nbsp; So that is the first key point.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ultimately the professional responsibility of the registered surveyors, whom I am sure will be as concerned as anybody else, to engage assistant surveyors who are adequately trained and who will do the job, especially in terms of field work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is that these assistant surveyors do survey work on the ground.&nbsp; Before they do that, in fact, their qualifications will be monitored, and this point is something that we would assure Dr Khor. Before they can do that, their names will be submitted by the registered surveyors so that the Chief Surveyor can issue them authority cards. &nbsp;And, in fact, a SOP has been in place to ensure that the entry of land is properly done with notification and&nbsp;authority cards.&nbsp; So at that point in time, the Chief Surveyor's Office will look at the qualifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is&nbsp;the assurance that the Chief Surveyor has given me, because I am as concerned as her, that standards should not drop.&nbsp;The Chief Surveyor&nbsp;will monitor the academic qualifications of the assistant surveyors&nbsp;doing the survey and the standard will not drop below the current standard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 701<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For good measure, indeed, the Chief Surveyor will publish these minimum qualifications in a Directive on Cadastral Survey that he would be publishing.&nbsp;I think this is the first point, ie, the work of the assistant surveyors&nbsp;is important.&nbsp; With this amendment, the work would still be properly done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second point is why there is an amendment to empower the Chief Surveyor not to grant approval of the survey plan if there is an encroachment that has been created as a result of new boundaries created by a development for which a survey plan has been submitted.&nbsp; As Dr Khor rightly pointed out, this amendment has been made in the light of a recent case where unwittingly some purchasers had bought units in a condominium and, unfortunately, because the developer had gone insolvent and, in fact, even though the developer knew about the encroachment, because the survey plans were approved, they could take out&nbsp;Certificates of Title and therefore they could issue&nbsp;titles to the sub-purchasers.&nbsp; And so under the law, SLA in fact went against the sub-purchasers to pay for the land upon which the encroachment, in this case,&nbsp;a retaining wall, was built.&nbsp; Hence, the approach therefore is that, in the public interest, it is better really to resolve these encroachments upfront rather than, for example,&nbsp;the suggestion by Dr Khor is to give notice of encroachment to sub-purchasers, and if sub-purchasers buy with notice of encroachment, they will take it with notice.&nbsp; But then you do not resolve the problem upfront.&nbsp; The question of the parties' rights can surface later on and can sometimes result in litigation.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, rather than do that, arising from the experience of this case that we had, the approach is to try to address the problem at source, ie, when the surveyor submits his survey plans to the Chief Surveyor, the onus is now on him.&nbsp; I think <p align=left>Column: 702<p>Dr Khor would agree that a surveyor who does his job would know what is on the ground, because encroachments cannot be hidden.&nbsp; It can be a retaining wall, an overhanging balcony or eave or a pillar to an entrance, and he will notice that.&nbsp; So, it is better for him when he does that - and that is what will happen in practice -&nbsp;to let the developer know, because the developer has engaged him for the job.&nbsp; So, really, the pressure point is not on him as such, but on the developer, because in order for the developer to sell the units, he has to take&nbsp;out Certificates of Title and, to do that, he has to submit approved&nbsp;survey plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onus is therefore on the developer to rectify the encroachment.&nbsp; He can do&nbsp;that in one of three ways.&nbsp; He can, for example, remove the encroachment, if it can be easily removed; or he can apply for a Temporary Occupation Licence from SLA; or&nbsp;buy over the encroached land from the State or, if the adjoining land is private land, then buy it over from its owner.&nbsp; Once the encroachment is resolved in this way, it is clear cut.&nbsp; Any sub-purchaser who buys from him will know that there is no encroachment which can trouble him later on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have thought over the alternative approaches&nbsp;very carefully.&nbsp; For example, notice of encroachment is one; giving approval for the survey plan,&nbsp;then getting SLA to enforce against the developer later on is another.&nbsp; But all these are approaches where the horse would have bolted from the stable, and the problem can then arise that can cause problems to sub-purchasers who are really members of the public.&nbsp; So, rather than do that, make the developer, who is a business entity here, responsible for rectifying the encroachment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The surveyor is, in a sense, the point man, because he is a professional doing the survey on the ground.&nbsp; He is the one who will discover the encroachment and, in practice, he will tell his employer, in this case, the <p align=left>Column: 703<p>developer, about it, and then the process should be resolved because, failing which, the survey&nbsp;plans would not be approved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let us work out this approach and see how it goes.&nbsp; As Dr Khor has mentioned, SISV is in close touch with the Chief Surveyor.&nbsp; In fact, there is a very good working relationship.&nbsp; There will be continuing dialogue, and I am sure we can monitor the system so that, should problems arise, we can adjust this process in due course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

The Hire-Purchase Act&nbsp;was first enacted in 1969 in response to the growth of hire-purchase transactions in the 1960s.&nbsp; The main objective then was to protect unsophisticated consumers from harsh and oppressive one-sided provisions in hire-purchase agreements, such as exceedingly high interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for some minor amendments, the Hire-Purchase Act has remained <p align=left>Column: 704<p>unchanged since it was first enacted in 1969.&nbsp; However, Singapore's financial market has since evolved.&nbsp; Consumers now have wider choices of financing.&nbsp; They are better educated and more sophisticated.&nbsp; With proper consumer education, they can make informed choices.&nbsp; As regulators, we promote greater disclosure and transparency to ensure that the market can work efficiently.&nbsp; There is, therefore, a need to update the Hire-Purchase Act to align with these developments.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, a joint private and public Taskforce, led by the&nbsp;Ministry of Trade Industry, was formed to comprehensively review the Hire-Purchase Act.&nbsp; The Taskforce included representatives from the Association of Banks in Singapore, the Association of Hire Purchase and Finance Companies, the Automobile Association of Singapore, the Consumers Association of Singapore, the Singapore Business Federation and the Singapore Retailers Association.&nbsp; Based on the Taskforce's recommendations, MTI drafted a Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Bill, and conducted public consultations in May and June this year.&nbsp; We received a number of good suggestions and feedback to improve the draft Bill.&nbsp; These have been incorporated into the final Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key provisions of the Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now take the House through the clauses in the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Bill now before the House is designed to achieve certain objectives:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;reinforce disclosure and transparency requirements so&nbsp;that consumers have the material information they need to&nbsp;make an informed choice;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;balance the interests of consumers and hire-purchase&nbsp;financiers, without imposing excessive compliance costs;&nbsp;and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 705<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;facilitate market developments.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is in line with the Government's overall consumer protection philosophy, ie, to promote disclosure and transparency, so that consumers are well-informed and empowered to assume primary&nbsp;responsibility for protecting their own interest.&nbsp; Together with improved efficiency, more flexibility and transparency, the Bill will help to promote a more competitive refinancing market.</p><p><br><I>Scope of application</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 of the Bill increases the cap on the value of consumer goods covered under the Act from $5,000 to $20,000.&nbsp; This brings the Hire-Purchase Act in line with the cap on the value of claims under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act which came into force in March this year.&nbsp; The existing cap of $55,000 on motor vehicles will not be changed, as it is adequate to cover mid-sized family sedan cars that the majority of consumers buy.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Formula for calculation of statutory rebate upon early settlement</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hire-Purchase Act currently mandates the use of the "Rule of 78" formula when calculating the balance payable upon early settlement of the hire-purchase agreement.&nbsp; This restricts the flexibility of the market to provide for other approaches to calculate the loan balance when the loan is redeemed before maturity.&nbsp; Clauses 3 and 9 of the Bill propose that the use of this formula no longer be mandated.&nbsp; Instead, the market will be free to adopt any formula, so long as it is made known to the consumer upfront, ie, at the time of entering into the hire-purchase agreement.</p><p><br><I>Hirer's right to require assignment of hire-purchase agreement<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help promote a more competitive refinancing market, clause 8<p align=left>Column: 706<p> allows a consumer to require the financier to assign the hire-purchase agreement to a new financier, after discharging his obligations as provided for in early settlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Early settlement, repossession procedures and information provision<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve efficiency, clauses 5, 6, 9 to 13 and 19 provide that the notice periods relating to early settlement, repossession procedures and information provision will be shortened from 14 days to seven business days.&nbsp; This takes into account advances in communications.</p><p><br><I>Limitations on terms charges and interest on overdue instalment payments and minimum deposits<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow for more flexibility in the market, clauses 15, 17 and 23 remove the limitations on the terms charges and interest on overdue instalments payable while clause 16 removes the requirement for a minimum deposit of 10% of the cash price of the goods comprised in hire-purchase agreements.&nbsp; When the Hire-Purchase Act was first introduced, the limitations on terms charges and interest rates were introduced for consumer protection. &nbsp;As the retail and credit financing market has developed since then, we should leave to competitive market forces to set the rates.&nbsp; Similarly, the minimum deposit requirement was intended to curb inflation by restricting credit facilities back then.&nbsp; Circumstances have now changed.&nbsp; We should leave financiers to decide on the need for such a deposit, based on their own risk assessment and propensity to bear risk.</p><p><br><I>Transparency and disclosure requirements<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, to ensure that consumers have the material information they need to make informed choices,<p align=left>Column: 707<p> financiers will be required to disclose upfront any charges and rates to be levied.&nbsp; Clause 23 also provides an amended Second Schedule of the Hire-Purchase Act which lists the minimum information that financiers should provide to consumers, including the effective interest rate and the method for calculating the balance payable upon early settlement or reassignment.&nbsp; Such information will form part of the hire-purchase agreement.</p><p><br><I>Sanctions and remedies</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lower legal costs for both parties, clause 3 provides for Hire-Purchase Act matters to be dealt with in a Magistrate's Court or a District Court instead of having their cases heard in a District Court only.&nbsp; Aggrieved parties can now decide which court they wish to resort to, depending on the circumstances of their case.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criminal penalties for the more serious breaches of the Act, especially those relating to fraudulent behaviour, will be retained.&nbsp; The penalties for these criminal offences will be increased to ensure deterrence under clauses 18 to 21.&nbsp; However, offences which are less serious breaches will be decriminalised under clauses 4, 6 and 14.&nbsp; For the requirements pertaining to clauses 4 and 6, it is already the case today that non-compliance with such requirements under the Act renders the hire-purchase agreement unenforceable until the financier fulfils the specific obligations required. &nbsp;For clause 14, the amendment provides that failure to comply with the requirement will be a breach of contract.&nbsp; These should suffice to ensure compliance with the requirements under the Hire-Purchase Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill updates the provisions in the Hire-Purchase Act relating to the rights and obligations of<p align=left>Column: 708<p> parties to hire-purchase agreements in the light of&nbsp;significant changes in the retail and credit financing market over the years.&nbsp; It seeks to balance the interests of the consumers and financiers, without undue regulatory compliance costs.&nbsp; The proposed amendments to the Hire-Purchase Act are aimed at improving market efficiency with the removal of a good number of statutory requirements on businesses,&nbsp; enhancing transparency and greater disclosure so as to enable consumers to make informed decisions, lowering legal costs for all and, thus, facilitating a more competitive market environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I understand that the Consumers Association of Singapore, which has been advocating for such changes to be made to the Hire-Purchase Act for the past two years, is appreciative of the efforts put in by the MTI and the various parties involved in the review.&nbsp; CASE was a member of the MTI task force to review the Hire Purchase Act.&nbsp; By including CASE and other industry representatives in the task force, MTI has demonstrated its consultative approach to industry regulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad, in particular, to note that Rule 78, a mandatory formula for calculating interest payments on car loans has been amended, so that financial institutions are now not required under the law to apply this rule on all hire-purchase loans governed by the Act.&nbsp; It is a positive move in improving the hire-<p align=left>Column: 709<p>purchase provisions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this change has not gone far enough to ensure that consumers need not be disadvantaged by this rule.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the financial industry is now left with the discretion to apply Rule 78 on an optional basis under the amended law, I would like to urge the industry players to discontinue the use of Rule 78.&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry of Trade and Industry will closely monitor the development and, if need be, consider banning the use of Rule 78 totally in future.&nbsp; The banning of this rule is not new, and it has been done in some developed countries.&nbsp; In addition, I suggest that the US practice for car loans be studied for implementation here.&nbsp; In the US, car loans are transparent, because details of the hire-purchase agreements are readily available on financial institutions' websites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the last few years, credit sales have been on the increase.&nbsp; It is another area of concern for consumers.&nbsp; This is an area that is not regulated, and CASE has seen increasing complaints against retailers who took advantage of this regulatory gap to impose unfair terms on the consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is just about right for MTI to look into the possibility and feasibility of&nbsp;extending the Hire-Purchase</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

With consumer credit being marketed to the masses, many high quality consumer goods are now within the reach of the man-in-the-street via hire purchase.&nbsp; Hence, the decision to increase the monetary limit for the HP Act to $20,000 brings it in line with the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another positive move is the decriminalisation of certain offences, for example, the failure on the part of the financing company to give certain notices required by the Act.&nbsp; Instead, the safeguard is that the hire-purchase agreement may not be enforceable until the financing company remedies the default. This is also in line with our more liberal statutory environment where contractual disputes are resolved in the civil courts without the need to criminalise commercial behaviour unnecessarily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a glaring regret of the amendment Bill is that it missed the chance to discontinue the application of Rule 78 which is commonly used in the motorcar hire-purchase agreements to calculate payments for early redemption of the car loan. Currently, the HP Act requires the financing company to apply Rule 78 to calculate the redemption sum.&nbsp; This was the practice inherited from an era prior to the computer age.&nbsp; The Rule of 78 disproportionately frontloads most interest payment to the early part of the loan period, thus leaving much of the principal sum unpaid.&nbsp; It is an approximate method of calculation which overstates its case by attributing more interest upfront than necessary.&nbsp; In effect, this practice discourages early redemption of loans and refinancing where cheaper credits become available.&nbsp; It is no wonder that in the car industry, refinancing is almost non-existent.&nbsp; This also runs contrary to the <p align=left>Column: 712<p>Government's effort at preaching financial prudence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, now that we have already moved into the computer age, banks and finance companies can readily calculate the advance loading of interest by the more equitable monthly rest method.&nbsp; It is time for the hire-purchase companies to move and adopt the monthly rest method of calculation. This method, the monthly rest method, is a more accurate and fair reflection of the cost of funds.&nbsp; In fact, in the US and UK, Rule 78 has been banned for sometime.&nbsp; I am glad that the amendment Bill has deregulated Rule 78 as a mandatory method of calculation.&nbsp; However, I hope that the Bill can go further to disallow the very inequitable Rule 78 altogether rather than leaving it as an option which finance companies may adopt.&nbsp; In fact, the chances of finance companies adopting that&nbsp;are very low.&nbsp; It will be naive to expect the finance companies to switch from Rule 78 to the monthly rest on a voluntary basis. This is evident from the fact that the vast majority of HP agreements for car loans exceeding the monetary limit of the present HP Act continue to use Rule 78 to calculate their redemption sum.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>There is no mandatory rule to explain why Rule 78 continues to be used in such cases except that there is an unlevel playing field where the terms and conditions of the HP agreements are dictated by the financing companies.&nbsp; I think we should not pass over the chance to address this inequity that affects hundreds of thousands of vehicle owners who are also our consuming public.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Second Schedule details the information for prospective hirers.&nbsp; This is an excellent move.&nbsp; May I suggest that to boost disclosure and transparency, a compulsory amortisation table be added to this Schedule.&nbsp; The table should have a clear schedule of loans with separate columns to accurately reflect the interest and principal sum payment, repayment, at<p align=left>Column: 713<p> monthly, quarterly or yearly intervals, so that the hirer understands his loan commitments and can compare his cost of the loans more meaningfully.&nbsp; Some banks have been doing this in their mortgage loans.&nbsp; I think it would be a good practice to extend it to all loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 5 and 6 of the proposed Bill seek to amend the notice period within which a hirer has to comply to a written request from a financier.&nbsp; It proposes to amend the notice period from 14 days to 7 business days.&nbsp; In this day and age, where people travel frequently, and there are more demands on an individual's attention, 7 days may be considered a little short for adequate action.&nbsp; While I am for repayment, rapid repayment and settlement, I would also like to know what prompted the Ministry to review this time-line.&nbsp; Has there been an increase in loan defaults?&nbsp; Moreover, there is a high cost to repossession and, in the case of a genuine lapse on the part of a hirer, for example, when the hirer was overseas, he would still have to bear the cost of repossession, which is included on the items on the Fifth Schedule, and some of the costs would&nbsp;include cost of storage,&nbsp;delivery,&nbsp;redelivery and so on and so forth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a vehicle is bought, the car dealer and buyer sign a sales and purchase agreement, as well as a hire-purchase agreement.&nbsp; Most buyers, at that point in time, would perceive themselves to be the new owner of the car under the S&amp;P (Sales and&nbsp;Purchase) agreement, while the bank is their financier under the HP agreement.&nbsp; Yet, notwithstanding registration of ownership with the Land Transport Authority, the buyer is not the owner of the vehicle, instead the finance company is the owner and the buyer merely the hirer.&nbsp; The situation becomes more complicated, as I was told that the HP itself may be invalid if the finance company never became the owner of the car prior to the S&amp;P<p align=left>Column: 714<p> agreement, or if the HP agreement might be viewed as a sham device to avoid the registration requirements of the Bill of Sales Act.&nbsp; I understand from the industry that there would usually be a Master Sales Agreement between the finance company and the car dealer by which ownership of the car is passed on to the finance company.&nbsp; But I am not so sure.&nbsp; The Master Sales Agreement would usually apply to the car only when the finance company approves the HP loan.&nbsp; By then, the car should already have been sold to the buyer under the S&amp;P agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question is, the car dealer could not have sold the car to the finance company after the same was sold to the buyer.&nbsp; Conversely, if the HP agreement was valid, it would then imply that the S&amp;P agreement was invalid because the car dealer could not have lawfully sold the car twice, first to the finance company and then a second time to the buyer.&nbsp; The validity of the S&amp;P agreement is not mere legal niceties.&nbsp; The Consumers Association of Singapore has seen complainants whose car dealers were wont to enforce the S&amp;P agreement against the consumers when the finance company declined to approve the HP loan.&nbsp; The legal ambiguities surrounding the S&amp;P and HP&nbsp;agreements in the car dealer industry leave much to be desired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but not least, in this year's Budget Debate, I spoke about the need to rationalise our consumer credit laws.&nbsp; The Hire-Purchase Act is but one facet of consumer credit.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the same legislative regime applies to HP,&nbsp;as well as other types of consumer credit transactions.&nbsp; Their laws provide for linked transactions and joint-liability of merchants and financier.&nbsp; Under their consumer credit law, the legal ambiguity that I have just spoken about would not have arisen and the consumer would not be unduly penalised by the S&amp;P agreement if the <p align=left>Column: 715<p>finance company declines to approve the&nbsp;HP loan.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to review the legal ambiguities current in Singapore with the view towards finding a workable solution for consumers and the&nbsp;HP industry, especially the car industry.&nbsp; There are many existing&nbsp;models in UK, US, Australia and New Zealand, that we could adapt and adopt from.&nbsp; I hope the Minister would incorporate the suggestions and concerns into the proposed amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support&nbsp;the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> First, let me thank the two Members for their support of the Bill.&nbsp; I would like to address the concerns raised, first on the Rule of 78.&nbsp; As we have indicated in the Amendment Bill, the Rule of 78 now is no longer mandatory and our approach is to leave it to the industry to decide how they want to set the terms for early redemption.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Members would agree that there is no free lunch.&nbsp; When a person takes up a hire-purchase agreement, he is contracting to pay, through a series of instalments, what he has contracted.&nbsp; If he&nbsp;opts for early redemption, then by all counts, there usually would be a penalty clause for early redemption.&nbsp; That penalty clause could&nbsp;either be through calculation of the interest or&nbsp;a very direct penalty clause.&nbsp; So, we leave it to the market to set.&nbsp; It is not true that this is an unlevel playing field.&nbsp; The hire purchase market is a very competitive arena, particularly for car loans, and so I could not believe that the cards are stacked against the consumers.&nbsp; There are many&nbsp;hire purchase credit companies out there and the consumers could choose any one of those companies in the market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do we not ban the use of the Rule of&nbsp;78?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think our approach is just to<p align=left>Column: 716<p> make it no longer mandatory and leave it to the market to decide whether it is monthly rest, daily rest, actuarial method, or if they want to continue the use of the Rule of&nbsp;78, we leave it entirely to the market.&nbsp; And, if the consumer does not&nbsp;like that&nbsp;rule set by one company, he can go to another company.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point&nbsp;raised is whether there ought to be an omnibus consumer credit law.&nbsp; Firstly, I am not convinced that we need an omnibus consumer credit law.&nbsp; Today we have approached this with separate laws for different consumer credit requirements.&nbsp; So, we have the Hire-Purchase Act and other&nbsp;Acts to deal with other critical areas of consumer credit.&nbsp; The example which Mr Yeo Guat Kwang raised about investment-linked products being portrayed differently, I think that comes under the MAS and comes under the financial legislation.&nbsp; So I do not think there is a shortage of rules to deal with all these different products.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see the need for an omnibus consumer credit.&nbsp; If there are specific areas or gaps, then I think we should raise this and see where we could deal with it under the various Acts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low also raised about having greater&nbsp;transparency by introducing a compulsory amortisation table in the Schedule.&nbsp; Again, I would leave this to the market.&nbsp; If it is best practice, if people feel that the template involves&nbsp;setting an amortisation table, so be it, we leave it to the market to decide.&nbsp; This could be their competitive selling point.&nbsp; I do not think it is necessary for us to make it compulsory that we should attach an amortisation table as part of the Schedule.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of why we change the notice period from&nbsp;14 days to 7 days, I do not think repossession&nbsp;would come as a lightning bolt.&nbsp; The person must have not paid up all his instalments, and I am sure the financier would have given him <p align=left>Column: 717<p>notice.&nbsp; The question is whether the legal notice period ought to be 14 days or 7 days.&nbsp; Our thinking is to make it a decent period.&nbsp; In this day and age,&nbsp;7 days is enough&nbsp;for people to convey the notice to the person.&nbsp; I do not think you could say that this would come out of the blue.&nbsp; There would be enough notice through the default of payments and through the various communications with the finance company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low also talked about the ambiguities about who is the owner and who is the financier.&nbsp; It is quite clear.&nbsp; If you are entering into a hire-purchase agreement, you are not the owner.&nbsp; The financier is the owner.&nbsp; So I do not think there is any ambiguity at all.&nbsp; If there are ambiguities, I am also surprised that this was not raised during the consultation period and not addressed.&nbsp; But&nbsp;we would take a look at this.&nbsp; I could not imagine that we are in this business of hire-purchase for cars,&nbsp;there are thousands and thousands of transactions, and such a glaring ambiguity remains in the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that would be a really big surprise to me.&nbsp; But I would get my staff to study this.&nbsp; The way I understood the problem, it&nbsp;is very clear.&nbsp; If you are buying a car on&nbsp;hire-purchase, you are not the owner, you are the consumer.&nbsp; The person who is providing the money is the owner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The current NUS Act and the NTU Act do not have explicit provisions for the two universities to borrow. It is essential that they have the powers to do so. It will enable them to make more efficient use of capital and to internalise their cost of capital for development projects. This is also as envisaged in the Ministry of Finance's framework for debt-financing for all statutory boards, which was<p align=left>Column: 720<p> implemented with effect from 1st September 2004.&nbsp; Under this framework, statutory boards are expected to take loans to partially finance their capital projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the universities have to reap good returns from their monies through prudent investment. The income from their investments will, over time, be an additional source of revenue for the universities.&nbsp; However, currently, the NUS Act is silent on the investment power of NUS.&nbsp; While NTU has a clause in its Act that enables the university to invest its monies, the clause, as it stands, differs from the standard clause required by MOF.&nbsp; The amended investment clause brings NTU in line with the standardised&nbsp; investment clauses for all statutory boards.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is therefore a need to amend the two universities' Acts to allow the universities to borrow from the Government and external financial institutions and to invest their monies in such manner as they think fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More broadly, the amendments will support moves to provide NUS and NTU with the institutional flexibility that they will need to respond to new opportunities and challenges. To make their next leap in quality, NUS and NTU must be dynamic and forward-looking institutions.&nbsp; They must have the room to differentiate themselves, to play on their respective strengths, to move into new areas of study, and make calculated trade-offs as they allocate their resources, so as to ensure the maximum benefit for their students.&nbsp;<br></p><p><I>Rationale for setting up the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendment of the NUS Act will also empower NUS to set up the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science.&nbsp; The High School will open its doors in <p align=left>Column: 721<p>January 2005 and will offer a six-year education from Secondary One to JC 2.&nbsp; The proposal to set up this school was endorsed by Parliament in November 2002, as part of the recommendations of the Junior College/Upper Secondary Review Committee.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting up the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science is part of the broader re-orientation taking place in the education system to provide a greater diversity of pathways, programmes and mix of schools.&nbsp; We have introduced integrated programmes, Specialised Independent Schools, such as the NUS High School, and have opened up to a small, privately-funded school sector.&nbsp; This greater diversity of options and opportunities in the education system will better cater to the different needs and talents of our children, develop more unique strengths, and help us meet the challenges of a more complex and rapidly changing environment.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specialised Independent Schools, like the NUS High School, will help us to nurture peaks of excellence in diverse areas of study and endeavour.&nbsp; They will offer a different model of education, complementing the strengths of our mainstream&nbsp;school system.&nbsp; The NUS High School of Mathematics and Science will be tailored to the special abilities of students who are highly talented in mathematics and science.&nbsp; Such schools are not new.&nbsp; In the US, specialised schools in mathematics and science, like the Bronx High School, offer an enriched environment and programmes to maximise the potential of their students. These schools have proven to be very successful in nurturing mathematics and science talent.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a tertiary institution with expertise and resources in the teaching and learning of mathematics and science, NUS is well placed to set up a high school to groom outstanding talents in these areas. It will <p align=left>Column: 722<p>be able to leverage on its reputation and capabilities as a leading research and academic institution to offer a top quality education in the schools sector.&nbsp; Strong specialised schools, like the NUS High School, the Sports School and the planned school of the Arts, will add strength and diversity to the national schools system.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key provisions of the Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I now move on to the specific amendments to the Act.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 2 and 3 insert new sections after section 6 of the Nanyang Technological University Act and National University of Singapore Act, which set out the universities' power to borrow from the Government or external financial institutions, and to confer them with powers of investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 also amends section 5(1) of the National University of Singapore Act to enable NUS to establish institutions to provide education above primary level.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 is a savings provision relating to investments made and loans raised by the respective universities before the date of the amendments in the Bill.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, these amendments will give our universities greater flexibility in the sourcing and use of funds, so that they can be innovative and dynamic institutions.&nbsp; They will be better positioned to meet future challenges in a more competitive landscape, and&nbsp;to establish themselves as leading centres in a knowledge-based world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, this proposed amendment changes our understanding of the fundamental mission and objects of universities as citadels of higher learning, rather than as institutions providing basic education which spans the primary to secondary levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment has been made to facilitate the setting up of the NUS High School hailed as the first of its kind in Singapore.&nbsp; According to Minister of State for Education, Mr Chan Soo Sen, the NUS High School is tasked with the special responsibility of providing a stimulating environment for students with exceptional aptitude and interest in mathematics and science.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the High School is fashioned somewhat like the famous Bronx High School of Science, which is a public high school located in New York City.&nbsp; This school was founded in 1938 and counts five Nobel laureates among its graduates, the most for any secondary school in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I applaud and strongly support the Education Ministry's recent moves to offer a wider range of options to our students and allow them to develop their talents and passion in specialised schools, such as in the Sports School or the Arts School.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am tempted to ask if indeed the reasons for NUS to establish a specialised high school in mathematics and science which necessitates an <p align=left>Column: 724<p>amendment to its Act, the building of a brand new school costing some $28 million and staff deployment are sufficiently compelling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly, giving those who are talented and passionate in mathematics and science an opportunity to develop their talents to the fullest and as early as possible is highly desirable.&nbsp; The ability of the new NUS High School to leverage on the comprehensive range of expertise available at&nbsp;the university&nbsp;to nurture and educate these students is also a positive factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, I would like to raise three concerns which I hope the Minister can clarify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, deviation from core business.&nbsp; The NUS had said previously that one of its primary motivations for mooting this idea is that it is tired of less than inquisitive students passing through its doors and thought that it might be able to do better than mainstream secondary schools at producing students who are better prepared for higher education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of pouring an inordinate amount of resources, building a new school and having to deploy staff to the school, as an experiment to find out if it can do better at producing independent, thinking and inquisitive students, would it not be better for the NUS to share its ideas with mainstream schools, say, starting with the schools offering through-train programmes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Bronx Science, from which the initiative for this school might have germinated, is also not directly part of a tertiary institution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUS could, if it desires, tie up with selected mainstream schools and allow the school to tap on its staff expertise and facilities to nurture students talented in mathematics and science.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 725<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to explain how NUS plans to staff its High School.&nbsp; How many of its academic staff would it be deploying to the school, either on a part-time or full-time basis?&nbsp; How would this impact the university's staff strength and resources and teaching programmes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the university, which is still striving to establish itself as a top research university, not be stretching its resources too thinly and diluting its attention and effort by venturing into what conventional wisdom would certainly view as a non-core business, ie, running a high school?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the university is already in the midst of implementing numerous changes.&nbsp; Sir, resulting from the last review of the universities' admissions system and curriculum, it would seem that the universities, including the NUS, are still in the midst of implementing the recommendations made, including how students are assessed for admissions, what courses to offer and the curriculum of different courses to make them more broad-based.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the universities are likely to be also involved in the current review of university fees and subsidies.&nbsp; Given all these on-going changes, would not the setting up of a high school by the NUS at this point in time be a diversion of its attention away from the more pressing and important tasks required of its primary calling?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the relevance of the teaching capabilities and experience of NUS lecturers.&nbsp; Moreover, unlike mainstream primary and secondary school and junior college teachers, NUS lecturers would generally not have undergone formal training to become teachers.&nbsp; Would the Minister not agree that university lecturers may not be properly equipped to teach <p align=left>Column: 726<p>secondary school and junior college students?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the university, there is very little teaching, as students who attend universities have gone through basic education, are older and assumed to be more matured and independent to do their own research. However, the level of maturity and independence of the high school students and thus their need for guidance and teaching would be vastly different, even if they are highly gifted in some areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not dispute that having more specialised schools to cater to the different talents and needs of our students would greatly enrich the education landscape.&nbsp; Moreover, it is also undeniable that the NUS High School could benefit from tapping on the university's resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, I am concerned with the appropriateness and effectiveness of allowing NUS to establish the High School for Mathematics and Science as, among others, this is clearly a departure from its core business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would&nbsp;urge the Ministry and the NUS to study the concerns raised and take steps to mitigate these issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these caveats, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Sir, I thank Dr Amy Khor for her support for the Bill and useful comments and questions.&nbsp; I can understand her concerns over whether running a high school is a deviation&nbsp;from the core business of NUS, and whether it will detract from it providing a university education that is the best that it can be.&nbsp; First, let me say that the idea of&nbsp; a High School having strong affiliations with a university is not a unique one.&nbsp; It has been working well in a number of countries.&nbsp; In the US, the<p align=left>Column: 727<p> University of Chicago Laboratory Schools are good examples.&nbsp; In fact, they cater to students all the way from nursery up to High School, but the focus is principally on the High School level.&nbsp; Many of the High School students take classes at the University of Chicago, and get supervised or mentored in their research by world renowned professors.&nbsp; Another good example is the Hunter School, which is affiliated to City University of New York.&nbsp; Again, you have students who are, through the affiliation, able to receive an education that challenges them.&nbsp; These are intellectually gifted students typically.&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are allowed to take courses at either Hunter College, which is part of the City University of New York, or Columbia University.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In China, there are several top schools with strong links to the universities.&nbsp; I myself have had the benefit of visiting and talking to people at several&nbsp;such schools,&nbsp;affiliated to top universities in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.&nbsp; They are all highly regarded and their students&nbsp;clearly benefiting from the links that they provide with the universities.&nbsp; For example, in Fudan University Affiliated Middle School, students take university level Mathematics courses.&nbsp; And the school also invites university professors to teach a class once a week and whenever there are interesting new topics that should be covered in the curriculum.&nbsp;&nbsp;The education experience and environment challenges the students in these schools, many of whom end up qualifying for top universities, not just in China but in the US and elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another good example is the Peking University Affiliated High School.&nbsp; The&nbsp;students are free to attend classes at Beida and to do research at the university.&nbsp; And, likewise, the students achieve&nbsp;high standards of excellence and are actively<p align=left>Column: 728<p> sought after by universities around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most of these schools, I should add that the work done by the students in the High School as well as when they take undergraduate modules by sitting in classes at the university is given credit when they finally go on to university.&nbsp; They are allowed to accumulate credits while at High School.&nbsp; And this again adds to the premium attached to these High Schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far the university goes in its involvement with the High School varies. In the case of the teaching universities - or the Normal Universities as they are called in China -&nbsp;it is typically a closer involvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;For some other universities, the universities are involved in the governance of the school, typically have the principal seconded from the university to the school, but they do not provide a large number of staffing for the school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may give you another example, at the Number Two Secondary School attached to East China Normal University - the top teaching university in Shanghai -&nbsp;there is a close relationship between the school and the university which allows the university to play a prominent role both in the management as well as&nbsp;teaching in the school.&nbsp; The university appoints both the principal and the vice-principal, and some of the university staff members are deployed to the school to teach and to help to develop the curriculum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the NUS High School, NUS will be actively supporting and taking a close interest in the school but will not be deploying any large amount of faculty resources to the school.&nbsp; It will not deviate from its core business of providing a university education. The university is very clear about that, and MOE is very clear about that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 729<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me elaborate a little.&nbsp;First, in the area of governance and personnel to run the school.&nbsp; The school board will be chaired by Mr Wee Heng Tin, former Director-General of Education. This will be once the School Board is appointed, which is after the NUS High School gets its legal status.&nbsp; The principal of the School, Professor Lai Yee Hing, is on secondment from NUS Science Faculty.&nbsp; The Assistant Principal, Dr Roland Su, has been assigned to the NUS High School but he will be joining the school as direct staff once the school gets its legal status.&nbsp; He is actually making a switch to become part of the direct staff of the school.&nbsp; Teaching staff, about 25, are recruited principally from the Government teaching service and from the private sector.&nbsp; Initially, it would be more from the Government.&nbsp; Over time, I think they will also recruit a fair number from the private sector.&nbsp; They will, in the first instance, have one teaching assistant from NUS.&nbsp; Over time, there could be a few more.&nbsp; And I would add, in response to Dr Amy Khor's specific question, that it is not necessary for all the teachers to be trained for teaching in the same way that our school teachers in our mainstream are trained.&nbsp; Not all of them will need to be&nbsp;NIE-trained.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at top schools abroad, particularly those that are engaged in something like developing special talents in Mathematics and Science, not all their teachers are trained at teaching colleges.&nbsp; Some of them are just people with a passion for the subject and who have a way of reaching out to bright young talent.&nbsp; It is for the school to interview them and decide if they have got the attributes that meet its needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I have covered governance and personnel.&nbsp;Second is the issue of curriculum and examination.&nbsp; I think there again NUS can provide valuable support for the school without over-extending itself.&nbsp; It is an area where NUS can&nbsp;add value, formulating a new curriculum and one that leads on to a new qualification -<p align=left>Column: 730<p> the NUS High School Diploma.&nbsp; The school will be having quite a different structure of curriculum compared to a normal school.&nbsp; It will have a modular system of core and elective subjects.&nbsp; And the curriculum will be accredited by the NUS Board of Undergraduate Studies.&nbsp; The NUS High School will also allow for new modes of assessment, new types of examination as well as other forms of assessment, besides examination, and these will be scrutinised by its Academic Assessment Committee.&nbsp; This committee will ensure that the academic standards of the NUS High School are calibrated to the admission requirements of NUS itself as well as to that&nbsp;of other top universities in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, another form of engagement between the university and High School, is that some of the students in the High School will be able to take undergraduate modules at NUS.&nbsp; Students will be mentored in their research work by NUS faculty members who will point them in the&nbsp;direction of new developments, excite their interest and seek to develop them to the fullest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as infrastructure goes, it is a stand-alone school, but it will be able to tap on some of the NUS' resources, particularly its library e-resources and its IT resources.&nbsp; I should add that MOE will support the High School, just like it supports other independent schools.&nbsp; We have paid for the same proportion of the development cost of setting up&nbsp;the new school as we would do for any other independent school.&nbsp; And we will continue to provide annual capitation grants to the school on the same basis as the other independent schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NUS High School is an innovation in our school system.&nbsp; It breaks new ground.&nbsp; The involvement of a university for the first time in the High School on a more than&nbsp;cursory basis will be a new model.&nbsp; It will allow for new curriculum, for articulation of&nbsp; a&nbsp;High School<p align=left>Column: 731<p> curriculum with a university curriculum, for flexible use of&nbsp;university&nbsp;faculty resources without detracting from their core mission of teaching university students well.&nbsp; It will ultimately be a model that is a win-win for&nbsp;the school system and for NUS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not preclude and, in fact, does not displace the continuing efforts by research institutions in Singapore under A*STAR,&nbsp;our other universities and NUS itself from continuing to engage with our secondary schools and JCs - giving talks,&nbsp;mentoring students, and so on and so forth.&nbsp; But this new school goes beyond that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NUS High School is part of a broader reorientation that is taking place in our school system to provide more diverse pathways to better meet the needs of students with exceptional talents and different talents.&nbsp; So we set up the Sports School because we have some students who are outstanding in sports and they need a different curriculum, different ways of organising the school, different time-tabling arrangements, even different ways of arranging their classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have students who are very strong in Mathematics and Science who should not be constrained and should be given not just a bit more than the usual model of education.&nbsp; They should be given a different model of education, not the regular school curriculum - new framework, new orientation, teachers with a special passion for the subject.&nbsp; And the link between the university and the High School is, I think, a very promising one for both NUS and the NUS High School.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have confidence that with NUS providing its support in the area of Mathematics and Science teaching and learning to NUS High School, our students who are <p align=left>Column: 732<p>talented in Mathematics and Science would soon have a school offering a highly stimulating and unique learning environment - one that is able to leverage on NUS' expertise and reputation and that is able to capitalise on the students' talents and passion.&nbsp; Singapore will gain&nbsp;from developing their talents to the fullest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.<br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, the Prime Minister announced during our recent National Day Rally a set of measures for a more supportive environment to have children and raise families in Singapore.&nbsp; The measures<p align=left>Column: 733<p> included extending maternity leave from eight to 12 weeks, and two days of childcare leave for each parent. The amendments in this Bill will effect those measures.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also amends the Employment Act in two other areas.&nbsp; First, to allow companies to implement flexible work schemes to optimise their manpower resources and, second, to raise the minimum age of employment for children and young persons.&nbsp; I shall take the House through each of the amendments in turn.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt"><I>Extending Maternity Leave</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, extending maternity leave.&nbsp; Two sets of regulation presently prescribe rights and benefits of maternity leave. Currently, employees covered by the Employment Act (EA), irrespective of nationality of the child or mother, are entitled to eight weeks of maternity leave for all births.&nbsp; Employers must pay for such leave taken for the first&nbsp;two children. Employees who are managers, executives and confidential staff are not covered under the EA.<br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the third child only, there is a separate scheme under the Children Development Co-Savings Act since 2001 which provides for eight weeks of maternity leave for mothers of Singapore citizens for&nbsp;legitimate births.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve a better environment for families,&nbsp; my Ministry set up a tripartite panel (National Tripartite Advisory Panel to Develop Family Friendly Workplaces) to formulate workable recommendations that were appropriate to Singapore's context. This included the length of maternity leave.&nbsp; We also garnered feedback from 11 focus groups, comprising employer and employee representatives from industries such as banking and finance, electronics manufacturing, hotels and restaurants, civic and community groups.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 734<p>We paid particular attention to women's views. After extensive consultation and deliberation, the tripartite panel recommended four additional weeks, bringing the total to 12 weeks for maternity leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp;panel also recommended that, subject to mutual agreement between employer and employee, there should be flexibility to take</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>the additional&nbsp;four weeks spread over the&nbsp;six months following the birth of the child.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would minimise the impact of continuous 12 weeks' absence of key employees, especially small and medium sized enterprises.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would also allow some employees, if they wanted to, to return to work after&nbsp;eight weeks on half-day or shorter work-week arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have accepted these recommendations. Clause 7 of the Bill therefore extends maternity leave from&nbsp;eight weeks to 12 weeks.&nbsp; A new section 76(1)(c) provides for up to 24 days to be taken flexibly over the&nbsp;six months following the birth of the child, based on a maximum six-day work-week.&nbsp; For companies working less than a six-day work-week, the number of flexible days of leave can be adjusted to be consistent with&nbsp;four work-weeks.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the issue of maternity pay. The Tripartite Panel assessed that our companies' cost competitiveness would be affected if they had to foot the wage bill for the additional leave. So, the Government will fund the additional&nbsp;four weeks for the first and second child and the full 12 weeks' leave for the third and fourth child for mothers of Singapore citizens. The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports will shortly be presenting those amendments under the Children Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA). The CDCA will also be amended to provide for 12 weeks' leave and pay to cover the first to fourth births of all<p align=left>Column: 735<p> qualifying mothers, irrespective of position.&nbsp; Managers, executives and confidential staff will consequently have expanded rights to paid maternity leave.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also taken the opportunity to address the situation faced by mothers with multiple births.&nbsp; Under current laws, these mothers are not eligible to further employer-paid maternity leave after the first birth, since they would already have&nbsp;two or more living children.&nbsp; Clause 7 of the Bill provides that these mothers will, in future, be entitled to employer-paid maternity leave for the second confinement.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Childcare Leave</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tripartite Panel acknowledged in its report the importance of developing family-friendly workplaces in Singapore.&nbsp; In addition to extending maternity leave, the panel also wanted&nbsp;two days of childcare leave for working fathers and mothers who have any child under the age of 7, regardless of the number of children and with no preconditions, such as illness of the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This recommendation is reflected in clause&nbsp;9 of the Bill. This childcare leave is meant for every parent, mother or father, to spend time with their children - to care for them, to tend to their needs or, if they like, just to appreciate each other.&nbsp; In that respect, it is different from annual leave.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although managers, executives and confidential staff are excluded from this Act, our experience is that, by and large, all companies extend the same leave benefits to executi7ves as they do to rank and file employees in order to maintain consistency. As they did for maternity leave, companies are encouraged to extend childcare leave to all employees, including managers and executives, as a matter of good human resource practice.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 736<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;two days are to be taken during the calendar year or by mutual consent any specified one year period. During the transition for the remaining few months of this year, I would like to encourage employers and employees to accommodate each other's needs in deciding on the number of days of childcare leave to be consumed.&nbsp; Some unions have suggested&nbsp;one day of childcare leave for their members for the remainder of&nbsp;this year&nbsp;or a total of&nbsp;three days of childcare leave to be consumed from 1st October 2004 to the end of 2005.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Employment Act sets minimum standards for childcare leave. For employers who have the resources, I urge them to provide more than the two-day minimum or other forms of family care leave.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tripartite partners will continue to promote family-friendly workplaces. This will raise employee satisfaction and productivity, both at home and at work. If employees are enabled to take better care of their young children and other family members, they will also be better workers.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Facilitating Flexible Work Schemes</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the second set of amendments contained in clause 3 of the Bill which facilitates flexible work schemes.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With rapidly changing market demands and volatile cycles, companies must have greater flexibility in scheduling work arrangements. Our existing legislation, which stipulates premium rates for overtime (1.5 times) and rest day (which is 2 times)&nbsp;and that the payment of overtime must be in cash, has hindered the implementation of flexible work schedules. In other words, in practice, during periods of peak demand,&nbsp;companies have to pay more for overtime, <p align=left>Column: 737<p>and this&nbsp;is correct.&nbsp; But when demand is down, they have excess workers on the payroll. This results in retrenchments during lull periods. Then when business picks up, companies must hire again, including many whom they had let go. This is inefficient.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must allow companies that face uneven demand due to the nature of operations, or seasonal and business cycles, flexibility to adjust&nbsp;work schedules. A few companies have implemented such schemes on a pilot basis after consultation with and agreement from their unions and Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you some&nbsp;examples.&nbsp; One company, instead of&nbsp;cash payments,&nbsp;offsets overtime accumulated as paid time-off&nbsp; to the workers. The equivalent premium rates of 1.5 times for overtime work and 2 times for rest day work are maintained. In another company, overtime payment at premium rates is paid in excess of contractual hours not on a daily or weekly basis but bi-monthly or quarterly basis. These are positive examples of the efficient use of manpower.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Economic Review Committee recommended that companies should be given exemption from the relevant provisions to allow flexible work schedules. The Government has accepted the recommendation.&nbsp; This provision is effected in clause 3 which allows the Commissioner for Labour to exempt companies from cash payments and/or at premium rates to employees, for overtime, rest day and public holiday work.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of tripartite guidelines has been formulated in consultation with employers and trade unions on the circumstances under which we will give permission for flexible work schemes. Various conditions will need to be observed to ensure that the interests of workers are protected. Companies that apply for exemption must provide income stability for workers, and <p align=left>Column: 738<p>ensure their safety and health is not compromised.&nbsp; &nbsp;They should also demonstrate that greater profits that result from the more efficient use of manpower will be shared with their workers. The guidelines will be disseminated to employers and the unions and workers. In addition, MOM will appoint a tripartite working group to assist the Commissioner for Labour in assessing applications for exemption by companies.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Raising the Minimum Working Age in accordance with ILO Convention 138</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, raising the minimum working age in accordance with ILO Convention 138.&nbsp; Let me turn to clauses 2, 4 and 5 of the Bill, which relate to the employment of children and young persons in industrial, non-industrial and light work.&nbsp; The present provisions allow for the employment of children aged between 12 and 14 in "light work", and under parental supervision. In practice, child employment is negligible in Singapore as children below 14 are either in schools or approved vocational institutions.&nbsp; Young persons, currently defined as persons between the ages of 14 and 16, may be employed in industrial undertakings, unless there is a specific prohibition in relation to that undertaking prescribed by my Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp; No restrictions are imposed on persons aged 16 and above.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minimum Age Convention of 1973 (No. 138 of&nbsp; ILO) is one of its&nbsp;eight core conventions.&nbsp; In essence, it stipulates that children should not enter the labour force before the completion of compulsory education, but in any event not before reaching the age of 15.&nbsp; However, children aged between 13 and 15 may perform light work, if it is not prejudicial to their educational activities. Beyond 15, they are permitted to take up employment, except for work which is dangerous or hazardous to health.&nbsp; For<p align=left>Column: 739<p> such work, the minimum age is 16 if their "safety, health and morals" are fully protected, and they receive proper training in the relevant branch of activity.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is against all forms of exploitation of children and imposes strict standards in the employment of youths. In 2001, Singapore ratified ILO Convention 182 on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour.&nbsp; We will take this opportunity to raise our minimum working ages to be in line with Convention 138, and in due course to ratify it as a continued commitment to the protection of our children and youths.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

First of all, I am very happy that the amendments will raise the minimum permissible age from 12 to 13 years for employment for light work and raise the permissible age from 14 to 15 years for non-hazardous industrial work.&nbsp; This is a positive move to make our requirements in line with ILO Core Convention 138, and I hope of course this will lead to early ratification of the Convention by our Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As recommended by the Economic Review Committee, the amendment empowers the Commissioner for Labour to lawfully approve applications &nbsp;for flexible work schedules without being bound by the existing overtime and rest day provisions which require the companies to pay the rate of payment for overtime and the rate of payment for work on rest day only in cash.&nbsp; With the amendment, companies can now use the accumulated overtime work to compensate employees in the form of paid<p align=left>Column: 740<p> time-off, also called compensatory time-off, during the lull period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, optimal use of manpower holds the key to success in the new economy.&nbsp; With the changing business environment and the need for an improving quality of life for all the workers, there is motivation in the search and implementation of more flexible working arrangements.&nbsp; The benefits of flexi-work practices have been well-documented in many management and human resource literature.&nbsp; Studies have shown that the introduction of flexi-work in developed countries has resulted in lower absenteeism, increased productivity, higher employee retention and savings in overhead costs, not to mention a higher employee morale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the unions in Singapore support flexible work arrangements.&nbsp; It allows flexibility in managing manpower resources in accordance with market conditions without having to resort to other cost-cutting measures, such as retrenchments, shorter work-week or temporary layoffs.&nbsp; It also provides and promotes a balanced lifestyle by allowing workers to take time off during non-peak periods.&nbsp; At the same time, employers do not have to sacrifice any productive time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for implementation of such a scheme, support from unions and workers is key.&nbsp; And unions and workers must be consulted before implementing such a scheme by the company.&nbsp; The initial stage of implementation is also crucial.&nbsp; The scheme should be implemented as a pilot project to first gauge its effectiveness.&nbsp; So a timeframe of six to 12 months for these pilot projects could be set.&nbsp; There should also be&nbsp;regular reviews and communication between management and&nbsp;workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry must ensure that such a flexible work scheme would not undermine the employees' interests and that there are proper safeguards against<p align=left>Column: 741<p> abuses.&nbsp; Flexibility should not affect the workers' income stability and should not be carried out at the expense of the safety and health of the workers.&nbsp; In terms of workplace safety, some union leaders had proposed that, under the flexible work scheme or flexi-time scheme, the maximum working hours in a day should remain at 12 hours, and employees should still be entitled to the same number of rest days per week,&nbsp;current leave benefits, and so on.&nbsp; Additional incentives should also be considered in the granting of approval of such schemes by the Ministry of Manpower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unions in Singapore are prepared to work with companies on their proposed flexible work projects so as to help workers understand and appreciate better the objectives of such changes and their benefits.&nbsp; It is in the union's interest to help workers keep their jobs and have greater certainty in their income.&nbsp; There need not be conflicting objectives if union and management are able to work together for a smooth workplace transformation and thus enable workers to remain employable.&nbsp; As a labour MP, I have the opportunity to actually work with some of the companies who have their pilot projects implemented.&nbsp; ST Aerospace is one unionised company that has successfully implemented a flexi-time scheme.&nbsp; Feedback from the management, union and employees has been positive as the scheme is&nbsp;seen to be beneficial to both the company as well as employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One important principle which ST Aerospace adopted is to grant paid time-off to employees on days when there is no work scheduled for them.&nbsp; The paid time-off will be deducted from the overtime work accumulated when the employees have to work overtime, based on the rate of 1.5 times for work beyond the contractual daily and weekly working hours, as stipulated in the Employment<p align=left>Column: 742<p> Act.&nbsp; The same principle also applies to the rate of payment for work on their rest day, ie, two times.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this arrangement, ST Aerospace has been able to better utilise its manpower resources and also share the productivity gain with employees, ie, all the employees in ST Aerospace can look forward to additional incentive bonus payments.&nbsp; There are savings also on travelling time and cost for the workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, therefore, flexi-work arrangements can lead to a win-win situation for all stakeholders, as businesses and workers stand to benefit.&nbsp; For this to happen, my stress is again on communication and trust between the company and employees, and regular reviews of performance measurement, work targets and objectives are also critical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies should also recognise that flexi schemes aim to achieve greater flexibility and optimise manpower deployment to strengthen their competitiveness.&nbsp; It is not a reduction in the cost for overtime payment and rest day work.&nbsp; Management should not see this amendment for greater flexibility as a new avenue for cost cutting.&nbsp; For flexible work arrangements to gain wider acceptance, more needs to be done to promote the benefits for both workers and employers.&nbsp; The challenge for the tripartite partners now is to balance the need to provide flexibility for the companies and to safeguard the interest of the workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;the other amendments for extended maternity benefits, I would like to urge all employers to grant extended maternity leave to their employees during the transitional period, ie, after 1st August 2004 and before 1st October 2004.&nbsp; I also hope employers could be more accommodating to employees' requests to take the additional 4-week<p align=left>Column: 743<p> maternity leave flexibly over the six months from the birth of the baby.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, the law will only set the minimum requirement on this issue.&nbsp; What we need to do now is to publicise and promote the best practices and get more workplaces to follow the early adopters.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me preface my remarks by putting on record that I am speaking today as a member of the Steering Group on Population responsible for the recently announced package of parenthood measures.&nbsp; It is not my intention to query the Committee on its recommendations, as is implied in today's <I>Straits Times</I>, where I have been unwittingly misquoted.&nbsp; Doing so would clearly be odd, since this would be tantamount to questioning myself, as I too played a part in coming out with the measures.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Employment (Amendment) Bill puts into statute what the Procreation Committee has recommended and the Government has accepted.&nbsp; The Bill focuses on two aspects of these incentives, ie, extension of paid maternity leave, and introduction of paid childcare leave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, by most accounts, the new baby package has been well received.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans strongly support the measures.&nbsp; This was also the feedback the women MPs have received thus far from our dialogue sessions with various women groups.&nbsp; And, indeed, this should be no surprise, because the package was developed only after extensive consultations from a broad spectrum of Singapore society.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some concerns have been raised which may warrant further review and action.&nbsp; I would like to highlight these under two of <p align=left>Column: 744<p>the&nbsp;key amendments&nbsp;covered in this Bill as well as raise two other issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, extension of maternity leave to 12 weeks and up to the fourth child.&nbsp; Besides extending paid maternity leave to 12 weeks up to the fourth child, the Bill provides some flexibility to not only the female employee but also her employer by allowing the employee the option of taking the last 4-week block of post-natal leave any time within six months of the birth, as long as her employer is agreeable.&nbsp; This arrangement could help mitigate the employer's worries about work disruption and impact on cost and productivity due to the extended maternity leave.&nbsp; At the same time, it could alleviate some of the employee's worries about being unable to keep up with developments at work due to her prolonged absence and/or potential discrimination arising from the longer maternity leave.&nbsp; For, indeed, whilst many women agree that extra maternity leave beyond eight weeks is handy and helpful, there are also others who hesitate to support the extension, as they genuinely fear increased discrimination in the job market against female employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At our dialogue sessions with various women groups, the issue of discrimination, particularly against pregnant women, consistently gets aired.&nbsp; In almost every session, someone would bring up a case of discrimination against pregnant women that she knows of.&nbsp; In one instance, the participant who is a professional said that she herself lost her job after she became pregnant and felt that she was a victim of discrimination.&nbsp;&nbsp;This fear of discrimination&nbsp;prompted another lady participant in her late forties to remark that one positive outcome for older women, who would not benefit from most of the new baby measures, would be the increased attractiveness of hiring them - botox, liposuction or otherwise - since they are unlikely to go on long maternity leave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 745<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on a more serious note, whilst the number of cases of discrimination against pregnant women at the workplace may not be large, these practices should not be condoned.&nbsp; The National Tripartite Advisory Panel's recently-issued set of Guidelines on Family Friendly Workplace Practices advocates non-discriminatory practices against female employees who are pregnant and employees with young children.&nbsp; This is a commendable positive first step.&nbsp; However, I would like to urge the Ministry to do its utmost through various measures, such as acknowledging and rewarding pro-family employers and strongly penalising errant ones, to help prevent discriminatory practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have also heard some comments that, even taken as a whole, 12 weeks or three months of paid maternity leave do not constitute sufficient incentive for couples to have more babies, and that the physical demands of caring for and taking time to bond with a newborn warrant longer maternity leave.&nbsp; That may well be so, but policy making is always about trade-offs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking as a member of the Procreation Committee and having weighed the scales as deliberately and carefully as we possibly can, I must conclude that the needs of employers should not be forgotten.&nbsp; Even progressive, enlightened, pro-family companies need to deal with very practical issues of managing workload during periods when one or more staff may be on maternity leave.&nbsp; The bias against women employees that some employers may have is unfortunate and not something this House should condone, but the commercial demands of the marketplace are imposing and cannot be ignored.&nbsp; We should therefore avoid making it even harder for companies by extending the maternity leave any longer than is helpful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, child-care leave.&nbsp;The second innovation, ie, parental childcare leave, is<p align=left>Column: 746<p> totally new.&nbsp; It is common practice in some countries in the west and, though arguably belated, it is a welcome addition.&nbsp; To some, two days of such leave per year per parent do not seem to be much, and one can argue that nursing a sick child, accompanying one to his or her harrowing first day in school, attending graduation concerts or term-end parent-teacher meetings all add up to more than two days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one must concede that such paid childcare leave imposes a cost on the company's bottom line, and it is once again a question of balance that needs to be achieved.&nbsp; Moreover, one should view this statutory childcare leave as a minimum which sets the tone for more companies to adopt pro-family workplace practices.&nbsp; This does not preclude employers from giving more than the mandatory two-day childcare leave per year, which is already being practised by some MNCs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can also complain why the Bill cuts off the age of the child for which such childcare leave applies to seven years.&nbsp; Why not 12, as some have argued?&nbsp; In fact, a mother at a dialogue session even said that childcare leave should be given to those with teenage children, as such adolescents could&nbsp;need even more attention.&nbsp; There is no magic number.&nbsp; Again, it is a reflection of the balance the Committee has sought to achieve between the demands of the employer and the family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, employees not covered by the Employment Act.&nbsp; Concerns have also been raised regarding women in middle management positions who are not covered by the Employment Act although they would be covered by their maternity benefits under the Children Development Co-Savings Act which is under the ambit of the MCYS.&nbsp; Those who are in this category, especially the lower middle white collar female workers, worry that<p align=left>Column: 747<p> they may not be accorded similar leave and other benefits as the rank and file employees, and that they may be discriminated against with no recourse from legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the National Tripartite Advisory Panel, mindful of such concerns, has, in its guidelines for pro-family workplace practices, advocated the equitable application of employment practices and benefits to all categories of workers, including staff who are not covered under the Employment Act.&nbsp; While anecdotal evidence suggests that most companies adopt such a practice to maintain consistency, there could be some bad apples.&nbsp; As MOM is principally in charge of labour and industrial relations, I would like to urge the Ministry to vigilantly monitor such situations and advise employers against adopting a short-term view in their HR policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, paternity leave.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;Singaporeans have also expressed disappointment that paternity leave has not been included in the package of procreation measures announced.&nbsp; This, in my opinion, is an issue which warrants review in the future.&nbsp; If indeed fathers are bearing equal or significant responsibilities in child-rearing, then a rethink of this policy is warranted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two-day childcare leave per year which the father can now take is a step&nbsp;towards encouraging and allowing fathers to bear equal parenting responsibilities.&nbsp; For now, this seems sufficient, as statistics from even the most liberal western countries indicate that most men do not take paternity leave.&nbsp; In Britain, according to official statistics, only one in five working fathers exercised his entitlement to two weeks of paid paternity leave which was instituted in 2003.&nbsp; Figures from the European Commission in fact show parental leave<p align=left>Column: 748<p> take-up rates of near zero for men, compared to over 90% for women, except for some Scandinavian countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that men do not take paternity leave, as they worry about what their colleagues think about them, as well as the fact that their employers may hold this against them.&nbsp; Hence, paternity leave would only serve its purpose if employers are sufficiently enlightened and ready to provide such leave, whilst fathers must indeed want to take leave to share in the parenting responsibilities and not, as I have overheard some men allude to for now, to play golf!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I should add that the baby package is exactly that, a package.&nbsp; The effects, which we all hope it will produce, stem not from the individual elements - whether it is maternity leave, baby bonus, funds for companies to hire consultants to develop a work-life culture - working in isolation.&nbsp; Rather, all the elements are intended to function in unison to provide the web of incentives and create an environment which is more conducive to bear and rear children.&nbsp; As the slogan goes, we want to make Singapore the best place to live in and, may I add, now, to have children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a nation, we take great pride in being No. 1 or a close No. 2 or 3 in many areas, eg, airport, seaport, garden city, national competitiveness.&nbsp; Sir, procreation is definitely not one of our strengths.&nbsp; Perhaps, our dismal performance in this area is ironically a result of our scintillating performance in so many other areas of national life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I humbly submit, therefore, that the package of measures remains a work-in-progress.&nbsp; Recognising this, the Government has now formed a new National Population Steering Committee under the charge of the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng, to look at all aspects of the population issue and<p align=left>Column: 749<p> coordinate the efforts of all relevant Ministries and agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to continually monitor and tweak the measures even as societal norms and expectations change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with this, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Employment (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill covers three areas:&nbsp; the provision of extended maternity leave and paid childcare leave; the raising of the minimum age for the employment of children and young persons; and the flexibility accorded to companies to optimise their manpower resources.&nbsp; I will touch on all the three aspects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly welcome and support the amendments providing for extended paid maternity leave and two days of paid childcare leave.&nbsp; These amendments are forward-looking and will contribute positively towards developing a more conducive environment for people to start families and have more children.&nbsp; It will help in our efforts to promote a healthy balance between work and family.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NTUC was an active member of the National Tripartite Advisory Panel to develop family-friendly workplaces that came up with these suggestions, and we strongly supported the change.&nbsp; We feel that the extended paid maternity leave will benefit all female workers and is of particular significance to the lower income, as they do not benefit as much from the tax benefits.&nbsp; In a recent survey which the&nbsp;NTUC Women's Committee carried out among 1,200 union members, more than half indicated that cost is one major factor for them not to have more children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am also particularly happy that the maternity benefits of female executives, managers<p align=left>Column: 750<p> and confidential employees will now be given statutory protection.&nbsp; I will touch on this later in the debate on the Children Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill, as this is a matter which is not covered under the Employment Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another serious anomaly which is now being removed is the decision to allow mothers with multiple</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>births in the first confinement to continue to enjoy employer paid maternity leave for the second confinement. The current law, which penalises these mothers by denying them the paid maternity leave when they give birth the second time, is unfair and should be removed.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, both the extended maternity leave and paid childcare leave are progressive benefits.&nbsp; By allowing even fathers to take the paid childcare leave, the law is helping to create an environment where fathers can play&nbsp;a bigger role in their children's lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extended maternity leave would considerably enhance women's welfare. They have a longer period of rest after childbirth and more opportunities for bonding with their newborns. However, for these amendments to be truly effective, employers too must play their part. Women continue to be concerned that employers may discriminate against them because of these benefits.&nbsp; This view is fortified by some of the recent letters to the newspapers by women complaining about the attitude of employers towards pregnancy. There is a set of tripartite guidelines that have been formulated to discourage discrimination.&nbsp; The guidelines are fairly detailed and attempt to provide benchmarks on what constitute enlightened&nbsp;human resource practices in the treatment of pregnant female employees and those with young children. As the guidelines do not have the force of law, however, women remain concerned that they may be discriminated against.&nbsp; So having the guidelines alone is<p align=left>Column: 751<p> insufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to ask the Minister what steps would be taken to educate businesses on their role as socially responsible employers and to prevent discrimination against pregnant women and those with young children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now come to the second important area of the Bill, and&nbsp;that is the amendment to facilitate the flexible work schemes.&nbsp; Our unions agree with the principle that with rapidly changing market demands or volatile cycles, businesses must have greater flexibility to schedule work arrangements. We understand that this is necessary to help businesses create new jobs and retain existing ones.&nbsp; The ERC had suggested amendments to the Employment Act to empower the Commissioner for Labour to exempt companies wishing to introduce flexible work arrangements.&nbsp; However, even the ERC recognised that whilst flexibility is a virtue, there must be safeguards against abuses.&nbsp; In its Report, at page 98, paragraph 2, the ERC stressed and I quote, "... on the need to provide flexibility to companies without undermining the interests of workers and productivity gains from optimal utilisation of manpower resources should be shared with the workers."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, broadly, the current amendment will pave the way for two types of flexibility in scheduling work.&nbsp; One category will be those related to the nature of the business which makes it difficult to space out work evenly during normal working hours.&nbsp; One example is the aerospace maintenance sector where aircrafts do not come in during the normal hours of work and there could be long periods where workers have nothing to do followed by long periods of extensive overtime.&nbsp; This situation is clear and will cause no difficulty, especially if&nbsp;there is no reduction&nbsp;in the rate of overtime <p align=left>Column: 752<p>payments. What we need to be careful though are situations where flexibility or exemptions are granted for companies facing the normal peaks and troughs of business cycles and where a reduced rate of overtime work is allowed.&nbsp; This is a much more nebulous area which must be guided by clear and transparent guidelines, defining the circumstances in which it would be allowed.&nbsp;I must stress that our unions are very responsible and even now, when circumstances justify it, have used their discretion to allow flexibility.&nbsp; They view this as a win-win strategy because, even though workers take home less overtime pay, they do not lose their jobs.&nbsp; The outcome is clear and defined.&nbsp; Along the same line,&nbsp;if this amendment will help workers to retain their jobs or&nbsp;ward off layoffs, we can support it.&nbsp; But, as pointed out by the ERC, safeguards are necessary to prevent abuses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I note that the tripartite guidelines will address some of these concerns.&nbsp; I would, however, like to stress a few critical factors that are important to workers.&nbsp; Income stability is one critical factor. Flexibility should not result in a situation where workers' incomes fluctuate so drastically from month to month that they have difficulty fulfilling their monthly obligations which are fixed.&nbsp; In many sectors, workers depend a great deal on overtime to supplement their monthly income.&nbsp; So the aggregation of the overtime period should not be too long as to impact on their livelihood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health and safety, Sir, is another important factor and should not be compromised under any circumstances.&nbsp; I would also like to urge the Minister to ensure that unions and workers are consulted before such exemptions are granted.&nbsp; And there must be a process in place to periodically review whether the exemptions should continue to apply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 753<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, we have to ensure that lowering the rates will not result in a disincentive for workers to work overtime.&nbsp; If so, workers may find it more attractive to take on a second job rather than to perform overtime which then weakens the impact of this amendment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, an equally important point to gain workers' confidence in a flexible work scheme is to ensure that gains arising from improvements in productivity are shared with workers and they are rewarded during better times.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flexibility, Sir, should also not be granted in such a manner as to be counter-productive to the recent measures to promote family-friendly work practices.&nbsp; We cannot talk about flexibility for people to take care of their family but, at the same time, also insist that flexibility for companies&nbsp;to save costs is paramount and no other consideration should apply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not these amendments will work and spawn more&nbsp;flexible work schemes depend a great deal on the trust and confidence that exist in the workplace. Employers are well-advised to invest heavily in winning the trust and investing long-term in the welfare of their employees as this will facilitate the implementation of any flexible work scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what safeguards will be put in place to ensure that exemptions from overtime, rest days, public holiday work will not be abused by employers.&nbsp; Also, can the Minister give an assessment on the number of companies that are likely to apply for the scheme?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I strongly support the amendment to raise the minimum working age in accordance with ILO Convention 138 on the minimum age for employment. With this amendment, the minimum permissible age for work in non-hazardous industrial undertakings will be raised from 14 to 15 years of age, and the minimum <p align=left>Column: 754<p>permissible age for light work for children is also raised from 12 to 13 years of age.&nbsp; As the Minister had mentioned, child employment is negligible in Singapore and there is no reason for us to continue preserving the existing law.&nbsp; The NTUC has been advocating for our laws to be amended to be in line with the ILO Convention 138 for a long time.&nbsp; I am glad, Sir, that this is finally being done. I am also heartened by the Minister's statement that, in due course, Singapore will ratify Convention 138.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Minister to consider doing so quickly, as with this amendment, there are no more reasons for Singapore not to ratify this Convention.&nbsp; In fact, Convention 138 is one of the most highly ratified core conventions of the ILO, and 135 out of 176 countries have already ratified it.&nbsp; We, Sir, certainly do not want to be the last few countries in the world left that have not ratified Convention 138.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> Sir, the extended maternity and childcare benefits in the Employment (Amendment) Bill form a key plank in the Government's pro-family policy.&nbsp; But for the plank to be effective, I would argue that it needs to be not only in the right place but also reasonably balanced and nailed in with the correct force. And right now, as it stands, my concern is that it may not be all that balanced.&nbsp; I would like to highlight, in particular, three areas and deal with each in turn.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First is the balance to be made between the responsibilities of the father and the mother. Second, the balance between the right to have babies and the right to work, and the right not to be discriminated against.&nbsp; And third is the right of married working mothers and balancing that with the right of unwed mothers who were abandoned by their men and have to cope with raising the children on their own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 755<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on balancing the responsibilities of men and women in raising their children. As has been pointed out by my colleagues before me, a concern is why the Government has not put the case for paternity leave. We know all the arguments as to why it is not legislated this time round. The reason given is that most fathers do not make use of it, going by the experience of some countries, that this is not&nbsp;something, as the Manpower Minister, Dr Ng Eng Hen put it recently,&nbsp;which would have reflected what society wants now.&nbsp; I am sure Dr Ng has consulted many young families and young fathers, but I have also talked to some and they have told me that they would have appreciated paternity leave to help their wives after childbirth.&nbsp; Many younger fathers want to be involved.&nbsp; And if you go to pre-natal classes, you can see very eager young husbands helping their wives and wanting to be involved in the process.&nbsp; If you go to hospitals, I hear that husbands are keen to be in the labour room, to be with their wives to watch their babies emerge for the first time.&nbsp; They do not want to be left out of the joys of parenthood and the Government should not make the decision for them.&nbsp; They should open up the choice to them, not decide for them, whether they would use the extended paternity leave or not even if they were provided for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, it seems very odd to me that just because the Government does not think that fathers will make use of the leave, it should not be provided for.&nbsp; It is almost like saying, if many workers do not use up their entire annual leave entitled to them, for instance,&nbsp;they are very hardworkers, then as a matter of policy, all workers are no longer entitled to their annual leave.&nbsp; The issue is surely not whether fathers will make use of the leave fully.&nbsp; Rather, it is whether we believe that fathers should share the responsibilities of raising a child and, if so,<p align=left>Column: 756<p> we should send this signal as a society by legislating paternity leave.&nbsp; And if necessary, we can encourage fathers to take their paternity leave.&nbsp; This also would help us to even out the playing field for employment which leads me to the second point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As has been pointed out by my colleagues before me, some women worry about discrimination, whether the extended maternity leave and the childcare benefits would cause employers to discriminate against them, affect their chances for promotion, the chances of being hired&nbsp;for the job.&nbsp; And we have heard of cases where women are asked at the hiring stage whether they have plans to have babies, how many children do they have or are there any childcare arrangements, as if they are not to be assessed on their own merits.&nbsp; It does not matter if you have&nbsp;a PhD or Master or whether you are a hardworker.&nbsp; At the end of the day, at the sub-conscious, what matters is how many children you have and whether you will be committed at work or as productive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we have also heard of women being passed over for promotion because they were pregnant or have plans for more babies.&nbsp; Yet, no man is ever asked at job interviews or promotions,&nbsp;"Will you be&nbsp;taking time-off for reservists?"&nbsp; Or whether they would be asked whether this would affect&nbsp;their productivity or performance at work since&nbsp;they have to go for reservist for so many weeks at a time.&nbsp; Men are also not asked, at the point of hiring or in terms of consideration for promotion, whether they would have more children&nbsp;or how would they take care of their babies.&nbsp; So we should change the mindset of the employers towards parenthood to take the larger national view and, at the same time, to protect women from possible discrimination because they are presently sharing a greater share of the load in raising their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>I would ask the Minister what assurances he could give to pregnant women and women with young children that they would not be discriminated against.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some women say they have little option but to resign from work after their maternity leave is over because the employers either have replaced them at work or have closed the door and the possibility of working out some other flexible arrangements, such as part-time work.&nbsp; This is especially the case in SMEs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some countries like the UK, the law provides for the right to return to work after maternity leave, paternity leave, or adoption leave.&nbsp; The Maternity and Parental Leave Regulations 2002 and the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 in the UK, for instance, provide for the right to return to the job in which she was employed after taking the leave for&nbsp;maternity purposes, or if it is not reasonably practicable for the employer to permit her to return to that job, then to another job which is suitable and appropriate on terms and conditions not less favourable than those which would have applied had she not been absent.&nbsp; So the right to return to work is enshrined in law, but we do not have that.&nbsp; I would ask the Minister whether this would be considered and whether the Minister would also encourage employers to look beyond giving mothers a stark choice between coming back to work immediately at the full pace of work, back to the normal workload, or the choice of not coming back to work at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Minister should also encourage employers to go&nbsp;the route of part-time work, which is part of the framework, and I would ask the Minister to see whether they could provide for the right to part-time work, which is provided in Switzerland.&nbsp; In fact, in Switzerland, on top of 16 weeks' maternity leave, it provides for the right to <p align=left>Column: 758<p>part-time work until the child is eight.&nbsp; It has the highest percentage of women in part-time work at 56.5%.&nbsp; And studies show that in Switzerland, the decision to have a family and to have more children depends directly on the job and career of women.&nbsp; The Netherlands are also known for the high level of part-time work, especially for women, and this is considered to be one key reason for the success of Dutch dual income families in having children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am happy to note that a new subsection has been inserted into the Employment Act to give greater flexibility to women in determining when to take the last part of her maternity leave.&nbsp; I would like to clarify with the Minister whether this would mean also that she has the option of not taking the full maternity leave but to come back earlier and to maybe work out some part-time arrangements and for the leave to be extended proportionately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on the balance between married women and unmarried women and who have children.&nbsp; Sir, married and working women employed, or self-employed, are eligible for 12 weeks of Government-paid maternity leave.&nbsp; I understand that unmarried mothers do not qualify for the extra&nbsp;one week of Government-paid maternity leave.&nbsp; Sir, some of these unmarried women have written to me.&nbsp; They are concerned because they see themselves as victims of circumstances.&nbsp; Many of them have been already dealt the emotional blow of being abandoned by men.&nbsp; They now have the responsibility of single-handedly raising a child in the competitive world.&nbsp; They want to also work.&nbsp; They want to earn enough income to give their children a better life.&nbsp; We need not add to their plight by withholding benefits which would help them to be better mothers and to raise their child better.&nbsp; They are in a more difficult situation, one would argue,<p align=left>Column: 759<p> than working mothers who have the support of their husbands to help raise their family.&nbsp; The <I>Straits Times</I> reported recently that there were 501 births registered without the father's name in 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the Government's concern, whether by extending the benefit to this group of unwed mothers, it would unwittingly send a signal of encouraging this trend or undermining the family as an institution.&nbsp; And I share this concern.&nbsp; But, at the end, it is the innocent children who would suffer from their continued exclusion from society by discriminating against unwed mothers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it would seem to me that the better solution would be to educate the men to take greater responsibility for their actions and for the women that they impregnate and for raising a family, and not punish the women who have to bear their children.&nbsp; Rather than abort these children, these women had taken the decision to raise them and give them a better future.&nbsp; We should not place extra burdens on their shoulders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in devising social policies, often we have to engage in difficult trade-offs.&nbsp; The best that could be done, as a general rule, is to maintain a precarious balance that would prevent the occurrence of desperate situations or intolerable choices.&nbsp; That is the first requirement for a decent society, one that we could always strive for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I would hope that we could look at the balance that we have put in place, in terms of the balance&nbsp;between the responsibilities of the father and mother in raising a child, the balance between the right to work and the right to have children, and the balance between unwed mothers and mothers who are married and who have husbands to help them at home.&nbsp; I think with a better<p align=left>Column: 760<p> balance&nbsp;throughout, we could achieve a better society for all.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am concerned about the effect of clause 3 of the Bill.&nbsp; Clause 3 states that, "The Commissioner for Labour can exempt employers from paying employees for extra work done after considering the operational needs of the employer and the interests of the employee."<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under the current Employment Act, employees who earn not more than $1,600 per month are entitled to additional remuneration for doing extra work under&nbsp;the Employment Act, in which clause 3 referred to.&nbsp; Currently, if an employee requests to work on a rest day, he is entitled to his usual rate of pay and if he works overtime, he would be paid at least one and a half times for each overtime hour.&nbsp; If an employer requests the employee to work on a rest day, the employer has to pay double his employee's daily wages, plus overtime pay.&nbsp; In addition, if an employee works more than the maximum of 8 hours per day or 44 hours per week, he is entitled to overtime pay.&nbsp; And, if an employee works on a holiday, he is entitled to an extra day's salary in addition to his pay for the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under clause 3 of this amendment Bill, it says that the Commissioner for Labour can exempt certain employers and employees from the entitlement to be paid for extra work.&nbsp; The implication of the amendment is very wide, since the section referred to in clause 3 of the Bill sets out both the basic pay and the extra pay for additional work.&nbsp; It would seem to be wide enough to allow the Commissioner to permit employers not to pay at all for extra work done by the employees.&nbsp; Is this the intention of the Bill or that it would help employers with uneven demands, as mentioned by the Minister?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 761<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Employment Act supposedly exists to protect workers, but the rationale stated by the Government to allow the Commissioner for Labour to exempt employers to pay workers for extra work done is to help employers.&nbsp; The amendment says that the Commissioner for Labour would need to consider the interest of the workers in deciding whether to exempt the employers from paying the employees for extra work.&nbsp; How would the interest of the employees be protected if they are not paid?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since we are dealing with employees earning not more than $1,600 per month, these are the very employees who have weak bargaining positions and need legislation to protect them, especially during this period of unemployment or employment uncertainties.&nbsp; However, this amendment is doing the opposite.&nbsp; The Minister has said that there would be guidelines.&nbsp; But, Sir, guidelines are guidelines.&nbsp; How does the Ministry of Manpower ensure that employers would adhere to the guidelines and the employers would not abuse the so-called flexible work scheme, whereby they do not need to pay workers for their extra work?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Let me thank the Members for their responses and their queries.&nbsp; I would try my best to answer some of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think whenever you have a situation where Members say they strongly support,&nbsp;it tells us that&nbsp;we have done something right, especially when it is women saying it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this, of course, pertains to maternity leave.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Dr Amy Khor, Mdm Halimah and Ms Irene Ng have raised some issues.&nbsp; Let me take these aspects separately because maternity leave and&nbsp;the other amendments of the Employment Act are quite different.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On discrimination,&nbsp;many questions were asked how do we ensure that these<p align=left>Column: 762<p> very changes that sought to help women do not result in them being discriminated.&nbsp; This was also the question that we considered, which is why, based on the National Tripartite Advisory Panel (NTAP), we decided to extend to 12 weeks.&nbsp; Employers who were represented at NTAP sensed that this is what they could bear.&nbsp; That is the first point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is that Government undertook the responsibility to pay for such leave so that the financial burden would be less on the employers.&nbsp; We would continue to do our part in promoting best practices, as Members have asked for, by issuing&nbsp;guidelines.&nbsp; We started up a fund, some Members may have read about it, called&nbsp; the WOW Fund, Worklife Works Fund.&nbsp; Some Members in this House have been asked to help us.&nbsp; Dr Jennifer Lee has agreed, and we have also gotten some representatives from the community to help us push these initiatives.&nbsp; And that must be done.&nbsp; In other words, we must send positive signals.&nbsp; We must continue, as Mdm Halimah and Dr Amy Khor have said, to highlight employers who are good examples.&nbsp; But let us also be realistic in what I think would make companies sit up and practise.&nbsp; Companies would listen to moral persuasion, but they are more likely to come on board if they really believe there is a business case of good HR practices and that it makes sense to their business.&nbsp; From that point of view, it is quite instructive that many companies had already adopted family-friendly practices, even without the need for legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if you take a scan of companies in Singapore, the ones who have the most, if you like, generous benefits in terms of pro-family practices, are also the ones that are most profitable.&nbsp; The MNCs&nbsp;realise one cardinal rule of profitable companies and,&nbsp;that is, in order for your employees to be productive, they need to<p align=left>Column: 763<p> be able to take care of their other domains - family, children,&nbsp; parents and&nbsp;themselves.&nbsp; Up to a certain level, if you require more from your employees, you must actually find means to help them take care of their own needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, IBM, even before this, they already had&nbsp;five days of &nbsp;family leave.&nbsp; No reasons need to be given.&nbsp; You can take it.&nbsp; And many other such companies have already practised or have in place these practices.&nbsp; Indeed, if you look at case examples of progressive companies, they have shown that they could have a win-win situation and that it need not mean that if you give provision for your employees to take such leave, that your productivity goes down.&nbsp; Indeed productivity goes up.&nbsp; Most employers are enlightened and they understand this.&nbsp; We have many good companies and&nbsp;management that understand this cardinal rule and so I am quite optimistic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second protection really is the tight labour market.&nbsp; If there is economic growth and companies and employers need people to meet their orders, they would hire.&nbsp; So our economic fundamentals must be correct.&nbsp; There is also a self-protection element in terms of employees.&nbsp; I meet many people.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know women who are equally productive at home and at work.&nbsp; And I do not see employers discriminating against them.&nbsp; In fact, they would go out of their way to employ such women because it also makes sense that a woman who can manage a husband and children can also manage businesses well.&nbsp; So I do not think that I get the same sense, as some Members have said, that this increase in&nbsp;four weeks of maternity leave would result in discrimination.&nbsp; I do not get the sense that there is a prevalent practice and I do not think that we should continue to push that as a typical behaviour of employees.&nbsp; I do not get that sense.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 764<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes,&nbsp;obviously we would get isolated incidents of complaints, as we do.&nbsp; In fact, in a labour market that is difficult, the cries&nbsp;that discrimination&nbsp;occur at work are quite rampant.&nbsp; It may or may not be the operating aspect, but this is quite true.&nbsp; So people say they are discriminated because they are older, lack certain skills,&nbsp;whether it is race,&nbsp;education aspect or age.&nbsp; So I would go back to the fundamentals and say, if we have a tight labour market, and if the economy does well,&nbsp;I think discrimination, by and large, usually diminishes.&nbsp; As I have said, our economic growth forecast is 8-9% this year.&nbsp; Jobs would be added and I think the labour market would continue to be tight.&nbsp; Our projection shows there would be a shortage of workers for the jobs that would be created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also listen beyond Government funding the four extra weeks&nbsp; - Ms Irene Ng has pointed this out&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;and we have allowed flexibility for these four weeks to be spread out over six months.&nbsp; She asked: what does it mean?&nbsp; Can they come back part-time?&nbsp; The answer is yes, by mutual consent.&nbsp; For that four-week period, they can devise any combination.&nbsp; It is up to them, but&nbsp;it has to be by mutual consent.&nbsp; So, if she decides that she wants one day a week, spread out I do not know over how long, it is up to them.&nbsp; It has to be done over six months.&nbsp; I suppose there is some mathematical formulation that they have to agree on.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members also spoke about why paternity leave was not introduced.&nbsp; I made some comments following our press conference when announcing these measures.&nbsp; Yes, I did say that it did not reflect society's&nbsp;needs at this point of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me contextualise those remarks.&nbsp; As Dr Amy Khor has said, this is a package and there are practical concerns.&nbsp; In other words, every time we introduce a measure, there is a cost to it and there <p align=left>Column: 765<p>are trade-offs to be made.&nbsp; Between paternity leave and maternity leave, we would have to cost the paternity leave that would be taken, and the sense was that women need more the period of four weeks to recuperate and bond with their children, and it will be better used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we had cost paternity leave, we would have had to forgo some other elements within the package.&nbsp; So it is a practical consideration.&nbsp; And we were governed by what is more useful, what will be better made use of, what do people need from the consultation, not as much as we wanted to send a signal.&nbsp; I agree completely that fathers need to share parenthood.&nbsp; I cheer the fathers who are involved with the birth of their children, as it should be.&nbsp; But if there was a trade-off between four weeks of maternity leave and paternity leave&nbsp; -&nbsp; it would not be&nbsp;two weeks of each, it would probably be&nbsp;three weeks of maternity leave versus one week of paternity leave&nbsp; -&nbsp; because&nbsp;we have to cater for more men working and men earning more.&nbsp; It is not quite symmetrical.&nbsp; In&nbsp;the package, if&nbsp;we introduce paternity leave, it would have actually taken up sizable chunks from what we could provide.&nbsp; And the package already costs $800 million.&nbsp; So there was a finite limit to the resources that we could spend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members also asked about unmarried mothers.&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng brought this up.&nbsp; Yes, there was a social signal to be sent.&nbsp; This is a marriage and&nbsp;procreation package.&nbsp; Yes, we do empathise with these mothers.&nbsp; Our intention was not to make it&nbsp;harder for them.&nbsp; But this particular package should not be seen as a be-all&nbsp;end-all of all incentives.&nbsp; There is a HOPE scheme which is particularly catered for unmarried mothers or other mothers who have to meet eligible criteria which are fairly beneficial, and there are many other schemes within the Government which they can ascribe to.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we&nbsp;need to send a social signal <p align=left>Column: 766<p>that in&nbsp;marriage and procreation, we must have agreed that the best environment which children are born into must be a nuclear family.&nbsp; I know that Members do not disagree with that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on aspects related to flexi time.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang said that he does not see how these schemes help employees.&nbsp; I think the union members have quite eloquently articulated the case that interests of workers need to be protected.&nbsp; I accept that.&nbsp; The worst protection for an employee is for him to lose his job.&nbsp; And just like flexible wages, this ability to maximise resources allows our companies to maximise their manpower.&nbsp; It reduces the need for them to retrench workers, and that surely must be the greatest protection of income stability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will we protect workers' interest when they apply for exemptions?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And that is why I have said that the Commissioner for Labour will appoint a working committee, which will include union representatives, when they are assessing the applications.&nbsp; I have said specifically what companies need to demonstrate when they apply for an exemption.&nbsp; So it would not be a case where the company says, "I have this. I am going to apply for exemption and expect to be exempted."&nbsp; It is not so.&nbsp; First, the Commissioner for Labour will have to see that indeed that there is a business case, there is volatility in the&nbsp;cycles, there is a lull period and peak period which the company must adjust to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it must ensure that workers' health and safety are protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, as I said, there has to be income stability.&nbsp; This is not just a cost cutting measure.&nbsp; Fourth and, more importantly, the profits gained from the more efficient use of manpower resources will be shared with workers.&nbsp; So we will consult the unions.&nbsp; In fact, the union will be in the committee advising the Commissioner for Labour.&nbsp; And I would encourage workers, if they<p align=left>Column: 767<p> feel that they will be discriminated against and their interests would not be protected, to join the union and get their union to represent them.&nbsp; I know full well that the union will represent them adequately and eloquently in the working committee that advises the Commissioner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me also thank Members for supporting our measures to change the minimum age.&nbsp; Let me first acknowledge that NTUC has been pushing for this for a very long time, and we have acceded.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah now says: can you ratify ILO Convention 138 quickly?&nbsp; My answer is that we will do it expeditiously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; [Dr Ng Eng Hen].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>													<!--TITLE_NAME:CHILDREN DEVELOPMENT CO-SAVINGS (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 767<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>CHILDREN DEVELOPMENT CO-SAVINGS (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR></b>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr S Iswaran) in the Chair]</B></p><p>6.26 pm</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, despite the introduction of various measures over the years, our total fertility rate (TFR) has dropped to an all-time low<p align=left>Column: 768<p> of 1.25 in 2003. To fully replace our population, we need a TFR of 2.1.&nbsp; Singapore is not alone in having a low and declining birth rate.&nbsp; Many developed countries also face the same challenge, and the irony is that Singaporeans actually do want to have more children.&nbsp; When polled, most saw a 3-child family as ideal, but many thought that they could only manage two.&nbsp; In fact, more couples are having only one or, in some cases, none at all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans have cited several factors for this, and this includes concerns over finances, the lack of time, lack of energy, limited options for the care of the child and sub-optimal worklife balance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our previous measures such as the extension of eight weeks of paid maternity leave for the third child and the baby bonus for the second and third child sought to address some of these concerns.&nbsp; But the recently unveiled parenthood package addresses the need of Singaporean families even more holistically.&nbsp; Of these measures, I shall only touch on the baby bonus and maternity leave.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at present, the bonus is given to the second and third child.&nbsp; The baby bonus will now be extended to the first and fourth child.&nbsp; The first child will be eligible for a cash gift of $3,000.&nbsp; The second child will remain eligible for a cash gift of $3,000 as well as a matching Government contribution of up to $6,000 in the child's development account.&nbsp; The third and fourth child will both be eligible for a cash gift of $6,000 as well as a matching Government contribution of up to $12,000 in the child's development account.&nbsp; The upfront cash component will be paid out over two years, instead of the current six years.&nbsp;I wish to inform the House that these changes will be reflected in the Children Development Co-Savings Regulations rather than the Bill itself.</p><p align=left>Column: 769<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to maternity leave.&nbsp; The Minister for Manpower has earlier explained the statutory maternity leave provisions to be included in the Employment Act.&nbsp; So I shall only highlight the salient points in this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill provides for Government reimbursement for the additional weeks of maternity leave for female employees and self-employed women.&nbsp; For the first and second confinements, this will be for the additional four weeks, subject to a cap of $10,000 per confinement.&nbsp; Employers will continue to pay for the first eight weeks.&nbsp; For the third and fourth confinements, Government will pay the full 12 weeks, subject to a cap of $30,000.&nbsp; The additional four weeks of maternity leave can be taken flexibly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For companies that have a six-day work week, the Government will reimburse up to a cap of 24 days.&nbsp; For others with shorter work week, the Government will reimburse the number of days of leave for an equivalent period of four work weeks.&nbsp; The Manpower Ministry will be responsible for the enforcement of leave provisions and the resolution of disputes between employers and employees under this amendment Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main purpose of maternity leave is to enable mothers to recover physically from childbirth.&nbsp; Mothers who adopt their child are not entitled to maternity leave as such.&nbsp; However, to affirm our commitment to support families, the Government will reimburse up to four weeks of pay if the adopting mother's employer voluntarily provides her with leave to be with her adopted child.&nbsp; In line with the flexible portion of maternity leave, the Government's reimbursement will only apply if the leave is taken when the adopted child is younger than six months.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our objective is to ensure that there will be a sufficiently large number of <p align=left>Column: 770<p>Singaporean citizens in succeeding generations to form a viable population core for the country.&nbsp; As such, Members will appreciate that this Bill proposes measures that are targeted specifically at citizen babies.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill proposes reimbursements for maternity leave for up to the fourth child, so as to help alleviate the financial outlays faced by couples who choose to have a fourth child.&nbsp; I should add at this point that this package is not meant as a prescription for the number of children that a family should have.&nbsp; Having a child is an intensely personal decision and the choice, we believe, is best left to the family to make.&nbsp; What we wish to do is to help and to support Singaporeans who want to have more children to have more children.&nbsp; At the end of the day, what we all want is that the next generation of young Singaporeans, not just to grow the economy, but really to build the nation and to be our future.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A new provision is the reimbursement of the pay of female employees or the lost income of self-employed women who are married, widowed or divorced, who adopt children who are less than six months old, at the point of adoption, for a maximum period of 24 days. This is a good initiative and shows that MCYS is sympathetic to the plight of couples who are unable to have children of their own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my comments regarding the extended maternity leave for up to four children are similar to those I had made earlier under the Employment (Amendment) Bill, I shall not repeat them here.&nbsp; However, I would like to urge MCYS, together with MOM, to intensify their efforts to convince more firms to adopt family-friendly work practices which are mutually beneficial to employers and employees.&nbsp; According to the Tripartite Committee on Work-Life Strategy, presently only one in five employers allow flexi-work and only 15% offer part-time work.&nbsp; There is obviously a great deal more room for pro-family workplace practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The demands of work and the worry that having a baby would hinder one's advancement in career are among the most oft-cited reasons for couples for delaying parenthood or having fewer children.&nbsp; More effort is thus needed to change employers' mindsets and develop family-friendly work practices.&nbsp; Such practices should not discriminate against women and should look at ways to allow for flexi-work hours, working from home and part-time work where the nature of the work can accommodate such arrangements.&nbsp; Employers must also be encouraged to look at performance in terms of outcomes and deliverables and not the hours worked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many stay-at-home mothers have expressed their frustration that the baby <p align=left>Column: 772<p>package seems to unwittingly imply that stay-at-home mums are less appreciated, although this is not so since they do benefit from the new baby bonus scheme, for instance.&nbsp; They share that they will prefer to work part-time which will allow them to spend time with their children and at the same time gain some financial independence and self-fulfilment.&nbsp; However, part-time work is scarce as many employers are not amenable to such arrangements.&nbsp; Such mindsets have to be changed if we want to encourage procreation and at the same time help make it easier for women to chart their own course in motherhood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS could also embark on a drive to encourage more fathers to share in parenting responsibility so that women do not feel that they would have to be the only ones to make the sacrifices and juggle multiple roles if they were to start a family that could impact on their career.&nbsp; Already, there are comments that the slew of measures remain women centric and do not do enough to signal the shared parenting responsibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other areas that MCYS could consider would be to help train more home-based baby-sitters and to consider extending infant care subsidies to parents who choose home-based baby-sitters as opposed to infant care centres.&nbsp; Some parents may feel more comfortable entrusting their infants to a familiar neighbour or relative than a maid or an infant care centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these suggestions, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, I commend the Government for inserting a new section 12A in the Children Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill to provide for Government's reimbursement for adoption leave.&nbsp; Adopting a child can be a complicated, time-consuming and emotionally draining<p align=left>Column: 773<p> experience, whether it is a local adoption or a foreign one.&nbsp; Currently, Singaporeans adopt an average of 700 children a year, more than 60% of whom are foreign born.&nbsp; About 5% of the total number of adoptions, or about 35 cases, each year&nbsp; involves singles.&nbsp; They have to meet strict criteria to be eligible to adopt.&nbsp; Each applicant will be investigated thoroughly by MCYS as well as the authorities in the relevant foreign country, if it is an overseas adoption,&nbsp;and they have to apply to the Family Court for the adoption order.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, under the current&nbsp;Government's guidelines, single females who meet the criteria and the strict checks are allowed to adopt a child.&nbsp; But here comes the contradiction with this Bill.&nbsp; It excludes them in its provision for reimbursement for adoption leave. The amendment only provides for Government's reimbursement to an employer who has granted to a married, widowed or divorced female employee paid leave in connection with her adoption of a child.&nbsp; Single females who adopted are not included.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister why the contradiction when MCYS already allows adoption by singles, and that signals that it is not an immoral thing, but at the same time does not allow the employer to get Government's reimbursement for adoption leave.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister to make consistent its policy and to be clear on the Government's position on this.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.&nbsp;This Bill provides enhanced maternity benefits and greater protection for women.&nbsp; There are a few aspects of the Bill&nbsp;which I wish to touch on.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, under this Bill, female executives, managers and confidential staff are now legally entitled to employer-paid maternity benefit.&nbsp; They can claim paid maternity leave of up to <p align=left>Column: 774<p>eight weeks from the employers for the first two children.&nbsp; Hitherto, for these women, their entitlement to this benefit depends on their contract of service.&nbsp; Most good employers would provide this benefit, but it is something contractual or purely at the discretion of the employer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Children Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA) was passed a few years ago, conferring paid maternity benefit to all female employees for the third child, a serious anomaly arose.&nbsp; It resulted in a situation where for female executives, managers and confidential staff, the maternity benefit for the third child is guaranteed but not for the first and second child.&nbsp; This Bill will address this anomaly.&nbsp; Maternity leave is a very basic and core benefit and should be given statutory protection, regardless of a woman's position in the workplace.&nbsp; This is commonplace in the legislation of many countries and recognises the priority which society places on the needs of pregnant women and mothers with new born infants.&nbsp; The NTUC has been raising this matter many times and we are glad that this change is finally made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important protection, Sir, under the Bill is that stipulated under the various provisions of the new section 17 which make it an offence for an employer to contravene sections 81 and 84 of the Employment Act.&nbsp; Under section 81 of the Employment Act, it is an offence for an employer to dismiss or even serve a notice of dismissal on a female employee when she is on maternity leave.&nbsp; Under section 84 of the Employment Act, it is wrongful for an employer to dismiss a female employee without valid reasons when she is in her sixth month of pregnancy onwards.&nbsp; These are important protection already provided for women covered under the Employment Act but which are now extended to female executives, managers and confidential staff under the Bill.&nbsp; Indeed, it is meaningless to provide for the payment of <p align=left>Column: 775<p>maternity benefit if there is no corresponding protection against wrongful dismissals when women avail themselves of the benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly therefore support this amendment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second weakness under the existing law which the Bill seeks to remedy is the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism.&nbsp; Despite the fact that the CDCA requires employers to pay maternity benefits to their female employees for the third child, there is no proper mechanism to deal with those who refuse to do so.&nbsp; This is now taken care of by the new section 12(1) which empowers the Minister for Manpower to investigate any complaints and to prosecute any employer who fails to pay maternity benefits or who contravenes any of the provisions of the law which prohibit dismissals due to pregnancy-related reasons.&nbsp; The new provision will strengthen the law in protecting women, and I support it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third improvement brought about by the law is the 24 days' paid leave accorded to female employees who adopt children.&nbsp; This is indeed a novel provision and will help couples who are unable to have their own children to adopt one.&nbsp; As the Minister had said, this is meant to affirm the Government's commitment to families and is certainly a most progressive aspect of the legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, the new section 22 of the CDCA provides that for confinements which occurred between 1st August 2004 and 30th September 2004, female employees will be entitled to the additional four weeks of benefit only if the employers agree to grant them leave of absence.&nbsp; This means that during the transition period, if employers refuse to grant the female employees the additional four weeks, they will be deprived of the payment from the Government.&nbsp; I would<p align=left>Column: 776<p> like to urge all employers to provide the additional four weeks to their female employees and to see this as an important investment in their employees' welfare and not just a cost item.&nbsp; At the same time, I would like to ask the Minister what measures will be taken to encourage employers to do so, so that women who give birth between 1st August 2004 and 30th September 2004 can benefit from these additional four weeks of maternity leave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill, and I have a few comments to make.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is much welcomed as it spells out the new measures that come under the recent announcements and the processes to improve work-life balance schemes.&nbsp; The speediness with which these policies are given the momentum is much appreciated.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three comments that I have to make. First, this Bill is still, as we have said before, motherhood centric and does not give enough recognition to the role that fathers play or have to play.&nbsp; As the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, it is important that the signal to the society comes clearly that fathers and mothers play an equal role in this aspect of bringing up children.&nbsp; And if we are truly concerned with work-life balances, it is important for employers to be guided well and to be steered into viewing family responsibilities.&nbsp; In some instances, the 12 weeks of maternity leave could have easily been packaged as parental leave with eight weeks' compulsory maternity leave and four weeks for the spouses to decide who is the better party to share that and to work it with the employers.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point that I would like to make is the stay-at-home mums who have <p align=left>Column: 777<p>made a deliberate choice to give up their careers and look after their newborns.&nbsp; Their consideration here is that they receive only $75 in infant care subsidy as compared to $400 for working mums.&nbsp; This disparity ought not to be there as, in some instances, fathers and mothers are making a deliberate choice to make do with one income and not all of them may come from well-to-do homes, that it is a choice of luxury.&nbsp; We can offer the same subsidies but perhaps provision can be made that they receive them on a sliding scale so that mothers or fathers will eventually return to the workforce and not see it, through their children, a potential cash cow.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, in this Bill, there should be a provision to protect the unmarried mother.&nbsp; She is a woman who falls into either of two categories - that she has become pregnant through an accident and is now with a child or a woman who has decided on her own to walk not down the path of the aisle and forgoes her boyfriend.&nbsp; Either way, she has made a deliberate choice; she has given up the option of an abortion and has decided to bring the baby to full term.&nbsp; Knowing full well the consequences and the stigma that is often attached to such a state, yet she goes ahead to walk this path because she cannot bring herself to abort the child or to be dependent on an unreliable boyfriend.&nbsp; There are such women among us. We have been told,&nbsp; from a recent newspaper report, that there are about 500 such babies, and 50 of such mothers have already formed a support group.&nbsp; I know some of them. They are responsible mothers.&nbsp; They do not play the victim role; neither do they play the martyr role.&nbsp; They are just trying to get by</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>in a place that is not very friendly to them or their children.&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, this Bill does not make a provision for them to enjoy child relief even when these single mothers are working.&nbsp; They are not entitled to any <p align=left>Column: 778<p>Government paid maternity leave.&nbsp; And as we heard earlier, the Minister is saying that the maternity leave is a way to recognise the fact that the mother needs some recuperation.&nbsp; These single unwed mothers are in the same category, and they have to depend on the goodwill of their employers to gain some maternity leave.&nbsp; While they are more dependent on the kindness of their parents to look after their children, there is no grandparent relief scheme available to them either.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill has provisions for those who are married, divorced or widowed.&nbsp; This particular group of women is totally left out.&nbsp; I think we have to face the fact that some men would rather walk away from their responsibility of their unborn child and that some women would rather go the whole way on their own than put up with a marriage that from day one they know it is going to be a tumultuous experience.&nbsp; It is a brave decision to bring a baby to full term and face a lifetime of bringing up a child alone. We ought to bring this group into the fold under these schemes and not see it as a way of encouraging women to have children out of wedlock.&nbsp; There must be enough disincentives to do that already.&nbsp; We do not need to use this.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, while the Bill spells out a whole slew of good measures, what is more important is how we implement them and how these are monitored.&nbsp; Eventually, it is my hope that the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports will also view and relook at how society is making its decision on what we see as a personal choice and maybe, as work in progress, to relook at the definition of "family".</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members for their contributions and I will&nbsp;take them one by one.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Dr Amy Khor for the need for family-friendly work practices and <p align=left>Column: 779<p>increased options for part-time work.&nbsp; But this is not something which can be easily solved through legislation.&nbsp; We will have to work with the employers, we will have to encourage and to educate.&nbsp; I note&nbsp;her suggestion on whether subsidies should be provided for home-based infant care. &nbsp;I think this is something&nbsp;which will need to be studied very carefully before we make any commitment in this area.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng talked about adoptions by singles.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in her own speech,&nbsp;she did acknowledge that our policies are necessarily biased towards being family centric.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst as a concession or as an exception, we allow singles to adopt children,&nbsp;this does not, in any way, erode our fundamental belief that the best place, the best circumstances, to bring up children is in the context of an intact&nbsp;family.&nbsp; So, yes, we do allow singles to adopt,&nbsp;but that does not necessarily mean that we should extend all the benefits and&nbsp;incentives for&nbsp;intact families to singles who wish to adopt.&nbsp; It is the exception rather than the norm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mdm Halimah's speech, I am glad to say that I can agree with practically all the points that&nbsp;she has made.&nbsp; It seems she&nbsp;has been so supportive.&nbsp; I would also echo, however, her encouragement to employers to take advantage of the Government's generosity during this transitional period from&nbsp;1st August to 31st&nbsp;September&nbsp;to grant the qualifying employees leave and let the Government reimburse them.&nbsp; But, again, this is something&nbsp;which we cannot legislate because, by definition, this Act only comes into effect on&nbsp;1st&nbsp;October.&nbsp; So, again, this is an opportunity for employers to show good faith.&nbsp; It is something&nbsp;which both Government and the trade unions will work very closely with employers, and this would be a good opportunity for tripartism in action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 780<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to move on to Ms Braema's speech.&nbsp; There have been a lot of criticisms that all these packages are too women centric and too motherhood centric, and that perhaps we are not focusing enough on the role of fathers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state categorically that we all in this Chamber do believe that fathers have a very, very important role to play.&nbsp; We also all believe that fathers can do more.&nbsp; But we must not mistake or wishfully believe that simply legislating maternity leave will solve the problem.&nbsp; As a father and as a husband, I will freely tell you the main limiting factor for father's contribution in his child's life is not&nbsp;time.&nbsp; There is always time,&nbsp;with a five-day week and with annual leave.&nbsp; There is actually more time.&nbsp; The problem is one of values, of attitudes and commitment.&nbsp; And we need to fix it at that level.&nbsp; But to pretend that simply legislating maternity leave will fix&nbsp;the problem of attitudes, values and commitment is wishful thinking.&nbsp; So let us&nbsp;&nbsp;address the problem at its root and accept that this is something which fathers and men will have to work through in negotiation with their wives and&nbsp;children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as stay-at-home mothers are concerned, I think it is important to get the perspective right, that the subsidies we provide for infant care and childcare are basically to assist women who choose to or need to&nbsp;return to work and therefore need the availability of childcare and infant care facilities which are very expensive compared to, say, kindergarten care.&nbsp; So because we recognise&nbsp;there is this need for women who wish to go back to work, we have come out with this package of subsidies.&nbsp; In the case of mothers who stay at home, I want to add that I do not want to enter into a debate as to which is the right course or who is doing more or which is&nbsp;more valuable. I think there are no right answers.&nbsp; These are personal decisions.&nbsp; But in the case of mothers who choose to stay at home, you will have to admit that they have, in a <p align=left>Column: 781<p>sense, a lesser need to use childcare and infant care facilities, than for mothers who are engaged at work.&nbsp; So that is the reason why, although as a concession, I would add that&nbsp;we have provided some subsidies for stay-at-home mothers who wish to avail themselves of childcare and infant care facilities.&nbsp; We have not added those subsidies at the same level as working mothers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to end by referring to her point on unwed mothers.&nbsp; I think Ms Irene Ng also brought up this issue.&nbsp; The fundamental point here is that the State cannot and should not be the surrogate father or&nbsp;surrogate husband.&nbsp; So let us recognise that that is where the crux of the issue is, that is, a breakdown in the relationship.&nbsp; There is a breakdown in the sense of responsibility by the person concerned.&nbsp; Again, to assume wishfully that we can solve the problem by getting the State to step in would be a big, big mistake.&nbsp; Having said that, however, we recognise that unwed mothers have needs, and that is why they still have entitlements to maternity leave under the Employment Act and that is why if they choose to put their children in childcare or infant care while they go out to work, they will also receive subsidies.&nbsp; So the point here is that we cannot argue for equality because that would be missing the crux of the issue.&nbsp; But we recognise that there are needs and we will do our best to help them, but they cannot be pegged at the same level as women who are married, or who were previously married and are now divorced, or are widowed through no fault of their own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in this entire debate, let us not get distracted by peripheral issues or by wishful thinking, but focus on what we are trying to do, which is not to prescribe how many children you should have, not to prescribe how you should order your family life or&nbsp;domestic life.&nbsp; What we are all affirming is the value of intact families and&nbsp;the value of children to our society,<p align=left>Column: 782<p> and that the most that the Government can do is to assist in a small way.&nbsp; But the primary responsibility lies in each of us as individuals, as spouses and as parents to make decisions, and these decisions have consequences.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
