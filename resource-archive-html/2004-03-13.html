FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tourism</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, as I was saying&nbsp; yesterday, bar-top dancing, beach fun foam parties, reverse bungee jumping and foreign cabaret acts are not uniquely Singapore.&nbsp; Let us not pretend that they are.&nbsp; But I can see what STB is doing, targeting the youngish, hip cosmopolitan crowd and that is fine.&nbsp; But let us not forget families.&nbsp; I think one unique and natural niche for Singapore is to position itself as a fun family destination.&nbsp; It should ride on our clean wholesome image which we should be proud of.&nbsp; It need not be fuddy-duddy or boring. Club Med, for instance, positions itself as the family resort specialist and&nbsp;does a great job of catering to families with all-day activities for children of all ages. Yet, it is also a hip place drawing young couples and young singles.&nbsp; I know that&nbsp;Atlantis City is also seen as a family place although even it has a casino. But I wonder whether it would still be as successful without the casino. If yes, why not be a family place without the casino?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe firmly that in our quest to attract tourists, we should not forget what kind of community we are and what kind of community we want to be which leads me to this last point.&nbsp; Over the last few years, Singapore has been loosening up to position itself as a hip, cool cosmopolitan society and a good tourist destination for the young.&nbsp; It is good that Singapore is getting to be more relaxed and more fun, but it will be a sad day if, to attract the tourist dollar and the rich jet-setters, we have no compunction of going the way of Patpong&nbsp;or some of the seedier joints in the region to sell the city, albeit as a top-end, top-draw destination, a version of these destinations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we go to the airport, sometimes we see in different cities, they abbreviate "Singapore" to "Sin".&nbsp; I hope that next time, when people think of Singapore, it will not be a sin city.&nbsp; I hope we will also<p align=left>Column: 1508<p> not want to become the Las Vegas of Asia, with big casinos and showgirls and compulsive gamblers coming to our shores.&nbsp; Not only is it shallow, it shows up our lack of creativity.&nbsp; New Zealand, to my mind, is a great example of one way to sell itself.&nbsp; Its greatest tourism act is arguably Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. His works convey to&nbsp;the world that New Zealand, a country of three million, is a creative place and also has beautiful landscapes that can pass off as Middle Earth.&nbsp; Malaysia highlights its famous actress, Michelle Yeoh in its "Truly Asia" advertisements and Hong Kong has actor Jackie Chan as its&nbsp;official tourism ambassador. These creative individuals personified what is special about their countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, in Singapore, what is our creative edge that we can show to the world as uniquely Singaporean and which we can be proud of as Singaporeans.&nbsp; I also want to ask the Minister: the Government has said no to casinos, why the change of mind now?&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; Sir, the number of tourists from China has increased significantly over the years. With the high economic growth of China, the people are getting more and more affluent.&nbsp; Every year, if we can attract 1% of China's 1.3 billion people to come to Singapore, we would have more than 10 million tourist arrivals in Singapore, much higher than the Singapore Tourism Board's target of seven million. This will certainly boost our tourism industry.&nbsp; In order to attract more tourists from China to visit us, I have a few suggestions to make. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have to reduce the entrance fees of our tourist attractions.&nbsp; In the past, we had the Haw Par Villa and the Tang Dynasty Garden. But because of the high entrance fees, they could not attract enough visitors, and had to close down. Sentosa used to charge an entrance fee of <p align=left>Column: 1509<p>$5. Two years ago, I raised this point in Parliament, and I am very glad that the entrance fee has since been reduced to $2.&nbsp; I think we should lower the entrance fees so as to attract more visitors.&nbsp; Now, we have two world-famous attractions, ie, the Jurong Bird Park and the Mandai Zoological Gardens.&nbsp; Last week, a Chinese tourist&nbsp;wrote in the newspapers that with the entrance fee of $12 per head, plus a plate of chicken rice and some drinks each, it would cost the family of four some $120. It is about $30 or&nbsp; about 150 renminbi per head.&nbsp; This is a bit high for the Chinese tourists. I think we should seriously look into these charges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we should have more Chinese signboards.&nbsp; In order to attract the Chinese tourists, we have to use their language so that they could feel at home when they are in Singapore.&nbsp; Recently, I went to Beijing and when I was flying on the SIA plane, I found that all the notices in the toilet were written in English. There was not a word in Chinese. As a result, the toilets were dirty and smelly. One air hostess came up with an idea and wrote two Chinese characters <I>chong shui</I>, meaning "flush water" on a sheet of paper and pasted it on the toilet wall. Immediately thereafter, the passengers began to flush the toilet after use, and the toilets became clean and no longer smelly.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I arrived at the Changi Airport, I heard two tourists from China&nbsp; discussing which way they had to go. One said, "Let us turn left. If we cannot find the immigration checkpoint, then we turn to the right."&nbsp; The other one was smarter,&nbsp; and he said, "Just follow the others!" So they were actually groping in the dark.&nbsp; If we can have more clearly written indications in Chinese, this will help the Chinese tourists and they will feel more at home here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we have to improve our service, particularly in our retail industry.&nbsp; I would like to cite an example.&nbsp; I went to<p align=left>Column: 1510<p> a shopping centre to buy a pair of trousers. I asked the salesman whether he could shorten the length of the trousers for me. He said, "No problem.&nbsp; You go and pay for it first."&nbsp; After that, he handed me a form and asked me to write down my name and telephone number.&nbsp; I asked him why I had to do this, as I just only needed to have the length of the trousers shortened.&nbsp; He told me that the trousers would be ready only in one week's time.&nbsp; If this is the kind of service we offer, then I do not think we would be able to attract the tourists to shop here.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</B> Sir, last year, when I spoke on this topic, I suggested that we have to focus ourselves on developing a unique identity for Singapore, be it&nbsp;a product or a service or an experience that the tourist can get when he comes to Singapore.&nbsp; I am happy to note that STB has adopted the words "Uniquely Singapore" as a slogan for its new campaign.&nbsp; Likewise, the Minister said yesterday said that the development of Sentosa and the surrounding islands has to be uniquely Singaporean.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Ms Irene Ng was a bit heated up over the fact that the Crazy Horse show is coming to Singapore.&nbsp; I too am quite excited about this but in a different sort of way.&nbsp; I will agree with her that there is nothing uniquely Singaporean about this and I do not think tourists will come to Singapore because there is a Crazy Horse show in Singapore and it is really exciting to watch.&nbsp; But I see this as part of an effort to spice things up in Singapore.&nbsp; It is often the case that visitors ask me what is there to do in Singapore at night after dinner.&nbsp; I must admit that the options are limited, unless, having been a Member of this House for so long, I am really out of touch with the nightlife in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do remember that some years ago, we had the old Bugis Street. &nbsp;I am not talking about the present Bugis Street.&nbsp; It<p align=left>Column: 1511<p> was an attraction by itself.&nbsp; We still have visitors coming back to Singapore asking where is the old Bugis Street, because it has that type of vibrant nightlife.&nbsp; I am not advocating&nbsp;that we should develop the seedy&nbsp;type of nightlife that we find in places like Bangkok, but I think we should have that kind of places and the kind of attractions that will make visitors remember that they should come back because Singapore is a happening place.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a look at, for example, Lan Kwai&nbsp;Fong in Hong Kong, there is nothing oriental about the place.&nbsp; In fact, it is all western-styled pubs and watering holes.&nbsp; But that place has become an icon of night life in Hong Kong.&nbsp; In a way, it has become unique to that territory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, developing tourism has to be all-encompassing because there are all types of tourists, including families.&nbsp; Catering to the rich and famous, as we want to do now, is a good approach because it will help us double, if not treble, our tourism receipts in the years ahead.&nbsp; It will enable us to carve out this very important huge niche market.&nbsp; But we must not forget, at the same time, those who continue to come here with fixed budgets. I say this because with the growth of the low-cost carriers, the no-frills airlines, we can therefore expect a totally new market to grow.&nbsp; We can expect more people to come here looking for just simply, what&nbsp;I call, good deals. While we now switch our focus to an upmarket high spending type of customers,&nbsp;we must not forget&nbsp;that numbers count too.&nbsp; Much of our tourism infrastructure is geared towards the mass market, our lower priced hotels, small restaurants and not everybody is attracted to just the plush resorts or the spas.&nbsp; I hope that we will not forget to remember our focus on this.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; There are&nbsp;people who said that when the China tourists come to <p align=left>Column: 1512<p>Singapore, the moment they are left alone without a tourist guide, they become "handicapped people". Everywhere they go, they see all the road signs and signboards written in English only.&nbsp; They can see but are unable to understand,&nbsp;hence they are "blind". When they are in the MRT trains, all announcements are in English. They hear but cannot understand, hence "deaf".&nbsp; When they try to ask around for directions, most people they meet speak only English, but they cannot speak English, hence "dumb".&nbsp; When they try to roam about Singapore on their own, they find that the bus stops have no bus guide or directions in Chinese, and they just cannot go anywhere, hence "lame".&nbsp; They become "blind, deaf, dumb and lame", just like the physically handicapped people.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next focused objective of the STB is to develop "self-service tourist package" to attract China tourists.&nbsp; Is such an environment helpful?&nbsp; In these few years, although the number of tourist arrivals in Singapore has gone up, actual income earned from the tourists has gone down.&nbsp; Hence, STB hopes to make tourists, especially China tourists, to stay longer and to spend more.&nbsp; However, if the environment does not improve, can we make China tourists stay longer here?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We often promote&nbsp;Singapore's uniqueness&nbsp;as a convergence between the oriental and western cultures. The STB Chief Executive Officer Mr Lim Neo Chian said that in the current and future tour promotional exercise, we want to use the emotional ties to attract the China tourists so as to make them feel more passionate in wanting to come here.&nbsp; After hearing the feedback I have just mentioned above, what would be their reaction?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to say that small details such as Chinese road signs and signboards alone cannot build up the emotional ties. I do not know when the Singaporeans who speak a little Mandarin but could not <p align=left>Column: 1513<p>understand&nbsp;Chinese would benefit from our efforts to woo China tourists, and recover their healthy senses of&nbsp;the so-called convergence of oriental and western cultures.&nbsp; Of course, the authority could continue to offer lip service by saying they are going to "provide the convenience", but do nothing in substance citing principle and technical problems as excuses. The fact remains if the China tourists leave Singapore after their short stay here, they could only comment that Singapore is very clean and orderly. But down in their hearts, they may not want to come back again and they may even go home and encourage their relatives to opt&nbsp;for other travel destinations. This will certainly be a great economic loss to us.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Social Impact of Tourism</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I wish to say has much been covered by my friend, Ms Irene Ng.&nbsp; We have seen discernible moves towards greater easing up of our social scene.

They are concerned that such moves promote the idea that sexual promiscuity is acceptable, and therefore, this may undermine our family values.&nbsp; They are afraid that this signifies a willingness, a readiness on the part of Singaporeans or the Government to go down the slippery slope where further down the society may no longer be able to or may not want to distinguish between entertainment and sleaze.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that we need to be exciting and vibrant in order to woo tourists.&nbsp; But the signals we pass must be consistent with our overall values.

Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):&nbsp;</B> &nbsp;Sir, the new electricity market commenced operation on 1st January 2003 with&nbsp;five active&nbsp;generation companies, five active retailers and about 250 large contestable customers, comprising 35% of&nbsp;Singapore's electricity demand,&nbsp;having exercised choice, and switched to independent retailers.&nbsp;&nbsp;By 31st December 2003, a very successful retail market had developed, where more than 80% of contestable loads or about 55% of Singapore's total electricity load had already exercised choice and were being supplied by independent retailers.&nbsp; The competitive and robust nature of the new market has seen generation companies compete to raise efficiency and bring down costs, with the ultimate beneficiaries being the customers.&nbsp; Pool prices were below the long-run marginal cost of the most efficient combined cycle gas turbine and retail contracts with large customers were well below SP Services' published tariffs.&nbsp; There was no supply interruption.&nbsp; The lights did not go out. &nbsp;There was no market suspension.&nbsp; There were clear price signals when there was a forced outage or fuel supply disruption.&nbsp; The market systems were operating successfully.&nbsp; Apart from the delay in the introduction of vesting regime, by all accounts, the Singapore&nbsp;wholesale electricity market and retail liberalisation roll-out is a successful model for other<p align=left>Column: 1515<p> countries to follow.&nbsp; The Energy Market Authority and the Ministry of Trade and Industry must be commended for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The vesting regime was implemented on 1st January 2004 based on 65% of the system demand being allocated to four generation companies.&nbsp; The vesting price for the month of January 2004 was set at $94.24 per megawatt hour.&nbsp; Almost immediately, the average pool clearing price dropped to $66.00 per megawatt hour.&nbsp; As a result, the wholesale price of electricity, which is the weighted average of the vesting price and the pool price, had also fallen to $83.74 per megawatt hour.&nbsp; This was certainly good news for the consumer.&nbsp; Business consumers had been lamenting our high electricity charges that add to the high cost of doing business in Singapore.&nbsp; It, therefore, came as a surprise to many of us when we read the 18th February 2004 <I>Straits Times</I> article with the headline, "Firms may pay less with new electricity contracts".&nbsp; But, it went on to state that, "Though wholesale power prices under deregulated system have eased by 10%, most firms are still locked into old pacts".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am an independent external Director of&nbsp; Singapore Power Limited, one of the generation companies, but I do not intend to go into the technical issues here, as these are complex and can be best dealt with at other industry forum.&nbsp; Instead, in the interest of the lay consumers, I would like to ask the Minister three questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, why, as reported in the said&nbsp;<I>Straits Times</I> article, although wholesale electricity prices had already dipped 10% since the start of the year, it was estimated that less than 1% of customers were paying these lower prices?&nbsp; How come so few customers were in the position to benefit from this drop in tariff?&nbsp; These are not small consumers who are <p align=left>Column: 1516<p>ignorant or careless about what they pay for their electricity.&nbsp; They are our largest commercial and industrial customers, such as wafer fab plants, petrochemical complexes, factories, hotels and large buildings, some of whom paid as much as $1 million per month for electricity and many of whom have in-house M&amp;E facilities managers to maintain their plant and equipment, or have engaged experts to advise them on their power consumption and tariff plan.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of vesting is not new.&nbsp; It has been talked about since the start of liberalisation.&nbsp; One would imagine that if there was going to be such a long awaited market development, the majority of the more sophisticated market participants, if not all, would be able to do their sums and place them in&nbsp;a position to hedge their risk or benefit from the change.&nbsp; Could it be that not many people in the industry had foreseen the drastic drop in the pool clearing price and it caught both the regulator and the market participants by surprise?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That brings me to my next question.&nbsp; Was there sufficient disclosure and dissemination of market information for the consumers to make informed decisions?&nbsp; Perhaps EMA, as the regulator, could not give advice on the type of contract consumers should enter into.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more forums, seminars and discussions could have been organised to educate those who are interested, and where experts could be invited to give their opinion on the different scenarios, the implications and consequences of the anticipated new development.&nbsp; It is then up to the audience to make their own judgment and decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for an efficient market, there must be adequate sharing of information, clear market signals, transparency about the rules, about developments and what the major industry players are doing.&nbsp; Any<p align=left>Column: 1517<p> changes should be notified as early as possible.&nbsp; The need for transparency cannot be over-emphasised as we move towards full retail contestability, where not only large customers are involved, but the smallest consumer would also have a choice of who he buys his electricity from and how much he is going to be charged for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third question relates to the small non-contestable residential household customers who are still being supplied by SP Services.&nbsp; This segment represents about one-quarter of Singapore's total electricity consumption.&nbsp; Every week, some of our residents come to us at our meet-the-people session because they could not pay their electricity bills and are in danger of having the supplies cut off.&nbsp; To supply to these small consumers, SP Services buy at the vesting price of $94.24 per megawatt hour.&nbsp; Compared to the present pool clearing price and the wholesale price, this now seems very high.&nbsp; Can SP Services take advantage of the fall in prices?&nbsp; And, when can the small consumers expect to enjoy lower electricity rates?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The CPFTA is intended as a shield to protect consumers and not a sword to cut down the retailers.&nbsp; The business community does not need to worry that the Act will affect their business.&nbsp; In fact, CPFTA will help improve the business environment by weeding out errant business practices and dishonest traders who give the industry a black name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the new legislation, business associations should play an important role in educating their members and work with<p align=left>Column: 1518<p> them to ensure that their practices do not break the law.&nbsp; I would like to know&nbsp;whether the Ministry has any plan to make the implementation of this legislation a success.&nbsp; What role would SPRING Singapore, the Retail Promotion Centre and the Singapore Tourism Board play in this area?&nbsp; What support would they provide to the retail and service sectors to educate the traders and facilitate the implementation of the CPFTA?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last year,&nbsp;during the Budget debate, I requested the Ministry to review the Hire Purchase Act to better protect the consumers.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry to give us an update.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to move on to travel services.&nbsp; Sir, the nature of travel has changed rapidly in the past few years.&nbsp; With the Internet, travellers have access to an unprecedented level of choices at even more competitive prices.&nbsp; In some ways, the balance, so to speak, has shifted towards the consumers.&nbsp; But in other ways, we have not kept up with changes in the travel industry.&nbsp; One such area is the travel industry legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travel-related complaints consistently remain among the highest categories CASE receives.&nbsp; Local travel agents claim that they are just agents of overseas tour package suppliers when they sell travel packages here to avoid liability for non-performance by their overseas suppliers.&nbsp; On this issue of liability of travel agents, whether as the principal or non-principal agents, I found that the European Community has issued a directive providing consumers with one contract partner responsible for the execution of the contract.&nbsp; Moreover, the UK has implemented the directive via its "Travel Package, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992".&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to consider similar guidelines for the travel industry to protect the consumers.</p></P></span></div>					<p align=left>Column: 1519<p>				<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First, credit sales; second, conditional sales; and third, hire purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all three types, the merchant either supplies the credit himself or arranges for a finance company to supply the credit.&nbsp; I may add also a fourth category, called the "credit sales", where the credit is arranged by both the consumer and the merchant independently of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, all four types of consumer credit transactions are governed by different regulatory regimes.&nbsp; Credit sales and conditional sales are unregulated.&nbsp; Hire purchases are regulated mainly by the Hire Purchase Act under MTI.&nbsp; Credit card sales are regulated by MAS who exercises jurisdiction only over the banking institutions and, hence, the credit&nbsp;part of the transactions rather than the underlying sales transaction.&nbsp; The result is a confusing array of rules and regulations applying to different types of transaction and inconsistent protection to consumers.&nbsp; For example, consumers who wish to select the best form of credit to purchase the consumer goods cannot make comparisons that are meaningful enough for them to make a decision.&nbsp; As such, they are, in fact, at the mercy of the merchants and there is unfair advantage at work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the UK and Australia, such regulations have been reformed.&nbsp; In fact, they have rationalised some of these transactions so that the same regime applies to all three types of transactions.&nbsp; The areas that have been rationalised include linked-transactions and by this the sales and credit elements are conditional upon each other.&nbsp; They have also joint liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially important for<p align=left>Column: 1520<p> hire purchase where consumers may have only one agreement with the finance company.&nbsp; Some hire purchase agreements are not governed by the Hire Purchase Act and it&nbsp;contains exemption clauses which severely limits liability for delivery and condition of goods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, they also have similar regulatory regime to apply to all three types of consumer credits that include things like disclosure regime, method of calculating interest rates, restrictions on administrative default and penalty charges, advertising and marketing regime, etc.&nbsp; I suggest that the consumer credit laws be rationalised so that different parts of the consumer credit industry may compete on equal footing.&nbsp; The result would be a more efficient market and a much more level playing field for both the consumers, the merchants and finance companies at work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Singapore Branding and CASETrust</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Singapore brand is a key competitive advantage which will help us to differentiate ourselves from our low-cost neighbours and make an impact in the international arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Singapore Tourism Board&nbsp;also launched&nbsp;the&nbsp;Uniquely Singapore Branding experience exercise.&nbsp; That is product differentiation at work.&nbsp; In the past, Singapore used to be a shoppers' paradise and I note from Minister George Yeo's comment that tourists still do shop in Singapore because of the top brands that are in town and because we sell genuine goods.&nbsp; I say we build on this competitive advantage that we have.&nbsp; Whereas in other countries which are cheaper options, they may not have the assurance to the consumers of giving them genuine goods or, in fact, a return&nbsp;policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In Singapore we can build on our&nbsp;premium reputation of trust and focus on<p align=left>Column: 1521<p>areas like service delivery and product quality.&nbsp; In fact, on 1st March 2004, the&nbsp;Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) was implemented.&nbsp; We can actually&nbsp;build on that and develop certain nationally recognised trust marks to accredit good business practices for consumer confidence.&nbsp; In fact, under CASE, there is a programme called the CASETrust to develop a trust mark for consumer goods and services, in both brick and mortar as well as cyber store fronts.&nbsp; Let me declare my interests as the Vice-President of CASE and Chairperson of CASETrust Advisory Council.&nbsp; Both are non-profit organisations.&nbsp; CASETrust is a quality mark which stands for quality, trust and a&nbsp;"be sure, not sorry" policy.&nbsp; CASETrust accredits and promotes companies with good and transparent business practice and service delivery - accredited companies display the CASETrust mark&nbsp;at their store front and websites to enable consumers to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Together with IDA, CASETrust also developed Trustsg to handle the vetting of Internet security practices.&nbsp; By this, we hope to build a Singapore Branding for Internet trading.&nbsp; CASETrust and Trustsg are part of Singapore Branding.&nbsp; The development of these trust marks generates benefits for Singapore far beyond the promotion of any single product or label.&nbsp; The intangible value of Singapore Branding spills over into spheres and industries.&nbsp; CASETrust and Trustsg can be a pillar for Singapore Branding.&nbsp; I urge the Government to give greater support to the development of CASETrust and Trustsg as part of the Singapore Branding strategy.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Despite the impact of SARS last year, our&nbsp;tourism sector has actually bounced back and recovered very well through the joint efforts of both the private sector as well as STB. &nbsp;&nbsp; If we exclude Malaysian land arrivals, last year, we had 6.1 million visitors. For this year, STB aims to achieve 7.6 million visitor arrivals.&nbsp; This will be a 24% increase from last year if we succeed. These are very ambitious targets and all the more so because competition is intensifying.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: none; mso-list-change: '%1:3:0:.' 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan' 20040313T1015">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me just quickly spell out the four prongs of STB's strategy to achieve this objective.&nbsp; Firstly, to strengthen market promotion; secondly, to grow new visitor segments; thirdly, to develop compelling products; and, fourthly, the rebranding exercise.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let us come back to the first prong.&nbsp; Our key high growth markets are <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and ASEAN. Their fast-rising middle class together with the emergence of low-cost carriers, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon has alluded to earlier, means that there is a huge surge of potential travellers within a 7-hour flight radius. To pursue this, STB has opened new offices in <st1:City><st1:place>Medan</st1:place></st1:City>, <p align=left>Column: 1525<p><st1:City><st1:place>Jakarta</st1:place></st1:City>, Chennai, <st1:City><st1:place>Kuala Lumpur</st1:place></st1:City> and Ho Chi Minh City within the past 12 months alone. And we will open another two more regional offices over the next few months.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: none; mso-list-change: '%1:5:0:.' 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan' 20040313T1015">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a particularly important market for us. Outbound tourists from <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> are projected to increase six-fold between 2002 and 2020.&nbsp; And this number is estimated to grow up to 100 million annually. &nbsp; As Mr Ang Mong Seng said, we want to capture a slice of that pie.&nbsp; But we are not alone in vying for that slice. Just last month, the 12 EU-member countries were awarded the "approved destination" status by the Chinese government.&nbsp; And this means we need to compete with the rest of the world for Chinese visitors.&nbsp; Specifically, to tap the growing Chinese market, STB is taking a few steps.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will make it easier for Chinese tourists to come to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. We have relaxed our visa rules.&nbsp; &nbsp;We have lengthened the visa validity period for social visitors from three weeks to five weeks, and the period of stay from 14 days to 30 days.&nbsp; We will also make available more channels for visa applications in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. 43 travel agents, with more than 320 branches, are now able to facilitate the application of Multiple Journey Visas (MJV) for independent Chinese visitors. &nbsp; And STB also plans to increase the number of authorised travel agents to 60 by this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: none; mso-list-change: '5.%1:2:0:' 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan' 20040313T1015">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, we will step up marketing in Chinese regional cities in <st1:State><st1:place>Zhejiang</st1:place></st1:State>, <st1:State><st1:place>Fujian</st1:place></st1:State> and Yunan to build awareness for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. To reach out to the high spending PRC tourists and business visitors, STB has launched a promotion scheme with VISA for their Gold and Platinum credit card members. STB is doing the same for members of airlines' frequent flyer schemes.</p><p align=left>Column: 1526<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: none; mso-list-change: '5.%1:3:0:' 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan' 20040313T1015">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Third, we will also make <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> more visitor-friendly to Chinese tourists. STB will work with key agencies such as CAAS, LTA and the attraction operators to install more multi-lingual signages to help Chinese visitors get around. I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Low Thia Khiang that we do need to make it easier for them to move around in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We will encourage the hotels to provide more Chinese TV stations and Chinese in-room directories. To enable PRC visitors to enjoy more of what <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> has to offer, we will be introducing more value-for-money packages by bundling together more attractions.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I also take the point that, where possible, we need to lower entrance fees and the package fees.&nbsp; But I also hasten to add that at the end of the day, tourism is a business.&nbsp; We can lower fees but we must ensure that the businesses remain viable.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: none; mso-list-change: '%1:6:0:.' 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan' 20040313T1015">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is another country that presents vast opportunities for us. Indian visitors already rank among our top five highest spenders in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. We intend to attract a greater number of Indian visitors to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and encourage them to stay even longer by offering high quality tour packages. In the coming months, STB will be working with the travel industry in <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to introduce more travel products that offer fun, educational and leisure experiences and which will appeal to families.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To guide us in our tourism marketing efforts, STB has formed a Marketing Advisory Council comprising leading figures from Indian tourism, business, media and academic sectors.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: none; mso-list-change: '%1:7:0:.' 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan' 20040313T1015">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In May, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> will host the prestigious <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>International</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Indian</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Film</st1:PlaceName> <p align=left>Column: 1527<p><st1:PlaceType>Academy</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> awards. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the Bollywood equivalent of the Academy Awards.&nbsp; Over 400 celebrities and film-makers from <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and other parts of the world will gather in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to honour the biggest names in Bollywood. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Many of you may not be aware but Indian superstars like Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan have the same drawing power as Tom Cruise or Ricky Martin, among the millions of devoted Hindi-movie watchers.&nbsp; This event will be beamed to 167 countries and is expected to reach more than 250 million households, mainly in the Asian region. The marketing value of this event to Indian nationals is incalculable. And we will leverage on more of such platforms to market <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> in <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and in other parts of <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The second prong is to grow new visitor segments.&nbsp; I think Members are aware that we intend to grow new visitor segments among international patients, students and business travellers. STB has therefore launched roadshows marketing our healthcare and education services in key overseas markets like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reinforce our position as a premier destination for business meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions, STB has also launched a $15 million global campaign to target event and conference organisers. &nbsp;&nbsp; Just last October, we had 11,000 international Herbalife delegates visiting <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> at one of the largest-ever corporate meetings. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And we will work to attract more of such corporate meetings to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: none; mso-list-change: '%1:9:0:.' 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan' 20040313T1015">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The third prong is to develop compelling tourism products and attractions.&nbsp; We need to create, improve, remake and &nbsp; to widen the range of tourism products in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. &nbsp; &nbsp;STB is drawing up a tourism development roadmap in consultation with industry partners. This roadmap will serve as a blueprint for the <p align=left>Column: 1528<p>development of new attractions and infrastructure in the next 10 years. &nbsp; Minister George Yeo yesterday outlined the exciting plans to develop Sentosa and the <st1:place>Southern Islands</st1:place>. This roadmap will also look into remaking <st1:Street><st1:address>Orchard Road</st1:address></st1:Street> into one of the greatest shopping streets in the world, and to upgrade the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Singapore</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>River</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> precinct into a thriving waterfront promenade.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: none; mso-list-change: '%1:10:0:.' 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan' 20040313T1015">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from new attractions, anchoring high profile signature events will also be another key thrust of this roadmap. The aim is to have something exciting happening every weekend, all 52 weekends of the year. These will cover performance arts, cultural, music and sports events. &nbsp; For example, in October last year, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> hosted the &nbsp; &nbsp;F1 Powerboat Race 2003, an event watched by 70,000 spectators. Also, we had a stellar cast of celebrities like Mariah Carey who gathered in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> last month for the MTV Asia Awards 2004, and this was beamed to 1 billion viewers across <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>. STB will continue to bring in more of such events to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> so that we will become the definitive events capital of <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ms Irene Ng is right when she said yesterday that food is a very important attribute of Singaporeans. What makes us unique is not the individual dishes that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is famous for,&nbsp;but the fact that we have an astounding array of cuisine, served in a variety of settings, from posh restaurants all the way to your hawker centre in Tampines.&nbsp; &nbsp;STB will capitalise on this to promote interesting food tours and specially packaged food gifts. This will cover the full range that we have available. &nbsp; For example, the Peranakan culture is indigenous to <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, not just to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; &nbsp;But we can package it as one of the key diverse experiences which visitors to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> &nbsp; &nbsp;can experience through artefacts, demonstration of traditions and food.</p><p align=left>Column: 1529<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth prong is rebranding <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; &nbsp;You will recall that we used to have the slogan called "New Asia".&nbsp; This concept was, in fact, slightly ahead of its time in 1996.&nbsp; But we have been so successful in creating awareness of the transformation which is occurring in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place> that many other countries have leapt on to this same bandwagon.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it is now losing its edge as a distinctive theme. As the world evolves and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> adapts, we need to refresh our destination appeal and to highlight the unique <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> experience that our visitors can expect. This is the genesis of the "Uniquely Singapore" destination branding, which was launched a few days ago by Minister George Yeo.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng is right that there is nothing particularly unique about reverse bungee jumping on its own or bar top dancing or crazy horses. In fact, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we have few attractions which are purely unique in themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But what makes <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> truly unique is our ability to mix and match,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>to create unique diverse packages that appeal to people from diverse corners of the globe. Each tourist, whether he be from China, India or from the West, comes with a different expectation of Singapore. But we must ensure that we will package for him or her a unique package which will leave him or her emotionally fulfilled, but not fully satiated, because we want them to come back again.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>11.45 am</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uniquely Singapore" is therefore a unifying theme to capture the special mix of traditions, cultures and history of Singapore, and it is a platform to showcase different aspects of Singapore to different segments of visitors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, STB is working hard to customise and position ourselves for this. If we want to do this well, we need first to understand what&nbsp;our visitors want,<p align=left>Column: 1530<p> what does the market want. It will also require us to be sensitive to the nuances of languages, traditions and cultures of our target market. For instance, let us come back to China. The Chinese view Singapore as the "daughter who is married out of the family" - a different surname, a different household, making our separate way in the world, but still related. Chinese visitors, therefore, expect Singaporeans to show them a certain familiar warmth, the warmth that you reserve for relatives. This link, both at an emotional and historical level, must be kept in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago, I visited the Sun Yat Sen Villa. Whilst browsing, it struck me that this was the nerve centre of Sun Yat Sen's revolutionary movement in South East Asia. It played perhaps a small but a critical role in the creation of the modern Chinese nation. Consequently, we should not be surprised that Chinese visitors find this resonates with their history and at an emotional level for them. So we need to look in the whole of Singapore and find much more of such gems which will appeal and attract our visitors, wherever they come from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; India, for example. The Indian tourists like Singapore because they find that we are cosmopolitan, modern and have a clean and safe environment. We have an interesting and varied cuisine that suits the Indian tastebuds. Some of my Indian friends tell me that they want to come here because there is such a great variety of Indian restaurants, sometimes even greater than what you can find in any single city of India alone. They like our shops because there is such a wide range of jewellery and electronic products at competitive prices. Mohd Mustafa is a household name even in India. But beyond food and shopping, you must understand that Singapore captures the Indian imagination because they see Singapore as a working example of what a future modern Indian metropolis can be.<p align=left>Column: 1531<p> Historically, we used to be part of the East India Company,&nbsp;governed out of Calcutta. But, today, when an Indian comes to Singapore, he says, "Hey! I can do that back home." And that is why if you visit India today, if you go to Hyderabad or Bangalore, certain aspects of it are familiar, because they have modelled what we have in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Uniquely Singapore" branding platform is therefore a very important initiative and one in which there will be controversy. For instance, I know that there has been some discussion in the Chinese press that our Chinese translation for the brand name - so far, I think, it is called&nbsp; 如 此 独 特 新 加 坡 <i>(ru ci&nbsp;du te&nbsp;xin jia po)</i> -&nbsp;does not have emotional impact.&nbsp; And I will say, yes, this is just a working example, a work-in-progress, and we will certainly seek the opinions of the Chinese press as well as the Chinese intelligentsia to come up with a label that resonates with the Chinese. I promise this House we will not create another "Hungarian Ghost Festival"!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning next to the comments of Ms Irene Ng and Mr Ahmad Khalis on social values, I agree with them that as we step up efforts to promote tourism, we must not lose our values, and we must not lose our compass. There was an article that Professor Richard Florida wrote, entitled "The Rise of the Creative Class". This was reviewed in the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> and also in the <i>Straits Times</i> recently. His research found that cities which are able to embrace diversity&nbsp;are able to attract and foster a bigger creative class.&nbsp; These are key drivers in a knowledge-based economy. The larger lesson for us in Singapore is that we need to shift our mindset so that we can be more tolerant of diversity. To achieve this, we have begun to take small but important steps to signal that we need a new respect for diversity and openness to<p align=left>Column: 1532<p> ideas. So these examples that the Members cited, eg, night spots to open 24-hours, bar-top dancing, and bungee jumping, are just part of that signalling process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, the International Advisory Council for Tourism in Singapore fed back to us. And they said, "You know, the problem for Singapore is that Singapore is so middle-of-the-road that it is in danger of being bypassed; the cheese has moved on for Singapore."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that we do need to be bolder, and allow experimentation at the edges. But we will ensure that even as we do so, there are sufficient safeguards to minimise any domestic social impact or erosion of moral standards. For example, the 24-hour licensing for night-clubs only applies to clubs that are located within designated zones, away from residential areas.&nbsp; While there is some flexibility in censorship for plays and cabarets, these events ultimately have a limited reach, and we will ensure that they do not offend racial, linguistic and religious sensitivities. We will continue to have safeguards, such as artistic merit requirements, setting of minimum age limits, restrictions on location, as well as compliance with rules on advertising and promotion. We want to be a family-centred attraction, but we want to be one with the full spectrum of attractions which can appeal and address different needs, different tastes. We need to learn to live and let live, and to accept that different people will have different tastes, different strokes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to the issue of market liberalisation in the electricity market, brought up by Mr Ong Kian Min.&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much progress so far. We separated the grid, which is a natural monopoly, from the competitive power generation and retail components. Starting from July 2001, we began retail competition in phases. We set up a real-<p align=left>Column: 1533<p>time wholesale electricity market in January 2003, and introduced vesting in January 2004 to curb market power of the generation companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcome so far has been positive. Within a short span of two to three years, 70% of our electricity market is contestable. Competition has incentivised the generation companies to install more efficient gas plants, which have resulted in significant reduction in the wholesale price of electricity. Using gas plants is only the first step. The generation companies are still looking for other technologies and squeezing productivity gains in order to stay competitive. In the long term, this will put, we hope, a downward pressure on prices and it can only be good for consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is critical in a competitive market is that we must allow price signals to come through, unimpeded by regulatory interventions or the exercise of market power by players. Price level must rise when supply runs short, because this signals the need for new investments. Similarly, price level must fall in a market with excess supply, and this signals the need to trim capacity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min commented that the introduction of vesting has resulted in the wholesale price of electricity falling by about 10%. It appears that this may not have benefited all large consumers, and a lot of people are asking themselves why.&nbsp; When consumers began negotiating contracts with electricity retailers in 2003, they had several choices. They could opt for a contract where vesting credits and debits were passed on to them, in other words, a variable contract. Or they could opt for fixed price contracts that gave certainty. Or they could opt to buy directly from the wholesale electricity pool. There are three options. And the option that you choose is one which each company has to make on commercial considerations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1534<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the contestable companies, 50% opted to buy from the wholesale market, and today they are enjoying the benefit of the lower wholesale price at the pool. However, those who chose the contracts indexed to vesting today are bearing the cost of the vesting debit pass-through. I want to emphasise it is not vesting per se that caused a price increase for these companies. Vesting does not mandate the pass-through of these debits to the customers. It is up to the customers and the retailers to negotiate the terms of the contract on a commercial basis, and&nbsp;whether or not they accept the pass-through is something for them to decide, not for EMA to stipulate. Consumers must shop around for the best deal in a competitive market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of companies caught with higher electricity bills have approached us for help. I would state that it would not be right for EMA to intervene in commercial contracts entered into on a commercial basis - willing buyer, willing seller basis. But EMA has approached the electricity retailers to see whether they would be prepared to be flexible, and some retailers have indeed been flexible. With the correct pricing signals from the pool, companies will negotiate future contracts with the competitive wholesale price as a reference point. They can then decide which retailer offers the most competitive package, or opt to buy from the pool at the wholesale price, which is currently cheaper but potentially more volatile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question Mr Ong raised was whether there was adequate market information. I agree with him absolutely that education and timely sharing of information&nbsp;are invaluable. We need to be as transparent as possible in order for a market to function. Companies were informed by EMA about vesting in early 2003, and they were briefed by retailers on the types of contracts that were available and the implications of these <p align=left>Column: 1535<p>contracts. EMA also conducted several seminars to address concerns raised in November 2003 by consumers about the contracts they had entered into. But more can be done, and we will be improving the level and quantity of communication between all the stakeholders in the electricity market. EMA is going to review the quantity to be vested in 2005, and I have asked EMA to ensure that any revisions will be announced by the third quarter of this year, so that all stakeholders will have adequate time to prepare their contracts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would now turn to the Member's third question on the impact on non-contestable small households. This group of consumers faces a very different set of economics in the electricity market. While there are many of us, about 1.1 million small accounts, we only comprise 25% of total electricity sales. Individual households do not have the same bargaining strength to secure favourable retail prices from the electricity retailers.&nbsp; It is also more expensive for electricity retailers to service the hundreds and thousands (actually 1.1 million) of small individual customer accounts, compared to a single customer using a large amount of electricity. &nbsp;Hence, we need to do this very carefully. The market design must allow small customers to aggregate demand so that they will achieve economies of scale as well as bargaining clout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMA is working on the details of opening the remaining segment of the market to contestability. This approach is likely to be an opt-in voluntary system and allow for demand aggregation. The system will need to be developed, rigorously tested, and tried out for smooth roll-out to the general population. Full implementation is likely to take place about three to four years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1536<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong asked whether ordinary households can be allowed to buy from the pool. I think this would be very risky because of the volatility. You just need one large buy to wipe out all your potential savings. I think&nbsp;the more important point is that in the liberalised electricity market, households have already benefited, as electricity tariffs have come down by 9.5% compared to December 2001, keeping oil prices constant. At the same time, the system of SP Services buying at vesting price for households protects them against undue fluctuations in pool prices. Remember, the vesting price is set to recover the total cost of operations of the generation plant using the most economically efficient technology available. In this way, consumers are already benefiting from the presence of new and improved technology as and when it comes along.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will quickly move on to consumer protection. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked what roles SPRING, STB and the Retail Promotion Centre would play in making the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act a success. I think Members are aware that the Act was passed in November 2003 and came into force on 1st March this year. STB and SPRING have worked very closely with the various business chambers and associations</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Mr Yeo asked for an update on the Hire Purchase Act.&nbsp; This was announced at last year's Committee of Supply debate.&nbsp; MTI has established a Taskforce to gather industry and consumer feedback, and to advise on the review.&nbsp;

I take note of Ms Penny Low's comment that the various consumer credit transactions in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> are regulated under various pieces of legislation.&nbsp; We would need to study this very carefully to ensure that the relevant legislation is carefully crafted before we make a decision on whether to rationalise or consolidate them, because we have to take its impact on businesses into consideration.&nbsp; The Hire Purchase Act Review Taskforce is currently looking into the pros and cons of linking credit and sales transactions, and providing for joint liability of merchant and financier.&nbsp; It will take into consideration Ms Penny Low's inputs before putting up its recommendations.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo asked about guidelines for the travel industry.&nbsp; The STB is working with the National Association of Travel Agents (NATAS) to implement a Code of Business Practice among travel agents, and this will be closely aligned to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. &nbsp; In cases of commercial disputes with travel agents, consumers&nbsp; may take up the case with NATAS or CASE, and where necessary, to the Small Claims Tribunal in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Ms Penny Low that the value of trust marks&nbsp;is critical for the Singapore Brand name and this is an area which we would support the various agencies out there who are issuing trust marks and which would encourage and promote better behaviour by vendors in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me quickly touch on corporate social responsibility.&nbsp; The first duty of a company is to be viable and to make money for its shareholders.&nbsp; But we also<p align=left>Column: 1538<p> expect companies to do so in a way which is socially responsible to its workforce and also take into&nbsp;account its impact on the environment. &nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a small densely packed country.&nbsp; It is one in which the company's behaviour beyond the economic realm has&nbsp;great impact.&nbsp; Secondly, as a country which trades with the rest of the world, we are also very mindful that we do not want to allow CSR to become an excuse for the erection of non-tariff barriers.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all that, I want to remind this House that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> actually has an excellent record in CSR, way before the term was coined.&nbsp; We have shown the world what tripartism means, that employers, unions and Government working together can ensure a viable business model in which workers' interest are cared for and in which the environment is looked after.&nbsp; So for those who are asking how much we have done, I would say we have already done a lot.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Secondly, the Member asked about our companies going overseas.&nbsp; The International Labour Organization (ILO) establishes international labour standards, and the level of adoption varies from country to country.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in helping our companies invest abroad, IE Singapore will provide market and country information, including the labour laws and practices of the country.&nbsp; And we would encourage our companies to adopt good corporate social responsibility practices, because it will enable them to gain greater trust and acceptance as they establish themselves overseas.&nbsp; At the end of the day, this is about enlightened self-interest.&nbsp; And we encourage our companies who behave so well in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to behave the same way overseas.&nbsp; That is part of the Singapore brand name and the value to a <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> company overseas.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the initiatives to promote it in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. &nbsp; I would say again, back to my earlier<p align=left>Column: 1539<p> answer, because we have already been practising this, and we have been practising it successfully through a tripartite model, we do not believe that legislation is necessary at this point in time.&nbsp; But I would encourage CASE, the NTUC as well as the Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility to continue their good work to raise the profile of CSR in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think with growing awareness and advocacy, I am confident that more companies in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> will appreciate the need to be socially responsible and to be environmentally conscious as they make money for their shareholders.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As much as we hope to keep training, skills retraining on them, you may have to accept that it is sometimes very difficult to teach old dogs new tricks.&nbsp; As such, I have seen so many of these people and their spouses seeking for an opportunity to be financially independent by being hawkers, small storekeepers and peddlers.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Cultural Ecosystem</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Miss Penny Low</B>:&nbsp; Sir, last year, MITA announced its plan to build a cultural capital by harnessing our artistic talents and cultural resources.&nbsp; We hope to better position ourselves for greater economic benefits and improved quality of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we know that art for art's sake does not work, art for money's sake will also have limited success.&nbsp; To fulfill MITA's vision of a cultural capital, we will need to first identify a cultural ecosystem that works for Singapore.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially, culture can be thought of as an overall ecosystem.&nbsp; Within it, there are numerous eco niches that affect each other and alter the fabric of the culture over time.&nbsp; For example, in the film industry, a good movie could only be made if you have good cinematographers, good&nbsp;<I>son&nbsp;et lumiere</I> (ie, sound and lights)&nbsp;team that captures the mood, good post production team that will create movie magic, as well as a good marketing team to promote the film itself.&nbsp; Of course, we will need good funding for any good films to come about.&nbsp; The lack of resources in any of these areas may undermine the economic potential of any good film and, obviously, the marketplace with its regulatory and cultural framework may also affect the success of the film.&nbsp; For example, the film "The Temptation of Christ" was a hit in some countries but a flop in others.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if his team has made any attempt to identify<p align=left>Column: 1545<p> the environmental factors like resources that feed into the system, the species that compete for the resources and growth, the systems lifecycle and eco niches, including the parasites and scavengers that will return material resources to the ecosystem itself, and their symbiotic relationship.&nbsp; I believe that understanding this will help us gain systematic knowledge of how things work naturally, and introduce specific policies to help nurture the cultural ecosystem and bring us closer to the vision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, these interventions do not refer only to fiscal or regulatory measures on the cultural scene alone.&nbsp; In fact, trends and policies affecting education, labour movement, technological development, philanthropy, capital infrastructure, consumer behaviour, urbanisation and the economy will have an effect on the content and structure, quality and quantity, as well as the creativity of the Singapore cultural fabric.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether these elements have been examined and whether the Ministry has also mapped out what affects what, whether we have also identified the pillars of our cultural ecosystem and, if so, what are they, and how does the Minister intend to allocate the budget to this end.&nbsp; I understand that a big portion of last year's budget went into the redevelopment of the National Library.&nbsp; Is this a key pillar that deserves such a big budget allocation <I>vis-a-vis</I> the needs for other cultural sectors?&nbsp; Ultimately, the success also depends on our pool of creative talent and employment opportunities.&nbsp; What efforts have been made to groom, attract and retain creative talents?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

He is a 10-time Grammy Award winner known for his vocal innovations and for being a classical conductor.&nbsp; When he was here, he teamed up first with Jeremy Monteiro, our local jazz musician;&nbsp;secondly, with our local percussion band named the Tribal Tide; and the finale he teamed up with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I must confess that&nbsp;I have never heard of the Tribal Tide before that performance.&nbsp; But I was very impressed at our local level of outstanding funky fusion rhythm and by the fact that they could hold their own against the versatile voice of Bobby McFerrin.&nbsp; Jeremy Monteiro was also, as usual, a joy to listen to.&nbsp; I am a great fan of jazz, so it was very good to see him improvising with Bobby McFerrin.&nbsp; That night, I was very proud of our Singaporean musicians.&nbsp; The show brought home to me how far Singaporeans have come on the arts stage, and how they deserve to be given a greater profile in the local media especially.&nbsp; When I read&nbsp;the <I>Straits Times</I> review of the concert, there was only a passing mention of our local musicians, and it was almost totally all on Bobby McFerrin.&nbsp; I find that it does not do service to our local talents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, such collaborations between global and local talents help to lift the <p align=left>Column: 1547<p>profile of our local artistes and then to the outside world and also to Singaporeans.&nbsp; It also shows our edge in Singapore as the place where we can find the best fusion of the East and the West.&nbsp; We should also encourage more such collaborations between our local and global talents to make a name in the arts on the world stage.&nbsp; Similarly, when our artistes go overseas, they should receive our support, especially in the local media.&nbsp; I am happy to note that our drama group, Wild Rice, was a hit when it performed the Singapore version of Animal Farm in New Zealand recently.&nbsp; The International Development Unit of the National Arts Council provides financial support, including International Grant and the International Collaboration Grant.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister how many arts groups have received such support last year and how much was disbursed through these grants, and whether MITA will be spending more on these grants.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister what more can MITA do to help our artistes to expand their external wing and make a name for themselves and for Singapore.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, the arts and culture industry is a relatively new <p align=left>Column: 1548<p>industry in Singapore.&nbsp; As such, not many Singaporeans are aware of its employment opportunities.&nbsp; Many young Singaporeans also do not have ambitions to pursue a full-time career in this industry.&nbsp; This situation is further worsened due to the relatively small market size in Singapore which does not provide much opportunity and jobs for our people.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to learn that the Ministry is planning to develop a creative industry where exciting jobs will be created for Singaporeans.&nbsp; I support this initiative, and believe there are lots of potential in venturing into the creative arena.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, before we embark on plans to develop the creative industry, we must identify strategic or niche areas where Singaporeans can support a sustainable cultural ecosystem.&nbsp; If arts and culture are still regarded as a liability, their potential to provide employment opportunities will be severely curtailed.&nbsp; Thus, we need to expand the market size of our arts and culture industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we should have more extensive outreach to increase the level of participation of arts and culture activities in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we should step up our marketing efforts to profile our arts and cultural groups to the world market.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

While I support the exercise to make us leaner and meaner, I certainly hope that the Minister will ensure that the Esplanade's programme will not in any way be restrained or constrained by the cuts in expenditure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the cost-cutting will not be passed on to concert-goers&nbsp;in the form of more expensive tickets or a pull back in service delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for a generation of Singaporeans, they remember taking walks along Elizabeth Walk with their family, or playing a round of police-and-thief at the old National Theatre grounds, or taking a roller-coaster ride at Kallang Park.&nbsp; Our next generation of Singaporeans will remember their time at the Esplanade, either as a participant at the Youth Festival or just plain enjoying a world-class performance in the evening at the Esplanade with close friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I raised the cost of the Esplanade at last year's COS, but concede that the benefits to our people and, more than that, to the generations to come will be worthwhile.&nbsp; I hope that the cost-recovery bogeyman will stay clear of this crucial stage of the Esplanade's development as one of Singapore's and, indeed, one of the world's icon for the performing arts.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Loh Meng See--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Members who have spoken on the subject of the arts, cultural capital and design.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would like to respond to Mr Seng Han Thong, Chairman of the GPC for Information, Communications and the Arts, who asked for a progress report on&nbsp;the Renaissance City project, which was started four years ago with a budget of about $50 million.&nbsp; The Renaissance City project&nbsp;aimed to establish Singapore as a city for the arts and to provide cultural ballast for nation building.&nbsp; Its main thrust is to develop the software to complement the new and the existing hardware or infrastructure that we have invested in.&nbsp; The budget was deployed for talent and audience development to create a vibrant arts and cultural scene, and to support the internationalisation of our arts and culture practitioners.&nbsp; To this end, MITA and the National Arts Council initiated new grants and training schemes to boost the professionalism and capabilities of our arts companies.&nbsp; NAC enhanced its arts education programmes and launched an arts marketing and outreach programme.&nbsp; To stimulate greater interest in the arts, key festivals, competitions and arts events were upgraded or created, such as the Singapore Arts Festival, Museum Fest and the Arts Month.&nbsp; For internationalisation, we assisted Singapore artistes and performers to gain wider international exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Renaissance City project has brought about a 26% increase in the number of arts groups in Singapore,&nbsp;from 435 to 549 arts groups, and a 25% increase&nbsp;in the number of arts and cultural events in Singapore, from 4,127 to<p align=left>Column: 1551<p> 5,158, over the last four years.&nbsp; A survey also showed that the percentage of our population who attended arts events rose from 15% to 27%.&nbsp; In 2002, more than one million people attended arts events.&nbsp; Last year, there was a slight dip, but that was probably because of the disruption caused by SARS.&nbsp; But it is clear that our arts audience has grown dramatically.&nbsp; More importantly, the Renaissance City project has deepened the interest, appreciation and understanding of our arts audience.&nbsp; The Renaissance City project has also boosted the standing and appreciation of our arts talents and their works at home and abroad.&nbsp; For example, Singapore artistes have been invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, Germany's Documenta, Shanghai's Art Festival and the Singapore Dance Theatre has gone as far as Mexico to perform in the&nbsp;Cervantino&nbsp;Festival.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Renaissance City project has certainly helped to make our arts scene more fun and vibrant.&nbsp; It has contributed to making Singapore more interesting and attractive to live and work, both for our Singaporeans and also for the international visitors and talent whom we hope to attract here.&nbsp; The challenge is to go beyond this achievement of the Renaissance City project.&nbsp; Last year, the Economic Review Committee identified the creative industry as a new and promising sector of our economy.&nbsp; MITA's vision is to both broaden and deepen our cultural assets and to grow the contribution of the creative industry from the current 3% of our GDP to 6% of the GDP by the year 2012.&nbsp; To achieve this vision, Singapore will need many creative talents, including people talented in the performing and visual arts, design, creative media and&nbsp;information technology.&nbsp; Today, our young creative talent can pursue degree programmes in the arts-related discipline at our tertiary institutions.&nbsp; For instance, NUS offers <p align=left>Column: 1552<p>degree programmes in music, theatre studies, architecture and industrial design.&nbsp; NTU offers degree programmes in mass communications, and will soon start offering design and media programmes.&nbsp; The Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and&nbsp;LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts provide diploma and degree courses in the arts.&nbsp; Polytechnics also offer design and media diploma courses.&nbsp; However, there is a gap at the pre-tertiary level.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>12.30 pm<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, students with an interest in the arts can take arts and music electives at "O" and "A" levels. But, this is only available at a few selected secondary schools and junior colleges.&nbsp; Often, the students face a conflict between their arts and academic commitments. There is no dedicated development path for those who have interest and show early promise in the arts. In 2002, the Committee on Reviewing JC and Secondary School Education recommended that independent schools specialising in sports, mathematics, science and the arts would enhance our education landscape.&nbsp; Last year, the Remaking Singapore Committee recommended the setting up of an arts school at the secondary level. MITA followed up by appointing a Committee to study the desirability and feasibility of a pre-tertiary arts school. Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Loh Meng See and Ms Indranee Rajah asked for a report on the progress of this study.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp; the Committee has concluded its study and given me a thorough briefing on its findings and recommendations.&nbsp; The Committee concluded that a pre-tertiary arts school was desirable and feasible.&nbsp; It has recommended that MITA establish an Independent Arts School for students aged between 13 and 18.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am pleased to announce that MITA agrees with the Committee's recommendation to set up an Independent Arts School to nurture our young talents who have a<p align=left>Column: 1553<p> passion for the arts.&nbsp; I will summarise the Committee's key recommendations. But first let me point out that in its study, the Committee consulted groups of students, parents, principals, teachers, artists and creative professionals, and many other stakeholders.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On curriculum content, the Committee recommended an integrated six-year arts and academic programme for 13 to 18-year-olds.&nbsp; The School will offer a range of academic subjects, including mathematics, science, languages, literature and the humanities.&nbsp; So it is not just about arts.&nbsp; Together with the academic subjects, students will be exposed to the various art forms to inculcate a multi-disciplinary understanding of the arts.&nbsp; They will then focus on at least one arts specialty in either visual arts, dance, theatre or music. Given Singapore's multi-cultural society and Asian heritage, the students will also have the opportunity for cross-cultural learning.&nbsp; The School will be staffed by well-qualified and experienced teachers, particularly those with teaching expertise in the arts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee recommended that the Arts School provide learning outside the classroom. The students should have the opportunity to learn from artists and other creative professionals and to participate in projects and performances. These activities will enable students to learn the commercial aspects of the arts and creative industries. This recommendation clearly addresses Ms Indranee Rajah's call for more practical oriented courses to enable the graduates to better cope with the business challenge of an artistic career.&nbsp; I agree with her.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also recommended that students graduate from the Arts School with an International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma. The Committee was of the view that the IB offers a flexible <p align=left>Column: 1554<p>curriculum emphasising critical thinking, breadth of knowledge and inter-cultural understanding that best suits both arts and academic learning. The IB diploma is a widely recognised qualification for university admission. The Arts School graduates will be able to apply for admission to NUS and NTU, and overseas universities.&nbsp; For example, Harvard University and other Ivy League universities in the US accept the IB diploma.&nbsp; Graduates who choose to further their studies outside the arts would also be able to do so with their IB diploma.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee recommended that the Arts School be "permeable" with mainstream schools. This means that students of the Arts School who subsequently choose not to pursue arts specialisation can rejoin a mainstream school. Conversely, secondary students from mainstream schools could apply to the Arts School and be admitted if they fulfill the academic and artistic requirements.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Committee recommended that the Arts School be located in the arts district because of the potential for synergy between the school and the rich resources already available in the arts district. These include the new National Library and the new Drama Centre, the new NAFA, LaSalle and the Singapore Management University (SMU) campuses.&nbsp; We also have the Singapore Art Museum and Asian Civilisations Museum in the arts district.&nbsp; In addition, NAC houses many arts groups under the Arts Housing Scheme within the district.&nbsp; The school will benefit greatly from the proximity to the artists and institutions and other organisations that have an active interest in the arts. We envisage their interaction and artistic collaboration will spark off a buzz.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my Ministry agrees with the Committee's recommendation that MITA <p align=left>Column: 1555<p>set up an Arts School.&nbsp; We will carefully study its detailed recommendations on the character, features and funding of the school.&nbsp;&nbsp; We note the recommended target to establish the school in 2007.&nbsp; We will release the full report of the Committee later this month and set up an implementation task force.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp; I believe this is a significant step to strengthen arts education in Singapore.&nbsp; The Arts School will offer an additional option for our students to approach artistic and creative careers.&nbsp; It will groom talents for our arts, culture and creative industries. The Arts School will add diversity to our education landscape and offer young Singaporeans who are artistically talented a new pathway to develop and achieve their full potential. I am confident that the Arts School will contribute to the next phase of our social, cultural and economic development.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I now turn to Miss Penny Low who spoke about the importance of looking at arts development from an ecosystem perspective.&nbsp; I agree with her.&nbsp; In trying to promote the arts, we have to understand that there is a very complex value chain and there are many people contributing to the value chain.&nbsp; I would rather not use those other descriptions that she had used so vividly to describe people who actually contribute to the value chain in growing our arts and creative industries.&nbsp; Of course, in the process, we have encountered, within this value chain, that there are big players and there are small players but they are all important players and they all contribute to creating values for the arts and creative industries.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry, together with Media Development Authority, National Arts Council, Design Singapore Council will certainly study the complexity of this value chain and try to engage every player <p align=left>Column: 1556<p>along the way, regardless of whether they are big players or small players - whether they are full-time engaged in the arts or they are only contributing as a part-time participant.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low also asked whether we have got our priorities right by spending so much money on the library development because she noted that a large chunk of the budget has gone towards&nbsp;our library programme.&nbsp; I just like to point out to her that what we spend on developing our library is not at the expense of our other programmes.&nbsp; The budget for the library was already approved some years ago as part of our Library 21 programme.&nbsp; We should bear in mind that libraries are a very important part of our cultural capital.&nbsp; Libraries today are not just places where we go and borrow a book. Our National Library has evolved into a major, social and cultural institution where it provides people with access to information, help people to update themselves with what is going on in the world of science, technology, medicine, culture, arts and social and economic developments, both here in Singapore and throughout the world. We do have to invest on our libraries and we will continue to do so to ensure that our libraries continue to serve Singaporeans in the best interest.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I turn to Ms Irene Ng who spoke about the pride that she felt when she saw Singaporeans being able to collaborate with world-class musicians or performers. She asked what else we can do&nbsp;to help our own artistes reach out to the global stage.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, many of our Singapore artists and performers are already beginning to make an impact on the global stage.&nbsp; Right now, let me give her just five examples of how MITA hopes to develop or help our artistes to develop the external wing of Singapore arts.</p><p align=left>Column: 1557<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, MITA has signed cultural Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with countries such as China, India and Ireland and cities like Paris and Melbourne.&nbsp; These MOUs allow our artistes to participate in our MOU partners' art festivals and cultural events. For example, through NAC's MOU with Arts Victoria in Australia, two works involving Singaporeans and Australian artistes have been co-commissioned for this year's Singapore Arts Festival.&nbsp; One of the works will be performed in the Melbourne Arts Festival.&nbsp; So it gives an opportunity for our people to collaborate with the Melbourne artistes and to jointly present their work.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Singapore Arts Festival Commission's productions that involved both local and foreign artistes working together.&nbsp; One example is last year's "The Global Soul:&nbsp;The Buddha Project", which was a collaboration between local company, Theatreworks, and renowned talents from Japan, Sweden, France, Thailand, Korea and China. The production subsequently toured Germany, Switzerland and Holland with great success.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, NAC provides funding under various schemes to promote artists internationally.&nbsp; Last year, NAC funded 74 projects at $364,000.&nbsp; For example, the International Touring Grant, mentioned by Ms Irene Ng, funded Dr Adrian Chok's new media work "Gulliver's Box" at Arts Electronica Festival in Linz,&nbsp; Austria.&nbsp; NAC supported violinist Kam Ning's&nbsp;performance in South Korea.&nbsp; It also funded the participation of three Singapore artists, Tan Swie-Hian, Heman Chong and Francis Ng, at the prestigious Venice Biennale 2003.&nbsp; As noted by Ms Ng, this year, NAC supported a group of Singapore artistes, including Wild Rice and their production of "Animal Farm" at the New Zealand International Arts Festival as a special Singapore Season.&nbsp; In the coming year, NAC intends to do more to<p align=left>Column: 1558<p> showcase Singapore talents on the international stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, the Esplanade, besides staging events featuring collaboration between Singaporeans and international performers, also organise the Asian Arts Mart in Singapore.&nbsp; This event showcases ready-to-tour works by Asian artists, including Singapore artists, to some 200-250 festival directors, agents and presenters from all over the world.&nbsp; Our arts group, such as Singapore Dance Theatre and Wild Rice had secured engagement in Australia, New Zealand, UK and US through this Asian Arts Mart.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, NAC also regularly engages international cultural network such as the International Society for the Performing Arts and the International Federation of Arts Council and Culture Agencies and foreign arts media to raise awareness and interest in Singapore arts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I next turn to Dr Tan Boon Wan who asked for an update on our effort to develop cultural capital. Dr Teo Ho Pin also asked what are the plans to expand the arts and cultural industry.&nbsp; Sir, cultural capital is the accumulated sum of our cultural resources, national identity, heritage, creative and artistic capability,&nbsp;in other words, it is our cultural DNA.&nbsp; It inspires new ideas and expressions, enabling Singaporeans to bring out a distinctively Singapore feel in our lifestyle, our products and our services.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a crowded globalised market, we need to differentiate our products and services to create a niche for Singapore. Cultural capital is therefore not just a key driver of the creative industries, comprising arts, design and media,&nbsp;it also exerts a pervasive influence on everything Singaporean.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural capital takes time to build up.&nbsp; So are we on track with our aims and goals?&nbsp; The answer is yes, but we have not arrived.&nbsp; As a young nation, we have <p align=left>Column: 1559<p>some way to go before we can attain first-world standards in the depth and breadth of our cultural capital.&nbsp; We are certainly enlarging our cultural capital and realising our vision of Singapore as a global city for the arts, as I have said earlier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>Today, Singapore, once described as a cultural desert, is already transformed.&nbsp; It is now a green oasis, not a desert.&nbsp; We have invested more than $1 billion in cultural assets such as museums, libraries, concert halls, and many other infrastructures and also much software in our cultural development since the 1989 Report of the Advisory Council for the Arts and Culture, and also the 2000 Renaissance City Project which I have mentioned earlier.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I had mentioned earlier, we are seeing growing arts audience at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore artists such as Tan Swee Hian, Ong Kim Seng and theatre-master Ong Keng Seng, have also gained international reputation.&nbsp; The Esplanade provides an exciting venue for the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, to perform their concerts and Singapore Dance Theatre to perform their ballets.&nbsp; We also offer a venue for recitals by our young musicians and staging of Singapore's musicals such as Dick Lee's "Forbidden City".&nbsp; The Esplanade also organises annual community festivals such as <I>Pasta</I> <I>Raya</I>, <I>Kalaa</I> <I>Utsavam&nbsp;</I> and <I>Huayi</I>, as mentioned by the Chairman of the GPC earlier.&nbsp; These events involve local musicians, local performers and also attract many of our heartlanders.&nbsp; The Esplanade has also attracted international attention.&nbsp; The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra&nbsp;performed in the Esplanade Concert Hall last Sunday.&nbsp; In fact, it asked to perform here because of the very favourable reviews since its inauguration.&nbsp; In the same week that the Vienna Philharmonic performed at the<p align=left>Column: 1560<p>Esplanade, we also have performance by the equally renowned London Symphony Orchestra, the Brazilian Minister for Culture and Grammy Award winner, Gilberto Gil and Jan Garberek, one of the world's top saxophonist.&nbsp; Such intensity of world-class and sold-out performances in a short spell of one week would have been unthinkable pre-Esplanade days.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, the Esplanade hosted the world premier of "I La Galigo" - a&nbsp;great Bugis epic from Sulawesi, depicting the creation and destruction of the Middle World.&nbsp; This production will go on to tour Europe and US.&nbsp; This year, NAC will also initiate a major visual arts event, called Seni Singapore.&nbsp; This will feature Singapore, Southeast Asian and Asian contemporary arts.&nbsp; It will be a prelude to a Singapore Biennale in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our cultural capital has certainly grown over the past decade and we are gaining international reputation for being an Asian, but cosmopolitan city, with multi-cultural resources and multi-lingual capability.&nbsp; MITA has begun to put in place the structures and platforms to support the creative industries.&nbsp; The Media Development Authority was formed in January 2003.&nbsp; Its charter is to develop Singapore as a global media city.&nbsp; In August 2003, Design Singapore Council was appointed to steer the national design agenda.&nbsp; MITA has also set up the Creative Industries Action Committee to facilitate inter-agency collaboration with key partners such as the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Manpower.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I have described, Sir, is only the beginning of efforts to grow the creative industries and to deploy our cultural capital and contribute to our economy.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform this House that the Government has committed new resources amounting to about $22 million over five years to reinforce existing programmes and to roll-out other creative<p align=left>Column: 1561<p> industry development strategy initiatives.&nbsp; This is on top of the $100 million Media 21 Fund which was announced in July last year.&nbsp; With this new resource, we believe that we can make an even greater impact in catalysing the growth of this promising sector.&nbsp; It is early days yet, and the journey is long.&nbsp; We will continue to work closely with industry players to sharpen our strategies and to harness the full potential of our creative sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked how can the arts and culture industry create jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Let me answer by way of an example.&nbsp; Last year, the Esplanade created job opportunities for nearly 15,000 local artistes and support staff.&nbsp; This is on top of their own staff of nearly 500 full-time and part-time employees.&nbsp; The local arts groups and companies, which stage events at the Esplanade, created jobs for actors, dancers, choreographers, script writers and composers.&nbsp; There were also jobs in theatre support and production, such as stage management, lightings, set and sound design, directing, producing and marketing, as well as those in front of house operations, such as ushering and ticket sales.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked how we can encourage younger Singaporeans to pursue careers in the creative industries.&nbsp; Today, our arts colleges and polytechnics are already offering a wide range of arts, design and media diploma courses, as I have mentioned earlier.&nbsp; These courses are always oversubscribed, suggesting that our young people are already keen on careers in the creative industries.&nbsp; As our arts, culture and other aspects of the creative industries grow, it will open up even more attractive and rewarding jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; These would be an added incentive for younger Singaporeans to seek careers in the creative industries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Arthur Fong asked whether as a result of budget cut, the Esplanade's<p align=left>Column: 1562<p> programming would suffer.&nbsp; I am glad to inform Mr Arthur Fong that the budget cut will not affect the Esplanade's programming in the coming year.&nbsp; The Esplanade hosted a total of 1,451 arts activities last year.&nbsp; This included 1,107 activities or events which were actually presented by the Esplanade itself.&nbsp; Next year, the company intends to build on the&nbsp;momentum by presenting up to 1,200 performing arts events, which is more than what they have done last year.&nbsp; Similarly, a total of 65 visual arts exhibitions were held at the Esplanade last year.&nbsp; This year, the Esplanade hopes to increase the number of exhibitions to 80.&nbsp; So, all in all, let me assure the Member that the Esplanade will continue with the momentum of its programmes and, in fact, where possible, it will&nbsp;improve the quality of the programmes that are being offered.&nbsp; He asked whether the budget squeeze will result in the cost being passed on to concert-goers or people attending performances.&nbsp; I am sure that the Esplanade management is aware of the need to price their tickets at a reasonable and affordable level, depending on the quality and the level of the performances that they are presenting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See spoke about the importance of design.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Loh Meng See wholeheartedly that good designs will command premium pricing.&nbsp; In August 2003, MITA formed the Design Singapore&nbsp;Council to develop the design cluster.&nbsp; This is a multi-agency initiative to implement three strategic thrusts:&nbsp; (a) to grow demand for design; (b) nurture an integrated design cluster; and (c) catalyse an international design status.&nbsp; Let me elaborate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thrust, to grow demand for design, is to encourage Singapore companies, especially SMEs, to use design to develop distinctively Singaporean products and services for the global market.&nbsp; At the community level, the Council will support programmes to<p align=left>Column: 1563<p> nurture greater awareness of designs so that Singaporeans will better appreciate how designs can enhance quality of life at home,&nbsp;work and&nbsp;play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thrust, to nurture an integrated design cluster, aims to raise the standard of designs and the standing of designers and promote inter-disciplinary collaboration.&nbsp; The Council is studying the introduction of a "Designed in Singapore" mark for our products.&nbsp; Already, Creative Technology's Prodikey and Zen Portable Media Centre had won awards in the US-based International Consumer Electronics Show.&nbsp; Singaporean SCDA Architects was named Design Vanguard for 2003 by the influential American Institute of Architects.&nbsp; Song+Kelly 21, a successful home-grown fashion brand, has received world-wide accolades from key fashion institutions.&nbsp; Phunk&nbsp;Studio, a local graphic collective, has found a way to combine both east and west in their works and has gone all the way to New York.&nbsp; "Designed in Singapore" label for such products will enhance the standing of designers in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third thrust,&nbsp;to catalyse the International Design Centre status, aims to link Singapore with good designs, so that whenever people think of Singapore, they think of design.&nbsp; The Council will make Singapore attractive for local and international design organisations to hub here.&nbsp; MITA will continue to ensure that every effort is made to tap and nurture the design industry as an important contributor to our economy.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is the MUD, or Multi-User Dungeon, and MMOG, or Massive Multi-player Online Games, which take place in the virtual world where users from all over the world meet online in the game server to compete or collaborate with each other.&nbsp; The online gaming industry began in Korea in 1996 and Korea is now a global leader.&nbsp; Taiwan joined the game in 1999 and a report by market intelligence, Centre of<p align=left>Column: 1565<p> Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry, estimated the revenue generated from online gaming to have grown from US$14.5 million in 2000 to US$120 million in 2003.&nbsp; In fact, it has registered the highest growth rate of any entertainment industry.&nbsp; The online gaming industry in the Southeast Asian region was worth about US$533 million in 2002 and China is also beginning to catch on to the heat.&nbsp; In other words, the online gaming industry is set to boom and, according to Boston.internet.com, online gaming is a niche of the US$31.7 billion world-wide gaming market.&nbsp; The swift growth of online gaming is unprecedented.&nbsp; But the question is where is Singapore in this game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, many industries are constrained by our scarce land resource and limited market size.&nbsp; But in the virtual world, the world is our oyster.&nbsp; Singapore is well positioned to take advantage of that.&nbsp; First of all, we are well-versed in English and Chinese language, of which more than 80% of the online games in the international market have been translated into the two languages.&nbsp; Second, our PC ownership is one of the highest and our Internet connectivity is pervasive.&nbsp; Third, there is also a proliferation of Internet cafes over the last three years, which has made computer gaming quite common.&nbsp; Hence, the presence of Internet cafes could also form a good platform and a far more effective means for new games to be introduced to the market.&nbsp; We should leverage on our competitive advantage to be an online gaming hosting hub for and beyond this region.&nbsp; We could quickly expand our creative pool to provide excellent gaming content and a vibrant multi-media industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about having a multi-media academy to this end?&nbsp; Perhaps, IDA as well can play the role of a facilitator to help small players form a consortium so that we are able to compete on par in terms of financial muscle with very <p align=left>Column: 1566<p>established players in Korea and Taiwan.&nbsp; Perhaps, there could also be a review of the rules safeguarding the nerve centres of online gaming which is the LAN centres for Internet cafes.&nbsp; There could be ways to improve its vibrancy without compromising on the possible negative effects it might have on children.&nbsp; After all, research from the Gannett estimated world-wide spending in this industry to reach about US$150 billion by year 2005.&nbsp; We should not miss this boat.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It plans to get every Singaporean connected both locally and globally so as to build an e-inclusive society. As such, IDA has launched a number of initiatives to increase the IT literacy and IT skills of Singaporeans. Although over 200,000 Singaporeans have attended the national IT literacy programme, not many of them have been connected to the e-inclusive society. This is due to the lack of follow-up programmes to engage these Singaporeans in e-services, especially the e-Government services.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Community Development Councils provide an effective outreach platform to encourage the participation of e-Government services. I hope that IDA will consider working with the CDCs to build a virtual community. To many working Singaporeans, IT skills have become a necessity for employability. Many working Singaporeans or job seekers are still lacking in IT skills, especially in the areas of office automation, work group and Internet applications. So we must step up efforts and train more office Singaporeans to be IT competent as early as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions: (1) what targets have been set to develop an e-inclusive society in Singapore? (2) what are the plans of the Ministry to engage Singaporeans in e-Government services?

Dr Lee, do you like to reply?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B> Sir, I thank Miss Penny Low for a very comprehensive review of the potential of online gaming sector. IDA is looking into building up Singapore's attractiveness as a games exchange; in other words, the preferred location in Asia where enabling services, infrastructure, capability, combined to enable digital management, distribution and publishing of online games and game services to the region.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the results have been encouraging. Currently, there are at least six regional Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs). I am not quite sure how these games operate, but they are known as MMOGs. These are managed out of Singapore compared with only two in the year 2002. So, we have tripled the number of such MMOGs in the last one year. More importantly, there are more companies entering our games sector. Today, there are about 40 companies across the computer games value-chain. IDA will continue to obtain industry feedback and work with other promotional agencies to anchor Singapore as the preferred Games Exchange venue for online gaming in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement IDA's efforts, the Media Development Authority (MDA) will focus its attention on developing Singapore-based gaming companies capable of producing original, exportable and commercially successful gaming content. MDA has seed-funded at least four game development projects, and there is growing interest from the industry to create original game content which includes online game content. For publishing and distributing of online<p align=left>Column: 1569<p> games, MDA will work closely with IDA and the Internet service providers with regional reach, so that they can host and distribute completed games on their network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin asked how can we continue to produce high quality infocomm technology manpower so that we can sustain our competitiveness in this growing sector. I think that is a very important point, because without the availability of high quality infocomm technology manpower, we would have great difficulty making headway, especially now when we are faced with&nbsp;very strong competition from countries like India and&nbsp;China. As it stands, our institutes of higher learning, our universities&nbsp;and polytechnics already provide first-class infocomm technology training to our younger Singaporeans. This effort is complemented by specialised ICT training provided, eg, by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA runs a programme called Critical Infocomm Technology Resource Programme (CITREP). This is the main programme to help ICT professionals keep up to date. Since the launching of CITREP, a total of more than 15,000 infocomm professionals have been trained. Last year, IDA announced that it would be injecting another $13.5 million into CITREP to train another 5,000 infocomm professionals by March 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skills and technology areas that are supported under CITREP are reviewed regularly on a yearly basis to ensure that they are properly tuned to the industry's needs. It is very important that when we invest in such training, the training correctly reflects the needs of the industry, and that is what IDA is doing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we hone the skills of the infocomm professionals who are already in the industry, we need to ensure that there is a constant flow of bright, young <p align=left>Column: 1570<p>people to build up&nbsp;our strength and to enhance our competitiveness for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce that the Infocomm Development Authority will be setting up a new National Infocomm Scholarship, in partnership with the industry, to develop infocomm professionals and leaders for tomorrow. IDA is setting aside a budget of $9 million to offer up to 90 scholarships over five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven companies have joined IDA in this scholarship scheme. They are Computer Associates, Frontline, IBM, Microsoft, NCS, Oracle and SCS. I look forward to more ICT firms joining the scheme. This partnership with industry is important as it signals the commitment of industry partners. Their participation enhances the scholarship, as National Infocomm Scholars will be attached to local and overseas offices and laboratories of the industry partners. Scholars will gain valuable industry experience. They will also benefit from the mentorship of infocomm professionals from the industry itself. Scholars who perform well will also be sponsored to do their Master's degree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what are the targets set to evolve an e-inclusive society and how do we expect to engage Singaporeans in e-Government service, and cooperation between CDCs and IT training providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the training part. There are already two IDA programmes to provide basic and essential IT skills for the general public and for our workforce. First, the National IT Literacy Programme (NITLP) is a nation-wide training initiative to equip Singaporeans with basic computer and Internet skills, such as information retrieval, e-mailing and conducting online transactions. This training is offered in four official languages, and they are available over<p align=left>Column: 1571<p> 130 locations across the island. The training is provided by approved commercial training providers and also various community organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five CDCs are valuable partners of IDA in this programme. They help to reach out to the community to encourage more Singaporeans to sign up for IT training. Since its inception in 2001 till end January 2004, the programme has benefited more than 170,000 people. The infocomm literacy rate of Singaporeans aged 15 to 69 increased from 47% in year 2000 to 60% in year 2002. The programme is succeeding to enhance employability of lower skilled workers and build an e-inclusive society by enabling all our citizens to be able to use infocomm technology, beginning with the very basic level. If CDCs come across job seekers who can benefit from such training, we will be very glad to get recommendations from the CDCs and to help such job seekers to access the appropriate training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the next level, the Infocomm Competency Programme (ICP) equips workers with infocomm application skills for the digital workplace. Courses cover training in work processing, spreadsheet, presentation, data base management and web page design applications. Since its inception in 2001 till end January 2004, the ICP has supported 90,000 trainees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infocomm competency rate of Singapoeran workers aged 15 to 69 has also increased from 43% in the year 2000 to 60% in the year 2002. Likewise, if CDCs come across job seekers who can take advantage of this infocomm competency training, then please refer them to IDA and we will ensure that they get the relevant training to enhance their employability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point in terms of engaging Singaporeans in e-Government <p align=left>Column: 1572<p>services. Last July, the Government launched the E-Government Action Plan II. This is the Phase 2 of the project to expand and to enhance the e-Government services available to Singaporeans. This is a much more comprehensive phase of the project. Even more Government services will be made amenable for e-delivery to our citizens. It will take advantage of the fact that we are providing extensive training for all our citizens to enable them to use infocomm technology. As a two-pronged approach, more and more Government services will be made amenable for e-delivery to our citizens. More and more citizens will be enabled with the skill to use the latest infocomm technology to access such e-Government services. This is the way that we are approaching this effort to have a more e-inclusive society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan was concerned with computer security and piracy issues concerning information that is retained on the computer networks.

IDA operates the Singapore Computer <p align=left>Column: 1573<p>Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) to detect, resolve and prevent security related incidents on the Internet.

The Government is mindful of the need to protect personal information. Besides our Computer Misuse Act, we have sector specific legislation such as the Medical Registration Act, the Banking Act and the Income Tax Act to protect sensitive personal data, including a person's medical and financial record. We also have a model data protection code that is benchmarked against internationally accepted standards. The code is available for adoption by the private sector. It has been embedded in the TrustSg programme, which is a nation-wide trust mark initiative supported by the IDA, to build consumer confidence to transact online and to live an e-lifestyle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the Member also mentioned spam. Spamming is a worldwide problem, not just a problem peculiar to Singapore. Only the other day, I read in the newspapers that some American Internet Service Providers, like AOL and&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;are suing&nbsp;alleged spammers. So, you can see that it is actually a global problem and it has, in fact, continued to rise despite increasingly aggressive effort by the Government to tackle the problem. IDA has been studying various measures to curb e-mail spams. Anti-spamming legislation is one possible measure, but legislation is not a magic bullet because more than three-quarters of the spams that are received originated from overseas sources and are well beyond the reach of our laws. So a judicious combination of public education, industry self-regulation, international cooperation and techno<p align=left>Column: 1574<p>logical assistance, like anti-spam filters, will be the most likely combination of measures that could have some impact on this nuisance. IDA is, in fact, conducting a review on dealing with spam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe I have covered all the Members' points.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Local Movies</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Seng Han Thong</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, if you go to India, you&nbsp;will come to one conclusion, that is, if you want to make money - make movies - because Indian people like to watch movies, and it has a population of one billion, which is a very large market.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people may be biased against the Indian movies saying that there are usually just one boy and one girl, singing, dancing and chasing each other around a tree, and it could go on forever.&nbsp; The Indian movies of today are no longer like this.

With the companies in the limelight and better viewership, they will rush to place advertisements on TV or even sponsor the programmes, thereby giving the TV stations more revenue. I think with such improvements, we will be able to get the TV stations into the black again and also at the same time, the standard of our TV programmes would be further improved.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B> Sir, I thank Mr Seng Han Thong for speaking well of the local film industry, unlike Mr Chiam who, during the Budget debate, wrote off the creative sector and the film industry as one that has got no potential. Indeed, Jack Neo has shown how a local film can reach out to regional audience. He has shown how he can make a commercial success out of a Singapore product. In fact, to succeed, our film industry must look outward. This is quite obvious because of the small size of the Singapore audience. If you want to make any impact at all, you really have to make movies not just for Singapore audience but also movies that can travel to the four corners<p align=left>Column: 1578<p> of the earth and be seen, appreciated and welcomed by audiences everywhere.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Seng that we need to take a holistic approach in promoting the film industry. Last year, as part of our creative industry development strategy, MITA and the Media Development Authority (MDA) adopted the Media 21 report as the blueprint to develop Singapore into a global media city. The Media 21 blueprint aims to double the economic contribution of the media industry from&nbsp;about 1.6% currently to about 3% of our GDP and to create more and better jobs for Singaporeans in the media industry by the year 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Media 21, a five-year $100 million fund was established to support, develop and spur the growth of local media industry, including the film industry. The scheme covers the entire value chain of film production and distribution, from the development of content, manpower, talent and infrastructure to marketing of content locally and overseas. In total, the MDA has nine schemes that Singapore film makers here can tap on, and we have set aside $25 million of the earlier mentioned $100 million Media 21 fund to develop the local film industry. For example, in the area of talent development which Mr Seng had mentioned the&nbsp;importance of having talent to support the growth of the film industry, MDA's media development scheme has already awarded 13 scholarships to our students in both reputable overseas universities and also local tertiary institutions. In addition, to encourage and support local budding talents keen to work on movies, we offer grants to help them produce short films. It is through the production of such short films that they can acquire the skills and expertise and experience, and go on to make full length feature films. In December last year, MDA also introduced a new scheme to help these budding film <p align=left>Column: 1579<p>makers to develop their story ideas into feature film scripts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of Media 21 strategy, MDA is also actively seeking co-production as a way to create content that will appeal to a global audience. For example, recently it participated in the production of a Hong Kong-Singapore movie, "<i>Hainan Chicken Rice</i>" with an international cast, including Sylvia Chang and Martin Yan. MDA has also partnered MTV and a local company, Mega Media, to produce a first made-by-Singapore TV series, "<i>Rouge</i>" for worldwide distribution. This 14-episode series will cost $2 million, with 75% of the budget spent in Singapore and will employ media talent for direction, production and acting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, MDA struck a 10-film MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with local Raintree Pictures and also collaborated with Discovery Channel to produce documentaries. Participating in such international projects will help raise the level of movie-making in Singapore. It is important for locally produced movies and films to find a marketplace in Singapore to sell their products. Therefore, over the past two years, MDA has been organising</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Last year, at the Film Market, a total of 6,000 participants from 34 countries attended the event to sell and to buy international media content.&nbsp; Such efforts are crucial if we are to develop and to build up the reputation of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a vibrant, global media city.&nbsp;<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">1.30 pm</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help local film makers, MDA will&nbsp;continue to facilitate the participation of our local movie companies in leading international markets, such as the Cannes<p align=left>Column: 1580<p> Film Festival, American Film Market and Hong Kong Filmart.&nbsp;&nbsp; And to explore new opportunities, MDA also led film industry missions overseas.&nbsp; For instance, there was a business mission to <st1:country-region><st1:place>New Zealand</st1:place></st1:country-region> last year, arising from which we are hoping to conclude&nbsp;a Singapore-New Zealand Co-production Agreement some time this year.&nbsp; This will add to the existing Co-production Agreements that we already have with <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Such agreements will open doors for local film makers by helping them to expand their market, collaborate on international projects and tap more resources and talent.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr Zainudin also drew a comparison with <st1:country-region><st1:place>New Zealand</st1:place></st1:country-region> and its success in the Lord of the Rings.&nbsp; To be realistic, we do not have the expansive and the breath-taking landscape for movies, like the Lord of the Rings or Last Samurai.&nbsp; But we do have the infrastructure and capabilities to become a media city.&nbsp; Even if we are unlikely to be the location for the next Lord of the Rings type of epic, we can offer a location where media services and projects can be conceived, developed, financed, traded and distributed to the international media market.&nbsp; And in the process, as we go along each step of this value chain, it will create opportunities for Singaporeans, both to contribute at the creative level and also at the supporting level.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> also offer enormous opportunities for our film makers here in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; So MDA is making plans to visit both <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to discuss co-production possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I turn to Mr Loh Meng See.&nbsp; He asked what is the progress of the plan to develop a Media Hub Fusionpolis at One-North and how will it fit&nbsp;into our overall development plan for the media industry.&nbsp; Let me clarify.&nbsp; Fusionpolis is planned as a home for a vibrant community of researchers, creative entrepreneurs, <p align=left>Column: 1581<p>content creators, financiers and industry players from the creative media and info-communication sector.&nbsp; Many will be Singaporeans but we also hope to attract such talents from overseas to add to the buzz at Fusionpolis.&nbsp; &nbsp;It will provide a work, live, play and learn environment to facilitate networking and cross pollination of ideas across the diverse discipline of arts, design, media, business and technology.&nbsp; Fusionpolis is expected to be ready by end 2005 and will bring us closer to the overall vision of developing <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a vibrant and creative hub.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; He also asked whether we have sufficient media talent.&nbsp; As I have explained in the earlier response, we have a scheme under the Media 21 to support the development of media talent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme has already made 13 grants to support four Singaporeans taking up media studies in the local Institute of Higher Learning and nine Singaporeans in renowned overseas institutions, such as the University of Southern California and the New York University, Tisch School of the Arts.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another scheme is the Capability Development Scheme which has already benefited over 200 media professionals sent for training courses or overseas attachment.&nbsp; We will explore other avenues to nurture and develop our media talents, even as we try to attract international media players to locate their operations in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that the TV stations should provide more coverage of constituency events and these would help them to gain viewer share or win more viewers to the channel and, also, TV broadcasters should consider airing more programmes on local enterprises.&nbsp; I agree with him.&nbsp; I think our TV stations are already providing coverage for local events and the business sector.&nbsp; Our broadcasters have been covering local <p align=left>Column: 1582<p>community events and they do have business programmes in their regular and special programmes.&nbsp; And some of these programmes are in fact public service broadcast, supported by the Media Development Authority.&nbsp; These programmes cut across all four languages and fall into genres such as news, information and current affairs.&nbsp; While we encourage media competition, coverage and programming should be left to the commercial players to decide based on their station's positioning and branding.&nbsp; Our TV stations are well aware of viewers' interest in programmes with strong local flavour, whether it is for information or entertainment.&nbsp; They will be well advised to cater to such demands if they wish to retain viewership.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Broadcasters already carry a wide range of interesting business and corporate programmes which both inform consumers and investors.&nbsp; They are high quality productions, such as Channel NewsAsia's Money Mind, Singapore Business Tonight, The Business Tree and We Mean Business.&nbsp; Channel&nbsp;i also has similar business programmes, such as The Making of an Entrepreneur.&nbsp; And Channel 8 has a magazine series called Money Week and also Evergreen Brands. &nbsp; Channel U carries a programme, such as Smart Investment which serves&nbsp; as investor education and to ensure that people who buy shares in a company know what they are doing and they are aware of a company's operations and prospects.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I am sure that our broadcasters will know how to respond if demand for more business programmes builds up.&nbsp; I think I have covered all the points.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and, also better appropriate times over the free-to-air channels and on radio too.&nbsp; Sir, from feedback gathered at the Programme Advisory Committee, of which I am a member, the elderly in the group and other older folks I have spoken to, have expressed the following.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, more oldies with their favourite stars, such as Wang Sar, Yeh Fong, P Ramlee, MGR, Dean Martin in them, so that it is a flash back down memory lane for the elderly too.&nbsp; Two, create or buy programmes that portray the elderly as a vibrant group, instead of a fragile lot.&nbsp; Their suggestions include featuring sports people, such as Reynold Caleen, the marathoner, mountain climbers, retired soloist, who sailed round the world.&nbsp; Three, local family dramas that depict generational differences and similarities that can help the young and the old understand each other better.&nbsp; Also, in that, they would like to have more programmes that show the various hobbies that elderly people can pick up.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1584<p>Four, they also have discussed that there is almost a lack of older people as news readers or game show hosts.&nbsp; Right now, Dick Clark is still universally recognised and appreciated.&nbsp; What has happened to our own local older group of news readers?&nbsp; Five, to schedule more of these programmes in the afternoon so that it does not clash with prime time viewership and cause family problems sometimes, as they tussle over the remote control.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In all these, there is one recurring theme also that has come up, which has been brought up in Parliament before,&nbsp;and that is at least an hour or so of dialect programmes over radio.&nbsp; The community of Chinese elderly really would like to have their dialect programmes coming back to them.&nbsp; Lastly, the call that they made is to show greater sensitivity and not depict them as weak or frail.&nbsp; A good example lies in today's <I>Forum</I> page whereby the Chairman of the National Council Against Drug Abuse rationalises the decision to portray memory loss using an elderly woman.&nbsp; In his letter, and I think the irony is lost on him here, he says, the key challenge was how to drive home the message in a 30-second advertisement featuring an elderly woman with impaired memory.&nbsp; That is why they had to use an elderly woman.&nbsp; So I think we can have quite a number of lessons that we can learn on sensitive portrayal.&nbsp; I would like to know how MDA can fund or help to find sponsors to fund such programmes.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think from time to time, especially on Saturday afternoon, Suria and Vasantham do carry old movies that were very familiar to the hearts and minds of our older people.&nbsp; Her second request was to have programmes that project or portray the elderly as vibrant groups, those who take part in sports, climbing mountain, riding bikes.&nbsp; I think through our drama series, the media had portrayed fairly some older people who are still living robust lives and are inspirations to their grandchildren.&nbsp; I think it is unfair for us to generalise and I do not think that all of the series or programmes that we have over TV portray the elderly as old, frail<p align=left>Column: 1586<p> and&nbsp;need help all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;She also likes to have a local family drama that depicts similar and different ways of life.&nbsp;

She also asked:&nbsp;could&nbsp;we&nbsp;not present our older people as TV stars,&nbsp;as newscasters, presenters and sports commentators?&nbsp; We do have.&nbsp; Brian Richmond is not only a radio personnel but, from time to time, he does appear, and he is of my age, if I am old.&nbsp; But we do have people like him coming forward to present some important items in our local events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is&nbsp;also a request to schedule the programmes in the afternoon.&nbsp;

On dialect programmes over radio, I think we already have a variety of sources for the elderly to access dialect programmes.&nbsp; Chinese dialect operas are available every Saturday on Arts Central, and dialect news daily on Capital Radio 95.8 FM.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dialect programmes are also available in videos and on cable TV on Starhub's Channel, TVBJ.&nbsp; Our approach of making available dialect programmes targetting a niche audience, while balancing the broader need to promote the use of Mandarin as a unifying language among Chinese, is a sound one which has served us well, and we will continue to do so.</p></P></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 1587<p>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, often enough, we hear and read in the media criticisms and feedback about censorship in Singapore.&nbsp; But if we look closer and study the type of feedback about censorship, we will realise that the more vocal and louder voices that we hear are from people who want more freedom and <p align=left>Column: 1588<p>openness.&nbsp; In the past few years, or maybe more, we have witnessed many relevant changes and a relaxation of the rules, and I am cheered by this development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several of my former expatriate friends who had lived in Singapore in the 1980s, in their recent visits, observed that Singapore has evolved tremendously.&nbsp; They said that some of the things that are possible&nbsp;and doable now were non-existent before.&nbsp; They are quite impressed by the changes and the progress.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;recently, at a dialogue session, I recall a father who is concerned about the photographs of scantily-clad women on the advertisement billboards at bus-stops.&nbsp; He was worried that his young children are easily exposed to such images, which he felt are undesirable influences to the young.&nbsp; Therein lies my concern.&nbsp; In our eagerness to facilitate creativity and give more freedom and cater to the diverse tastes, choices and lifestyles, are we listening too much to the minority and loud critics?&nbsp; How then do we also, in our earnestness to be as inclusive as possible, manage the sensitivities of the silent majority who generally carry conservative views?&nbsp; Could the Minister also enlighten us on the role of the Board of Film Censors in the light of the recent comments in the media about the practice of censorship and the Censorship Review Committee's recommendations to shift towards greater choice for the individual and greater exercise of individual responsibility?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Loh Meng See--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our national shared values which include the sanctity of the family unit, moral integrity, social and religious harmony should not be compromised in any way.&nbsp; I wish to urge the Government not to relax and give latitude in these important areas that form the social fabric of our society.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, censorship is a very subjective yardstick.&nbsp; So, when they are reviewing our censorship yardstick, we should extensively seek the views of our people and the various communities and organisations, and not forgetting the major premise that Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious society.&nbsp; The views of those who have family and children will definitely be different from those who are single.&nbsp; Of course, we are unable to satisfy everybody, but I think we should be able to set a standard which is agreeable and tolerated by the majority.&nbsp; We must strike a balance between openness and stability.&nbsp; That is why somebody feels that when we are opening the window, we must not forget our little fly-swatter.&nbsp; I agree with this.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When MITA is reviewing its censorship status, it should not be swayed by the passionate arguments of a small group of people, and, at the same time, not be bound by the conservative and outdated views of some organisations.&nbsp; It is just like saying that the croaking of one or two frogs at the bottom of the well is very loud and thus significant, while the sound made by the thousands of frogs in the field is not significant.&nbsp; That should not be the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no hard and fast rule to say that censorship review must be done at regular intervals. But, it should be done from time to time to stay relevant.&nbsp; Whenever a review is done, the views of <p align=left>Column: 1590<p>the people from all walks of life should be extensively sought.

Members who have spoken on censorship from various perspectives.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I will respond to Mr Zainudin who asked me to enlighten the House on the role of the Board of Film Censors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1953, the Board of Film Censors has been serving an important role in our society.&nbsp; It ensures that films exhibited here are in accord with the level of public decency accepted by our society and do not undermine our national and public <p align=left>Column: 1591<p>interests, such as law and order and racial and religious harmony.&nbsp; The Board of Film Censors also administers the film rating system that gives Singaporeans more choice in entertainment whilst, at the same time, protecting our young from undesirable content.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, the Board of Film Censors has shown flexibility in adapting to the changing environment while, at the same time, preserving and protecting our social values.&nbsp; Its guidelines have evolved and it has extended its system of public and industry consultation. Such consultation ensures that the Board of Film Censors is in tune with changes in societal values.&nbsp; Hence, it has developed a film rating system to accommodate individual choice. Recently, it has introduced sequential dual rating for films where different age groups can watch different presentations of the same film, thereby giving viewers more choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board of Film Censor's role is not an easy one.&nbsp; It has to balance the expectations of the majority and the wants of the minority.&nbsp; Even with the more flexibile guidelines, its decision will not satisfy everyone and there will be some who dislike the Board of Film Censors for what it does.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, but the majority do support censorship.&nbsp; Some people hold the view that censorship is obsolete and people should be able to see anything they want.&nbsp; The recent Censorship Review Committee survey shows that these are clearly the views of the minority.&nbsp; The majority, represented by 70% of the respondents to the survey, supported our censorship policies, with over 70% accepting our standards for violence, sex and nudity, coarse language and homosexuality in each of our film ratings. To protect the young, 74% supported more censorship for contents targeted at the young.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 1592<p>should not disregard their concerns even though they might be a relatively silent group.&nbsp; Even in western societies, such as the United Kingdom, the US or Australia, censorship is practised to reflect social mores.&nbsp; The recent public backlash in the US from Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's breast-baring wardrobe malfunction during the Super Bowl half-time show, and the subsequent implementation of a technologically advanced five-second tape delay in the live broadcast of this year's Academy Award is&nbsp;a case in point.&nbsp; It illustrates that there&nbsp;is a large school of opinions and concerns in every society, even in the US, who will object to some form of display that is made available&nbsp;to&nbsp;all and sundry.&nbsp;&nbsp;They in their own way also establish some standards of public decency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to emphasise that censorship decisions are not made on the whims and fancies of public officers.&nbsp; There is an established mechanism that involves the society in deciding on censorship issues. The Board of Film Censors regularly consults the Films Consultative Panel, a citizens committee with broad representation from society, including professionals, businessmen, educationists, social workers and community leaders. The Films Consultative Panel assists the Board of Film Censors to decide on film ratings or censorship. There is also an appeal process that provides a check on the Board of Film Censors.&nbsp; Should any distributor or film maker be aggrieved by the Board of Film Censors' decision, he or or she can seek redress through the Films Appeals Committee.&nbsp; This again is a citizens committee set up by statute, which acts as the final arbiter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the film "<I>15</I>", for example.&nbsp; To assess this film, the Board of Film Censors conducted screening for no less than seven different focus groups before deciding to approve the film under the <p align=left>Column: 1593<p>R(A) category with certain edits. The distributor appealed against the Board of Film Censors' decision to the Films Appeals Committee.&nbsp; After viewing the film and deliberating carefully, the Films Appeals Committee unanimously upheld the Board of Film Censors' decison.&nbsp; This shows clearly that such decisions are not taken lightly. They are, in fact, taken&nbsp;after much consultation and deliberation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Board of Film Censors takes criticisms in their stride, even if such criticisms are unfair and unjustified.&nbsp; But it is one thing to criticise and another to publicly misrepresent the Board of Film Censors and to lampoon its staff.&nbsp; I read with dismay last week's <I>Sunday Times'&nbsp;</I> article which reported that Mr Royston Tan was traumatised by the Board of Film Censors' demands of 27 cuts for his film "<I>15</I>" and has set out to satirise the Board of Film Censors and lampoon one of its officers by making a new film called "<I>Cut</I>".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an example of misrepresentation of the Board of Film Censors. I asked the Board of Film Censors whether they required or insisted on 27 cuts.&nbsp; Actually, the Board of Film Censors only required 10 cuts, out of which nine were to remove mention of teenage gangs and chants used by these gangs, as advised by the Police for law and order reasons.&nbsp; However, the producer chose to make additional edits within the gang chants or songs, thus increasing the number of edits to 27. I think it is unhealthy for public officers who were carrying out their duties to be subject to unwarranted ridicule even if it is just for a laugh.&nbsp; More so when such decisions were taken only after extensive consultations. The producer may think it is funny, but I am afraid I do not appreciate such unbecoming attempts to undermine the standing of a public institution.&nbsp; Making fun of the Board of Film Censors will not cause us to change our censorship framework to suit the<p align=left>Column: 1594<p> agenda of those with vested interest or an agenda of their own.&nbsp; In fact, I understand that "<I>Cut</I>" may be passed by the Board of Film Censors uncut, even though it has gross inaccuracy and misrepresented the Board of Film Censors.&nbsp; I emphasise "may be" because the Board of Film Censors has not quite finalised its decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Zainudin that we should not allow the vocal minority to drown out the concerns and interests of the vast majority of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I also like to assure Mr Loh Meng See that even as we refine our censorship guidelines, we will not neglect our key social values, high moral standards and public decency.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Film Censors will continue to serve and uphold the majority's view in the context of our&nbsp;Asian society and our national interest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I now turn to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang who asked whether we could update this House on the implementation of the Censorship Review Committee's recommendations.&nbsp;The Media Development Authority is implementing the Censorship Review Committee's recommendations in phases.&nbsp; This is because some of the recommendations involve further study and consultations with the public and the industry. Some changes have already been effected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier on, since October 2003, films may be released or re-released under a different rating with the sequential dual rating system.&nbsp; This was, in fact, done with films such as "<I>Love, Actually</I>".&nbsp; As recommended by the CRC, MITA has formed two new Committees in February this year to advise on arts issues, namely, the Arts Consultative Panel and the Arts Appeal Advisory Committee.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April, the revised film classification system will be introduced. This is the film classification that will provide for an<p align=left>Column: 1595<p> introduction of an intermediate category known as M18 category,&nbsp;between the NC16 and R(A) which will become R21 rating.&nbsp; In May, MITA will lift the ban on the magazine <I>Cosmopolitan</I> and&nbsp;exempt more genres of arts entertainment from licensing requirements.&nbsp; This will be followed in June by video classification and cable programme classification for NC16 and M18 on StarHub Cable Vision's Premium tiers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo also asked if MITA could share its thinking about the pace of change regarding censorship guidelines.&nbsp; I would like to assure him that the Censorship Review Committee, in making its recommendations&nbsp;after extensive consultations, was mindful that the pace of change must take into account our multi-racial and multi religious society</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Their approach was to proceed at a measured pace that our society is comfortable with.&nbsp; Hence, in implementing the recommendations, we will not move too far ahead of the majority.&nbsp; Rather, we will recalibrate our censorship guidelines and framework sensitively, even as we foster an environment conducive to encouraging creativity&nbsp;and developing our cultural capital to bring about a more innovative and vibrant Singapore.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I turn to Miss Penny Low.&nbsp; She has expressed a valid concern, particularly advertisements that pop up in the HDB heartlands or even the non-HDB heartlands, advertisements that may offend some people.&nbsp; I think Mr Zainudin also reflected one feedback on such an advertisement.&nbsp; First, let me state that our laws clearly prohibit any obscene or <p align=left>Column: 1596<p>objectionable content in any medium.&nbsp; The MDA regulates content in the print, broadcast and film medium.&nbsp; Contents in other mediums, such as billboards or posters in public places, are placed under the purview of the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS).&nbsp; ASAS maintains a code of advertising practice, which emphasises that advertisements should be legal, decent, truthful, and not misleading.&nbsp; They also emphasise public decency and protection of children and that young people's interests should also be safeguarded.&nbsp; As a general principle endorsed by the CRC, stricter contents are applied to advertisements in public places in view of the likelihood of uncontrolled access, as noted by Miss Penny Low.&nbsp; However, difference in interpretation by the advertisers in question may sometimes lead&nbsp;to results mentioned by her, and I take her point.&nbsp; I shall ask MDA to work closely with the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore to eliminate perceptions of looser standards in advertisements appearing in public.&nbsp; We value such feedback on advertisements and will get the relevant stakeholders to act on them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier on, in my haste to comply with the time limit and I know you wield a very sharp guillotine, I apparently omitted responding to Dr Tan Boon Wan's point on information technology.&nbsp;&nbsp; May I have your permission to respond?&nbsp; Actually I omitted responding to Dr Tan Boon Wan and Ms Indranee Rajah.&nbsp; With your permission, Mr Speaker, now that we have a bit more time, can I respond to them?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B> Dr Tan's question and similarly Ms Indranee Rajah's point, was what is the impact of this trend of business process outsourcing (BPO) on Singapore.&nbsp; How are we going to compete with BPO giants that have emerged on the landscape like India, for instance, Ms <p align=left>Column: 1597<p>Indranee Rajah asked whether there is a role for Singapore in this new business sector.&nbsp; I overlooked responding to them but I would like to give the response now.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, Singapore's infocomm industry remains one of our key engines of growth.&nbsp; First, the EDB pipeline for investments remains strong.&nbsp; Last year, the infocomm and media cluster was the second strongest contributor to EDB's investments commitment in the service industry, with $623 million of total business spending committed.&nbsp; When fully realised, these investments would generate $544 million of total value-added and 2,163 professional and skilled jobs.&nbsp; Secondly, the infocomm sector revenue is expected to have grown by 4½% in 2003 and projected to grow by 7½% this year.&nbsp; Thirdly, along with improved business turnover, we are also seeing a turnaround in job market for infocomm professionals.&nbsp; The Ministry of Manpower's quarterly labour market survey showed a year-on-year increase of 2.2% workers employed in the infocomm sector in 2003.&nbsp; This was in comparison to a decline of 2.7% for the same period between 2001 and 2002.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan and Ms Indranee are both right that areas like business process outsourcing and the convergence of IT and media represent new opportunities but they come with many new challenges.&nbsp; When it comes to business process outsourcing, Singapore cannot compete with India on costs.&nbsp; But Singapore is still attractive for higher-end process outsourcing and services such as business continuity, disaster recovery, IT strategy and security implementation and logistics supply chain coordination.&nbsp; Singapore is also well-placed to serve as a hub for managing, coordinating and monitoring outsourced services that are delivered out of lower-cost regional countries.&nbsp; So although we may not be able to do the outsourcing work, we can be the higher-<p align=left>Column: 1598<p>level nerve centre to coordinate and to manage these outsourced services.&nbsp; In fact, we offer extensive connectivity, high band-width, strong technical capability and a conducive environment to service such needs.&nbsp; IT service companies, such as IBM, EDS, HP, Satyam and Scandent recognise our advantage.&nbsp; They use Singapore as the location to fulfil regional shared services contract awarded by their clients.&nbsp; In 2003, Singapore attracted over 30 shared service business process outsourcing projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With over 7,000 MNCs and a strong base of supporting infocomm technology companies, we offer a huge potential for companies to expand their activities and to grow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our advantages have also helped us to persuade companies such as SAP and Credit Suisse First Boston to locate their back-office and service support centre here in Singapore.&nbsp; Companies like Polaris and IBM have also sited disaster recovery operations here.&nbsp; They joined companies like Citigroup, BASF and Exxon Mobil in building Singapore as a strong centre for shared services and business continuity activities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, IDA will work with EDB, MAS and IE Singapore to strengthen Singapore's position as an ideal location for selected BPO services and to develop the BPO industry in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the convergence of IT and media sector, this provides another opportunity for Singapore to become a trading and distribution centre for digital assets -&nbsp;films, advertising, online games as mentioned by Miss Penny Low, and printed materials.&nbsp; We have successfully piloted digital cinema distribution as an example.&nbsp; So instead of having rolls and rolls of films being carted around, you can now distribute the films through the digital broadband network.&nbsp; IDA is also exploring opportunities in IT security, web services, grid computing, utility data <p align=left>Column: 1599<p>centres.&nbsp; To tap regional opportunities, IDA is working with the Singapore Info-Comm Technology Federation to bring a cluster of local infocomm technology companies to explore the China market.&nbsp; So far, 20 companies have already signed up for this collective effort.&nbsp; We are in the process of finding a home in China for this cluster.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This year, with the appearance of the Avian flu in some Asian countries, we all heard that Minister Mah Bow Tan was going to slaughter some 5,000 chickens as a preventive measure, to assure the people that the remaining chickens were safe to eat. As a matter of fact, it is quite safe to eat chicken in Singapore, but just do not eat too much.&nbsp; But, please, carry on eating our national favourite - chicken rice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was the message transmitted so effectively? That is because it is a matter of life and death.&nbsp; If you eat the wrong thing, you will die.&nbsp; So everyone is concerned.&nbsp; I hope that MITA would not jump to the conclusion&nbsp; that our means of&nbsp; communications with the people are already perfected. The subject matter concerns life and death, therefore the message is noted, and the communication means effective. But for those long-term policies and intangible policies, people do <p align=left>Column: 1600<p>not understand.&nbsp; I think we should work harder on that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take for example the Budget Statement, as announced by our Finance Minister.&nbsp; People said that it was very uneventful.&nbsp; I told them that this was an important Budget which urged our people to have more children so that we could have enough young people to look after the ageing population. Otherwise, when the present generation of people get older, there would not be enough young people to support us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have to cultivate our talents - our local talents, together with the imported foreign talents. This is a long-term policy.&nbsp; We have to explain to the people so that they could understand.&nbsp; For example, many people thought everything was going to be all right with the arrest of Saddam Hussein.&nbsp; Suddenly, there was this series of explosions in Spain and people began to be alarmed, saying, "Ah, the terrorists are coming again".&nbsp; So how are we going to explain to our people the implications of such events?&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where public communication with the people comes in.&nbsp; It is a very important function.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, our television channel stations have gone to the various constituencies and they do a lot of out-door telecast.&nbsp; Channel U has also gone out to the people and reach out to them and find out what are their views on Avian flu.&nbsp; I think this is very important.&nbsp; For the VIPs to be on TV all the time is very important.&nbsp; For the small people, once they get the chance to go on TV, they will treasure it forever.&nbsp; So I think it gives them a chance and they would like to participate, and give their views.&nbsp; I think when we are to explain our Government policies to the people, we should involve more public servants, civil servants, so that they could explain all these long term strategies to our people.</p></P></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 1601<p>					<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In this knowledge age, where human capital is a critical asset, the key to success is really to have a skilled and innovative workforce that constantly updates its skills and knowledge.&nbsp; By imparting knowledge to the people, by providing the means to empower themselves, and by firing their imagination, the library itself plays an important role in this regard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to begin by applauding the efforts of the National Library Board in reaching out to the population as a whole.&nbsp; I note that there are many activities geared towards the young and there has been a variety of family-oriented activities being offered.&nbsp; I understand that the library also organises trips to schools to raise the awareness of the library services amongst children.&nbsp; Schools are also doing their bit towards cultivating the reading habit, a habit that is crucial to foster a life-long learning instinct.&nbsp; Thus far, not surprisingly, many of these efforts would involve physical library facilities around the main library which is being built, regional libraries or those in institutions of learning, such as schools and universities.&nbsp; To complement this, community children's libraries were set up to bring the library closer to the people.&nbsp; These had mixed results, although they were instrumental in attracting people who would otherwise not make a trip to the library for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, most of these activities currently reach out to the majority of the population.&nbsp; However, I am concerned about the access to these services for the unconverted, the ignorant or the disadvantaged.&nbsp; Most of these are likely to be from low income families.&nbsp; Equal efforts must be&nbsp;made towards this group<p align=left>Column: 1602<p> of people and it must not be viewed as part of the corporate volunteerism programme of the National Library staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what efforts are being made to literally bring the library to the people so that no segment of the population is left out inadvertently.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Encik Yatiman Yusof--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So when Mr Seng Han Thong asked about the new initiatives to help Singaporeans to understand Government policies, especially in dealing with disasters, it is crucial that we also look into the initiatives to help Singaporeans understand the policies, especially those who cannot be reached by the mass media.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, I would like to turn to the issue raised by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.&nbsp; I thank Mrs Lim for raising the question of how to attract the unconverted to our library.&nbsp; I totally agree with her that there is an important role for the library to reach the ignorant and the disadvantaged.&nbsp; But there are a number of&nbsp;efforts in which the National Library Board (NLB) has started towards this direction.&nbsp; For example, the NLB organises annually a charity book donation event.&nbsp; For this financial year, the NLB donated over 26,000 books, 500 packs of magazines and about 1,900 audio visual materials for 56 charity and non-profit organisations to help promote reading and literacy to some 25,000 people.&nbsp; The organisations that benefited<p align=left>Column: 1604<p> from this effort include the Movement of the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore and the Society for the Physically Disabled.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through its Corporate Volunteerism Programme, volunteers from among NLB staff employ their skills to set up the libraries and multi-media resource centres at Gracehaven Home and Changi Women's Prison.&nbsp; Over 3,000 books and audio visual materials were donated to the library at Gracehaven Home and 5,000 books and magazines were given to the Changi Women's Prison.&nbsp; In addition, they conduct training for prison inmates in library and information technology skills.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in March last year, NLB launched a Library@office programme to attract more professionals.&nbsp; It is not just the ignorant and disadvantaged,&nbsp;those who 'can't be&nbsp;bothered'&nbsp;type are also being reached.&nbsp; So, we reach out to the professionals, managers, executives and businessmen (PMEBs) to the libraries, as about half of the members of this group have not borrowed any books or audio visual materials from the library in the preceding year.&nbsp; NLB presented some of its services at the office doorstep of the PMEBs in the central business district and selected high traffic suburban office malls.&nbsp; The programme was successful in reaching out to some 600,000 people and subsequently resulted in about 90,000 additional visitors to the public libraries.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</B> Sir, the telecommunications market was liberalised some years ago.&nbsp; While competition has certainly brought benefits to consumers, I have noted that in some instances such as charges for local calls, these have not actually been brought down.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to enlighten us as to how competition can further benefit consumers in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the new 3G telephones will roll out by the end of the year.&nbsp; Given that the telcos bidded $100 million each for the licences, and this was at the height of the dot.com boom, how does the Minister see the prices of 3G services evolving?&nbsp; And whether these could, in fact, be attractive enough to make consumers switch from 2G or 2½G, as we have now, to 3G.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> offers a good example.&nbsp; Their telcos also bid a high price for 3G licences some years ago.&nbsp; But poor take-up rate has forced one telco last month to slash the cost of 3G handphones to under HK$1,000 each, and monthly charges of less than HK$200, all of which, in effect, make 3G phones cheaper than the present 2G phones.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I have the Minister's views, please?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B> Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon has asked about the impact of liberalisation in the infocomm sector, particularly referring to the telecoms sector.&nbsp; He also asked about why charges for local calls have not dropped as a result of the opening of the market.&nbsp; He also asked about the pricing of the 3G services that are to be rolled out.&nbsp; I will respond to his points.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our telecommunications industry was fully liberalised in April 2000.&nbsp; Since then, we have made good progress in developing competition in the telecommunications market.&nbsp; Both individual consumers and business consumers<p align=left>Column: 1606<p> have benefited from more than 400 new operators providing a wide range of new and innovative services at competitive prices.&nbsp; Today, some key telecoms sectors are already fully competitive.&nbsp; The mobile phone market is one good example.&nbsp; Consumers now enjoy a wide variety of offerings from three operators, high quality services and some of the lowest prices compared to other jurisdictions like <st1:place><st1:City>Hong Kong</st1:City>, <st1:country-region>Japan</st1:country-region></st1:place> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; As a result, currently, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> has one of the highest mobile penetration rate of about 83%.&nbsp; Other sectors that are competitive include the wholesale international telephone service.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More competition has also been introduced in the retail broadband and retail international telephony services, with lower prices, high quality and more service differentiation.&nbsp; Broadband prices have fallen by as much as 50% since liberalisation with consumers able to choose from a diverse range of broadband packages.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For retail IDD services, consumers can now select from a variety of premium or budget services, including voice over Internet protocol.&nbsp; Since 1998, the average IDD call charges to top overseas destinations have, in fact, fallen by as much as 73%.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, prices for telecoms services such as international private lease circuit and Internet connectivity have also dropped significantly over the last three years by as much as 75% and 62% respectively.&nbsp; However, effective competition has yet to be achieved in markets like local telephony and local leased circuits.&nbsp; This is due in part to fundamental market characteristics such as a high sunk cost and lack of economies of scale and scope, which render competition difficult to achieve.&nbsp; Other jurisdictions like the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>, US, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> had also experienced similar difficulties.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1607<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, notwithstanding the competition status, our consumers continue to enjoy reliable and high quality local telephone services at relatively low rates compared with the US, UK, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia.&nbsp; The rates have remained the same, unchanged, for more than 10 years.&nbsp; And about a year ago, some competition was introduced when StarHub completed the roll out of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s second residential fixed line network via cable.&nbsp; Homes are now able to take up an alternative package catering to their needs for fixed line telephone services by switching to StarHub.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StarHub will further ensure that SingTel's fixed line phone services are priced competitively.&nbsp; I would like to point out that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s residential fixed line market is already saturated at about 98% of households covered.&nbsp; We are not likely to see significant growth in this sector.&nbsp; Given the market saturation and the existing price level of fixed line services, there may be limited scope for competition to lower price in the future.&nbsp; Overall, we should give the four-year old full liberalisation of the telecommunications market&nbsp;the thumbs up for the benefits it has brought to consumers and businesses.&nbsp; But IDA will continue to be vigilant and to watch all the sectors as we go forward.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan also asked about the status of the 3G mobile services, the roll out and pricing.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three 3G licensees&nbsp; -&nbsp; SingTel Mobile, StarHub Mobile and M1.&nbsp; All the three roll-out plans for 3G services are on track to meet the roll-out deadline of December 2004.&nbsp; All three operators have awarded contracts to network equipment manufacturers&nbsp;for the deployment of their 3G networks.&nbsp; M1 has also begun trials of its 3G network in the central and other parts of the island.&nbsp; However, as with any introduction of new technology, IDA will set the overall <p align=left>Column: 1608<p>framework for the&nbsp;commercial development, but leave it to the operators to decide on how best to price and market the new services.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operators in Singapore have not announced their pricing strategy.&nbsp; But so far, we have observed&nbsp;in overseas market, 3G prices for&nbsp;data and voice have been priced competitively against existing 2G and 2½G services for voice and data.&nbsp; With three operators here offering a variety of service packages to meet the different needs of consumers, we can expect competitive pricing for 3G services when they are rolled out towards the end of the year.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to emphasise here that to do so, we require a tetra-partite approach that combines the efforts of the police in legal enforcement, the chatline industry in regulating their services, the major media players in regulating advertisements and parents in guiding their children.&nbsp; Specifically, I would also say that the chatline operators have to accept the responsibility to protect the young and operate their services with adequate safeguards to discourage potential offenders from preying on the young.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from having that&nbsp;to uphold higher standards,&nbsp;efforts are also aimed at regulating chatline advertisements to ensure that they are not misleading.&nbsp; Because under the new code that is to be introduced, operators would be required to carry precautionary messages in their advertisements warning users of the dangers of meeting strangers acquainted through chatlines.&nbsp; As these advertisements are carried by major media owners, such as SPH, it is useful if they also monitor the compliance of the chatline advertisements in their publications.&nbsp; We are happy to note that, so far, till December last year, SPH has improved their chatline advertising guidelines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the efforts of the police.&nbsp; I think the police and the chatline industry would be successful only&nbsp;if there is close <p align=left>Column: 1610<p>cooperation given by the parents.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1611<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Since HDB flats are transacted in the resale market at market prices, we should be consistent and price new HDB flats according to the market conditions too.&nbsp; But, the Government must continue to provide the necessary subsidy for first-timers and upgraders to purchase these new flats.&nbsp; In this way, the prices of HDB flats will be more stable and will move in tandem with market conditions.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The higher income has the alternative of going to the private sector housing.&nbsp; Although recently HDB has released its scheme for HDB heartlanders to sublet their flats totally, this is still limited.&nbsp; The queue for HDB rental flats is long and there are stringent conditions to be met.&nbsp; Households with a salary range of $1,000 to $2,000 are finding difficulty to pay the current loan instalments, especially with the lower income and also the flexi wage system.&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Presently, the short-term leases are not popular, as the banks are not providing loans for short-term leases.&nbsp; However, if there is sufficient market for this type of houses, I am sure the Ministry of Finance, or the Monetary Authority of Singapore overseeing the banks, can review the present policies of the loan structure and provide the persuasion power to the banks to accept shorter leases.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</B> Sir, the Housing and Development Board has played a critical role in the early years in providing public housing for Singaporeans.&nbsp; It also ensures that the cost of housing remains reasonable and affordable.&nbsp; Today, almost all Singaporeans own a flat or a private property.&nbsp; Furthermore, over the years, the private sector developers have gradually matured and have taken on a bigger role in the housing market here.&nbsp; Therefore, I think it is timely for us to review the priorities of the HDB.&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1613<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice that, in recent years, the HDB has stopped building the smaller 3-room flats and instead focus more on the larger 4- and 5-room flats.&nbsp; Sir, I think this is wrong.&nbsp; I feel that HDB should continue to build more 3-room flats to cater to the lower income group.&nbsp; There are mainly three types of people who need lower cost housing.&nbsp; Firstly, those who are facing financial difficulties.&nbsp; They have to sell their flats in order to repay their debts.&nbsp; Some of them have become bankrupts.&nbsp; Some feel it prudent to downgrade to a smaller flat to reduce their exposure.&nbsp; Firstly, they would be debarred from purchasing or renting another flat for a period of time under HDB rules.&nbsp; Next, if they are given permission to purchase a flat, they would not be able to afford a large flat.&nbsp; Secondly, those who have undergone divorce, as a result, most of them have to dispose of their matrimonial flat.&nbsp; The women who often have the custody of the children would have difficulties supporting a large flat, at least in the immediate future.&nbsp; Thirdly, those who are starting a family and&nbsp;young couples who are also starting a career, would not want to over-stretch themselves by buying a large flat.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think it would be wrong for us to push this group of people who are already stretched to go beyond their means by insisting that they take on a big flat.&nbsp; I would therefore urge the Ministry to review HDB's policy and consider offering more 3-room flats.&nbsp; Alternatively, I would like to suggest that the HDB offer shorter leases, such as 20 or 30-year leases, so as to keep the costs low and allow tenants to extend later if their financial position has improved.&nbsp; I believe shorter leases are already available for the senior citizens under the neighbourhood links programme.&nbsp; Perhaps, it can be extended to people who fall within these three categories.</p></P></span></div>					<p align=left>Column: 1614<p>				<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Minister also noted that the days of high demand for HDB flats are over and, with growing <p align=left>Column: 1615<p>affluence, more Singaporeans will aspire to own private housing.&nbsp; The Government is thus scaling back its public housing programme and its medium term aim is to adjust the ratio of public to private housing to a ratio of 75:25.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, since HDB's restructuring, what plans have been implemented or are afoot to enable HDB to better react to changing demand conditions, scale back its public housing programme and work towards the 75:25 housing mix and open up the public housing market to private sector developers.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the public housing sector, the trend towards upgrading to larger flats has reversed in the last couple of years.&nbsp; HDB had stopped building 3-room flats on the ground that our citizens' housing aspirations have risen.&nbsp; But there is now a current glut of several thousand unsold HDB flats, many of them larger ones.&nbsp; HDB's building programme had halted because of a steep fall in demand.&nbsp; However, the resale market has been very active, especially for the 3- and 4-room flats.&nbsp; This is a clear reflection of the downgrading trend.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the current economy has been a major factor in this process, it is very plausible - with the tightening of CPF rules for housing purchase and the requirement to use increasing amounts of cash for downpayment - that this downgrading phenomenon may be entrenched for a long time.&nbsp; Our ageing population can also exacerbate this phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So besides this downgrading phenomenon, there are also more people desiring to rent a flat.&nbsp; At my meet-the-people sessions, almost without fail, there would be appeals related to downgrading and rental housing.&nbsp; In view of what appears to be a significant U-turn in<p align=left>Column: 1616<p> demand preferences, I urge the Minister to undertake a comprehensive study to better understand Singaporeans' preferences and the need for the various housing options.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At the appropriate time, the Ministry should consider reviving the building of 3-room flats, perhaps starting out as a small percentage of the total stock.&nbsp; This will provide families with tighter budgets an option to own a smaller flat that is more affordable.&nbsp; Furthermore, as Singaporeans begin to think of housing more in terms of consumption than investment, there is room for a larger and more active rental market.&nbsp; Besides catering to the lower income groups, there could also be young Singaporeans who do not wish to be tied down by a housing mortgage.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

&nbsp;This has brought many benefits, for instance, it has given HDB flat buyers more choice in their mortgage financing and also with&nbsp;relaxation in the HDB rules, the HDB flat owners have flexibility in the resale and use of flats. And also banks and other financial institutions are now competing to provide more attractive loans to HDB buyers.&nbsp; However, there is a group of HDB flat purchasers who are unable to obtain bank loans to purchase their flats because of what is considered poor credit standing and this includes many downgraders, like what my colleagues mentioned just now.&nbsp;

In particular, Sir, should public housing be confined to 4-room flats and 3-room flats, as many of my colleagues have indicated, and to ensuring that there is an adequate stock of rental housing to cater to the needs of those who are perhaps in the lower income groups and are unable to afford their own homes?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">3.15 pm</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;

The reality is that the economic downturn that we have just experienced forces a lot of Singaporeans to really downgrade or ask for greater options in terms of housing possibilities.&nbsp; Many of them do not have good ratings, that is why they want to downgrade.&nbsp; But HDB's policy really does not allow them to do so.&nbsp; They are allowed to downgrade but they have difficulty getting HDB loans.&nbsp; They cannot get bank loans because of their credit ratings.&nbsp; Yes, they may get some proceeds from the sale of their existing flats, but they cannot go anywhere if they <p align=left>Column: 1619<p>cannot get loans from any party.&nbsp; So, we can actually tell them to stay put in their current flat and make use of HDB assistance plans, but this also incurs costs.&nbsp;

But this has the unfortunate consequence that those who are keen in a particular location cannot have a flat if the total applications fall just below the minimum target set by HDB.&nbsp; HDB then becomes the target to blame.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent casualty of the system is the much-touted 50-storey HDB blocks to be built at Duxton Plain.&nbsp;

Besides closely monitoring the demand for the different types of flats and changing the mix, if required, to ensure good take up, the Ministry could also peg the minimum percentage of applications needed to trigger construction based on market conditions and responses.&nbsp; It could also provide applicants with more definitive target date of completion of the project, to accord some certainty and transparency to the applicants.&nbsp; Perhaps the Ministry can additionally consider one of the ERC's Land Work Group's recommendations that a reverse tender system be initiated to allow more suppliers and spread the risks that HDB faces from over-building.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reverse tender works like this:&nbsp; selling prices of HDB flats in a particular estate are predetermined, and private developers are invited to bid for the development.&nbsp; This would be like a variation of the present EC scheme.&nbsp; The developer's profit stems from how efficiently and effectively they build and launch these units.&nbsp; This ensures that public flats are still affordable while giving home buyers a wider variety of design choices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the walk-in selection system implemented by the HDB for its surplus flats, I urge the Ministry to consider selling these flats on a daily basis, as each day that these flats remain vacant represents a wastage and misallocation of resources and costs to taxpayers.&nbsp; For instance, one of the estates at Jalan Bahar, which is within my constituency, has a high number of vacant flats, due primarily to noise pollution from the Tengah Air Base.&nbsp; In fact, in one of the blocks completed some <p align=left>Column: 1625<p>five years ago, only two of the 80-odd units in the block are occupied.&nbsp; The HDB should adopt a more aggressive pro-active, pro-market and pro-customer approach to sell these flats, say, by allowing applications on a daily basis ---</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This averages about three cases per week.&nbsp; They all wish to rent a flat from the HDB after selling their properties.&nbsp; I am aware that the HDB has many assistance schemes to assist those who fail to keep up with HDB instalment plans.&nbsp; One is to defer the housing payments for an initial period of six months, with a further extension of another six months, if necessary.&nbsp; But this only offers the residents temporary reprieve from their financial problems.&nbsp; Many hard-hit residents who have no means to maintain the HDB financial instalment plans would always choose to sell their flats to raise money to pay off what they owe to the HDB, which can run up to an amount beyond their reach.&nbsp; Their next course of action would be to ensure that they secure a rental flat from the HDB, as a private flat would be too much for them to afford.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the 30-month restriction rule bars them from renting a flat from the HDB.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a more permanent solution, can HDB review the 30-month restriction and consider shortening it?&nbsp; HDB should also&nbsp;consider building flats for short-term purposes, so that families which are <p align=left>Column: 1626<p>facing domestic difficulties as a result of family problems or financial hardship can resort to such services to have a roof over their heads. &nbsp;Such services should also be open to singles who may need short-term accommodation before they obtain their purchase flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public housing programmes must be flexible enough to meet the rapidly changing needs of our population, especially when the affordability factor in home ownership is becoming a greater burden with more uncertainty in the earning power for the majority.</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

While we are told that there&nbsp;are 55,700 rental flats currently available, we are also told that there is a long waiting list.&nbsp; Can I get a clarification from the Minister? What is really the size of this waiting list that resulted in this delay in <p align=left>Column: 1627<p>people getting the flats?&nbsp; Is there a system that differentiates between those who urgently need the flats versus those who are just merely being choosy?&nbsp; I would like to also&nbsp;ask the Minister what is the trend of Singaporeans asking for rental flats.&nbsp; Is there an increasing trend?&nbsp; If there is, what is MND's assessment of the matter?&nbsp; Is it a temporary surge in demand such that it will not do anything?&nbsp; If this is so, at what point will MND decide that rental flat is a living option that Singaporeans may actually prefer?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not advocating for us to make a U-turn on our home ownership policy.&nbsp; But given the current experience&nbsp;of the economic downturn, some Singaporeans may feel that renting a flat is a better option. Yes, rental flats are heavily subsidised but if we can have a tiered system&nbsp;of charging in "C" class wards, we can also look into a system for rental flats, that is, allowing Singaporeans a choice in housing types just as we allow them to choose the wards that they want when they are hospitalised.&nbsp; In that sense, they pay the rental based on their income rather than forcing them to buy flats all the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, related to this issue of supply of rental flats, I would like to ask the Minister if there is any plan to&nbsp;offer those purchased flats that are not taken up, just like what Dr Amy Khor talked about.&nbsp; I see many vacant flats in my area and some of them have been vacant for five years.&nbsp; Certainly, it is better to rent them out to gain some income for HDB rather than to leave them vacant all the time.

These residents have seen their income reduced drastically by the economic downturn and now, they even face structural unemployment. Their income has been reduced to the point where some even face difficulties meeting their daily household needs, not to mention their housing loans.&nbsp; The cost of living remains high and they have accumulated arrears of HDB loan repayments, electricity bills, S&amp;CC, schools fees, etc.&nbsp; Of course, the ultimate solution is for them to retrain and upgrade their skills and get a good income. But as we all know, some simply cannot get out of the rut.&nbsp; So what are we doing to help them?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have assistance schemes to restructure their HDB loan repayments for a few months or to provide them with short-term financial assistance,&nbsp;subsidies for schools fees, and short-term measures like that. These small hesitant&nbsp;measures are unlikely to solve their problems. They need to downgrade to a smaller and&nbsp;more affordable flat. Even if they want to sell their flat at the present market value, they will not get much back after repaying the loan. And&nbsp;even if they sell their present flat, with their present low income and with the new rules on housing loans, it is unlikely that they will get a loan from HDB or&nbsp;a commercial bank to buy the next flat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realistically, what can we do to get them out of this rut?&nbsp; How can we help them to downgrade, wipe their slates clean and lighten their burden so that they can start afresh and move on?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</B> Sir, many have spoken about downgraders and their plight.&nbsp; I do not pretend to understand the intricacies of HDB financial rules.&nbsp; I just like to ask a simple question: who is going to help the downgraders?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB says that they will give loans only for upgraders but I fail to see the<p align=left>Column: 1629<p> logic. Those who want to upgrade, most, if not all the time, have the means to do so.&nbsp; And if they do not have the means to do so, they probably could obtain loans from private banks. The opposite is true for downgraders.&nbsp; I do not want to ask the Minister to answer any questions but I just like to propose four things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;can we reverse this policy of granting loans only to those who are upgrading and to give loans to those who are downgrading?&nbsp; They are not asking for handouts. They are prepared to pay market rate of interest but they are not being given the loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, &nbsp;can we have, as many MPs have said, more three-room flats?&nbsp; DPM Lee has explained that we no longer can see the growth rates that we have seen before.&nbsp; It is obvious that many residents now will think that they have over-spent and they want to downgrade.&nbsp; I genuinely see that they do want to downgrade and it is not that they are trying to make a profit from having HDB flats. Can we build more three-room HDB flats?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, can we review our rental rules because they have been the cause of many MP letters in&nbsp;their meet-the-people&nbsp;sessions, asking for accommodation simply because even downgrading is not an option - for those who are unemployed, for those who have lost their jobs, retrenched and as someone has said just now, structural unemployment?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, increase the number of flats for rentals.&nbsp; As Dr Maliki has put it, there are many flats that are vacant and can be used for rental purposes.&nbsp; In Woodlands, I already know of two blocks where nobody is staying there and they were actually reserved for, at one stage, SARS emergency.&nbsp; But right now, nobody is using the flats. Why can we not use them as rental flats?</p></P></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 1630<p>					<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>HDB Pro-family Policies</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, listening to my parliamentary colleagues just now, we can&nbsp;hear that we try to express two key words - flexibility and choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, young Singaporeans are getting married at an older age.&nbsp; One of the reasons is that they need to save up for their dream homes.&nbsp; Would&nbsp;MND be prepared to make available the option of additional rental housing or studio apartments for young Singaporeans who want to get married but have not saved up enough for their HDB flats?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must applaud HDB for implementing the Staggered Downpayment Scheme.&nbsp; I would like HDB to consider reducing the downpayment from 20% to 10% for young married couples, similar to the Confirmed Government Officers Scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like also to ask HDB how many young Singaporeans buying resale HDB flats near their parents are successful in applying for the HDB housing grant.&nbsp; Would HDB consider increasing the quantum of the housing grant to encourage more young Singaporeans to live near to their parents?&nbsp; I actually&nbsp;know that my colleagues in this House - Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, myself, Lily Neo, Halimah and Cynthia - we all live together with our own parents or parents-in-law.&nbsp;They really help us a lot.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to&nbsp;make another suggestion: HDB should try to develop pro-family programmes.&nbsp; Regulators like URA, BCA and NParks must ensure adequate provision of family-friendly equipment and facilities in public places, parks and gardens. This should be barrier-free with ramps provided and lifts installed for the benefit of expectant mothers, young children and the elderly.&nbsp; I am sure we have observed some of the<p align=left>Column: 1631<p> hawker centres are on the second floor. We must help the young children, expectant mothers and the elderly to get into these places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shopping centres and other places should be required to provide breast-feeding rooms for mothers or diaper changing stations which both mothers and fathers can use. After all, we are talking about shared responsibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will MND also consider increasing the planning norms for childcare and infant care centres so that these facilities are more accessible in the HDB neighbourhood, shopping area, business area and workplace?&nbsp; By doing this, I am sure the Ministry of Community Development and Sports can develop more childcare centres in the business and shopping areas.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Sir, I thank the many Members&nbsp;who have spoken and taken such a keen interest in the various public housing issues.&nbsp; Before I respond specifically to their questions, may I have a few moments to give a quick overview of the public housing policies.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last few years, we have seen a few major changes in public housing policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a&nbsp;start, with the implementation of bank origination, HDB farmed out its market rate loans to commercial banks. So now, flat buyers who take bank loans have a much wider choice of loan packages, but, of course, at the same time, they have to be subject to the credit assessment rules of the banks which&nbsp;are not a bad thing in the sense that&nbsp;they encourage financial prudence.&nbsp; Also, in the same spirit of giving the owners more choice and encouraging greater self-reliance, we have relaxed the rules at the same time to make it easier for them, amongst other <p align=left>Column: 1632<p>things, to resell or sublet their flats in order to monetise this very important asset.&nbsp; This is exactly in line with what Dr Maliki mentioned just now about the concept of home ownership - a person having a stake and being able to make use of that stake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major change took place in July 2003 when we corporatised HDB's Building and Development Division to form a company known as HDB Corp. As a result of this restructuring, HDB today is a much leaner organisation with a clearer focus on the core functions of being a public housing authority, as Mr Iswaran mentioned just now.&nbsp; It has, at the same time, allowed HDB Corp to export its expertise which it is beginning to do, and it has paved the way for greater private sector participation in our public housing programme, something which I will elaborate on later&nbsp;in response to Dr Khor's questions.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these changes are significant and major, and I am pleased to note that they have been implemented smoothly.&nbsp; I attribute this mainly to the very harmonious relations between the management and the unions of HDB.&nbsp; I would like to place on record my appreciation of board members like Mdm Halimah who was instrumental in helping us to implement these very major wrenching changes in a relatively smooth manner.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the years ahead, we are going to consolidate these measures and focus on their implementation in order to ensure that our public housing programmes remain relevant and in tune with other changes in the economy and our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the major outcomes of our review is to re-focus HDB on its core function - to deliver quality, affordable housing to our people. As part of this review, we have examined the public-private housing mix in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Dr Amy <p align=left>Column: 1633<p>Khor mentioned just now that the target for public-private housing mix is something like 75:25.&nbsp; This is a long-term objective. Currently, the proportion of public housing is something like 80-81%.&nbsp; So to drop from 81% to 75% may seem small in percentage terms, but, in actual fact, it is an extremely big drop.&nbsp; Because if we look at the stock of public housing in Singapore,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>800,000 units, you will see that this is a very major task and, therefore, it has to be done gradually over a long period of time and at a pace which the housing market can absorb and such that&nbsp; the housing needs, the demands, the aspirations of Singaporeans can be met at the same time.&nbsp; So this change will be gradual.<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="15" Minute="45">3.45 pm</st1:time></p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our immediate focus is to phase in the private sector participation in the development of public housing from July 2006 onwards.&nbsp; Members will recall when I announced the formation of HDB Corp, I indicated that, in the first year of liberalisation, 2006 onwards, 10%&nbsp; of HDB's building programme will be opened up to the private sector, and thereafter it will be followed by 30% in the second year and 50% in the third year.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MND is currently studying ways to open up the public housing market to the private sector.&nbsp; One way is to just outsource the design and consultancy part of the project.&nbsp; This part is currently undertaken by HDB Corp and we can just outsource this part to the private sector.&nbsp; In other words, a straightforward transfer.&nbsp; Another option is to use the design and build method.&nbsp; This design and build method is not something new.&nbsp; This has been practised in some HDB projects already.&nbsp; Under this option, private companies will undertake the design and build works for HDB as one package.&nbsp; A third option is to allow the private sector to take over the whole development of HDB flats.&nbsp; In other words, design, build<p align=left>Column: 1634<p> and sell the new HDB flats.&nbsp; This means that private sector developers will tender for the land, build the flats, and price the flats for sale.&nbsp; And, as a result of that, they will bear the market risk in the process.&nbsp; This is along the lines of what Dr Khor mentioned just now, the reverse tender process, whereby the developer sets the price, except that in the case of a reverse tender system, the price will actually be fixed by the authority - by HDB. There are some problems associated with this option which I will elaborate on later.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcome of this study is going to have a very significant impact on the nature of public housing in the years ahead.&nbsp; It is, therefore, very important for us to take our time to study carefully the implications before we finally take a decision on this.&nbsp; But, whatever the option we choose, with greater private sector participation in the public housing market, I believe that Singaporeans can look forward to more choice, greater variety in public housing, and I think that is for the good and that is something we should go for.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many Members have spoken about the issue of affordability of HDB flats and I think this is particularly relevant in these last few years when there have been economic uncertainties, CPF cuts and now flexible wages.&nbsp; Sir, affordability is always a contentious issue and Encik Zainul Abidin Rasheed said just now that public perception is that HDB flats are not cheap.&nbsp; HDB always responds that, "No, public housing is affordable.&nbsp; Cheap and affordable."&nbsp; Are we talking about the same thing?</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, recently I visited a public housing flat in <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>.&nbsp; This was a 55 sq metre flat, smaller than our 3-room flat, close to a studio apartment.&nbsp; The elderly couple who had just bought the flat paid HK$1.5 million.&nbsp; Roughly it is about S$320,000 for a 55 sq metre flat.&nbsp; But<p align=left>Column: 1635<p> when I spoke to them they were very, very proud.&nbsp; In fact, they said they were very lucky to get this flat.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; A private flat of that size in <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> would cost much more.&nbsp; Was that flat cheap?&nbsp; To the owner, it was very affordable.&nbsp; They were obviously very house proud.&nbsp; The house was very well furnished, just husband and wife.&nbsp; Then they also told me that their son had emigrated to Singapore, I think something like seven years ago, working with the SMRT, and recently bought an HDB Executive flat (130 sq metre), more than twice the size of the parents' flat in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Price - about the same - $320,000.&nbsp; And, they said that their son was even luckier than them - to be able to buy such a nice flat in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> for the same price.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what does this tell us?&nbsp; The <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> couple's 55 sq metre flat is not cheap by <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s standards, but it is very affordable to them, because the wages there are higher.&nbsp; The son's flat in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, which is cheap by <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>'s standard, but not by <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s standard, is also affordable to him.&nbsp; In other words, what is affordable varies from place to place and, indeed, from time to time as well.&nbsp; And it is dependent on many factors, like the cost of living, income levels, people's expectation of what kind of quality of life they want, what kind of flat they want to buy.&nbsp; So it can be rather subjective.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a better and a more objective way of trying to assess affordability is to take the monthly mortgage instalments that a household has to pay, and compare that with the gross monthly income.&nbsp; This is known as the debt-service ratio.&nbsp; So you take the mortgage instalments and you divide that by the household income, what is the percentage of your household income that you spend on housing to pay off your loan.&nbsp; At last year's prices, those<p align=left>Column: 1636<p> who bought 3 and 4-room flats from HDB needed to use, on average, less than 20% of their monthly income to service their monthly mortgage loans.&nbsp; In other words, they had a debt-service ratio of less than 20%.&nbsp; A debt service ratio of 20%, I submit, is reasonable and affordable by any standard.&nbsp; Buyers would generally be able to service their loans, this 20%, using their CPF funds alone.&nbsp; In other words, they do not have to come up with any cash, even after the cut in the CPF ordinary account rate in October last year.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well within the debt-service ratio guideline of 40% which is adopted by financial institutions when they do credit assessment for granting of mortgage loans.&nbsp; It is also in line with international benchmarks of household expenditures on housing, which are typically between 25% and 30%.&nbsp; So, Sir, in answer to many Members' concerns, there is really no need to be worried that HDB flats are today not affordable to the majority of Singaporeans.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mdm Cynthia Phua were concerned about the impact of the flexible wage system on buyers.&nbsp; Sir, HDB monitors wage trends very closely and, as I have said in this House, if it is necessary, they will adjust the prices to ensure that they remain affordable.&nbsp; But individuals must also exercise prudence and choose a flat that is well within their means, bearing in mind that buying a home is a long-term commitment.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo asked whether we can, through reducing the construction cost of flats, make HDB flats more affordable.&nbsp; Let me emphasise that the affordability of households, and not construction cost, is the key consideration when we price HDB flats.&nbsp; In other words, we look at the resale flat prices and as resale flat prices move, the new flat prices will also move in tandem, in such a way that they will remain affordable.&nbsp; 3-room flats, we have undertaken to make them affordable to as <p align=left>Column: 1637<p>many as 90% of Singaporeans; 4-room flats, 70% of Singaporeans.&nbsp; But, having said that, it is still important for us to make sure that construction costs are kept as low as possible.&nbsp; And I want to assure the Member that HDB does that through many means - through the use of construction technologies, like prefabrication, using value-for-money materials, and so on. But I just want to add&nbsp; that while we can ensure that new flats are affordable, we cannot ensure that prices of resale flats are affordable.&nbsp; It is something that has got to be determined by the market and based on willing buyer and willing seller.&nbsp; But for new flats,&nbsp; they will be made affordable.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, another point on the issue of affordability, some Members have suggested that HDB consider offering shorter leases - 30-year leases.&nbsp; Those who are familiar with valuations know, and here Dr Amy Khor may be able to bear me out, there is no straight line correlation between the length of the lease and the price of the flat.&nbsp; So, if you were to say, shorten the lease, from 99 years to 60 years, it does not correspondingly reduce the cost of development by one-third.&nbsp; In fact, the valuers say it will just reduce the cost marginally, say, by about 10%.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason is because land cost and property prices do not vary proportionately with the length of the lease.&nbsp; on the other hand, there are also some major shortcomings with shorter leases.&nbsp; Those who have properties with short leases would know that such flats depreciate in value very quickly.&nbsp; And, when you try to sell them, it is very, very difficult to do so.&nbsp; When you try to obtain financing for them, it is also very difficult.&nbsp; So, I think, in view of these concerns, my view is that shorter leases would not be well received by most Singaporeans.&nbsp; Yes, we do offer shorter leases.&nbsp; Studio apartments are on 30-year leases for the elderly.&nbsp; Shops are on 30-year leases.&nbsp; But<p align=left>Column: 1638<p>I would hesitate to extend such short leases across the board to other flats, without careful consideration.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now touch on the issue of 3-room flats.&nbsp; Many Members have asked whether and how Government will ensure that there are sufficient 3-room flats available because such flats are more affordable, and they are in greater demand now from various categories of people.&nbsp; We have reviewed our policy on 3-room flats as part of the overall review of the role of the HDB, and let me now share with the House our key conclusions.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, the profile of flats sold by HDB has changed, as many Members of Parliament have observed, and this is in tandem with changes in Singaporeans' expectations and living standards.&nbsp; In the 1960s, HDB built predominantly 1- and 2-room flats&nbsp; and that was primarily to ease the very acute housing shortage at that time.&nbsp; Later, HDB started to build 3-room flats, then 4-room flats, 5-room flats and even Executive flats as people wanted better and better housing, bigger and bigger flats.&nbsp; In 1985, HDB stopped building 3-room flats because there was simply very little demand for 3-room flats.&nbsp; Everybody was going for 4-room flats, 5-room flats, and bigger.&nbsp; Subsequently, in 1995, HDB stopped building the top-end Executive flats, preferring to let the private sector build ECs instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1985, HDB has built 3-room flats only in selected SERS replacement sites, and this is to cater for the 3-roomers who still have a preference for these 3-room flats.&nbsp; So to meet their rehousing needs, we have continued to build 3-room flats for the replacement sites. Now, only 4-room and larger flats are offered for sale to the public.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the housing needs of low-income families earning $2,000 per month and below, there is a 3-room flat buy-back scheme, whereby HDB buys back 3-room flats<p align=left>Column: 1639<p> from the resale market, then resells them at subsidised prices to these low-income eligible households.<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="16" Minute="0">4.00 pm</st1:time></p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I relate this history to reinforce the point that the situation has changed over the years - demand has changed, aspirations have changed. And HDB has had to keep pace with those changes.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, the prices of 3-room flats have risen sharply, in part, due to the growing demand from singles and also from downgraders. Last year alone, the average valuation of 3-room flats increased by 17.6%. At the same time, the proportion of 3-room flats in our housing stock has declined as a result of a stop in the building programme in 1985. So today, our stock of 3-room flats consists of 220,000, which is about 27% of all HDB flats. When we stopped in 1985, 3-room flats accounted for more than half, or 52%, of the total housing stock.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MND has been monitoring these trends carefully. Although the demand from downgraders may abate once the economy picks up, it is also possible that there will be sustained demand for 3-room flats in the future, due to our changing demographics or aging population, as older lessees may opt to downgrade to a 3-room flat so that they cash out and have more to meet their retirement needs.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am pleased to inform the House and the Members who have spoken in support today that HDB will resume building 3-room flats for sale to the public. This is in line with HDB's core mission of providing affordable, quality housing. The new 3-room flats will be offered for sale under the Build-To-Order (BTO) system, and this is to avoid over supply because we try to match the supply and demand as far as we can. <p align=left>Column: 1640<p>Under the BTO system, a contract will only proceed to tender if demand is above a certain minimum benchmark level. The first contract will be launched in the second half of this year, and more details will be released when the flats are ready for offer. We will assess the response and then adjust the supply accordingly.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we will continue to build new 3-room flats in SERS replacement sites. And those balance units that are not taken up by the SERS lessees will then be offered for sale to the members of the general public.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The income ceiling for the purchase of these new 3-room flats will be set at a higher level than the current income ceiling for the sale of 3-room buy-back flats. It will be set at $3,000. This is higher than the ceiling of $2,000 for the same 3-room buy-back flats, but this is still lower than the $8,000 for the purchase of 4-room and larger flats. The reason for this is that we want to ensure that the 3-room flats that we are building will continue to be kept for those who are in the 50th percentile and below, which is what the income ceiling of $3,000 represents. All those who have household incomes higher than the 50th percentile should, strictly speaking, go for the 4- and 5-room flats. All the other eligibility conditions, such as citizenship, household nucleus, etc, will continue to apply.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I now turn to the question by Dr Teo on the supply and demand of HDB flats. Dr Teo asked how HDB projects housing demand. This is a very difficult task, I assure him. Housing demand is very dynamic. It is affected by many factors - state of the economy, employment outlook, confidence level, the demographics, such as household formation, the profile of the population and so on. Demand can also change quickly due to unforeseen circumstances. The SARS crisis last year had a significant and immediate impact and housing <p align=left>Column: 1641<p>demand fell sharply, both new as well as resale and, of course, in the private sector as well.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it is very essential for HDB to have a flexible and yet responsive flat supply and allocation mechanism. What HDB has implemented last year, Build-to-Order system, meets this objective, as flats are only built when there is sufficient take-up and demand. Yes, it does create some uncertainty, as Dr Khor pointed out, but I submit that that is part and parcel of letting people be aware that we cannot simply be building ahead of demand, having flats ready waiting for buyers. And if the buyers, for one reason or another, change their mind, we have those flats just sitting on the shelf. That is an untenable situation and this is the reason why there is a need for us to better match supply and demand through the BTO system.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is not the only way we allocate flats, as the last few years have demonstrated. Other than the BTO system for new contracts, we have also implemented the Balloting Exercise (BE), whereby surplus SERS flats in mature estates that are no longer needed for rehousing the SERS lessees are put up for balloting for members of the public. We&nbsp; use the balloting method because these flats in the mature estates are in very high demand and is always over-subscribed many times. So, we need to allocate them by ballot.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third method of allocation is the Walk-in-Selection (<st1:State><st1:place>WIS</st1:place></st1:State>) scheme. This is used in situations when there is ample supply of flats. In the non-mature estates, for example, in Jurong and Woodlands where there is ample supply, applicants can walk in and literally pick a flat off the shelf. They can buy it at any time. This is even better than what Dr Khor was suggesting -- to have a <st1:State><st1:place>WIS</st1:place></st1:State> every day. This is more than every day. This is 24 <p align=left>Column: 1642<p>hours if you use the Internet. This is a very effective system for clearing surplus flats in non-mature estates.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has this been successful? Has HDB been proactive, pro-consumer, pro-market? I believe it has and I think the results show for themselves. It has started to build show flats. It has conducted tours of the estates in which they are trying to sell the flats, to try and interest buyers, to show the buyers what a wonderful estate they are moving into. This is where, I believe, the work of Members of Parliament and the work of the Town Councils have an impact. Because where the estate is well maintained, well provided in facilities, that is a great plus for buyers.&nbsp; The HDB has also taken up television advertisements and advertisements in the newspapers. Last, but not least, and very importantly, they have also adjusted their pricing. Obviously, they cannot&nbsp; keep their prices fixed and expect buyers to accept whatever they sell those flats at. Yes, HDB has been able to learn from the private sector and has adjusted its practices accordingly, with success.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua asked about the number of flats that have not been taken up. Currently, HDB has about 10,000 flats available for sale - about 8,000 in the non-mature estates and 2,000 in the mature estates. They are continuing to market them and to sell them to people through the various allocation systems.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me respond to Mrs Yu-Foo's questions about pro-family policies. I think HDB's policies are very pro-family. For example,&nbsp; under the balloting exercise, couples are given priority allocation if they want to buy flats near their parents through some weightage system. Although it is a balloting exercise, they are given additional weightage. So far, the records show that about 40% of all applicants have taken advantage of this<p align=left>Column: 1643<p> scheme. So, it is a very high percentage of people who have benefited from such priority allocation scheme.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who choose to buy a resale flat near their parents also enjoy a higher housing grant of $40,000, instead of $30,000 for the others. Again, more than 50% of couples take advantage of this. This is already very generous and we do not have any plans to increase the housing grant any further.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the public rental scheme, those who are earning $1,500 monthly and above, we have liberalised the subletting rules, again, allowing more young couples, if they so wish, to rent.&nbsp; If they do not wish to rent from HDB, they can rent from the open market.&nbsp; Again, we have relaxed the subletting rules.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB estates are also designed to be family-friendly, whether it is in terms of ramps, void deck space for elderly care or childcare facilities, or whether it is in terms of elder friendly features in their flats. The provision of sufficient elderly care, infant care, childcare facilities in the HDB estates is something that is looked at very closely.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall every time I visit the branch offices and I get a briefing from them, one of the main briefing items is on the provision of facilities, especially facilities for children, elderly, kindergarten facilities, social day-care facilities and so on. And there are planning norms in place for each of these facilities. Where the facilities are not up to the norm, additional facilities are provided. I would like to assure the Member that these pro-family policies will continue to be in place and monitored closely.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, let me move on to an issue which has attracted the attention of many Members of this House and rightly so, and<p align=left>Column: 1644<p> this is the concern about providing assistance to households who are in financial difficulty.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a general guiding principle, the Government will help those who are prepared to help themselves. In this regard, Members know that HDB has put in&nbsp;place a wide array of financial assistance measures to help flat lessees who have difficulty paying their mortgage loan instalments. They can extend their loan repayment. They can defer in certain cases. They can reduce their local instalments in other cases. By and large, I think these schemes have come in very handy and there are many flat owners who have taken advantage of these schemes to tide over their temporary financial hardships.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, as always, there are those who cannot be helped by these schemes. They are in severe financial hardship. And I agree with Members that downgrading to a smaller flat, a more smaller flat, a more affordable flat, would be effective in alleviating their financial burdens. Dr Maliki, Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed and Prof. Chin have also asked whether HDB can grant concessionary loans to downgraders purchase another flat, whether we should change the policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Prof. Chin, I am not supposed to answer, but I will anyway.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something that has occupied the minds of the Ministry and HDB. Ever since we ceased the granting of concessionary market rate loans for flat buyers, since <st1:date Month="1" Day="1" Year="2003">1st January 2003</st1:date>, we have had a considerable number of requests or appeals from people wanting to continue to have a market rate loan from HDB because</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Let me explain, first of all, that when we implemented this policy, we wanted<p align=left>Column: 1645<p> to ensure that subsidised loans are given to those who need them most.&nbsp; There was a time when you could actually go to HDB to get not just the first subsidised loan, not just the second subsidised loan, you could even get a third subsidised loan from HDB.&nbsp; Obviously, it is not tenable for us to continue to have such a generous loan policy.&nbsp; Not only does it encourage over consumption, but I think there is a limit as to how much money we should put aside for housing loan subsidies.&nbsp; And we should really target those who need it most, ie, the first timers and those who are able to upgrade as to encourage them to better themselves.&nbsp; Those who have already enjoyed a concessionary loan, or who are buying a flat of the same or smaller size, are not eligible for a loan because, generally, when they sell their bigger flats, they have in hand a considerable sum of money as a result of the sale of their flats.&nbsp; So the proceeds from the sale of their flats are sufficient for them to either buy a smaller flat or to rent a flat.&nbsp; This is the reason why we have limited the second loan and not allowed&nbsp; them to take a second loan.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of flat buyers who have approached the banks and the financial institutions for a second loan have been able to do so successfully.&nbsp; But, of course, again the small numbers who are not able to do so for a variety of reasons have come back to HDB for concessionary loan.&nbsp; I explained in this House last year that HDB would exercise flexibility and would grant another concessionary loan to downgraders who are in severe financial hardships, and these include retrenchment or severe pay cuts, or business failure, illness, death of the breadwinner, and so on.&nbsp; This is a temporary measure.&nbsp; It will help lessees to cope with the CPF changes that were implemented last year as well as the economic downturn.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to inform the House that so far, we have processed more than 600 <p align=left>Column: 1646<p>appeals for such concessionary loans.&nbsp; We have approved about 12%, about 80 of them.&nbsp; And the majority of the unsuccessful appeals were rejected mainly on two grounds.&nbsp; The first was when the lessees were deemed to be able to finance their flat purchase from the sales proceeds of their existing flats.&nbsp; So when you consider the proceeds from your flats and you net off the outstanding loan, in many cases, they would have quite a large sum of money which would enable them to buy or rent another flat.&nbsp; But the second category are those who are really not financially ready to buy a flat in the first place.&nbsp; In other words, they did not meet HDB's credit assessment guidelines either because they did not have a job or they had already extended themselves in other areas.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, HDB will continue to exercise flexibility during this period.&nbsp; It will take into account buyer's economic circumstances and, of course, if MPs come across such cases, I would urge them to either write to the Ministry, myself, my MOS or my SPS, and we will consider their requests for concessionary loans taking into account, as I said, their individual circumstances.&nbsp; But the policy on not granting concessionary rate loans to those categories of people will remain.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now turn to the issue of rental flats or, more correctly, the issue of home ownership versus rental.&nbsp; Again, many Members have asked what are our plans to meet the increasing demand for rental flats.&nbsp; They have brought up this very fundamental issue which is whether we should continue with our home ownership policy or whether we should move towards some kind of a rental policy. Which is better for us?&nbsp; Sir, home ownership is the foundation of our public housing programme.&nbsp; It has been a success.&nbsp; Over 85% of Singaporeans live in HDB flats and the majority of them, almost 95% of them, own their flats today.&nbsp; This is something that I believe is <p align=left>Column: 1647<p>to be proud of.&nbsp; Because I do not believe there is any other country in the world, developed or developing, that is able to claim this.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we deliberately restructure our public housing policies and subsidies so that a higher proportion live in subsidised rental housing permanently or for a long period of time?&nbsp; Public housing is more than just providing a roof over people's head.&nbsp; It plays a very critical social role in getting people rooted to the country.&nbsp; It gives people a sense of belonging and to own a home is to own a part of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; It is what makes <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> worth contributing to and worth defending.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We remain committed to encouraging home ownership.&nbsp; Social cohesion is critical, especially for a young and small country like ours, and to give Singaporeans a stake in the country, a stake in the nation, through home ownership is, I believe, the critical bedrock upon which we have achieved social stability and engendered&nbsp; a sense of community and belonging to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; So I would like to urge Members to continue to support the home ownership policy.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, I agree that as our economy restructures, there will always be some low income households who may have difficulty sustaining home ownership.&nbsp; There will always be those, like the young couples that Mdm Yu-Foo mentioned, who are not ready to commit to home purchase.&nbsp; So for these people, subsidised rental housing may be a better option until they are ready and able to buy a HDB flat.&nbsp; For the low income, we have the Public Rental Scheme and October last year, the Government made subsidised rental housing more readily available for the lower income households by raising the monthly household income ceiling, from $800 to $1,500.&nbsp; So far, <p align=left>Column: 1648<p>about one quarter of the 300 rental applications every month&nbsp; - about 70 to 80 of them come from families earning between $800 and $l,500, and these were families which hitherto had not been able to rent from HDB.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then for those who do not wish, not that they cannot afford, but do not wish for whatever reason, to buy a HDB flat.&nbsp; HDB has relaxed the subletting rules last year to allow more flat owners to sublet their whole flats.&nbsp; I hope that through this way, and over time, a thriving viable rental market in public housing will be created.&nbsp; So far, more than 700 flat owners have rented out their whole flats.&nbsp; They have moved in with their children or they have moved to other properties.&nbsp; But it has been a win-win, they have been able to get rental income, at the same time some of these young couples would have a chance to rent some of their flats.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have no plans to provide rental housing for the better off, for those whose household incomes exceed $1,500.&nbsp; The reason is very simple because, based on current HDB prices, HDB flats are actually very affordable.&nbsp; You consider that your mortgages actually can be paid out from CPF whereas your rental cannot, then I think you will realise that it makes very good sense, not just from the investment point of view, but also from the cashflow point of view, to actually buy rather than rent.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I come to the 30-month debarment policy, many Members again have asked whether we can relax this policy of 30-month debarment for HDB lessees as well as private property owners from renting a flat.&nbsp; Why is this policy necessary?&nbsp; We really want to prevent the existing property owners from competing for subsidised rental housing with other low income families who may have more pressing housing needs.&nbsp; Our housing stock for rental flats is limited and we <p align=left>Column: 1649<p>really need to make sure that it goes to those who are in greater need for those flats.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, again, HDB does exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis and we do waive the 30-month waiting period if the persons are in severe financial hardship and they are not able to afford alternative housing after the sale of their property.&nbsp; Again, I urge Members of the House to bring any cases that they may have to our attention, in case some of these cases may have slipped through the cracks.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to assure Members of the House that HDB will continue to ensure that there are adequate rental flats to meet the demand for such flats among the low income families.&nbsp; But even as we make subsidised rental flats more available to more people, we have to be careful that we do not give rental subsidies to all and sundry.&nbsp; We need to target the rental subsidies to those who need the most.&nbsp; And those whose financial situations have improved, those who are renting flats and have improved their financial status should be encouraged to take home ownership instead.&nbsp; This would then free up the rental flats for those who are truly needy.&nbsp; I think I had mentioned this to Members of the House previously.&nbsp; HDB intends to convert all those rental tenants, existing tenancies, which are open ended, to term tenancy and to implement income-based rental.&nbsp; But, of course, it would take into account the economic situation before doing so and any adjustments would be done in phases.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" align="center"><b>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</b></p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="16" Minute="25">4.25 pm</st1:time></p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in conclusion, let me say that I do understand why many Members of this House consistently and continuously <p align=left>Column: 1650<p>ask HDB to exercise greater flexibility in the implementation of these rules, whether you are talking about the 30-month debarment rule or you are talking about granting of additional concessionary loans.&nbsp; These rules were introduced to curb excesses and to prevent over consumption and they are still appropriate and necessary.&nbsp; But I wish to assure Members of the House that HDB will exercise flexibility at the margins, will be sympathetic and will assist those who are in genuine hardship.&nbsp; Even so, I hope Members will understand that not all the cases that they bring up, or appeal for on behalf of their constituents, will be approved.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, as I said at the start, we have made several significant changes in our public housing policies and this is necessary to keep pace with the changing economy and society.&nbsp; Going forward, even as we consolidate the measures that we have implemented, we will keep on reviewing our policies and programmes to ensure that they remain relevant to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Singaporeans.&nbsp; But our commitment remains unchanged, and that is, we will provide quality, affordable housing to the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Kian Min:</B> Madam, a few years ago, the Government introduced the HDB Main and Interim Upgrading Programmes as our older estates built in the previous era were in need of improvement.&nbsp; Compared to the newer estates, these older estates looked rundown and there was a danger of them turning into slums.&nbsp; A few years later, the Lift Upgrading Programme was introduced so that lifts stop at every floor to serve the residents who were getting older and less mobile.&nbsp; These programmes were launched during the years of plenty when we enjoyed strong growth,&nbsp;rising property prices and budget surpluses.&nbsp; Now we have to tighten our belts and cut back on non-productive expenditure, and sensibly so.&nbsp; As DPM and Minister for Finance has emphasised, we have to live within our means.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the need for upgrading remains the same, if not even more urgent, as our older estates are getting older with the passage of time, and our <p align=left>Column: 1652<p>residents are also getting older and, hence, more in need of having the lift stopping on their floor.&nbsp; In every housing estate, there are some precincts that are fortunate to be upgraded and others that are still waiting their turn.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether the plan is still to upgrade them all.&nbsp; If that is still the plan, at the pace forecasted, over what timeframe will we be able to achieve this?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Madam, the highly publicised stalled upgrading works at Marine Terrace has caused many HDB residents to be wary of upgrading whereas they had previously eagerly awaited their turn for the precinct to be called "Yet Another HDB Upgrading Precinct".&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the hiccups, such as the falling windows, delays and complaints of poor workmanship, all things being equal, upgrading has generally improved the value of HDB flats and the living environment for residents.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for the MUP projects that receive the go-ahead, I urge the Ministry to review the upgrading package, cut away the frills and concentrate on the truly important components.&nbsp; In these days of belt-tightening and keeping in view the need for economy for long-term maintenance, the improvements planned need to be practical and useful to the residents.&nbsp; This will also help to make the cost more affordable to residents who have to co-pay more in the case of MUP.&nbsp;&nbsp;In one estate, the voting went narrowly against the upgrading programme to the chagrin of those who supported it.&nbsp; This is unfair to the majority.&nbsp; Presumably, this occurred because the dissenters do not wish or do not have the means to pay for their share.&nbsp; Having a more basic package could help make this more affordable and reduce the risk of this occurring.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of IUP-Plus, where lifts are added to every floor, with affected residents paying only a very small share, the majority of residents welcomed the<p align=left>Column: 1653<p> initiative.&nbsp; In this case, the perennial bugbear is the exclusion of the 4-storey walk-up flats in the Lift Upgrading Programme.&nbsp; The reason given by the Government for the exclusion has always been the high cost of adding lifts to these flats for a relatively small number of beneficiaries.&nbsp; However, with an ageing population, having lifts on each floor is fast becoming a basic necessity and not a choice.&nbsp; I would, therefore, urge the Ministry to adopt this new attitude of never-say-never to reconsider adding lifts to such walk-up flats.&nbsp; Advancement in technology and innovative designs could help to minimise costs.&nbsp; Otherwise, another option would be to tear down these blocks and consider alternative uses for the vacant site.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The present package of Interim Upgrading plus Lift Upgrading is still much cheaper than the Main Upgrading Programme.&nbsp; The cost of one MUP precinct is equivalent to four or five IUP plus LUP precincts. With this saving, many more precincts can now enjoy IUP plus lift access to every floor in the older HDB estates.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister said that there were some 3,000 blocks of flats that qualified for IUP, and it would take about 10 to 15 years to complete the programme. Some old folks told me that by 15 years they most probably would not be around to enjoy the benefits of such upgrading.&nbsp; I would like to ask if the Minister would speed up these projects to finish all the upgrading programmes in, say, five years. This will also help to boost up the presently depressing building industry.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With our ageing problem, lift access to every floor would be a great convenience<p align=left>Column: 1654<p> to our older folks.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Madam, the most pressing need in the entire upgrading programme is really with respect&nbsp;to&nbsp;lift upgrading.&nbsp; Many Members of this House, and I can attest to this personally, those of us whose constituencies have a large number of older flats especially, we see this request repeatedly from the older residents.&nbsp; They bought their flats at a time when there was more spring in their stride, and not having a lift on every floor was not as big an issue.&nbsp; But, today, it has become a major problem.&nbsp; And it is small comfort to them to say: "Wait your turn, bide your time, lift upgrading will come to you in due course."&nbsp; Neither is it satisfactory or reasonable, in my opinion, to tell them, "Why do you not sell your flat and find another that is on a floor with a lift?", one particular reason being that they have lived there for the last 20 to 30 years, this is part of their community.&nbsp; To ask them to upheave and relocate because of a simple matter&nbsp;of a lift seems quite unnecessary and also not consistent with our own policy of trying to preserve communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister:&nbsp;can we not re-allocate resources away from the more grandiose MUP and IUP-type projects towards&nbsp;these basic upgrading programmes like the Lift Upgrading Programme?&nbsp; This way, we can broaden the scale, accelerate the pace and, I think, bring benefit to those who really need it most when we are trying to rejuvenate these older HDB estates in our area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I would also like the Minister to respond to a point I raised under the<p align=left>Column: 1655<p> housing policy section on whether in fact the Government would consider decoupling the subsidy to housing from the purchase of public housing itself.&nbsp; That is one means of discouraging over-consumption of public housing.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</B> Madam, my residents who have enjoyed the upgrading of their estates, and in particular lift access to every floor, have asked me to convey their thanks to the Government.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</B> Madam, there are three upgrading programmes that I want to look into, and I hope the Minister too:&nbsp; the&nbsp;IUP,&nbsp;MUP and&nbsp;LUP.&nbsp; I will leave out SERS, as I will want to talk only on these three subjects.&nbsp; I am asking for a review of IUP, MUP and LUP.&nbsp; IUP is an interim upgrading and only involves the external features; MUP, the internal and the external features; and, of course, lift upgrading - we all know we have to really improve on the lifts.&nbsp; We should marry all these three&nbsp;and just have only one upgrading package.&nbsp; This is to save cost of recurrent upgrading and to avoid too much disruption to the flat owners and also to the environment.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should ask ourselves: what do the residents really need?&nbsp; They need, I think, the lifts to be upgraded; they need the ceiling and interior cracks to be mended; replace the leaking pipes, the electrical <p align=left>Column: 1656<p>wirings and, of course, the windows and walkways.&nbsp; These are what the residents want.&nbsp; So, what I am proposing is that we have a new upgrading package to deal with only all these items.&nbsp; The town councils can come and do the external upgrading, such as the gardening and all these nice environment features.&nbsp; Of course, there is a caveat here: we do not allow them to just do all these changes freely.&nbsp; The Government should give&nbsp;the Town Councils&nbsp;a little bit&nbsp;more of&nbsp; funding&nbsp;for the maintenance and&nbsp;the very essentials.&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;the Town Council Chairmen&nbsp;would not ask too much.&nbsp; We just want to make sure that the environment looks pleasant for all.&nbsp; So, this is the point I want to raise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp;with regard to lift upgrading, I think it should be given free.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because, if you accept my proposal, then there will be&nbsp;a lot of cost saving from the cutting down of the upgrading programmes and this cost saving that I have proposed should go to this lift upgrading.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Lift, being a common facility used by every resident as well as people visiting the block, should actually be treated like&nbsp;IUP items and be given free.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I also urge the Ministry to add this new selection criterion for LUP, using the proportion of the ageing population within a precinct, because the single most important item that elderly residents always ask for is lift accessibility.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Madam, many Members have spoken on this issue of upgrading.&nbsp; Some, like Dr Tan Cheng Bock, have questioned the relevance of the upgrading programmes and suggested that we review them.&nbsp; Others, such as Dr Tan Boon Wan, Mr Ang Mong Seng and Dr Amy Khor, have asked whether we can do more, especially lift upgrading.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first reiterate the importance of upgrading.&nbsp; Upgrading is critical in our efforts to keep our housing estates young.&nbsp; As Members rightly pointed out, our estates are ageing.&nbsp; It is like our population, and we really need to renew the older estates, give them a new lease of life.&nbsp; And if you do not have upgrading, over time, very quickly, HDB estates will deteriorate and will become slums, and I do not think any of us wants to see that happen.&nbsp; If that were so, it&nbsp; would defeat the whole purpose of our home ownership programme, which is to provide good quality, affordable housing for our people.&nbsp; So, by improving the living environment, upgrading gives our residents a sense of ownership and pride in their estate, encourages them to remain, maintain the existing ties in their community, and we are also able then to attract new households to come into those estates and give those estates a boost, greater vitality.&nbsp;

It&nbsp; asks several questions of residents who have lived in completed upgrading precincts.&nbsp; Its latest survey was conducted last year and covered nearly 60,000 households whose flats were upgraded between 1996 and 2002. 95% of the households indicated that they were satisfied with the <st1:place>Main</st1:place> as well as the Interim Upgrading Programmes (MUP/IUP).&nbsp; This satisfaction level was higher than the previous survey conducted in 2000.&nbsp; HDB also asked them what were the items that they found most useful and most appreciated - covered linkways, upgraded lifts, letterboxes and improved toilets within their homes, these are things that were most appreciated.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall support level for upgrading is very strong. The overall support level in all the nine precincts that were polled last year for the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was over 85%. For the MUP, apart from <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Teban</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Gardens</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> which did not meet the 75% requirement, the other six precincts that we polled in 2002 were all well supported, with "Yes" votes ranging from 82% to 95%.&nbsp; In fact, three precincts received more than 90% for upgrading.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the message for us is loud and clear - that upgrading, especially lift upgrading, is still very relevant, very welcome,&nbsp; and still desired by residents. That does not mean that we do not review from time to time the scope of upgrading.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do we need to have co-payment for upgrading?&nbsp; Why do we need to poll for upgrading? Dr Ong Seh Hong, Dr Tan <p align=left>Column: 1659<p>Cheng Bock and others have asked why residents have to pay for lift upgrading. Why not treat it like IUP?</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, contrary to what Members have suggested, lift upgrading is an expensive programme.&nbsp; It is very heavily subsidised by Government.&nbsp; In fact, for some blocks where there are certain physical constraints, the cost of providing lift access to every floor is exceptionally high. If we do not have a co-payment element in it, a lot of our&nbsp; budget for upgrading will be taken up by the Lift Upgrading Programme. Rather than speeding up the programme, we are going to delay the programme even further.&nbsp; Having residents poll and co-pay for the programme actually ensures that the upgrading proceeds at a pace in which people are happy with and gives them a sense of ownership of the programme.&nbsp; It makes them appreciate the programme and realise that if they ask for it, they are prepared for it, then they can have it.&nbsp; On the contrary, if it is free, everybody will be asking for it and it is going to be much more difficult for us to try to assess what is the real need.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also decided that there must be a high threshold of 75% before we implement the programme. Again, this is because there is a co-payment element. If we just have a simple majority, say, 50%, since all residents have to pay their share of the cost, I think it is not a high enough rate.&nbsp; We have set it at 75%, the same rate for the MUP programme. If we can garner 75% "Yes" votes, then I think that 25% or less who did not vote for it, will not feel aggrieved, as it is an overwhelming majority that has chosen to go for lift upgrading.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong suggested that the proportion of elderly residents is a criterion for lift upgrading.&nbsp; I agree with him.&nbsp; In fact, this criterion is implicit in the choice of many <p align=left>Column: 1660<p>of the precincts for Lift Upgrading Programme, although I hope he understands that we also need to have other criteria as well.&nbsp; Otherwise, if we just go for the older precincts based on age, many of the not-so-old estates will not be able to enjoy the upgrading.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min asked whether upgrading itself will continue.&nbsp; The answer, of course, is yes.&nbsp; It is a long-term commitment of the Government but it is subject to our fiscal position, whether we can afford to continue to have upgrading and, if so, at what pace.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far,&nbsp; 310,000 flats or 60% of the flats which are eligible for upgrading have received some form of upgrading, whether it is MUP, IUP or LUP.&nbsp; Considering that we started the upgrading programme in 1990, I think this is quite an achievement, it is quite a rapid pace.&nbsp; As to how quickly we can upgrade the rest, it will largely depend on the resources that we have available.&nbsp; We need to prioritise our budget, so we cannot upgrade all the remaining flats at the pace that Members would like.&nbsp; But I assure the House that we will certainly do as much upgrading as we can, to as many precincts as possible, within&nbsp; the budget allocated for upgrading in my Ministry.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor and Mr Ang Mong Seng, amongst others, asked for lifts for low-rise blocks. I empathise with their call.&nbsp; But, again, it is a question of priority.&nbsp; There are still more than 3,000 high-rise blocks that are eligible for lift upgrading that have not yet received this upgrading and have lifts on every floor.&nbsp; Funds earmarked for lift upgrading are finite.&nbsp; Our priority now is on high-rise blocks, where more residents can benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we make further progress on upgrading the high-rise blocks, we can certainly consider bringing some of the low-rise blocks in at some stage.&nbsp; As has been famously said, "Never say never".</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1661<p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Iswaran has several questions. &nbsp; First of all, I apologise for not answering his questions earlier on the issue of decoupling of subsidies from purchase.&nbsp; I will touch upon this later on if I have some time. He asked if the MUP budget is well-spent.&nbsp; We recognise that the MUP is a programme that needs to be constantly reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant.&nbsp; In fact, in the whole upgrading programme, if we trace it from 1990 to today, we will see that there have been many changes.&nbsp; We introduced LUP in 2001. We introduced IUP Plus in 2002.&nbsp; We reduced the MUP budget per flat in 2002 by something like 30%, so the Standard Package today is about $29,000 where it was about $40,000 before. We reduced the Standard Plus Package from $67,000 to $47,000. Today, we see less of the not-so-essential items like amphitheatres, facade works and extensive landscaping and so on which town councils have fed back to us are more difficult to maintain and therefore to hold off such works if we can. As a result of the reduction in the budget, some of these works have been dropped off the list of things that can be done.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are sensitive to feedback from Advisors and HDB residents when we decide what kind of HDB upgrading programmes to offer.&nbsp; In FY2003, we did not select any new precincts for MUP partly because there are still some precincts that have not yet been polled. We selected 16 IUP Plus and eight LUP precincts, the same as in FY02.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Members, going forward, that careful prioritisation in the upgrading programme will become increasingly important, especially in the context of tighter budgets.&nbsp; I have asked HDB to review the upgrading programmes to see how we can make upgrading even more cost-effective and more beneficial to residents.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1662<p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I have answered the questions on upgrading.&nbsp; Since I have some time, I will respond to Mr Iswaran's question on the decoupling of subsidies from the purchase of flats. Madam, in principle this is a good idea.&nbsp; It makes economic sense.&nbsp; In fact, we have already implemented such a scheme in the form of a housing grant.&nbsp; If you want to buy a resale flat, if you are a first-timer, you can make use of a housing grant - $30,000 if you are buying a flat anywhere and $40,000 if you are buying a flat in close proximity to your parents.&nbsp; You can also use the housing grant for ECs.&nbsp; So, it is not something new.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the question that Mr Iswaran is asking is whether we can do so universally and to apply this housing grant for all flats and also for private flats.&nbsp; These are very important and serious questions to be asked and to be studied.&nbsp; If we are going to allow the use of the grant for new flats, then obviously, the pricing of the new flats cannot be at a subsidised rate.&nbsp; It would have to be at the market rate.&nbsp; Then again, do we allow the housing grant to be used for private developments?&nbsp; There are several serious questions involved there.&nbsp; If you can afford a private flat, do you really need a grant?&nbsp; These are questions which need to be asked and will be studied, especially in the context of our plans to open up the public housing sector to private sector participation through various options, as I have explained earlier. This is obviously one of the areas that we will be looking at.&nbsp; I would like to ask Mr Iswaran if he has got any views on this, to pass them on to the Ministry.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

everything.&nbsp; So, basically, what Dr Tan is asking for is to have MUP for everybody.&nbsp; That is, essentially, what had been happening in the past until we introduced IUP when Members of this House urged a sort of MUP-minus to be implemented because obviously not everybody could wait for MUP.&nbsp; That was the genesis of the IUP.&nbsp; Then came the Lift Upgrading Programme, which is a stand-alone package, separate from the <p align=left>Column: 1664<p>MUP.&nbsp; But, to put it very simply, what Dr Tan is asking is:&nbsp; can we implement MUP for everybody?&nbsp; Keep it to a trimmed down version of the MUP, where you do lift upgrading, works within the flat, some works in the precinct.&nbsp; I think essentially that is what he is asking for.&nbsp; And, yes, as I said, that is part of the review that we are undertaking.&nbsp; He may think that it may be cheaper, but I just like to explain to him that if we put all those items in the list, and the menu starts to get longer and longer, it is not necessarily as cheap as what we are doing today.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

At present, there is no maintenance guide or standard to assist both maintenance organisations and owners to exercise their duties to maintain their buildings properly.&nbsp; Very much is left to the maintenance organisations and contractors to carry out these activities.&nbsp; This is not desirable as our buildings get older and may be less safe to its users.&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, there is a need to emphasise the importance of building maintenance to building owners.&nbsp; The recent window falling incidents clearly show a lack of understanding of responsibility of various stakeholders in the installation of windows.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</B> Madam, in the repairs of ceiling leaks and spalling concrete in old HDB flats, HDB has funded such repairs on a 50-50 basis on the ground of natural deterioration of the material used.&nbsp; HDB is now funding the rivet replacement programme using the same 50-50 principle.&nbsp; During Question Time recently, Minister Mah stated that the rivet problem arose because of three problems - the design, during construction, and maintenance of the windows.&nbsp; It seems that he has assigned a weight of one-third to each of these factors.&nbsp; Madam, the material used in the rivets is aluminium.&nbsp; Enough aeroplanes have fallen off the sky, that even the man-in-the-street would have known that aluminium suffers from the characteristic known as metal fatigue.&nbsp; HDB's decision to switch to stainless steel is a clear admission of the wrong choice of aluminium as a material for window rivets.&nbsp; In fact, it is possible that no amount of maintenance could prevent the ultimate failure of these aluminium rivets.&nbsp; We should put the problem and the responsibility where it belongs, that is, at the design stage when the decision of choice was made.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, when a car manufacturer needs to recall cars because of a design fault, he recalls the cars at his own cost and not at the consumer's cost.&nbsp; The most famous case recently involved the A class cars developed by Mercedes Benz which has a tendency to turn turtle taking corners at a certain speed.&nbsp; Similarly, <p align=left>Column: 1666<p>Madam, as a matter of principle, should not HDB bear 100% of the replacement cost instead of getting residents to co-pay for the mistakes it made way back in the design stage?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The last time this House debated on falling windows of HDB flats, the Minister, I believe,&nbsp;gave the assurance that in the legislation which shall be enacted this year, he shall make provision to allow householders to inspect their own windows.&nbsp; Can the Minister confirm this?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this point of inspection of windows I hope that the Minister, for this time round, at least, can waive the $40 inspection fees on the HDB flat owners.&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin was right when he said it was better to legislate upstream.&nbsp; He said that you need only to legislate to have windows safely designed and safely installed.&nbsp; If you get it right in the beginning, there is no need to legislate downstream.&nbsp; In the light of what Dr Teo said, I would suggest that instead of using casement windows, the HDB should use sliding windows.&nbsp; One architect said that the casement windows, once they are open,&nbsp;act like sails catching the wind.&nbsp; In the high floors, the wind-load increases.&nbsp; I would say that even if the best steel rivets are used, the constant buffeting of the windows shall definitely make the screws come loose.&nbsp; There are about 817,000 HDB flats, not counting private flats, condominiums and commercial office buildings.&nbsp; I shudder to think&nbsp;the number of casement windows that shall be falling in the few years to come.&nbsp; It is safer to replace casement windows with sliding windows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the replacement of windows, I would say that this round the HDB should pay the full cost as advocated <p align=left>Column: 1667<p>by the previous speaker and not let the flat owners pay.&nbsp; Legally, the HDB should be responsible for all fixtures, because they are the land owner.&nbsp; Windows are fixtures and they are the landlord's liability.&nbsp; Be that as it may, it is a bad time to ask Singaporeans to pay more money as many of them are out of jobs.&nbsp; In any event, it was the HDB that initiated the changing of the windows which are now starting to come loose and falling to the ground.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Madam, I have three points to make.&nbsp; The HDB is currently looking into legislation to make it compulsory for home owners to have their windows checked and made safe.&nbsp; Although this legislation is well-meaning because of the serious problem of falling windows, I think there is concern down the ground that the approach may be too drastic.&nbsp; I personally do not expect this law to be arbitrarily invoked against a home owner.&nbsp; As&nbsp;I see it, it is a last resort fall-back position in case there are really errant home owners who refuse to maintain their windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would like to suggest that instead of just falling back on legislation, the HDB should also adopt the softer approach first, of educating home owners on their responsibility to maintain their windows as well as other parts of the flat so that these do not pose any danger to others.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, this process should be an on-going one and not surface only when we have a problem of falling windows.&nbsp; It is true that most home owners sign the lease agreement which stipulates this as their responsibility.&nbsp; But the truth is that not many home owners really read, or even fully understand, all the terms in the lease that they signed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is that I wish to ask the Minister what help or assistance will be given to those who cannot afford to <p align=left>Column: 1668<p>replace their windows.&nbsp; HDB has agreed to pay for half the cost&nbsp;for 43,000 flat owners who had their windows with aluminium rivets installed between 1987 and 1998, but no help for all the others.&nbsp; Other flat owners have to pay their own.&nbsp; The average cost of $190 is still quite hefty for low income, smaller flat owners, some of whom are struggling with unemployment.&nbsp; Could the Minister at least explain what help will be given to them and where can they get this help from?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point is that at the last Parliament sitting, the Minister had said that HDB may agree to allow affected home owners to do their own inspection so that they do not have to cough up the $40 to get a contractor to do the inspection.&nbsp; Can the Minister confirm whether this is indeed now possible?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Quality of HDB Flats</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):&nbsp;</B> Madam, why are there increasing complaints about the quality of HDB flats?&nbsp; And I am not talking about old flats, but of new ones, where defects seem to appear almost right from the day you get your keys.&nbsp; In recent months there has been a spate of letters to newspapers from new home owners with complaints ranging from cracked tiles, faulty doors, doors that do not close properly, leaks from walls, ceilings, peeling paintworks, choked toilets, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a home owner makes a complaint, it can be a very frustrating wait for rectifications to be made.&nbsp; And, even more so when it upsets their plans to move into their new home.&nbsp; Of course, HDB would refer the complaint to the contractor, but then you will find that the contractor would sometimes make all kinds of excuses.&nbsp; If there is a leaking ceiling the contractor might say that it is due to the renovation works going on upstairs.&nbsp; In fact, one writer complained,<p align=left>Column: 1669<p> when he was told that the reason why the paintwork in his apartment peeled off&nbsp; was that it was due to heat from the sun,&nbsp;but then the sun does not even shine into his flat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another contractor told a new home owner that the reason his toilet bowl choked was because someone must have thrown something inside.&nbsp; But then the family had not even moved in!&nbsp; And when it was finally fixed, the silicon seal was not applied&nbsp;and the matter was not properly done.&nbsp; When asked why, the contractor said, "Well, this is a HDB flat.&nbsp; What do you expect?"&nbsp; But, Madam, why not?&nbsp; Why cannot HDB flat buyers expect a reasonable quality?&nbsp; They are not talking about high-class condominium quality, but HDB flats today are not cheap either, and surely it is fair to say that when you put in your life-time savings into a dream home, you do not expect to have quality defects from day one.&nbsp; So while there is a 12-month defects liability period, it can be very frustrating if problems keep cropping up, especially when you are nearing the end of this period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; While HDB has assured the public that all flats are subject to quality checks, the question is whether the checks are stringent enough, and whether there is, in fact, adequate supervision.&nbsp; I suspect too that the problem may have to do with our tendering system.&nbsp; Having won the tenders, because they submitted the lowest bids, and faced with rising costs, contractors may be forced to cut corners.&nbsp; And with the construction industry in the doldrums, I would not be surprised that this is the case.&nbsp; Given the fact that HDB builds far less flats today and, if I am not wrong, it is going to be less than 10,000 units this year, surely it would not be too onerous a task to tighten on the quality control.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<p align=left>Column: 1670<p>Members have asked why HDB residents should bear half, or indeed, all of the cost of retrofitting their windows.&nbsp; Let me first of all explain why we are taking such an apparently drastic action, as Mdm Halimah put it.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of falling windows has risen sharply in recent years.&nbsp; I quoted some statistics in Parliament.&nbsp; In 2001, 17 cases; 2002, 48 cases; 2003, 106 cases.&nbsp; We have been lucky so far.&nbsp; Only&nbsp;three minor injuries have been reported due to falling windows.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>In spite of the increased publicity since BCA and HDB had a joint press conference on 20th February, we have not seen a drop in the number of windows falling.&nbsp; In fact, we have had another 10 new cases since then&nbsp; -&nbsp; three a week.&nbsp; Do we have to wait for somebody to get killed or hurt before we take this seriously?&nbsp; I hope not.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">5.15 pm</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question is: whose responsibility is this?&nbsp; Is it the designer's responsibility, the installer's responsibility or resident's responsibility?&nbsp; To answer that question, I think we have got to go back to why windows fail.&nbsp; They fail due to poor design at the start, poor workmanship when they are installed or poor maintenance.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Architects, developers and contractors have a duty to ensure proper design, manufacture and installation.&nbsp; I agree with Dr Teo, as endorsed by Mr Chiam, that we have to legislate upstream.&nbsp; In other words, we have got to make sure that the architects design it properly; contractors install it properly; the developers make sure that they have the right standards.&nbsp; All these will ensure that we tackle one part of the problem, but this is only part of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because even with proper design and installation, even if it is designed to the highest standard&nbsp;&nbsp; and here I must say&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; it is very well to say that everybody should know that <p align=left>Column: 1671<p>aluminium does not last very long and that we should have switched to stainless steel&nbsp; -&nbsp; but at the time when these windows were installed, the industry standard was aluminium, not just in Singapore, the PSB SPRING standard, but internationally.&nbsp; Everybody installed aluminium casement windows with aluminium rivets.&nbsp; So, even with proper design and installation, windows can become unsafe over time, because you cannot expect the window to be installed and last forever and ever.&nbsp; Windows can become unsafe because they are subject to constant usage and to high wear and tear, like all things.&nbsp; And without regular maintenance and repair, screws, rivets, even stainless steel rivets can break or become loose, causing windows to fall.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of windows which have fallen in HDB flats are between 8-13 years old.&nbsp; It is not as if they were installed and they start falling overnight or within a few years.&nbsp; Three quarters of the windows that fell have been installed by lessees themselves.&nbsp; They were not the original windows.&nbsp; So, it is clear to me that the windows did not fall due to poor design or installation by HDB.&nbsp; HDB has been following the industry's standard.&nbsp; It has installed the windows according to the prevailing quality standards of the time, both new and upgraded flats.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1987 and 1998, aluminum rivets were used because they were the accepted industry standards.&nbsp; Where standards have risen, HDB has followed suit.&nbsp; In fact, HDB was ahead of the industry standard when it switched to stainless steel rivets in 1998, although the revised industry standard was adopted in the year 2000.&nbsp; So, when we talk about apportioning responsibility, we have to accept that it is not entirely the responsibility of the window contractor, developer or installer, but also the <p align=left>Column: 1672<p>responsibility of the owner.&nbsp; I think this is one fact that has to be established.&nbsp; It is not the same as designing a car wrongly, whether it is a Mercedes A class or whatever, and then having to recall those cars.&nbsp; These are things that have been designed according to the standards and yet have failed after many, many years. I think it is fair for all the parties involved to take some responsibility.&nbsp; It is certainly not correct to say that owners are not responsible at all.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the home owner to maintain his windows and other fittings in his flat in good condition.&nbsp; Whether it is stated in the lease or&nbsp; not, I think it is common sense.&nbsp; To argue, therefore, that HDB should continue to pay for the full cost of retrofitting the windows, because they fitted them in the first place, irrespective of how long that has been&nbsp; -&nbsp; five years, 10 years, even 20 years for some of the cases&nbsp; -&nbsp; I think does not make sense.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, to help those flat owners improve the safety of their windows, HDB will carry out a one-off goodwill rivet replacement programme for the casement windows that were earlier installed by HDB, and it will co-share 50% of the cost.&nbsp; And this is strictly on a goodwill basis.&nbsp; Those who are in financial difficulties, as Mdm Halimah asked, can approach HDB Branch Office for assistance, and there can be some consideration made to allow them to pay the retrofitting cost by instalments.&nbsp; But it is not tenable for HDB to pay for those who have retrofitted their windows themselves.&nbsp; The question was asked: what if they cannot afford it?&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; why could they afford to change the windows in the first place?&nbsp; I think in such a circumstance, it is also necessary, if there is a need to, for them to also look at their own windows, inspect them, and if it is necessary to change, they would have to bear the full cost of changing.&nbsp; But where it is a HDB-installed window, then the 50% co-sharing paying kicks in.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1673<p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, even while we are standing here arguing about who is responsible and who should pay, I would like to appeal to all high-rise residents to act now and minimise the danger of falling windows.&nbsp; Act now, check your windows straight away.&nbsp; If they are not in safe condition, get them fixed before they fall off and hurt or kill somebody. HDB residents who are in doubt can approach the Branch Office for assistance.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, what is this all about?&nbsp; It is not about creating jobs for contractors, as some members of the media have mentioned.&nbsp; It is not about HDB ducking responsibility or the Government ducking responsibility.&nbsp; It is about getting residents to play their part in making sure that our high-rise living environment in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is safe and a pleasant one.&nbsp; It is about minimising risk to life and limb.&nbsp; It is about saving lives, and the lives that we save could be our neighbours, friends, loved ones, or even ourselves.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I turn now to Mr Chiam's question about window inspection fee and also the banning of casement windows.&nbsp; Yes, BCA had earlier proposed mandatory periodic inspection of windows.&nbsp; The reason behind that was that they wanted to make sure that the windows are absolutely safe, and there is a certain minimum standard of safety. But as I informed the House last month, I have asked BCA to consider the alternative of allowing home owners, if they so wish, to check the windows themselves, provided they accept this responsibility of ensuring that their windows are in good condition. In other words, if you wish to save $40 and you want to do it yourself, or if you have friends, neighbours or you yourself can do it, by all means.&nbsp; But please make sure that if something is not quite right, you get it fixed.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of whether we should ban casement windows above the 10th <p align=left>Column: 1674<p>floor, I am not an expert on windows, but my experts tell me that casement windows are good for ventilation compared to other types of windows and, that is the reason why they are so widely used, not just in HDB flats but also in private apartments.&nbsp; Indeed, the issue is not really casement windows versus sliding windows.&nbsp; The issue really is whether you take care of your windows, whether you have installed them properly, and whether you have maintained them properly.&nbsp; Even sliding windows have been known to fall if they are not properly maintained.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I come to the questions raised by Mr Tan Soo Khoon about complaints of quality in HDB flats. Why are HDB flats of such poor quality?&nbsp; First of all, I must agree that it is totally reasonable for somebody who buys a HDB flat or any flat for that matter to expect to have in his possession a flat which is of reasonable quality.&nbsp; I think that is a given.&nbsp; I do not think we should make any excuses for that.&nbsp; Having said that, there will always be flats that are not as well built as others.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has been building flats for the last 40 years.&nbsp; By and large, most Singaporeans would acknowledge that the flats that have been built and that they have lived in all these years have been of good quality.&nbsp; This is not a mean feat.&nbsp; Public housing all over the world has been a big challenge for many cities, whether it is developed or developing.&nbsp; In many cities, public housing is seen to be lower quality housing, low-class housing, not built to such high standards, but not in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HDB has, over the years, put in place a comprehensive quality management system to check and to maintain quality, whether it is the design or the construction of the flats.&nbsp; What HDB is doing now is to let BCA separately assess the quality of its flats through<p align=left>Column: 1675<p> what they call the CONQUAS system.&nbsp; This is an acronym which stands for Construction, Quality and Assessment System.&nbsp; This CONQUAS system is a system that has been used by private sector developers to assess the quality of their flats.&nbsp; It is a very detailed assessment of internal quality of the flats&nbsp; -&nbsp; finishes, doors, windows and so on.&nbsp; And there is a score at the end of the day. The score for public housing has gone up from 71.9 in 1997 to 79.3 in 2003, and this is on par with the score for private housing which is 79.4.&nbsp; So, on an objective overall&nbsp; basis, one can say that, over the years, the quality of housing has gone up.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But notwithstanding this, I think we all must expect that defects in individual units do occur -&nbsp; poor workmanship, improper installation, etc&nbsp; -&nbsp; and that is the reason why we have a defects liability period.&nbsp;&nbsp; And all defects within this defects liability period are repaired and rectified free of charge.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has there been an increase in the complaints of quality among HDB flats?&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been an increase.&nbsp; Is it due to a decrease in quality?&nbsp; If you take the CONQUAS' scores as an objective measure, the answer is no.&nbsp; So, what else could be the reason?&nbsp; I asked the private sector developers this question, because I too am concerned about the increase in the complaints.&nbsp; They told me, yes, they have also received an increase in the number of complaints from private buyers.&nbsp; The buyers are getting much more fussy.&nbsp; They check every little nook and cranny and they make sure that everything is perfect.&nbsp; Marble is not the right colour and marble of the wrong grain are also not accepted.&nbsp; And they attribute this to the drop in private property prices.&nbsp; What they told me was that when prices are going up, buyers did not care what the flats <p align=left>Column: 1676<p>look like.&nbsp; They just bought so that in a few years' time, they sell, make money and go off happy.&nbsp; But now they actually look at the flats in minute detail.&nbsp; And when they do so, they find all sorts of things going wrong&nbsp; -&nbsp; some serious, some not so serious.&nbsp; But the fact is that complaints of quality in private sector flats have also gone up.&nbsp; Part of this, I suspect, is also due to the issue of the type of construction workers that we have been getting.&nbsp; So this is where BCA has got to do something to raise the quality of construction.</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

So private condominiums do have problems as well.&nbsp; The difference, of course, is that owners of private condominiums do not write to newspapers to complain and Members of Parliament do not raise their issues on their behalf in this House.&nbsp; But for HDB flats, they will either threaten to write to the newspapers or they will bring it up to the MPs, and the MPs will obviously bring this matter up in the House.&nbsp; That is why you are here for.&nbsp;

But when it comes to the supervision, I think it is the same whether we are building more or less flats because, ultimately, each flat or each project is built according to certain standards, certain specifications at certain prices, and by certain contractors using <p align=left>Column: 1677<p>the same kind of construction workers.&nbsp; So I think there has got to be a much more concerted effort industry wide, not just for HDB flats, and certainly not because we are building less flats.&nbsp; But industry wide, we have got to make sure that the construction quality goes up and this is where I will mention, if you will permit me, some of the things that BCA is doing.<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just last year, there was&nbsp; the launching of the Quality Mark for Good Workmanship Scheme whereby they will supervise more closely the workmanship standards of individual flats, in other words, putting pressure on the contractors to ensure higher quality.&nbsp; How the contractor does it - by putting more manpower, by increasing supervisors - it is up to them.&nbsp; But this Quality Mark Certificate is something that the private sector developers have received well because it obviously gives them another selling point.&nbsp; So 6,000 units in 30 projects have actually applied to be assessed, be voluntarily assessed under the Quality Mark, and there will be about 3,000 obtaining certain certification.&nbsp; So, really, it is a construction industry-wide issue -&nbsp; the question of construction quality.&nbsp; It goes all the way down the value chain, from designing flats so that it can be easily built, and all the way down to building it.&nbsp; And this is a subject which, I think, will be discussed in another cut on the issue of construction quality.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I want to assure Members that HDB flats are not inferior in quality to private sector flats.&nbsp; They are cheaper in price not because they are lesser in quality but because they are subsidised by the Government.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; Madam, following my parliamentary colleagues' "upgrading" requests, I would also like to add another request, what I term the "neighbourliness upgrading programme".&nbsp; Let me elaborate.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the decades, HDB has greatly improved its designs of residential blocks of flats, in terms of the corners, lift landings, and other common areas, in keeping with changing environmental conditions and expectations of residents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, this has helped to provide, to some extent, the opportunity for fellow residents living in the same block to interact with each other.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I think more can be done to improve the layout of the common areas for residents to come together as neighbours in small groups.&nbsp; For instance, a principle could be adopted that for a small cluster of families, say, between 8 and 10 units each sharing a common corridor, we could have a neighbours' corner built into or along the corridor.&nbsp; The neighbours' corner could be a common space for residents living around it to use as a neutral ground for various interactional and social activities for their mutual benefit.&nbsp; For example, children from different units can play together outside their flats in this neighbours' corner and, yet, are within earshot and the watchful eyes of their parents or<p align=left>Column: 1681<p> child-minders.&nbsp; Teenage neighbours can also gather together to discuss study matters or hobbies.&nbsp; In the evenings, their parents and grandparents can chat with each other also.&nbsp; During festive occasions, the neighbours' corner can be a lively scene as neighbours celebrate the occasion and tuck into meals they have cooked and shared with each other.&nbsp; I am sure we can see the value of facilitating cross-neighbourly interaction in this way, and this can form the basis of enhancing social networking, mutual support and promoting better multi-cultural ties of HDB dwellers.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask what are the Ministry's plans to research and pilot new forms of block designs that can further enhance community living in our high-rise environment.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I enjoyed living in HDB flat.&nbsp; And now that I am an MP, I do receive quite a lot of complaints&nbsp;like quality, design and&nbsp;structure.&nbsp; But each time we have complaints, we will refer them to HDB or the town council.&nbsp; We do get quite good response.&nbsp; But I would like to raise two points.&nbsp; One is the question of spalling, ceiling leaks and many other complaints, and whether&nbsp;they have&nbsp;to do with aging of&nbsp;the HDB estates.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;About 85% of flats are 10-year old, and maybe half of that are 15 or&nbsp;20 years old.&nbsp; I shudder to think what will happen in the next 10 or&nbsp;20 years as most of the flats are&nbsp;on 99-year leasehold.&nbsp; I wonder whether HDB would like to look at this policy, in terms of ownership and leasehold.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The other is the question of governance.&nbsp; What kind of governance do we want?&nbsp; We are told, in fact, that once <p align=left>Column: 1682<p>you get a flat, HDB is liable for about one year for repairs and other complaints.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, when we have this ceiling leak problem, I am not sure&nbsp;about spalling concrete, we were given a kind of goodwill,&nbsp;sharing of cost at 50-50 responsibility.&nbsp; So residents have come to expect that, in fact, HDB is actually partly responsible.&nbsp; And now when it comes to windows falling, they also expect that, and we cannot say&nbsp;that since they have already got 10 years, it is their responsibility.&nbsp; So I think the question is: what kind of governance do&nbsp;we want?&nbsp; How do&nbsp;we educate the HDB dwellers about their responsibility?&nbsp; As this is public housing, they think HDB must be responsible.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, they must equally be responsible and be made aware of the question of shared responsibility.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

must not put the cart before the horse.&nbsp; We do not expect someone to get married just because he wants an HDB flat.&nbsp; Our reason for giving priority to families is because it is a question of&nbsp;relative need.&nbsp; We hope that when&nbsp;they get married,&nbsp;they will have children and, therefore, they will have greater need for space and for privacy.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of divorce, if a couple breaks up and they have children, the divorcee with his or her children will constitute a family unit and can certainly retain the flat.&nbsp; If they are young and they are singles, then I think you would agree with me that, from the point of view of fairness, they should be treated no differently from any other single who is under 35.&nbsp; For the argument as to why 35 years, why not shift it, I think, again, let us come back to the fundamental principle of relative priority.&nbsp; Top priority is for families, and second priority for older <p align=left>Column: 1683<p>singles.&nbsp; For younger singles, the options are to stay with the families -&nbsp;we hope&nbsp;they will have good relations with&nbsp;their families - or to consider renting</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

As far as estrangement is concerned, you will agree that, beyond a certain point, the HDB and the Government cannot be the provider of last resort and the resolver of all family problems.&nbsp; We want to help, but there is a limit to how much we can help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to Dr Amy Khor's points.&nbsp; I am glad she agrees with our latest move to have studio apartments integrated with other housing types and, as she said, this will allow ageing in place.&nbsp; I will take her suggestion about using the children's CPF to pay for the flat.&nbsp; It is something which we will have to consider, but consider carefully.&nbsp; There, again, I would hasten to add that there are implications and we will have to be very careful before we proceed in that direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCA already does have a guide on best practices to ensure barrier-free access, not just for older residents, but also for others who are handicapped or disabled.&nbsp; For instance, in HDB flats, I think you are all aware -&nbsp;you will see a proliferation of ramps and covered walkways.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the flat itself, we try to make sure that there are non-slip tiles and, in some cases, hand-hold grips which<p align=left>Column: 1684<p> are at lower levels so that the elderly can use them.&nbsp; So, to the maximum extent that it is possible, practical and viable, we will continue to ensure that both in HDB flats as well as indeed even in private housing, the features cater to the older residents and to others who are disabled.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I next move on to Prof. Ngiam's points.&nbsp; I agree wholeheartedly with&nbsp;him that when we build flats, we are not&nbsp;just building a household, but we are hoping to build communities.&nbsp; I also agree with him that the design of the flats and of the precincts can make a difference.&nbsp; He has made many useful suggestions which we will certainly take back to study.&nbsp; But having said that, I also want to share with Members that HDB has actually been doing rather well so far.&nbsp; For instance, in the old days, we used to have these large slab blocks.&nbsp; To some extent, that could also replicate a <I>kampong</I> corridor but, of course, as time has moved on, people wanted more privacy and we have to have fewer units per corridor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the common space on each floor, do not forget that HDB does provide areas for interaction and activities, both at the block level and precinct level.&nbsp; For instance, we have void decks, playgrounds, landscaped areas, social/community facilities, child and student care centres, and these cater to the residents of all ages, both young and old.&nbsp; It also allows for residents from different floors and blocks to congregate and interact.&nbsp; In addition to that, we have also constructed precinct pavilions, landscaped roof decks, and the latest thing which HDB is trying out is the new community mall concept where community facilities, such as the Residents Committee Centre, childcare centre, etc, can all be clustered together.&nbsp; And we will continue to look for ways to optimise the design and, as I said earlier, we will take&nbsp;the Member's&nbsp;suggestions on board as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1685<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad Mr Zainul Abidin agrees that, on the whole, the quality of our HDB flats has been good.&nbsp; I want to emphasise that HDB blocks are built to last.&nbsp; We sell purchasers a 99-year lease, and I can tell you categorically that, as far as the structural components of the blocks are concerned, they should survive well past that.&nbsp; However, this is predicated on appropriate maintenance.&nbsp; And maintenance, as the Member has quite rightly said, is a joint responsibility.&nbsp; HDB has to play a role and will continue to play a role, especially when it comes to upgrading.&nbsp; As far as routine maintenance is concerned, the town councils have to play their role.&nbsp; But, as the Member has rightly said, there is&nbsp;a joint responsibility in which the residents, the owners of the HDB flats, have to play their role, whether making sure that the place is painted, that cracks are sealed, that spalling concrete is addressed and treated before it becomes a major problem, maintaining their windows, and so on and so forth.&nbsp; I am afraid this is something which we will have to repeat and repeat <I>ad infinitum</I>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member has quite rightly identified that, sometimes, because we do too much, a sense of entitlement creeps in.&nbsp; I think we have two choices.&nbsp; We can either give in to that sense of entitlement and do more and more, in which case, we will then end&nbsp;up in a situation where less and less responsibility is borne by the residents, or we can take the harder route which we have taken, which is to honestly and openly share with residents that, yes, maintenance is a joint responsibility; yes, maintenance costs money, we will help on&nbsp;a goodwill basis for some measures and, for those who really cannot afford, there are other means to assist them.&nbsp; But let us accept the fundamental point that this is something which we do together and, if we do it properly, we will have HDB&nbsp;blocks, communities which survive the test of time.</p></P></span></div>					<p align=left>Column: 1686<p>				<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is, therefore, unfair to ask the town councils to shoulder the full liability of maintaining the flats due to poor workmanship and design.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, I could not unfairly accuse the Government of abrogating its duty and passing the buck to town councils, as the HDB did provide some help to town councils for certain costly repairs to HDB estates.&nbsp; Of course, the Government does not want to admit that it is its responsibility.&nbsp; So, these helps are called "goodwill".&nbsp; However, the town councils were informed that these goodwill repairs would be withdrawn.&nbsp; So, now there is no goodwill, but "badwill", bred by the HDB as owner and builder of the HDB flats, with inherent maintenance problems conveniently dumped to the town councils.&nbsp; I would like to highlight two examples below.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, sunken apron and manholes.&nbsp; Hougang Town Council frequently comes across instances of sunken aprons and poorly graded sewer lines in our estates.&nbsp; HDB, in its most typical fashion, will say that these are common properties managed by the town council, and thereby the town council should make the necessary repairs and&nbsp;pay for the repair bills.&nbsp; What the HDB conveniently forgets is that these aprons and manholes are not, in the first place, designed and constructed with supports which will prevent them from sinking with soil settlement.&nbsp; In contrast, the aprons constructed in new HDB estates are supported now.&nbsp; However, the HDB was&nbsp;unwilling to carry out repairs for the town council when aprons are badly sunken and sewer lines below are also badly damaged.&nbsp; But, Madam, this is now withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1687<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, dislodged ceiling boards on pitch roofs.&nbsp; Members may think what is the big deal with ceiling boards.&nbsp; It should be relatively low cost to repair. But the ceiling boards are located on the roof of 18- and 20-storey highrise buildings with no access from inside the building.&nbsp; In my constituency, there are seven such blocks which are relatively new developments, with similar design and with the problem of falling ceiling boards.&nbsp; The total cost to solve the problem, based on our quotation, was about $0.5 million, with about half of the cost being the need to install horizontal platforms and scaffoldings with boomlift to access the ceiling.&nbsp; I wonder why they design such flats that will result in high maintenance costs.&nbsp; Subsequently, the town council established the problem of falling ceiling boards was due to the detailing and fastening systems used.&nbsp; The HDB was good enough to want to rectify the problem and, in November 1988, notified us in writing that the HDB contractor would carry out the work.&nbsp; However, despite numerous verbal communication, nothing happened and, in June 2003, Hougang Town Council wrote to the HDB to remind them that the matter was still outstanding and, currently, it is still outstanding.&nbsp; Now, the HDB has also withdrawn this category of goodwill repair.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it is a case of promised repair on specific work by the HDB and then withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other problem, Madam, concerns the recent restructuring of HDB.&nbsp; The privatised part of the HDB is now called Surbana, which sounds like the name of a&nbsp;holiday resort.&nbsp;&nbsp;On matters of estate maintenance problems, in the past, when the town council dealt with the HDB directly, at least we had a clear answer and guidelines on repair matters.&nbsp; Now, we are like a ping-pong ball, played&nbsp;between HDB and Surbana, being referred <p align=left>Column: 1688<p>here and there.&nbsp; To give just one instance, the Hougang Town Council recently repaired some external wall finishes and, based on established cost sharing principles, submitted a claim for reimbursement, first to the HDB, then Surbana.&nbsp; It was not a big amount, but it took more than six months, and the matter is now still pending.&nbsp; My question really is whether these are fair deals which&nbsp;the HDB metes out to town councils, or are these only&nbsp;special deals that HDB metes out to Hougang Town Council simply because we are an Opposition town council.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Madam, I do not understand it.&nbsp; Why is HDB asking for $422 million in capital grants to finance its deficit when it still has $150 million in investments?&nbsp; If the investments are held in an investment subsidiary, then the funds should be returned to the HDB so as to reduce the budget funding for HDB and help to reduce the budget deficit.&nbsp; Further, I would like to seek clarification from the Minister on the following two questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; For an entity that lost $773 million in 2003, $997 million in 2002, $952 million in 2001 and received accumulated Government grant of $11.5 billion since 1960, HDB has an equity of capital gains reserve of $4.9 billion and $8.2 billion in asset revaluation reserve.&nbsp; Can the Minister explain how a money losing entity like the HDB can accumulate such a huge reserve?&nbsp; Is it correct for us to assume that the HDB has been selling flats at higher inflated prices than the actual cost price to Singaporeans and then reporting it as a paper loss on the profit and loss statement?&nbsp; Is this how it resulted in an annual transfer of more than $100 million to the asset revaluation reserve and a slightly smaller amount into the capital gains reserve?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1690<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss in rental of flats is similar to&nbsp;upgrading of flats, as reported in the 2002/2003 Annual Report statement.&nbsp; I recall that in Parliament, Mr Mah Bow Tan,&nbsp;Minister for National Development, had said that about 60% of the available flats are not being rented out.&nbsp; So, what is HDB waiting for?&nbsp; It is interesting to note that while the HDB waits to rent out the rental flats, we are losing more than $200 million in accounting loss a year.</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

To live in harmony, we have to cultivate a community culture, a respect for each other, tolerance of our differences, caring for one another and helping to protect and maintain common properties and facilities.&nbsp; We need to evolve into a civil society. We are still a long way from this.&nbsp; We have neighours who hang dripping mops outside their flats, throw litter and curry out of their windows, create irritating noises late into the night, urinate in lifts, clutter up the common corridors, discard unwanted fliers in the void decks and vandalise common properties - just to name a few examples of uncaring behaviour.&nbsp; It appears that such unpleasant incidences are on the rise. What can we do about this? How do we go about creating a civil caring society? This is a multi-faceted issue.&nbsp; But as the HDB, under the purview of the Ministry, is the&nbsp;agency in charge of most of our houses, I hope that the Ministry could look into the matter and facilitate our evolution into a civil caring society.</p></P></span></div>					<p align=left>Column: 1691<p>				<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Madam, first, I want to assure the Member for Hougang that the rules on the withdrawal of the goodwill repair on sunken apron and the manhole apply universally across all the Town Councils, not just to Hougang or Potong Pasir, but also to all PAP Town Councils.&nbsp; It is fair that he came here to complain, but he did not hear the screams of some of the PAP Town Councils' Chairmen&nbsp;-&nbsp;Dr Teo has been very&nbsp;angry&nbsp;at the withdrawal of these goodwill repairs and so did many other Chairmen like Mr Othman Eusofe and even Dr Tan Boon Wan.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me explain why the goodwill repair was extended some 10 years ago.&nbsp; That&nbsp;gave the impression that it was a defective construction project&nbsp;- I am referring to the sunken aprons and manholes.&nbsp; The goodwill repair was extended some 10 years ago because at that time, Town Councils&nbsp;were a new entity.&nbsp; We recognised that many Town Councils did not have the expertise to do such repairs or the resources, ie, money.&nbsp;So HDB extended the goodwill repairs.&nbsp; Over the years, in the last 10 years, Town Councils have accumulated substantial experience, and&nbsp;they know what to do.&nbsp; Secondly, they have accumulated substantial reserves. For example, in the case of Hougang, they have something like $15 million in the sinking fund which they could use to do such repair works.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did these sewage pipes sink? Because over time, there is soil movement. Sewers rest on the soil, so when the soil sinks, the sewage pipes could sink - not&nbsp;everywhere because we do not know where the soil will sink to. This is part and parcel of the maintenance process which my Minister of State was talking about - maintenance over a long period of time,&nbsp;which is the responsibility of Town Councils.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these items fall in <p align=left>Column: 1692<p>the common area - manholes, aprons and sewage pipes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of that, over the last 10 years, the Government has also provided S&amp;C grants to all the Town Councils.&nbsp; In fact, the sinking fund that Hougang has accumulated, $15 million or so, came almost entirely from the S&amp;C grants because over the last 10-11 years, the Government extended to Hougang Town Council something like $14 million S&amp;C grants in total.&nbsp; It means that they are eminently able to&nbsp;carry out&nbsp;these repairs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member also mentioned other items like ceiling board.&nbsp; Ceiling board again is an item that falls in the common area and it is a wear-and-tear item that we need to look into.&nbsp; Regarding the promise by HDB to complete the project and then&nbsp;withdrew that promise, I will have to look into that.&nbsp; If the Member has any correspondence on this, please let us know.&nbsp; If it was a commitment by HDB before the withdrawal, then we will have to honour that.&nbsp; But we will&nbsp;have to look at the allegations carefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Surbana's performance, as far as we are concerned, Surbana must deliver on what they can do. Surbana should not be doing a postman's job of passing claims onto HDB.&nbsp; We will have to look at that because Surbana has only been corporatised not so long ago. We believe that Surbana is still trying to find its feet, but we believe that this could be an isolated case where Surbana is delaying some advice as to how to carry out these repairs.&nbsp; We appreciate the Member's feedback. Certainly, we will look into this allegation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the provision of facilities in Potong Pasir.&nbsp; Potong Pasir is a political division.&nbsp; Like any other political division, it is not a big town.&nbsp; Potong Pasir is part of the Toa Payoh Town.&nbsp; If we look at Toa Payoh Town&nbsp;itself, there are more than enough <p align=left>Column: 1693<p>recreational and sporting facilities for everybody.&nbsp; In Toa Payoh Town itself,&nbsp;it has got&nbsp;a very good sports centre, swimming complex, a beautiful Toa Payoh park and a neighbourhood park that links Potong Pasir along the canal to Toa Payoh Town.&nbsp; So the residents in Potong Pasir are welcome to use the facilities in the Toa Payoh Town because we do not stop them from coming just because they are Potong Pasir residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Member complains about Potong Pasir, I have more to complain about Tiong Bahru, for example. &nbsp;There are no facilities there.&nbsp; There are no basketball courts there - the Member said there are two in Potong Pasir.&nbsp; Because Tiong Bahru is part of the Queenstown estate, so my residents are encouraged to use facilities in Queenstown Sports Stadium which is built for that purpose. Of course, that does not mean that the Potong Pasir MP cannot use the money that they have in the Town Council to build some local facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;They could have built more table tennis courts in their void decks using their surplus. They can also write to HDB to allow their money to build basketball courts on the common property. I do not think we will object if they use their own money.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Potong Pasir can well afford simple projects like these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we look at the facilities in Hougang, we will find that facing the same constraint, the Member for Hougang has done remarkably well.&nbsp; He has not complained of a lack of recreational facilities.&nbsp; In fact, the last time I went there, I found that it is quite well-endowed with simple but adequate recreational and sporting facilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mr Steve Chia's questions, first, I want to commend him for reading the Budget Book, the estimates report and the HDB Annual Report.&nbsp; But I think he has missed out important items.&nbsp; I want to point them out.&nbsp; This is important.&nbsp; So I <p align=left>Column: 1694<p>read from the statement here: "HDB does not have accumulated surplus. HDB is not a profit-making organisation.&nbsp; It is a loss-making operation because&nbsp;we subsidise most of the operations we do, especially in the sale of flats."&nbsp; This can clearly be seen from HDB's financial statements published in the annual reports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to the Member's earlier question, HDB does not have any investments in bonds and other financial instruments.&nbsp;They are short of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;They used to borrow from the Government.&nbsp; Government is not going to lend&nbsp;them now.&nbsp; So&nbsp;they issue bonds -&nbsp;they are borrowing money from the public.&nbsp; These bonds are, what&nbsp;we term, medium-term notes - 10 to 25&nbsp;years.&nbsp; To-date,&nbsp;they have issued something like&nbsp;$3.4 billion&nbsp;worth of&nbsp;bonds, with outstanding bonds&nbsp;for $3.1 billion,&nbsp;which are money that HDB owes the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For financial year 2004, HDB is projected to have an operating deficit of $422 million, mainly from the subsidised sale of HDB flats and the provision of CPF housing grants which the Minister talked about earlier on.&nbsp; Hence, a capital grant of $422 million is necessary to cover this deficit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia said that HDB has a lot of money, it has investments in bonds and equities. These bonds and equities are actually held by HDB's subsidiaries,&nbsp;not by HDB.&nbsp; If we look at the HDB Yearbook<I>,</I> if we look at the balance sheet on page 119, we will see investments. This is the latest yearbook.&nbsp; The one that is coming out should be for 2003/2004.&nbsp; This is the 2002/2003 yearbook.&nbsp; If we look at the balance sheet, there is an investment item (item 7).&nbsp; If we look at the notes -&nbsp;on one side is HDB, and on the other&nbsp;is HDB group&nbsp;-&nbsp;HDB has nothing here.&nbsp; We have no investments in equities, bonds or anything like that,&nbsp;but HDB subsidiaries do.&nbsp; There is some money there but they are not all in cash.&nbsp; The subsidiaries have <p align=left>Column: 1695<p>turned the money into working capital - some of it they have bought equipment or things necessary for their operation. HDB does receive dividends from them which are considered part of income and will be offset against expenditure.&nbsp; But in spite of that, HDB will suffer about $422 million estimated loss this year. HDB does not have any money.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia suggested that HDB should quickly rent out all its rental flats instead of losing money. HDB reviews all the applications for rental flats very carefully. When the Minister suggested sometime ago in Parliament that X% of flats were waiting to be rented out, it was because the people who have applied to HDB, do not qualify for these rental flats. We have stringent requirements to rent out rental flats.&nbsp; Basically, they must be low-income, they must have a friend to co-share the flat with them, and&nbsp;they must not have sold the flat within 30 months.&nbsp; These are requirements. It is not that we do not want to rent out the rental flats.&nbsp; It is that people who come to us, in large numbers, do not qualify for these rental flats.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Madam, I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether he agrees that the cause of sinking aprons and sewer lines is a result of improper construction method, ie, it was not properly supported and that is the result.&nbsp; Does he agree with that?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

He asked whether the developments are on track and I am happy to inform him that they are on track.&nbsp; In fact, the Downtown at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Marina</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Bay</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> will be our key focus for<p align=left>Column: 1702<p> development of our City in the next 15 to 20 years.<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's intention is to develop the area around the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Marina</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Bay</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> to provide prime office space for global businesses as well as financial institutions, complemented by a full range of residential, shopping, dinning, cultural and entertainment facilities.&nbsp; So the Downtown at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Marina</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Bay</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> will not be just a place for work, it will also provide a total live, work and play environment.&nbsp; That is why a number of land parcels in the Downtown area will be zoned for residential and also "white uses", in other words there will be a mix of uses which will help to create vibrancy and buzz within the city.&nbsp; In fact, developments in the area are already underway.&nbsp; NTUC has the NTUC Centre just completed.&nbsp; Two sales sites launched in 2001 and 2002 are now in the various stages of construction and, of course, we will be launching the sale of our Business and Financial Centre (BFC) in May this year, through the Reserved List System.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the Downtown at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Marina</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Bay</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> can be one of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s key competitive advantages for the medium term.&nbsp; Cities all over the world are investing heavily in state-of-the-art facilities, infrastructure, developments to attract investments, trade and tourists.&nbsp; So, cities like <st1:City><st1:place>Dubai</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:City><st1:place>Shanghai</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> and <st1:City><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:City>, they are all channelling a lot of effort and money to new areas to keep abreast of changing requirements of business and financial institutions.&nbsp; Developers and investors can now choose from a wide array of attractive locations globally.&nbsp; In the midst of such competition, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> needs to plan for, and invest in, the necessary infrastructure and software to create an equally, if not more attractive environment.&nbsp; So we are fortunate to have available to us such a large tract of unencumbered land, right in the heart of the city, in a prime waterfront locale, and <p align=left>Column: 1703<p>this gives us a tremendous opportunity to create a unique business, financial and residential hub, as a seamless extension to the existing CBD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will adopt a pro-active approach to realise the vision for Downtown at Marina Bay.&nbsp; As a start we will be putting in place key infrastructure and facilities to open up the area, to make it more accessible, more attractive.&nbsp; The Government's initial investment in key infrastructure in the Bay area will amount to $300 million and this will go towards developing a waterfront promenade around the Bay, a new pedestrian-cum-vehicular bridge to link to Marina Centre, as well as an extension of the common services tunnel, and road and sewer networks to bring utilities to serve the new developments.&nbsp; The URA will be calling for consultancy studies for the design of the promenade and pedestrian bridge because this is in a prime location and we want to make sure that such works are well-designed and relate well to the surrounding area.&nbsp; To activate the Downtown at Marina Bay early and to ensure vibrancy, we will also introduce low-density developments around the Bay for recreation and lifestyle related uses.&nbsp; And this can be for shorter leases, for up to 30 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also be releasing land for residential users in the next few years to bring life to the area.&nbsp; The development of the Downtown will require the effort of all agencies.&nbsp; So to further lend impetus to the effort, the Government has appointed URA as the development agency to champion and focus actions for development of the area.&nbsp; What this means is that URA will spearhead and coordinate development efforts and also carry out active promotion, marketing and <p align=left>Column: 1704<p>place management for the area.&nbsp; Of course, URA will work closely with other agencies as well as with the private sector to make sure that the plans are market-oriented and are attractive to investors.&nbsp; I will chair a Ministerial Steering Committee comprising senior representatives from MOF, MTI, MinLaw and relevant agencies to provide strategic directions, facilitate decision making and steer development efforts for the Downtown at Marina Bay.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure Dr Teo that the release of any land at the Downtown at Marina Bay, such as for the BFC, will factor in the supply of space in the existing CBD, which is the Raffles Place, Shenton Way area, and will not be neglected.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
