<div align="center"><b>FACTORIES SET UP UNDER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIALISATION POLICY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Finance

(a)  how  many factories have been set up under  the

Industrialisation Policy up to the latest convenient

date; (b) how much foreign capital is invested; (c)

how  much  local capital is invested; (d)  how  many

workers  are  employed in those factories;  (e)  how

many    of    those    factories    are    operating

satisfactorily; and (f) how many of those  factories

have  closed down or ceased operation and  how  many

workers became unemployed as a consequence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the annual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



Census   of   Industrial  Production  which   covers

establishments employing ten or more workers,  there

were  1,555 manufacturing establishments at the  end

of  1968,  employing 72,200 workers. In 1959,  there

were 531 establishments employing 25,600 workers. In

other words, factories and industrial workers nearly

trebled since 1959. This covers the Member's queries

(a) and (d) as appeared in the Order Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at June 1969, foreign paid-up capital amounted

to  $637  million. Of this, $264 million or  42  per

cent  came, from local sources, while $373  million

or, 58 per cent came from abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual capital investment in fixed assets

exceeds  the  above and is estimated, at  some  $780

million.  This  is  much  higher  than  the  paid-up

capital,  but is made possible because most  of  the

companies are able to get credit facilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



from  various sources, and, besides, in most cases,

land  in  industrial  estates  is  leased  from  the

Government,  while buildings are  either  leased  or

mortgaged.  Such  credit  availability  has  enabled

sound  enterprises  to commence with  lower  capital

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above statistics on capital investments are

based  on  a  quarterly  survey  conducted  by   the

Economic  Development Board. The survey  covers  all

pioneer firms in Jurong and non-pioneer firms in the

nine  major industrial estates and is not comparable

with  the Census of Industrial Production. The above

covers the Member's queries (b) and (c).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few exceptions, Singapore factories are

active  and operating satisfactorily. Of the pioneer

firms,  nine  have ceased operation.  Their  closure

affected  roughly  300 workers. These  workers  were

mostly  absorbed by other establishments. This  last

bit  covers  the  Member's queries (e)  and  (f)  as

appeared in the Order Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Parliamentary Secretary

aware  that some factories in Jurong have a shortage

of  workers, especially technicians and artisans? If

such  a  situation  exists,  can  the  Parliamentary

Secretary   inform  the  House  what  measures   the

Government intends to take to deal with it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while this question should

properly  be directed to the Minister for Labour,  I

suppose  I  can  just  say a  few  words.  There  is

evidence  recently that there is  some  shortage  of

skilled   labour.  The  Government  is  taking   all

necessary steps to remedy this situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>UNIFORMED CIVIL SERVANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Change of uniforms)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether  it  is  intended  to  change   the

uniforms  of  the  other  uniformed  civil  servants

besides Police and Customs officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, uniforms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



are  issued  to civil servants who are  required  to

wear uniforms for easy recognition or identification

by  the  public to prevent undue wear  and  tear  to

their  own  personal clothing,  or  for  reasons  of

prestige and ceremony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Police and Customs, uniforms

are provided mainly for purposes of easy recognition

and  identification. As they belong to law-enforcing

forces, their uniforms should have the appearance of

smartness and dignity to command better respect, it

is  with  this object in mind that their  uniforms

were changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a similar need exists, the uniforms of a

particular  group of officers will be  changed,  but

uniforms will not be changed just for the sake of  a

change.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know which particular

group of officers' uniforms will be changed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, no other group

exists which needs a change of uniforms. But if  the

Member  can  make  out  a case  for  a  change,  his

suggestion   will  be  considered  and,   if   found

necessary,  the uniform will be changed.  But  as  I

said,  the uniform will not be changed just for  the

sake of a change.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Now that a change of uniform for the police has

been  enforced,  will the Minister also  change  the

uniforms  of police cadets in schools who are  still

using the same old uniforms?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> There is no plan just now to change the uniforms of

school police cadets.

<div align="center"><b>TAX RELIEFS ON PREMIUMS FOR GROUP MEDICAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INSURANCE SCHEMES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Finance if he will consider granting tax reliefs  on

premiums  for group medical insurance schemes  which

have been introduced by collective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



agreements,  in  the  same  manner  as  reliefs  are

allowed on premiums for life insurance policies  and

contributions to provident funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, premiums for group medical

insurance  under  most  collective  agreements   are

payable  by  employers. As such, they are  trade  or

business  expenses and have always  been  deductible

from income for tax purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few schemes under collective

agreements   in  which  employees  may   voluntarily

participate  and  make  small  payments   to   cover

themselves  and  their families for  hospitalisation

and   surgical  benefits.  Under  the  law,  medical

expenses   of  the  community  at  large   are   not

deductible for income tax purposes and there  is  no

valid   reason   to   give   special   relief    for

contributions   by   employees  to   group   medical

insurance schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such contributions are similar to payments for

personal accident policies, for which no income  tax

relief is given, and are not in the same category as

provident  funds  or life insurance  policies  which

are,  in fact, savings schemes, although the  latter

provide for capital sums being payable on death.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Does the Parliamentary Secretary not recognise the

fact  that if group medical insurance schemes become

popular,  it will be a great boon to the  Government

in  the  sense  that  members of  medical  insurance

schemes  who become hospitalised will generally  get

themselves  warded  in Class I and  Class  II  wards

instead of the virtually free Class III wards?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Medical insurance schemes are for the benefit of

the  persons taking out these schemes. As a  general

rule,  there  is no income tax relief  for  accident

schemes  and, as I have just said, they are  not  in

the  same  category as life insurance schemes  which

are, in fact, savings schemes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider changing

the  Income Tax Ordinance so that tax relief can  be

granted  on  premiums  paid  for  medical  insurance

schemes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> My Ministry has found no valid reason for making

any  change to the existing Income Tax Ordinance  so

as to give relief to such contributions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FACTORIES ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Inclusion of I.L.O, safety regulations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs and Minister for Labour if he  will

consider widening the scope of the provisions in the

Factories   Ordinance   by  including   the   safety

regulations recommended by the International  Labour

Organisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the scope of the existing

Factories  Ordinance  is sufficiently  comprehensive

for  safeguarding the health and safety  of  persons

employed in factories. Relevant International Labour

Organisation  safety regulations have  already  been

used  by  the  Factory  Inspectorate  to  guide  the

factory occupiers in safety and health practices  in

such  industries as the iron and steel industry,  the

chemical  industry,  textile  mills  and  industrial

gases   manufacturing  plants.  Further,  there   is

provision in the Ordinance for the Minister to  make

special  regulations to uphold higher  standards  of

safety  and health of workers in industry where  the

risk of bodily injury is abnormal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> It appears to me that there are no adequate safety

regulations in respect of building sites.  With  the

tendency now for buildings to go higher up, I  think

it  is high time to look into this particular aspect

of   safety   regulations.  Will  the  Parliamentary

Secretary please tell the House whether he will look

into this matter?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the construction of

factories,  all aspects of safety are  being  looked

into by the various Ministries concerned.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Parliamentary Secretary

not recognise that rapid industrialisation has given

rise to a lot of harm and safety problems, making it

imperative  to  strengthen  the  provisions  of  the

Factories Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, as I have indicated just now, the present

Ordinance   is   adequate  to   meet   the   present

requirements.  I think the House was told  yesterday

by  the  Minister  for  Health that  the  Industrial

Health  Unit was going to play a major part  on  the

whole question of industrial safety.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that

the  appropriate  authorities in  his  Ministry - the

Factory   Inspectorate   - refer   to   the    I.L.O.

recommendations for guidance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> It is difficult to hear the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member's question was whether the

Parliamentary Secretary appreciated that the factory

inspectors,   in   fact,   refer   to   the   I.L.O.

recommendations for guidance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> The I.L.O. recommendations are being implemented.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> If the I.L.O. recommendations are referred to for

guidance, does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree

that suitable I.L.O. recommendations be made part of

the Factories Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> It is not just a simple matter of putting the

recommendations  into our present legislation.  This

sort  of thing will take time. As far as the present

Ordinance  is concerned, we feel that  it  is  quite

adequate  to meet our present needs. However,  I  am

sure  that when the time comes, steps will be  taken

to deal with such matters. I think the next question

of  the  Member  on the Order Paper will  deal  with

that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arising out of this question, may

we know how old is the Factories Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I am afraid I have no idea of how old it is,



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> If that is the case, the word "adequate" is not

very appropriate.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree

that  the  Factory  Inspectorate  believe  that  the

Factories Ordinance is inadequate?. He can refer  to

the  1968  Annual Report of the Ministry  of  Labour

under the appropriate section.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I think the Member is

anticipating  the  answers  to  his  next  question,

because he is now dealing with the next question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>FACTORY INSPECTORATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increase and upgrading of staff)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs and Minister for Labour if he  will

consider  (i) strengthening the Factory inspectorate

by  increasing the numbers of Senior Inspectors  and

Inspectors of Factories; (ii) upgrading the posts of

Chief  Inspector, Senior Inspector and Inspector  of

Factories   and  (iii)  re-organising  the   Factory

Inspectorate to increase its enforcement capability.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Factory Inspectorate has

already  been  strengthened by the creation  of  two

posts  of  Inspector of Factories, one in  1968  and

another  in  1969. In 1967, the Factory Inspectorate

had  only  four posts of Inspector of  Factories  in

addition to the Chief Inspector of Factories and the

Senior Inspector of Factories. The established posts

of Inspector of Factories have now been increased to

six  in  the  I 969-70 Estimates. Although  all  the

posts  of  Inspector of Factories have been  filled,

two  of  the officers have been taken into  national

service. To make up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



for the loss of service of these two Inspectors  of

Factories,  provision has been made in  the  1969-70

Estimates for a supernumerary Inspector of Factories

to be recruited. Attempts are now being made to fill

this  post on a temporary basis until the return  of

the   two  Inspectors  of  Factories  from  national

service,  one  in April and the other  in  September

1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary scale of Factory Inspectors, including

the   Chief   Inspector  of  Factories  and   Senior

Inspector   of  Factories  who  are  all   qualified

engineers, was revised in July this year to bring it

into  line with that of engineers employed in  other

departments of Government, such as the Public  Works

Department.  Since  the staff in the  department  is

limited  in number, consisting in all of 18 persons,

Government has not seen fit to upgrade the  post  of

Chief Inspector of Factories and Senior Inspector of

Factories.   If,   however,   the   department    is

reorganised, consideration will be given to  upgrade

these two posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the importance of industrial safety in

the  context of rapid industrialisation,  Government

has  obtained  the  services  of  two  International

Executive Service Corps experts to make a  study  of

industrial   safety   and   health   in   industrial

establishments.  They have completed  their  reports

and  their recommendations are being studied by  the

Government with a view to their implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganisation of the Factory Inspectorate to

increase   its   effectiveness   is   one   of   the

recommendations   made  by  the  experts.   However,

industrial safety and health is not just  a  problem

of  enforcement.  Both  management  and  workers  at

factory  level must themselves ensure that the  laws

enacted  for  the health and safety of  workers  are

strictly observed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Parliamentary Secretary

not  agree  that  a staff complement  of  one  Chief

Inspector  of  Factories, one  Senior  Inspector  of

Factories and five Inspectors of Factories



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



is  far  from  adequate to ensure that  the  minimum

standards  of safety, health and welfare of  persons

engaged in factories are observed? When the position

in   1968   is  compared  to  that  in   1959   when

industrialisation was first mooted,  there  was  one

Chief Inspector of Factories, an Industrial Training

Officer --



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Inche Abdul Aziz, what you are saying

sounds  more  like  a  speech than  a  supplementary

question. What is the question?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Parliamentary Secretary

not agree that the position in

1968  is  far  from  favourable or  satisfactory  as

compared to the position in 1959?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think every department would

like  to  increase its staff, but there is always  a

limit.  I am sure as time goes on and when the  need

is such as to enable us to convince the Minister for

Finance, I am sure more posts could be created.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that

with  rapid  industrialisation and increase  in  the

number  of factories and diversity of the  kinds  of

factories, a total of seven Inspectors of  Factories

is  far from adequate and satisfactory to cope  with

the cases in hand?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already indicated that we

have  increased the number of posts in  the  Factory

Inspectorate and that is as far as we  can  go  just

now.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the present number of

Inspectors   of   Factories  deal  efficiently   and

expeditiously with all the cases in hand?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I do not know whether the Member can indicate an

instance where the Inspectors of Factories were  not

know,  there has been no complaint of any negligence

or  unsatisfactory performance of their duties. But,

as I said, if we can make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



out a strong case that there is really a need for an

increase in the number of Inspectors of Factories, I

am  sure  the  Minister  for Finance  will  give  it

sympathetic consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary

it as a priority question.

Ministry at this juncture think that there is such a

need  and  whether, in fact, his Ministry is  taking

steps  to  prepare such a case for the consideration

of  the  Minister for Finance for the  provision  of

extra personnel for this particular department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I have already indicated in my answer that

the  number  of posts has already been increased  in

<div align="center"><b>INCREASE OF WATER CHARGES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, complementary with the

construction of low-cost houses by the  Housing  and

Development Board has been the expansion  of  modern

sanitation  facilities throughout the  Republic.  In

1960,  36  per cent of the population was served  by

modern  sanitation. The percentage  now  is  55  per

cent. Some $69 million have been spent over the last

nine years in extending sewerage facilities not only

to  new  industrial and housing estates but also  to

outlying  areas which hitherto had not been provided

with such facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to make modern

sanitation  available to every home within  economic

reach.  We will spend approximately $60 million  for

the  period 1968-73. To help finance the scheme, the

World  Bank  has agreed to a loan of $18 million  to

meet  the foreign exchange component of the sewerage

projects, the first time the World Bank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



has  given a loan for sewerage development  anywhere

in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, the capital and operational costs of

the Sewerage Department have not been covered by the

revenue  collected. To be quite candid, no one  knew

what  returns we got on expenditure as the sums  had

never been worked out. In the course of negotiations

with  the World Bank for the loan, the Bank made  it

clear  that approval of the loan was conditional  on

the sewage fees being revised. Further, fees were to

be  linked to the volume of water consumed  and  the

revenue  by  1972  was  to  be  adequate  to   cover

operating   expenses   plus  interest   on   capital

amortisation.  It is a cardinal principle  with  the

World Bank that investments must pay their way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In compliance with the conditions set out by the

World Bank, it is necessary to raise the charges for

water. The increases will be as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Domestic users of water will pay an additional

20  cents  per thousand gallons of metered water  in

addition to a fee of $2 per fitting per month;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In the case of non-domestic premises, the

charge  will  be  50 cents per thousand  gallons  of

metered water;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) In the case of industries utilising water in

their  end-products, meters will be fixed to assess

the amount of water used for industrial purposes and

not discharged into sewers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fees will be collected by the Public

Utilities  Board  on behalf of the  Government.  The

additional payments from domestic premises will vary

between  20 cents and $1 per month for more than  55

per  cent  of the population, while another  30  per

cent   will  pay  between  $1  and  $2  per   month.

Commercial and industrial premises will also bear  a

share  of the costs, varying from $2.50 to  $15  per

month  in the case of coffee-shops, and $15  to  $75

per month for the smaller industrial premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the increases in utility charges

will  not  be  reflected in poorer  households,  the

current  exemption  from the  P.U.B. sales  tax  on

consumers whose bills are below $10 a month will  be

extended to those whose bills are below



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



$12  a month. The five per cent tax payable on bills

between $11 and $20 will now be applicable to  bills

between  $12  and $25 a month and the ten  per  cent

rate  of tax will in future apply only to bills over

$25.  In  spite  of  the increases,  the  return  of

investments in sewerage is expected to  be  no  more

than two per cent on capital invested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation to give effect to these increased

charges  will  be  introduced  at  this  sitting  of

Parliament, and when the Bill is passed  early  next

year the increases will take effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this is a Christmas

present  for the thousands of consumers. I have  two

questions,  Sir.  First,  what  is  the  number   of

consumers who are making use of the sewage  schemes?

Secondly,  the  Minister for Finance mentioned  that

the  revenue returns would be only two per cent.  In

other words, it is only $1.2 million. Will there  be

further  increases later on when the  Minister  will

probably   come   here   with  another   Ministerial

statement?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member has not been listening with the

attention that the statement deserves. As I said  in

my closing remarks, these increases will take effect

next year and therefore he and his friends can spend

their Christmas without undue concern that the water

bills are going up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the two per cent return, I do not know

how  the Member arrived at the figure of a yield  of

$1.2  million. When I said a two per cent return  on

capital,  I  meant  a  two per cent  return  on  the

capital that had been spent in all sewerage works in

the  past. The Member will agree that this is a very

low  return on capital investment. For instance,  if

you  were  to  invest money in business,  you  would

expect  a  return of at least 20 per cent; but  this

being a public utility, Government had to settle for

a very low rate of return indeed. Of course, I agree

with  the Member that this is most unfortunate,  but

let  us reflect on the good fortune in the past when

these  people  were getting subsidised services.  In

the past, as I have said, there was no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



accounting on this score, and what happened was that

the  general  tax revenue had gone into meeting  the

losses  sustained  by running the  sewerage  system.

With  these  new  charges, the  Sewerage  Department

should at least no longer be in the red.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there would be further increases or not,

no one can say. It all depends on a number of things

which  it  is  not  possible to  predict  now.  For

instance,  if wages and costs go up, then  naturally

the charges will also have to go up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the figure of $1.2 million was

arrived  at  as  a result of the $60  million  loan,

apart  from  the other capital investment  involved.

Just  now  the Finance Minister mentioned  that  the

Sewerage  Department had been running at a  loss.  I

would  be  grateful if he could inform the House  of

the amount of losses up to date.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said in my statement, no

one knew what the losses were because no one did the

sums. But the Member for Punggol will recollect that

the Sewerage Department was at one time a department

of  the  former City Council. When the City  Council

hived  off into different departments with the  main

utilities  department forming the  Public  Utilities

Board, the treasurer then knew what the position was

and   passed  on  the  Sewerage  Department  to  the

Government. He was under no illusion that this was a

losing proposition. So Government had to carry  this

baby,  and this was carried, as I said, out  of  the

general  tax revenue until we applied for the  World

Bank  loan. The World Bank did the calculations  and

said that this loss has now got to be made good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, is it correct to say that it is a loss

because  it  is a service to the public  and  not  a

trade?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, it is a loss in the sense that those receiving

the  services did not pay for the cost. It  is  like

people riding on the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



Traction  Company's buses and the company is  losing

money - in the same way that the Sewerage Department

is losing money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Finance Minister

this:  if  the Sewerage Department is losing  money,

would  it not be more equitable to raise the sewage

fee  rather than the rate of water consumed, because

the  people  who  do not now enjoy the  use  of  the

sewage  system  will be asked to pay  for  something

which they are not receiving?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is one way of charging people, in proportion

to  the  user  of  the facilities.  It  is  quite  a

technical subject and this matter has been gone into

in  great detail by officials of my Ministry and the

Public  Works  Department.  The  calculations   were

checked  by  a mission sent by the World  Bank,  and

they  came  to the conclusion that a combination  of

fees  per  fitting plus the consumption of water  is

the  best and most equitable method of charging  for

this service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Finance Minister mentioned

that  a loan of $60 million will be coming from  the

World  Bank  to  enable  us  to  extend  our  sewage

facilities in the next five years. Can he inform the

House  whether  the entire Republic will  have  such

facilities, bearing in mind, of course, the increase

in water rates?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The sum of $60 million is the total expenditure

from  1968 to 1973. The World Bank will finance only

a  part  of  this expenditure, that is, the  foreign

exchange  component,  the  money  used  on  imported

material,  and  this comes to only a  proportion  of

this amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the whole population will receive this

facility by 1973 I doubt it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Finance Minister not

agree that to charge the increase in water rates  to

those who lack such sewage facilities is unfair?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Are you repeating Mr Lim Cheng Lock's

question in different terms?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> It is somewhat different from the question asked

by the Member for Kampong Kapor. The Member's

question was about the increase of sewage fee. My

question is: will the increase not be unfair to those

consumers who make use of water only?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not follow the Member's question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The Minister has already informed the House that

water rates will be increased after the New Year.

Whether it be a Christmas present or a New Year

present makes no difference. My question is this:



will he not consider it unfair to those consumers

who lack the sewage facilities and yet have to pay

more for the water consumed?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I suppose in a sense it is

unfair. But, on the other hand, let us not forget

that these are homes in rather remote areas, and

possibly if we were to apply the principle of

charging every one the cost of the services, it may

well be that houses in such remote areas would have

to pay more for their water anyway because it is

more costly to lay the mains to these areas. In

these matters, of course, one tries to apply a rough

and ready rule whereby everybody makes his

contribution to the services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if it is a case of rates which the Finance

Minister mentioned just now in respect of no tax on

consumers whose bills are now below $10 a month,

will he then increase them to, say, $15 and $30

instead of coming to a happy compromise at $12 and

$25?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, this is exactly what has happened. The

exemption rates have been raised so that this

additional charge will not bring in new consumers to

pay the sales tax. In fact, there will be a

reduction in the tax on Public Utilities Board

bills. So the limits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



which have been proposed are more than generous.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's statement that

there is a possibility that the cost of water will

be increased, has Government explored the

possibility of installing machinery to desalt sea

water?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Desalination is far from sewerage. Mr Ho, I do

not see how your question can arise out of the

Ministerial statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I think the Minister did say that there is a

possibility that the cost of water would have to be

increased. So if we could introduce desalination,

water might be cheap.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I only mentioned the

possibility of further increases in charges because

I was asked to commit myself to the position that

there would never be any increases in charges. Of

course, I cannot give any undertaking of that kind.

I have also linked the possibility of increases in

water charges with the possibility of increases in

wages. So if the Member applies himself diligently

in the trade union field to the task of maintaining

wage stability, then he will ensure that there will

be less chances of increases in water charges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, for several years I have been a member of the

Public Accounts Committee which drew attention to

the appalling state of affairs in the financial

administration of the Sewerage Department. Can we

have the assurance of the Finance Minister and also

of the Minister for National Development that they

will seriously look into the financial

administration of the Sewerage Department and will

take corrective measures on the financial side of

the department?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the whole project of

sewerage development is undertaken, has the Ministry

ever explored



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



the possibility of allowing it to be handled by

private enterprise? It might be more economical.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that novel proposition has never entered my

head.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very short amendment Bill, the aim of

which is to simplify the procedures for invoking the

law against dumping of imported goods in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs (Dumping and Subsidies) Ordinance,

1962, which  first came into force on  16th  April,

1962,  provides  the legislative  framework  against

the dumping of imported goods in Singapore and  for

safeguarding locally-made goods



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



from  unfair  competition posed  by  imported  goods

which  have  been subsidised by their  countries  of

origin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ordinance, the powers to invoke the law

and  impose  duties rest with the President  of  the

Republic. These powers have so far been invoked only

once,  and  it  was  found that the  procedures  for

invoking  these powers were rather cumbersome.  This

amendment  Bill, therefore, seeks to  adopt  a  less

cumbersome  procedure,  by transferring  the  powers

from  the  President to the Minister, to enable  the

Minister to impose duties by publishing an order  in

the  Gazette  and presenting it to Parliament.  This

procedure  is in line with other revenue legislation

and  is  aimed  at  facilitating the  imposition  of

duties  and preventing any delays. Speedy action  in

cases  of  this nature is necessary to  protect  the

interests of our local industries and of our  honest

trading  partners,  and to penalise  those  who  are

engaged  in  unfair competition by dumping  imported

goods  in  Singapore  or who have  the  benefits  of

subsidies from foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of powers from the President to the

Minister is to be effected by clause 4 of the  Bill.

Clause 2 provides for such powers to be exercised by

the  Minister by publishing an order in the  Gazette

and presenting it to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to amend section 14 of the

principal  Ordinance to make it  mandatory  for  all

regulations made under the Ordinance to be published

in  the Gazette and presented to Parliament as  soon

as possible after publication.

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Tang See Chim].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Salaries Commission recommended that the

salaries  of  Puisne Judges should be considered  in

relation  to  the salaries of the civil  service  in

Singapore  and that the former relationship  between

the   salaries  of  the  Judges  and  the  Permanent

Secretaries should be restored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also suggested that if the

recommendation  regarding  the  salaries  of  Puisne

Judges  is  accepted, then the emoluments of,  inter

alia, the Chief Justice should also be reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of Superscale 'B' (all-in

salary of $2,700 a month) and Superscale 'A' (all-in

$3,000  a  month)  for Permanent  Secretaries  on  a

personal-to-holder  basis, it  was  decided  that  a

comparable  revision of the salaries  of  the  Chief

Justice and Puisne Judges be effected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the salary of the Chief Justice has

been revised from $2,570 a month (basic) to $3,500 a

month (consolidated) and for the Puisne Judges  from

$2,100   a   month   (basic)  to  $2,700   a   month

(consolidated).   This   revision    was    effected

retrospectively    from    1st    January,     1969,

administratively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give legal effect to this revision, it is

necessary for the Judges' Remuneration Act, 1963, of

Malaysia to be amended. This Bill seeks to  do  just

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Companies Act, 1967, was passed by

Parliament  on 21st December, 1967, and was  brought

into operation on 10th January, 1968. The purpose of

the  Act is to safeguard the interests of the public

who  deposit funds with finance companies. Since the

coming   into   operation  of  the  Act,   companies

transacting  financing business have  been  licensed

and  their operations subject to the supervision and

control of the Commissioner for Finance Companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recollect that during the Second

Reading  of the Finance Companies Bill in Parliament

in December 1967, the Minister for Finance explained

that  it  was  necessary to pass  the  Bill  without

reference  to  Select  Committee,  so  that   proper

control  could be established immediately  to  check

the   future  proliferation  of  finance  companies.

However,  the  Minister for Finance  also  indicated

that   every   consideration  would  be   given   to

representations  from  finance  companies  and,   if

necessary,  amending  legislation  could  later   be

proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the coming into operation of the Act, the

Finance  Ministry has received representations  from

the  Association of Finance Companies,  the  Finance

House Association of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce

on    certain   provisions   of   the   Act.   After

consideration  of the views expressed  and  in  the

light  of  the  experiences gained in the  last  two

years  or  so  in  regulating  and  controlling  the

operations  of the finance companies,  it  was  felt

that  a  comprehensive review of  the  Act  need  be

carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Advisory Committee was then formed for this

purpose.   This   Committee  was  chaired   by   the

Commissioner  for  Finance  Companies  and  included

representatives  from  the two finance  associations

and  the  Chinese  Chamber of Commerce  as  well  as

consultants from the International Monetary Fund. It

considered various memoranda and proposals submitted

to  it  and held discussions and consultations  with

the  Solicitor-General, the Registrar  of  Companies

and  other Government departments concerned with the

working of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of its deliberations, it recommended

certain amendments to the Act which are incorporated

in the amendment Bill now before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Finance Companies Act,

1967, by   introducing  a  number   of   unrelated

amendments  designed, in the main, to  alleviate  or

relax  the strictness of certain provisions in their

application  to the business activities  of  finance

companies.  In  the  task of protecting  depositors'

funds, it must be conceded that the profitability of

finance companies should not be unduly crippled by

the too restrictive provisions. The more important

amendments are as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 2 of the Act on the

definition  of "financing business". This  amendment

extends  the  definition of "financing business"  to

include   hire-purchase   companies   which   accept

deposits from the public. As now defined in the Act,

"financing business" means, in summary, the carrying

on of the dual function of borrowing money from, and

lending money to, the public, but as hire-purchase

financing by legal definition is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



not  lending of money, these hire-purchase companies

have so far not been brought within the ambit of the

Act.  Since  it  is the aim of the  Act  to  protect

depositors' funds, those companies which  engage  in

hire-purchase financing, but do not accept  deposits

from  the public, will still not be subject  to  the

provisions of the Act.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 adds a new section - section 3A - to the

principal Act. This new section restricts the use of

the term "finance company" or any of its derivatives

indicating   that  a  company  transacts   financing

business. Henceforth, the use of the words  "finance

company"  will be confined to only finance companies

licensed  under this Act in the same manner  as  the

word "bank" is restricted to companies doing banking

business. This is to avoid confusion and provide the

means to the members of the public to distinguish  a

company  which  is  licensed to carry  on  financing

business  from  the great number of companies  which

are  not so licensed, but whose business is akin  to

that of "financing business".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 repeals section 12 of the principal Act

and substitutes therefor a new section. The existing

law   provides  that  every  finance  company  shall

maintain a reserve fund and, before any dividend  is

declared,  it  shall  annually  transfer  a  certain

percentage  of net profits to reserve to  strengthen

the company. This restriction on payment of dividend

to   shareholders  will  now  be  relaxed,  so  that

adequate  profits may be left over for  distribution

to    the    shareholders   to   encourage    equity

participation  in finance companies.  On  the  other

hand,  it  is  felt  that smaller finance  companies

should  be encouraged to grow faster by building  up

their reserves at the higher rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, therefore, provides for different

amounts  to be transferred to reserve fund according

to  the  paid-up capital of the finance  companies.

For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



this purpose, licensed finance companies are divided

into two categories:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) companies whose paid-up capital and reserves

are  $2  million and above each - these are required

to transfer to reserve fund at the lower rates;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) companies whose paid-up capital and reserves

are  less  than $2 million each - these are required

to transfer to reserve fund at higher rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 amends section 17 and relaxes the

restriction on unsecured loans by raising the  limit

for  each  unsecured loan from $1,000 at present  to

$5,000 so as to enable the finance company to have a

certain  amount of "clean" lending to those who  are

considered credit-worthy, but the aggregate  of  all

unsecured loans should not exceed 10 per cent of the

finance company's paid-up capital and reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision has been added imposing a ceiling

on  secured  loans  to any single  borrower  to  not

exceeding  60  per cent of the paid-up  capital  and

reserves  of  the  finance company,  but,  with  the

approval of the Commissioner, this limit of  60  per

cent  may  be raised to 100 per cent of the  paid-up

capital and reserves. The introduction of this limit

is  to  spread  the risk of lending of  the  finance

company, so that "all the eggs would not be  put  in

one  basket",  so to speak, which may  endanger  the

interests of depositors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A finance company is prohibited from investing

more  than  25 per cent of its paid-up  capital  and

reserves in any other undertakings. Clause 12 raises

this limit to 50 per cent, provided the approval  of

the Commissioner is obtained. This serves to improve

the  capacity  of finance companies as institutional

investors or, alternatively, it will enable  finance

companies  to  participate  in  equities  aimed   at

economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law provides that no finance company

is  permitted  to  acquire  any  immovable  property

except  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  financing

business.  While  it is recognised that  channelling

too  large  a  proportion of  depositors'  funds  to

acquire immovable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



properties  may  be  of  adverse  interest  to   the

depositors, nonetheless the finance companies should

not  be totally prevented from direct investment  in

immovable  properties  which offer  an  assured  and

growing  income  and  become  increasingly  popular.

Clause  13, therefore, removes this restriction  and

allows   a  finance  company  to  acquire  immovable

properties up to 25 per cent of its paid-up  capital

and reserves, and such other additional property as

may be approved by the Commissioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the foregoing, the scope of the Act has

been  narrowed so that it will not apply to licensed

pawnbrokers whose business is already subject to the

control  of  the Pawnbrokers Ordinance.  Conversely,

licensed  finance  companies  will  be  specifically

exempted  from  the  operation of  the  Moneylenders

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions are also incorporated to empower the

Commissioner   to   compound   offences   and   make

regulations  to  control advertisements  by  finance

companies. Other amendments are concerned  with  the

inspection and investigation of finance companies or

are mainly intended to improve the administration of

the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unlikely that some finance companies

will still express dissatisfaction over some of  the

provisions of the law in spite of the fact that they

will   have   been  relaxed.  But  certain   minimum

standards and norms must be observed. It is believed

that  this  amendment Bill strikes the happy  medium

between  the interests of shareholders in maximising

profits and the protection of the depositors' funds.

It  is hoped that this Bill will further achieve the

purpose  for  which the Act is intended,  i.e.,  the

protection of the depositors as well as the  orderly

expansion of finance companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (2) of section 3 of the Rubber

Association of Singapore (Incorporation) Act,  1967,

provides  for  a  common seal  of  the  Association.

Subsection (4) of section 3 of that Act provides for

the  use  of  this  seal, in that the  seal  can  be

affixed  only  pursuant  to  a  resolution  by   the

Committee and in the presence of, and witnessed  by,

the Chairman or Deputy Chairman or any member of the

Management Committee and by the Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Rubber Association of Singapore

issues Certificates of Origin to rubber exporters to

facilitate  shipments  of  rubber  to  European  and

American  countries. Though there  is  no  statutory

requirement  that a Certificate of  Origin  must  be

sealed  to  be  valid, it is an accepted  commercial

practice to seal such certificates. All Certificates

of  Origin  issued  by  the Trade  Division  of  the

Ministry of Finance, for example, are sealed by  the

Government  seal.  In the case  of  Certificates  of

Origin   issued   by  the  Rubber   Association   of

Singapore,  certain European countries  like  Spain,

Portugal,  Italy and Greece have refused  to  accept

these Certificates of Origin unless they are sealed,

and  such refusal would affect our export of  rubber

to those countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present procedure for the endorsement of the

common seal on Certificates of Origin issued by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



Association  is  extremely cumbersome.  Quite  apart

from the requirement of a resolution, it is also not

convenient for all endorsements to be carried out in

the  presence of a member of the Committee,  whether

he   be  the  Chairman  or  Deputy  Chairman  or  an

ordinary Committee member. This is because  members

of  the  Association and the Association's Secretary

do  not  share  the  same  premises.  As  such,  the

endorsement  of  the  seal  has  to  be  done  at  a

Committee  member's office in the presence  of  both

the  member  and  the Secretary, and  the  Committee

member's   office   may  be  far   away   from   the

Secretariat.  Rubber exporters have complained  that

such procedures have caused unnecessary delay in the

endorsement   of  urgently  required   Certificates,

resulting in delay in the shipment of rubber.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, therefore, seeks to simplify the

procedure  for  the  affixing of  the  Association's

common  seal on Certificates of Origin. It seeks  to

do  away  with  the requirement of a resolution  and

allows the seal to be affixed in the presence of the

Secretary and any other person so authorised by  the

Committee.  This  simplified  procedure  applies  to

Certificates  of Origin only and does not  apply  to

any other document.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill makes a number of important amendments

to  the  Income Tax Ordinance. The amendments  range

from  exemption from income tax on interest accruing

to   non-residents  and  on  shipping  profits,   to

simplifying    the   commencement   and    cessation

provisions of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of Members, I shall go through the

Bill clause by clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 provides for the Act to come into

operation from 1st January, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 is to permit the Comptroller to give

information to the Manager of the Central  Provident

Fund  Board,  where such information is required  by

the  latter for the performance of his duties. Under

the existing provisions, this is not permissible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for complete exemption from

income  tax  on interest from deposits  in  approved

banks derived in Singapore by non-residents. Members

will  recall  that  in 1967, the  rate  of  tax  was

reduced  from 40 per cent to 10 per cent on interest

earned by non-resident depositors in approved banks.

The  amendment also provides for exemption from tax,

of  interest derived on or after 1st January,  1968,

by  all  persons,  resident  or  non-resident,  from

deposits  in  the  Post Office Savings  Bank.  These

exemptions  are designed to make banks in  Singapore

even  more  attractive as depositories  for  surplus

funds  from outside Singapore and also to  encourage

people  to cultivate the saving habit with the  Post

Office Savings Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, any income remitted from

outside Singapore to a Singapore resident is subject

to  tax  in Singapore. Provision is also being  made

for  the Minister to exempt from tax income remitted

from  abroad  and received by a person  resident  in

Singapore where relief is not provided under  double

taxation agreements. This will allow flexibility, so

that  in  cases  where  the  Minister  considers  it

desirable, income received in Singapore from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



specified overseas investments may be exempted  from

tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1968,

was  before  the House last year, it  was  announced

that  exemption from income tax would be granted  to

Singapore-registered   ships.   Clause   4   is   in

accordance  with  that statement and  the  amendment

seeks  to  exempt from tax income derived  from  1st

January,  1969,  from  the operation  of  Singapore-registered ships. This exemption will apply  whether

a  ship  belongs to a Singapore owner  or  an  owner

resident  outside  Singapore  and  is  designed   to

encourage  the  registration  of  ships  under   The

Singapore    flag,   thereby   creating   employment

opportunities  for our citizens. The  response  from

maritime circles has already been encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides for the repeal of the provisions

allowing  double  deductions for market  development

expenditure.  As  the  Economic  Incentives  Act  is

comprehensive, covering a wide range of  incentives,

double  deductions  for market  development  are  no

longer necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 alters the existing commencement and

cessation  provisions which have often  perplexed  a

number of taxpayers in the first one or two years of

assessment. Under the existing provisions, while for

the   first  year  of  the  three-year  commencement

period, the income for tax purposes is the amount of

income  in  that  calendar year, in the  second  tax

year,  the  income is computed by reference  to  the

income  for  one year from the date of commencement,

resulting in the income for the first twelve  months

being  used as the basis for assessing tax liability

in  the first two years. The taxpayer, however, gets

the  benefit of the cessation provision by which  in

the  year  during which he ceases receiving  income,

his tax is not based on the full earnings during the

preceding  year, but on his actual earnings  in  the

year of cessation. In addition, the income from  one

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



the  two  preceding  years  is  relieved  from  tax.

However, this is not generally appreciated and there

is  a  general  misconception  that  when  a  person

commences employment he is taxed twice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed amendment, the income assessed

for  any  year  of assessment shall always  be  that

earned   in  the  preceding  year,  e.g.,  a  person

commencing  employment in 1970 will only  be  liable

for  tax in 1971 based on his 1970 income. This will

allow  for  a  straightforward  computation  of  tax

liability  and, at the same time, curb manipulations

resulting   in   loss  of  revenue   by   artificial

commencements and cessations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the proposed amendment, by which in

each  year a person is liable for tax based  on  his

actual income in the preceding year, is simpler  and

more easily understood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitional provisions have been made, so that

those  who  have  been  liable  to  tax  under   the

commencement provisions will still have the  benefit

of  the old cessation provisions. All taxpayers  who

commence  their trade, business or employment  after

1st  January, 1969, will be assessed under  the  new

preceding-year  basis. Those who have  already  paid

tax in 1969 and who commenced employment or trade in

1969 will be subject to tax in 1970 but the tax paid

in  1969  will  be credited against their  1970  tax

liability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is a consequential amendment arising from

the  repeal  of  the old commencement and  cessation

provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 is aimed at restricting the carry-forward

of   losses  to  such  cases  where  the  beneficial

shareholders to whom the carry-forward of losses  is

to be allowed are substantially the same as those in

the  company which incurred the losses. This  is  to

prevent  abuses  resulting  from  the  purchase   by

unrelated   persons   of   companies   which    have

substantial losses in order to derive tax benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 repeals the existing law which provides

for  tax  at  the  rate of 10 per cent  on  interest

received by non-residents from deposits in approved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



banks,  as  the  new provisions in  clause  3  allow

complete exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 deals with the manner in which interest

from tax-free bonds and stocks is dealt with for tax

purposes,   where  the  recipients  are  banks   and

financial  institutions.  Since  such  organisations

receive  the  interest as trading receipts  and  are

allowed to deduct, as expenses, the cost incurred in

the garnering of funds, etc., the credit allowed  is

one-half  of  the  tax on the income  from  interest

which is brought to charge for tax purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 13 are provisions which require the

remaining  partners  in a partnership  to  keep  the

Comptroller  informed where any partner  is  leaving

the   partnership  or  leaving  the   country.   The

remaining  partners  are made  liable  for  the  tax

payable  by  any person who ceases to be  a  partner

where  moneys have been paid to an outgoing  partner

without  the  written permission of the Comptroller.

This  is  to tighten up on possible avenues for  tax

evasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 allows the Comptroller to raise advance

assessments where a person's source of income ceases

or when he is about to leave the country. This is  a

procedural  amendment which is necessary to  prevent

tax  losses, taking into account the repeal  of  the

old cessation provisions and the introduction of the

strict preceding-year basis of assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 is to permit the Comptroller to withhold

the refund of any tax collected until the matter has

been  finally determined in the Courts of  law  with

provision  for interest to be paid on the amount  so

withheld.  This would safeguard revenue and  prevent

taxpayers  from being able to obtain refund  of  tax

which  the  Comptroller may not be able  to  recover

when  the case is finally decided in favour  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 lists the stocks and bonds which are tax-free at the date of publication of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it, is interesting to note the

number of items on today's Order Paper which are of

direct relevance to the commercial sector. All of

these items, particularly the important Bill

currently before us, when implemented, will have the

effect of helping to rationalise and liberalise

certain vital aspects of our commercial activities.

It illustrates to my mind very clearly that in

emphasising the importance of industrialisation, the

Government has not overlooked the need to assist

constantly in raising the standard of our

traditional commercial activities in order to keep

pace with changes and to maintain our position as a

leading international business centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us is an excellent example of what

the  Government can do to provide the private sector

with  wider  scope  of operation.  I  have  in  mind

clauses 3 and 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 concerns the banking industry and I hope

that  with  the official encouragement now provided,

our  banks  will proceed to attract more money  from

abroad to be deposited in Singapore and, perhaps  in

time,  we shall rival Switzerland in this particular

area  of  international  banking  service.  In  this

regard, we have two very salient points, namely, our

strong currency system and political stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 concerns the shipping industry and is

part  and parcel of the incentives promised  by  the

Minister  for Communications to encourage a  greater

number of merchant ships to fly our flag. Since  the

official  announcement of the Government's intention

to  introduce  such  facilities, I  understand  that

considerable  interest has been  aroused  the  world

over and there have been many inquiries from abroad.

I  feel sure that with the passing into law of  this

particular  amendment to the Income  Tax  Ordinance,

and a host of other advantages which are already  in

existence,  such  as the strategic position  of  our

port,  the  highly  developed port  facilities,  and

facilities  for  ship-repairing and maintenance,  we

shall  soon  see an influx of applications  for  the

registration of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



sea-going   vessels  in  Singapore,   resulting   in

expanded  employment  opportunities  for  our  young

people  who  may  be interested in  seafaring  as  a

career.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has time and again

demonstrated that, be it in the industrial sector or

the  commercial  sector, he is always  prepared  and

willing, within reason, to offer incentives  in  the

form of tax concessions to encourage development  or

expansion which will be of ultimate benefit  to  the

country.  But  the  success  or  failure   of   such

incentives  to  achieve the desired  effect  depends

largely   upon   the   initiative,   ingenuity   and

determination  that  can  be  exercised   by   those

concerned in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendments

proposed  in the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill.  I  am

only  surprised  that this amendment  Bill  was  not

introduced   earlier.  To  take  one  example,   the

commencement and cessation provisions of the  Income

Tax  Ordinance,  which are as  confusing  as  modern

abstract  paintings, have led to  confusion  amongst

laymen.



A  wage-earner cannot understand why if he commences

employment  in December in any year he  has  to  pay

income  tax  for two years in January  of  the  next

year. He has hardly worked for more than a month and

has  only  been paid one month's wages,  yet  he  is

liable  to pay income tax for the first year on  the

month  of  December,  and for  the  second  year  of

assessment,  from  December of  the  first  year  to

November of the next year. I therefore welcome  this

amendment   Bill   and  note   with   even   greater

satisfaction that those of us who have already  been

hit,  like  myself,  by  double  taxation  when   we

commenced  employment will be given a  reduction  in

income tax when we cease employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that many big business companies

have taken advantage of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



the  commencement and cessation provisions to  avoid

paying  income  tax.  This has  been  going  on  for

several  years and the Government has, as a  result,

lost  several million dollars. May I inquire whether

action can be taken to recoup these losses?



<br><br>4.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the

Parliamentary  Secretary on  introducing  this  Bill

which  is a fair and progressive measure. It clearly

shows that we have a very healthy economic policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the amendments were introduced, the Income

Tax  Ordinance was rather confusing but  now  it  is

more reasonable. Income tax will now be based on the

income derived in the preceding year, and the tax to

be  paid  next  year  will be based  on  the  income

derived this year. I believe that all taxpayers will

be satisfied with this arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where does this fair and equitable taxation

policy  come  from?  We  know  that  our  Government

practises  democratic socialism. We  often  need  to

emphasise that it is our noble aim to build  a  more

fair and more equitable society. In order to achieve

this  aim,  we  must lay down a fair and  reasonable

taxation policy. We must specify that the rich  will

bear  a greater part of the tax burden and the  poor

will be exempted from income tax. It is only through

this  progressive  policy that  we  can  realise  an

egalitarian society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that a healthy and progressive taxation

policy  will promote the development of our  economy

and  improve  the  prosperity of  the  country.  For

example, the Bill provides that ships registered  in

our country as well as deposits which are put in our

banks  by  foreigners will be exempted  from  income

tax.  I  think  this  will  encourage  more  foreign

capital to be invested in our country. Once we  have

got  hold of these investments they will be used  to

finance  the various activities of our commerce  and

industry. This will also encourage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



more  ships to be registered in our country. In this

way,  our  economy will improve and more  employment

opportunities  will be created. Therefore,  we  must

maintain a progressive economic policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment Bill mainly looks

after the interests of the rich and big enterprises.

Naturally  I  support  this  Bill  because   it   is

beneficial to our economy. But I would like to  take

this opportunity to remind the Minister that he must

also  look after the interests of the working class.

For example, we should reduce the property tax rates

on  Housing  Board flats in order  to  reduce  their

burden.  All  in  all,  this  amendment  Bill  is  a

progressive and equitable measure. I support it.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill makes several important

and   desirable   amendments  to  our   Income   Tax

Ordinance. Like the Member for Bras Basah, I am also

surprised that these amendments were not thought  of

very much earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, tax exemption is to be given in

respect of interest derived in Singapore by  a  non-resident  individual.  This will  encourage  him  to

leave  his  money here instead of taking it  out  of

Singapore for investment abroad. I am also  glad  to

know that such exemption is to be back-dated to 20th

August, 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to see that the Minister will be

given  the  power  to  exempt from  tax  any  income

received   in   Singapore   from   sources   outside

Singapore.  But  there is a proviso which  specifies

that  this  outside source must come from a  country

with which there is no arrangement for the avoidance

of  double taxation. I would be interested  to  know

how  many and which are the countries that Singapore

has  made  arrangements with for  the  avoidance  of

double taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand we have such an arrangement with

Australia.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we are getting  closer

and  closer  to  Australia in many fields,  such  as

trade  and  investment.  Any  Singaporean  who   has

considerable assets in Australia will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



not  bring back to Singapore the income derived from

these  assets, because if he does so he has  to  pay

income  tax  in  Singapore.  Hence,  he  leaves  his

assets,  whatever  they may be, in  Australia.  What

then  is the benefit to Singapore? We should be much

happier  if  this  particular  amendment  could   be

further amended by the deletion of the proviso  that

limits  the Minister's powers of exemption  only  to

countries with which Singapore does not have  double

taxation agreements.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank those Members who

spoke  in support of this Bill. They have all spoken

very  well  of our economic policies,  and  I  think

Singapore justly deserves to be the financial centre

of  this  part of the world. The provisions in  this

amendment Bill are, in fact, making this possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think two Members complained that certain

provisions, like the provisions for commencement and

cessation, were not introduced earlier. My reply  is

that  it  is  better  late than never.  Anyway,  the

present  provisions for commencement  and  cessation

are   straightforward  and   would   not   lead   to

misunderstanding by taxpayers that  they  are  taxed

twice in the year of commencement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Bras Basah wants an

assurance  from  me that the present  taxpayers  who

commenced  business or employment before the  coming

into  force of the Act would get the benefit of  the

old  cessation provision. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  can

give  this  categorical assurance. In  fact,  it  is

provided  in  the  Bill  that  those  who  commenced

business or employment before the coming into  force

of  this  Act  would  get  the  benefit  when  their

business or employment ceases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah is labouring under

some  misapprehension.  The  proviso  in  clause   3

clearly  states  that  the Minister  will  have  the

discretion to exempt from tax income from  countries

with which we have no double taxation agreement. But

where   there   is  a  double  taxation   agreement,

provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



is  made normally for the exemption of tax on income

when  it  is  remitted  back to  Singapore,  because

income  is normally taxed at the place where  it  is

earned. The whole idea of double taxation agreements

is  that  they will not be taxed twice. For example,

if  profits  are earned in Australia, the Australian

Government  will have the primary right to  tax  the

profits.    Normally,   without   double    taxation

agreements,  when the profits are remitted  back  to

Singapore,  the  Singapore  Government   will   also

exercise  the  right to tax such  profits.  However,

under   a  double  taxation  agreement  with,   say,

Australia,  it  is normally provided that  once  the

profits  are taxed in Australia, they are not  taxed

again when they are remitted back to Singapore.  The

proviso in clause 3, however, gives the Minister the

discretion  to  exempt profits from tax  where  such

profits  derived from countries with which Singapore

has  no double taxation agreement are remitted  back

to Singapore. That is the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the remark made by the Member for

Sembawang that the provisions of this Bill are  only

for  the rich. I say that it is not true. If he will

remember  that an ordinary wage-earner,  who  has  a

wife  and two children and earning less than $500  a

month is not subject to tax, he will not make such a

complaint;   he   will  realise  that   the   P.A.P.

Government  is  a  socialist one and  does  not  tax

workers with a small income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also touched on the question of

property  tax. I am very happy to announce  in  this

House  that  the  Government has decided  to  reduce

property  tax  for  all owner-occupiers  of  Housing

Board  flats to the uniform rate of 23 per  cent  of

the    annual   value.   This   again   is   another

manifestation   of   the  Government's   policy   to

encourage  people  to own their  own  homes  and  to

create a stable and prosperous society.

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>5.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when this Bill was introduced in

the House, I explained that it would amend the

Constitution in two respects. First, it would set

out a new Part relating solely to the Judiciary.

Second, it would set up the Presidential Council

whose creation was recommended by the Constitutional

Commission on minority rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six written representations were received by the

Select Committee and accepted as being relevant.

These are annexed to the Committee's Report as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



Appendix   II.   Members  will   note   that   these

representations  were made only in  respect  of  the

second  part  of the Bill, namely, the  Presidential

Council. Oral evidence was heard by the Committee in

respect of one representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No major amendments have been recommended by the

Select  Committee.  In respect of  the  first  part,

Article  52D  has  been  redrafted  because  it  was

thought  that  the requirement that one  must  be  a

citizen  before he can be appointed a Judge  of  the

High    Court   may   exclude   otherwise   suitable

candidates.  The  other change is the  insertion  of

clause  (10)  to Article 52F wherein it is  provided

that  the  President may, in his  discretion,  grant

leave  to the Chief Justice and the other Judges  of

the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Bill sets out more radical

provisions and only one minor amendment thereto  has

been  recommended -- a purely drafting amendment  to

Article 81M (5).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the Constitutional

Commission  on  minority rights had recommended  the

creation  of  the  Presidential  Council  and   that

Government  had  accepted this  recommendation.  The

main function of this Council would be to offer such

assistance  by  way  of  counsel  and  advice   upon

legislation, including subsidiary legislation,  that

might   have   provisions   which   conflict    with

fundamental   rights  and  liberties   of   minority

interests  in the State. It is hoped, as well,  that

the   Council   would  provide  the  Government   or

Parliament  with such advice as may be  sought  from

it,  on  any matter relating to the safeguarding  of

rights or liberties belonging to certain sections of

our   community,  whether  they  relate  to  racial,

religious  or  other matters. While recognising  its

usefulness,  the Government has also  provided  such

measures  in  the Bill as to ensure the  legislative

supremacy of Parliament. We have endowed the Council

with  the  authority and status to  make  its  views

known  and  felt on all those matters  I  have  just

referred to. So it is, Sir, that the Council can, in

regard to what it considers to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



differentiating measures, cause a reconsideration of

such  provisions in any proposed law or  indeed  any

existing law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Third time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is important that the

Presidential Council to be set up does its work with

honour and responsibility and not become a centre of

reaction.  It  is to be hoped that its  contribution

would  always  be directed towards the consolidation

and not the disruption and weakening of the State. I

cannot  help  feeling, however,  that  some  of  the

curious features in this amendment Bill would add  a

few  more  legal conundrums to the as yet unresolved

problem  posed  by  Articles  52  and  90   of   the

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also questionable if the two-thirds majority

in  Parliament  needed to overcome a report  by  the

Council  that a proposed piece of legislation  is  a

differentiating  measure or  otherwise  inconsistent

with  the fundamental liberties of the subject could

not  be  negatived  and overcome by  the  device  of

introducing a constitutional amendment in Parliament

requiring  only  a bare majority under  Article  90,

Rule     1.    Further,    subsidiary    legislation

characterised  by  the Council as a  differentiating

measure   or   otherwise   inconsistent   with   the

fundamental  liberties  of the  subject  could  also

remain  in the statute book as enforceable  law  for

six months before appropriate measures of revocation

are  taken. I hope, however, that it is not too much

to  expect  that  more careful and elegant  drafting

would  be a feature of the new Constitution that  we

are to have in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Constitution

(Amendment)  Bill. I wish to touch upon  the  second

part  of  the Bill, namely, the Presidential Council

and  matters related thereto. When the Bill was read

a  Second  time in Parliament, I remember I  made  a

statement   supporting  the  setting   up   of   the

Presidential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



Council.  In my opinion, I regard it as  the  second

most progressive measure ever taken by Parliament in

the  history  of  our parliamentary  democracy.  The

Select  Committee  took  into consideration  various

matters,  including  procedural,  relating  to   the

Presidential  Council.  The  Government  is  to   be

praised  for exercising care in the introduction  of

this  Bill  and its passage through all its  stages.

For  instance, there is a provision stipulating that

members  of  the Council should be people  above  35

years of age. This will enable people who are mature

and  knowledgeable to be appointed as  members.  The

Bill also provides that people of unsound mind shall

be  disqualified for appointment as members  of  the

Council. These provisions are very appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee also gave careful

consideration to the various details  in  the  Bill.

The  Presidential Council's main function is to  see

that  there is no discriminatory measure in all  our

legislation  against the minority  groups.  In  this

way,  various opinions and views can be advanced  so

that  the  Government can take a judicious stand  in

its  policies  for  the people's  benefit.  In  this

respect, the Government has set up community centres

and citizens' consultative committees throughout the

Republic to look after the interest of the people of

Singapore,  and  also  to  assess  their  views  and

opinions  so  as  to  help  the  Government  in  the

implementation of its policies. We all know that  in

dictatorial countries, the authorities do  not  like

freedom  of  expression for the people.  They  would

like  to  shut them up. But this is not a  judicious

policy.  There is a Chinese saying that it  is  more

difficult  to shut up the people than  to  stop  the

flow  of  a river. This is something that cannot  be

controlled.   We   must  develop   the   spirit   of

parliamentary  democracy.  In  this   respect,   the

setting  up of the Presidential Council will  afford

an  opportunity  for  people who have  distinguished

themselves in public service or attained eminence in

their respective walks of life to contribute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



their part in nation-building for the  benefit

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the appointment of members of the

Council,  I  would  like to make  some  suggestions.

First,   the   Council   should   be   composed   of

representatives of various races in various walks of

life. Second, the members of the Council should come

from the four streams of education. They should  not

come  from only one stream of education. As  we  are

implementing  the  policy of  multi-lingualism,  the

Council  should conduct its proceedings in the  four

official languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, can the Minister say when this

Presidential  Council will be set up? Two  or  three

years  have  elapsed since the  setting  up  of  the

Constitutional Commission. As ours is  an  efficient

government, every kind of work should be efficiently

carried  out. The people of Singapore would like  to

know when the Presidential Council can be set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing the speech of the

Member  for Sembawang, I feel that certain parts  of

his speech are worth listening to. For instance, the

Constitution (Amendment) Bill represents a  symbolic

step  in Parliament. But he has not said why  it  is

so.   If  we  look  up  the  political  history   of

Singapore,  we  can  see  that  there  is  a   great

difference in the present Constitution of  Singapore

compared  to the Singapore (Constitution)  Order  in

Council, 1958. From there we can see where  we  have

progressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been introduced in the House

together   with   the   Criminal   Procedure    Code

(Amendment) Bill. The Constitution (Amendment)  Bill

is   on  constitutional  matters  and  the  Criminal

Procedure  Code  (Amendment)  Bill  is  on  judicial

matters. With their passage, we can see that we have

progressed  constitutionally as well as in  criminal

procedural law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we debated the Criminal Procedure Code

(Amendment) Bill yesterday, we heard that there  was

a person who held a public rally at Fullerton Square

against  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  (Amendment)

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Bukit

Merah has deviated in his speech on the Constitution

(Amendment) Bill. He is referring to the rally  held

at Fullerton Square which has no relationship at all

with the Constitution (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Sembawang must appreciate that I am

listening  to  the  Member for Bukit  Merah  in  the

spirit of the season. Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Perhaps the Member for Sembawang is too impatient.

I  was  about  to refer to the Bill now  before  the

House. Just now I was talking about a certain person

who  held a public rally at Fullerton Square against

the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill. But we

have not seen anybody holding a public rally against

the Constitution (Amendment) Bill. Perhaps there  is

an   explanation  in  that  not  many   people   are

interested  in  the setting up of  the  Presidential

Council.  There  is  another view  that  this  is  a

democratic process which is easily understood by all

people  and that there need not be any hue  and  cry

against  it. Furthermore, the Bill would be able  to

present  a  kind of democratic spirit. This  is  an

honour   that  Parliament  has  achieved.   However,

without  the setting up of the Presidential Council,

it  does  not  mean  that our  Constitution  is  not

democratic or up to date. The point is that with the

introduction of the Bill, our Constitution can  cope

with  more comprehensive matters and in wider  scope

touching on the interest of minority groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore is multi-racial, it is very

necessary to look after the interests and  needs  of

the   minority  groups.  Article  89  (1)   of   the

Constitution of Singapore is a provision relating to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



rights  of  the minorities. Even before we  achieved

our  present  stage of progress in our Constitution,

the Government had already taken care of the welfare

and  interest of the minorities. With this amendment

Bill,   we  can  improve  the  provisions   of   the

Constitution  so  as to look after  their  interests

better. The Presidential Council can assess opinions

and  views from various quarters and put their heads

together to consider any legislation which might  be

a  discriminating measure. This is in  keeping  with

our  democratic  practice. This will  cut  down  any

possibility  of dictatorial measures in legislation.

In  this  context, I must say that the Bill and  its

provisions are very appropriate at this time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>5.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may first deal with the

Member  for  Sembawang. He wants to  know  when  the

Presidential Council will be set up. The  answer  is

next  year.  How early next year I do not  know.  It

takes  a  lot of administrative work to get  such  a

Council  on  to  its  feet. But perhaps  the  Member

himself is anxious to get on the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang questioned whether

the provision in Article 81K (6) (c) of the Bill  is

not  inconsistent  with or illogical  when  compared

with  the  present  Article 90 of  our  Constitution

relating  to  constitutional  amendments.  He   also

referred to Article 52 which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any law enacted by the Legislature after the

coming into operation of this Constitution which  is

inconsistent  with this Constitution shall,  to  the

extent of the inconsistency, be void.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 90 (1) provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The provisions of this Constitution may be

amended by a law enacted by the Legislature.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the law now stands, the Constitution may

be  amended  by a simple majority, as laid  down  in

Article  90. But Article 81K clause (6) (c)  of  the

Bill  requires  a two-thirds majority  in  order  to

overcome any adverse opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



of the Council to the effect that a provision in the

proposed   law   is   a   differentiating    measure

inconsistent with the fundamental liberties  of  the

subjects.  Members will agree that it  is  only  but

right  that we should have this provision  in  order

that  Parliament may not, without such  a  majority,

abrogate  these  fundamental liberties  if,  in  the

opinion  of the Council, a Bill would have such  ill

effects.  Any  suggestion that  the  requirement  in

Article  81K clause (6) (c) might be overcome  by  a

withdrawal  and  re-submission of  such  a  proposed

measure  as the Constitution (Amendment) Bill  would

be  quite incorrect. Such a Constitution (Amendment)

Bill would again have to obtain the clearance of the

Presidential Council so that any such Bill which  in

the   opinion  of  the  Council  adversely   affects

fundamental rights or liberties may not be passed by

Parliament without a two-thirds majority.  There  is

really  nothing inconsistent with the constitutional

amendment  provisions. The effects of the particular

clause would be to ensure further the protection  of

these fundamental rights or liberties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask the Minister some

questions and would also like him to clarify certain

points.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister has spoken in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): There were some questions which were not replied

to. Can I ask him to clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask the Minister about the two

questions  I mentioned just now. The first  question

relates  to  the  appointment  of  members  of   the

Presidential  Council. Can the Minister  assure  the

House  that the members of the Council will  include

people from various races and all walks of life, and

also from all the streams of education?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if the Member for Sembawang had taken the

trouble to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



read  the  Report of the Select Committee, he  would

not  have  to ask me these questions. These  matters

were   raised  in  representations  to  the   Select

Committee  and the Committee's Report is before  the

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not appoint members of the Presidential

Council,  but certainly the Member's views  will  be

taken into account. It is a great pity, after having

heard him today, that we did not appoint him to  the

Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> The Member for Sembawang cannot read English! You

have to excuse him.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>ABORTION BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>5.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee considered 33 written

submissions  on  the Abortion Bill  and  heard  oral

evidence  from  the representors of  five  different

organisations  which  had submitted  memoranda.  The

Committee  decided to incorporate certain amendments

based  on  some  of  the points brought  up  in  the

memoranda as well as in oral evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no change in the basic purposes of the

Bill was deemed necessary. The basic aim of the Bill

is to reform and liberalise the abortion law so that

women  with unwanted pregnancies may, on social  and

humanitarian  grounds  as well  as  on  medical  and

eugenic   considerations,  have  their   pregnancies

terminated   safely   and   cheaply   in    approved

institutions and by approved doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was expected, there were written submissions

which  argue  on  the principles  of  the  Bill.  Of

course, the stand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



taken depended upon whether the individual person or

the  organisation which made the representation  was

for or against the principle of treatment by way  of

a  deliberate act to terminate pregnancy. Some  took

their  stand  in  accordance with  their  particular

religious  persuasion, although they of  course  did

not  want openly to admit it. There were also  other

submissions  which proposed amendments  to  specific

provisions  of  the Bill. Often the  representations

took  the  form of the first part being  devoted  to

arguments on principle and, in the latter  part,  to

propose  specific  amendments to  the  Bill.  It  is

interesting  to note that there were also  memoranda

which,  in  the first instance, argued  against  the

principle  of  the  liberalisation  of  the  law  of

abortion, but later went on to propose amendments to

specific  provisions  of  the  Bill,  presumably  to

improve it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the issues raised in the submissions

pertaining to the principles of the Bill were indeed

familiar ground as these had already been covered by

arguments  for and against the Bill which  had  been

raised  before the Bill was presented to  Parliament

and which were exhaustively debated in Parliament at

the  Second Reading of the Bill. I can say that, all

in   all,  with  a  few  exceptions,  most  of   the

representations were agreed that there was a need to

reform  and liberalise our law of abortion, although

there was disagreement on specific provisions of the

Bill  and their wording and how far we should go  in

liberalising it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the representations, the Select

Committee  decided  upon certain amendments  to  the

Bill.  But  I  wish  to emphasise  here  that  these

amendments to the Bill will in no way alter the aims

and objectives of the Bill or deviate from the basic

considerations   which  had  made   the   Government

introduce  the Bill. Neither would they in  any  way

weaken  the  Bill  as  had  been  suggested  in  one

quarter.  The  amendments which  are  submitted  for

acceptance  would,  in fact, improve  the  Bill  and

considerably strengthen some of its provisions.  For

this, I would like to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



the  opportunity here to express my thanks to  those

who  had come forward to make representations to the

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to comment on every one of the

amendments  which  the Select Committee  decided  to

recommend  acceptance by the House. These have  been

described  in  detail in the Report  of  the  Select

Committee. I propose instead to consider them  under

main subject headings. They are as follows:



<br><br><i>(1)  Membership of the Termination of Pregnancy  Authorisation Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of members of the Board remains

at  11. The amended changes relate to changes in the

composition  of the five appointed members.  Of  the

five  members to be appointed by the Minister, three

instead of the original two shall be females. It  is

further  specified  in the amendments  that  two  of

these   three   women  are  to  be   "professionally

qualified social workers". The original text  stated

it rather ambiguously as persons with "experience in

social welfare work".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for these amendments will be

immediately apparent to Members. It was pointed  out

both in written representations and in oral evidence

that  abortions involve primarily the female  person

and,  therefore,  female  representation  should  be

larger.   Hence  the  amendment  to   increase   the

appointed  number  of  female members  to  at  least

three.  The number can, of course, be larger if  the

Minister  wishes to appoint more women on the  Board

if he considers this of advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment to the Board of two

"professionally qualified social workers" instead of

persons with "experience in social welfare work" was

made  on  the  suggestion of various  organisations.

such  as  the  Catholic  Social  Guild,  the  Inter-Religious  Organisation and the professional  social

workers.   Professionally  qualified   persons   are

identifiable.  They  are  persons  who   possess   a

qualification in social work, i.e., the  Diploma  in

Social  Studies. This would not be the case  if  the

original term "experience in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



social  welfare work" is used, as this could include

a  range  of  persons from charitable organisations,

voluntary workers and those whose experience may  be

limited and not relevant to the issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments relating to the membership of

the Board are minor administrative amendments. Thus,

for  clarification, the filling of a casual  vacancy

on   the  Board  should  be  by  a  person  who  has

equivalent  qualifications to  the  member  whom  he

replaces.  Also, the composition of the  Board,  but

not  the  number, may be varied by the Minister.  In

the original text the Minister would be able to vary

the composition as well as the number of members  of

the   Board.  This  appeared  objectionable  to  the

Catholic Social Guild.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(2) Conditions under which abortions may be authorised</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several significant amendments to the conditions

under  which abortions may be authorised  have  been

accepted  as a result of the suggestions by  various

representations   made   orally   and   in   written

submissions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment makes a qualification to the

medical  reasons  under which  an  abortion  may  be

authorised. In the original text, an abortion  could

be performed where there was risk to the life of the

pregnant woman or injury to her physical and  mental

health.  The  amendment clarifies that  these  risks

should  be  "serious"  risks. The  addition  of  the

adjective to qualify the risk to life or the  threat

to  a woman's physical and mental well-being injects

a relative term into the considerations and probably

will  restrict the conditions under which  abortions

can  be  carried  out for medical  reasons.  If  the

amendment  is  accepted, medical practitioners  will

probably  find  their  area of manoeuvre  restricted

even more than under the present law which allows an

abortion to be performed where there is a threat  to

the  life and health of the pregnant woman,  without

qualification.  The  amendment  is   made   on   the

suggestion of various representations, that is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



the  Singapore  Medical  Association,  the  Catholic

Social  Guild,  the Catholic Medical Guild  and  the

Regional Council of Churches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since, however, this amendment was largely

proposed  by  the  medical  profession  which   have

probably weighed the disadvantages, the amendment is

submitted  for  acceptance.  But  I  would  like  to

reiterate  here that this amendment will in  no  way

weaken this part of the Bill. In fact, it will serve

to clarify the position of this provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment (made to clause 5 (2) (d))

adds  another condition under which an abortion  may

be approved by the Board. This is when pregnancy has

been due to carnal connection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter makes unlawful carnal

connection with any girl under 16 years of age.  The

exception  is  when the girl is married.  Since  the

clause provides that pregnancy consequent on rape or

incest  is  ground for abortion, it is equally  good

grounds for adding this other sexual assault on  the

girl to be included under this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further amendment relating to the conditions

under  which abortions can be performed  relates  to

abortions in cases of emergencies. This is  provided

under  clause  5  (5).  Under this  clause,  it  was

provided that an abortion could be performed when it

is  immediately necessary to save the  life  of  the

pregnant mother or to prevent grave permanent injury

to  the  physical or mental health of  the  pregnant

woman.   The   amendment  seeks  to   restrict   the

practitioner's discretion to a condition where it is

immediately  necessary to perform the  operation  to

save the life of the pregnant woman. In other words,

the  condition where there may be reason to  perform

the  operation to prevent grave permanent injury  to

physical  or  mental health is excluded  under  this

clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment was made on the suggestion of the

Singapore  Medical  Association  in  the  course  of

discussions  with  its  representatives  in   Select

Committee. The view expressed was that if there  was

a grave threat of permanent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



physical  or  mental injury of the  pregnant  woman,

this  should be done under a different clause  (i.e.

clause  5  (3))  where a second medical  opinion  is

required and that the operation is carried out in  a

Government hospital or in an approved hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth significant amendment relates to the

citizenship   status  of  the  woman  applying   for

abortion. The relevant clause is clause 5  (8).  The

original text would have covered abortions under the

approved conditions to residents of Singapore  only.

Although  a  woman  who is "resident  in  Singapore"

would  normally include Singapore citizens, it could

happen  that  such  a citizen might  not  have  been

resident  in Singapore during the four months  prior

to  the  application of the abortion and  would,  by

interpretation of this clause, become ineligible for

consideration for an abortion. Obviously this is not

the  intention  of the Bill. The intention  of  this

clause  is to exclude non-residents and non-citizens

from  taking advantage of the liberalisation of  our

laws.  It  should not operate, however, against  our

women  citizens. The amendment seeks to clarify  and

forestall     the    remote,    though     possible,

interpretation of the clause against  our  citizens.

It  specifies that an abortion may be authorised  if

the pregnant woman is a resident in Singapore in the

four  months  prior  to  the application,  or  is  a

citizen or wife of a citizen of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments under this heading are

administrative and consequential to the three  major

amendments which I have just described. For example,

it   is  provided  that  a  report  of  an  abortion

performed   for  medical  reasons   by   a   medical

practitioner where the prior authority of the  Board

has not been obtained will have to be made within 14

days.  It  was  considered that  the  original  text

providing  for  the report to be made  "as  soon  as

possible" was ambiguous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(3) Processing of applications for abortions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several amendments are proposed relating to the

clauses which pertain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



to   the  work  of  the  Board  in  processing   the

applications  for  abortions. This  may  briefly  be

described as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(a) Referrals for specialist opinion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 7, the Board may make reference, as

circumstances arise, to specialists for an  opinion

on  an  application before it makes a  decision  on

it.  In  the  original text, in clause 7  (4)  (d),

this  was limited to a reference to an obstetrician

and  gynaecologist. It was rightly pointed out that

this  was an unnecessary restriction. There may  be

other  conditions  outside  the  competence  of  an

obstetrician  and gynaecologist which  may  require

another medical specialist opinion, say, that of  a

physician  or a psychiatrist. With this  amendment,

the  Board would have the discretion to refer  such

matters to the appropriate specialist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(b) Consent for the operation of termination of pregnancy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For obvious reasons, the Board has to be

satisfied that the application for abortion  is  of

genuine  intent  and  a  consent  to  undergo   the

operation is an indication of this intent. A  valid

consent  for  such  an operation  is  described  in

clause  8. This clause states that a valid  consent

may  be  given by a woman who is over 18  years  of

age.  By  the  proposed amendment,  this  has  been

extended  to  a  married woman even though  she  is

under 18 years of age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only where the pregnant woman is unmarried

and  under 18 years of age that the consent of  her

parents or that of a guardian is required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(c) Participation in the decisions of the Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a safeguard to the impartiality of the Board,

an amendment is provided in clause 9 to disallow  a

member  of the Board or any committee appointed  by

the  Board involved in any way with the application

or  in  the operation to terminate a pregnancy, to

be  party  to  the authorisation for  treatment  to

terminate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



pregnancy. This amendment has been inserted  on  the

suggestion   of  the  Inter-Religious  Organisation,

whose  representors to the Select Committee appeared

rather   concerned  and  wished   to   exclude   the

possibility   of   a  conspiracy   between   medical

practitioners to procure an abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(4) Conscientious objection</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original text of clause 10, which is called

the  "conscience clause", provides that a person who

has   a   conscientious  objection  may  refuse   to

participate in any treatment to terminate pregnancy.

Sub-clause (2) of clause 10, however, states that in

any  legal  proceedings  the  burden  of  proof   of

conscientious  objection shall rest  on  the  person

claiming  to  rely  on  it. This  unfortunately  has

caused some misapprehension, as can be seen from the

representation of the Singapore Medical  Association

as  well  as several others. Therefore, in order  to

clear  the ambiguity, an amendment has been proposed

which  will provide specifically the manner in which

a  person  who  may be involved in the operation  of

termination   of   pregnancy   can   indicate    his

conscientious  objection  to  participate   in   the

operation. This is done by the person testifying  on

oath  or  affirmation  that he has  a  conscientious

objection  to  participating  in  the  operation  of

abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, many other amendments which

had  been  suggested by the various  representations

but  which  the  Select  Committee  had  decided  to

reject.  One  of  the amendments  proposed  but  was

rejected  was from the Singapore Medical Association

which  sought to add in a phrase that an  additional

child  "is likely to impose additional and  grievous

hardship  on  the  woman  or  her  family"  to   the

environmental clause, i.e., clause 5 (2) (b).  As  I

have  stated  before, this proposal to add  in  this

additional phrase, though it may appear to make  the

clause slightly restrictive, adds nothing materially

to  the criterion already contained in it, nor  does

it in any way alter its essential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



meaning,  that  is,  to allow  abortions  on  socio-economic  grounds.  Moreover, it  has  been  rightly

pointed  out  that  it  may unnecessarily  impose  a

restriction  on  the  judgment of  the  Board  which

already  has  a  difficult  job  to  perform.   This

suggested  amendment was accordingly  rejected.  The

reasons  for  the  rejection of the other  suggested

amendments become quite apparent, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

if  you  are to read through the proceedings of  the

Select Committee as published in its Report, and  I,

therefore, do not propose to go through them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the passage of this Bill

together  with  its  companion Bill,  the  Voluntary

Sterilization Bill, is certainly an event  of  major

importance to the people of our Republic. This  Bill

has  been rightly described outside this House as  a

Human  Rights Bill. When adopted by this  House,  it

will  forever  liberate our women from  the  present

tyranny  of unwanted pregnancies. It will  free  the

family  from the burden of having to feed  and  care

for  the  child  which,  on account  of  family  and

financial hardships, it is just unable to do. As for

the  community,  it will be spared  the  tragedy  of

having  unwanted  children from  whom  most  of  the

delinquents,  the  criminals  and  the   anti-social

elements  are derived. This is the social evil  from

which  our  community will be freed.  On  the  other

hand,  it will help to ensure that children born  in

Singapore  will  be wanted children, being  children

who   will   be   properly  cared   for   and   have

opportunities for education and the full development

of  their faculties so that they can grow up to lead

meaningful lives and contribute to our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also respects the religious and ethical

beliefs of our people in that it does not compel any

woman to have an abortion if she does not want it on

account of her religious and ethical beliefs or  for

any  other  reasons. But it makes  it  possible  for

those  whose  religious and ethical beliefs  do  not

forbid  them from having an abortion to request  for

treatment by way of a deliberate act of termination



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



of pregnancy under certain conditions as specified

in  the  Bill.  This  indeed  does  vindicate  the

freedom  and  rights  of the  individual  and  his

conscience   which   is  so   important   in   our

multiracial and multi-religious society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of this Bill indeed marks a historic

milestone in the development and progress  of  our

Republic.  This  Abortion Bill, which  will  allow

abortions on purely socio-economic grounds  under

its environmental clause, can indeed be considered

one  of  the  most  progressive pieces  of  social

legislation  ever  to  be  adopted  in  the   non-Communist world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, when it becomes law, will be in force

for four years and may be extended for a period of

not  more than one year, after which it will  have

to  come up for review before Parliament. No doubt

time    and    experience   gathered   from    its

administration  will  tell us  how  effective  the

great change proposed in this Bill will fulfil its

purposes. Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



course,  we shall watch very carefully the effects

of  the implementation of this law on our  social

and  medical habits, and if it is deemed necessary

in  the  light of experience gathered, it  can  be

brought up for review before this House even  much

earlier.  However, I have every  confidence  that,

barring   initial   practical   difficulties    in

implementation, this Bill, on which a  great  deal

of thought and consideration had been given, would

more  than  fulfil the purposes for which  it  has

been drawn up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
