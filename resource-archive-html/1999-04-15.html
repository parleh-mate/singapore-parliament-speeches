<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) what is the total number of pork sellers,  pork-based and pork-related traders and stallholders who are affected

by the ban on the import of live pigs into Singapore;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>

and  (b)  whether  there  are other forms  of  assistance  being

considered  to help these traders and stallholders,  apart  from

the one-month rental waiver for pork stallholders and factories.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether, in the recent viral outbreak, the illnesses

of  the  abattoir workers and those involved in the  trading  of

pigs  could  have  been  avoided,  and  how  serious  are  their

illnesses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir,  may I have your permission  to take  Question

Nos 1, 2 and 3 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Thank you. Sir, first, let me give a

quick  summary of what happened.  Following the outbreak of  the

Japanese  Encephalitis (JE) in Malaysia, the Primary  Production

Department  (PPD) monitored the situation closely  and  kept  in

close contact with their counterparts in Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the situation deteriorated in Malaysia, PPD

progressively  took  additional  measures.   PPD   carried   out

serological surveys on imported pigs to confirm that  there  was

no  active  JE  infection  in imported pigs.   Mosquito  control

measures were intensified.  Abattoir workers were advised to  be

vaccinated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was reported that a Hendra-like virus has been

isolated from human cases in Malaysia, PPD stopped the import of

all  pigs  from Malaysia and closed our abattoirs.  As an  added

precaution, PPD also banned the import of dogs, cats, horses and

other  mammals from Malaysia.  These measures are still in place

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPD and other agencies in the Ministries of the Environment

and  Health  are  still closely monitoring the  situation.   The

measures  put in place have been effective in not only  ensuring

that JE did not occur in Singapore but also that the outbreak of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>

the previously unknown Hendra-like virus has been contained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on the impact of the ban. The ban on

the  import  of  live  pigs  into  Singapore  has  affected  the

following groups of people directly:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. 22 live pig importers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. 759 pork stallholders (647 pork stallholders in

markets managed by HDB, and another 112 by ENV);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. 98 meat processing plants licensed by PPD. These

plants, employing about 860 workers, are involved in the cutting

and  deboning  of  pork, meat roasting and the manufacturing  of

Chinese and Taiwanese sausages, and sweet meat (bak kua); and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv 75 food factory tenants in HDB industrial estates. 11

of these are meat processing plants licensed by PPD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist those directly affected by the ban and with

little recourse to substitutes, both HDB and ENV have waived the

rent  for pork stalls in HDB and ENV markets for one month.   As

for  the 75 food factory tenants, they either received a  waiver

of  one-month rent or a half-a-month (if they are not completely

dependent  on  fresh pork supplies), and one month  service  and

conservancy charges given by the PAP Town Councils.    Both  HDB

and  ENV would review the concessions given towards the  end  of

the  one-month  rent free period and may extend the  waiver,  if

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the resumption of live pig imports, we will

only  allow it when we are certain and confident that  they  are

safe for the Singaporean public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When pigs can be imported from Malaysia will depend on how

successfully the current disease outbreak is controlled.  We

will resume imports from Johor only when the area can be

declared to be a disease-free zone according to international

standards.  We do not foresee this taking place in the immediate

future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pig farms in Pulau Bulan, Indonesia, were not affected

by  the JE or Hendra-like virus outbreak.  However, now that  we

know of the existence of the Hendra-like virus in our region, we

have  to  take special precautions.  First, Pulau Bulan must  be

free  from  the  Hendra-like virus  or  Nipah  virus.   PPD  has

recently  inspected Pulau Bulan and did not observe any clinical

evidence of the disease there.  PPD has also taken blood samples

of  the pigs and sent them to CDC, Atlanta, USA, for Nipah virus

testing.   When we receive the test results to confirm that  the

farms  and the island are free from the disease, then we can  be

sure  that Pulau Bulan is indeed free.  Following that, we  will

do  regular blood testing every two weeks to exclude  the  Nipah

virus infection.  We will also maintain strict viral security at

the  farms, ie, the pigs can only be brought into the farms with

PPD's  approval.   We will insist on the maintenance  of  strict

hygiene  and control of vectors such as mosquitoes,  bats  which

are potential Nipah virus vector and rodents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, PPD will insist that the following measures be

taken:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All pigs, from the weaning stage, must wear ear tags that

are  serially  numbered  and approved  by  PPD  as  a  means  of

identification.  Each consignment of pigs must be  isolated  for

two weeks prior to exporting to Singapore.  Every consignment of

pigs  must  be inspected by a PPD veterinary officer  to  ensure

that  the  pigs  are properly identified and are healthy  before

loading   into   barges  for  transport  to  Singapore.    Every

consignment  of  pigs  must again be inspected  for  health  and

identification on arrival in Singapore.  In the short term,  PPD

will  station  its  own veterinary officers full-time  at  Pulau

Bulan  to  check production and health records, closely  monitor

the  farms  for any sign of infectious diseases and ensure  that

all pigs are properly tagged and accounted for.  In this way, we

can be confident that any pig imported into Singapore from Pulau

Bulan will be disease-free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asked whether the illnesses could have

been avoided.  Let me

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>

explain that our actions taken have been effective

in preventing the JE outbreak from occurring in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the illnesses affecting the local abattoir workers

have  been confirmed to be due to the previously unknown Hendra-like  virus.   Prior to 19th March 1999, there were  no  reports

from  Malaysia that indicated that another virus other  than  JE

may be involved in the human cases there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also asked about the seriousness of the illnesses.

Eleven abattoir workers were affected by the viral illness.   Of

these,  9 had infection of the brain and 2 had infection of  the

lungs.  One of the patients died and 9 have been discharged from

hospital  as at 12th April 1999.  The remaining patient  who  is

still in hospital has improved and is in stable condition.   The

patient  is  expected to be discharged from hospital later  this

week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illness caused by the Hendra-like virus is serious and

can  be fatal.  Prompt action by the various Government agencies

has  limited  the number of infections.  We were unfortunate  to

have  one  fatality  but  we are thankful  that  the  rest  have

recovered.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  if we need to diversify our sources of food import  as

much as possible from now on and whether he will promote chilled

fresh meat as the preferred choice of meat in Singapore, and  if

anything can be done and has been done to facilitate this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the outbreak of the Nipah virus is

of  serious  consequences to us as far as our  pig  imports  are

concerned.   Even with all the precautions that we  have  taken,

the   supply  from  Pulau  Bulan  can  only  meet  20%  of   our

consumption.   At the same time, we do not see the  supply  from

Johor or the rest of Malaysia coming in in the immediate future.

So  our main sources will have to be from other countries in the

form   of   chilled  or  frozen  pork.   This  is  the  business

environment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>

that we are communicating to those in the trade.  We

are having discussions with the pork stallholders association

and explaining to them that they have to adjust to this new

environment and the Government would help them to adapt to this

new condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At best, Pulau Bulan can supply us 20%. The supply from

Malaysia  will not be forthcoming, and even if it is forthcoming

in  the  following months or years, it will continue to  have  a

question  mark because of the outbreak of the Hendra virus.   We

will  always  have  to  look out for  possible  outbreaks.   For

reasons  of food safety and hygiene and diversification  of  our

sources, we feel that we have to move to chilled and frozen pork

from  a  wider  variety of sources and we will be  working  with

traders  in the trade on how to adjust to providing chilled  and

frozen pork to Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister has

said  that the PAP Town Councils have given a waiver of  service

and  conservancy charges to all stalls selling  pork.   I  would

like  to report to this House that the Potong Pasir Town Council

has done likewise.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask two

questions?  The first is:  is pork, which has been infected with

the Nipah virus and the Hendra-like virus, safe for eating?  The

second  question is:  how can we ensure that if we eat  pork  we

would  not suffer from eating pork precisely since there  was  a

case of pigs being smuggled into Singapore recently?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have said this repeatedly. First of

all,  pigs  which  are  affected by JE, the  pork  is  safe  for

consumption.  JE is not transmitted from human to human  and  it

is  not transmitted from eating pork.  The evidence so far shows

that  this  is the same for the Hendra-like virus or  the  Nipah

virus, ie, you will not contract the virus from a human being or

from eating pork.  The evidence so far shows that those who were

down  with  the disease were in direct contact with  a  diseased

pig.  That is the main source of infection.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I

ask the Minister, given that there is a Hendra-like virus

involved, race-horses which have visited Malaysia in the last

six months may be susceptible to this.  What measures is the

Ministry taking to make sure that these horses are not infected?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, since 19th March 1999, we have

banned   the  movement  of  race-horses  between  Malaysia   and

Singapore.  These horses are kept in quarantine.  They have been

tested  for infection of the virus.  The Turf  Club in Singapore

has  also  systematically set out to  test  all  the  horses  in

Singapore  as  a  precautionary  measure.   Only  when  we   are

confident  that  the horses are free from the  disease  will  we

admit the horses into Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Will the Government assist existing

fresh pork sellers to transfer to the sale of chilled and frozen

pork?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We are in discussion with the

association  and  stallholders.  We think it  is  necessary  and

important for the stallholders to switch to facilities that  can

allow  them  to  sell frozen or chilled pork.   I  think  Lianhe

Zaobao  has reported that a stallholder in Marine Parade  market

has  renovated his stall to sell chilled pork.  It shows a  very

innovative  and entrepreneurial approach to the situation.   The

chiller  facilities  cost  less than  $6,000.   The  Government,

through  HDB  and ENV, will facilitate all this conversion.   We

will  provide the necessary power supply.  We will  upgrade  all

our  wet  markets  so  that  all the  stalls  can  be  similarly

upgraded.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister about the wild

boars in Pulau Ubin which have been ordered to be killed?  Given

that  we  are taking the approach of testing race-horses,  might

not  the same approach be taken for these wild boars, that  they

be hunted down, anaesthetized and then tested, rather than being

shot on sight?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It is a pleasure to be talking about

pigs  rather than HDB flats!  But I am afraid wild boars do  not

quite

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>

come under my Ministry.  These are wild boars in

Pulau Ubin and from what I read in the newspapers, there seems

to be an over-population of wild boars and MINDEF is taking this

opportunity to cull the wild boars.  If the wild boars can be

tested for the disease, then I hear a comment from behind me

that they would not be wild boars.  They would be tamed boars!

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, could the Minister

clarify  whether other meats are exposed to the danger of  these

viruses, such as beef, chicken and duck?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> There is no evidence that the virus has

spread to any other meat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Law whether

the occupants of the former Istana Kampong Glam and the adjacent

Lot  53  will  receive resettlement benefits  and  what  is  the

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  first  part of the Member's question concerns  resettlement

benefits  of  the occupants.  In the case of the  former  Istana

Kampong  Glam, those occupants living there at the cut-off  date

of  13th March 1999 will be considered for resettlement benefits

under prevailing resettlement policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Lot 53 which was acquired under the Land Acquisition

Act,   the  normal  process  is  for  Land  Office  to  make   a

compensation award based on vacant possession, in which case the

issue of resettlement will not arise.  However, if the landowner

does  not  deliver vacant possession, an award on an  encumbered

basis  will be made instead, in which case the occupiers of  the

property will be cleared under existing resettlement policy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Member's question asks

about the Government's plan with respect to the Sultan Hussain

Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some 79 beneficiaries who are receiving payments

under  that  Ordinance.  Many of them are not even in Singapore.

Of  those  in Singapore, only a few of them, about 14,  actually

live in the former Istana Kampong Glam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Sultan Hussain Ordinance has been

clarified by Government in the past.  In particular, the  former

Minister for National Development, Mr S Dhanabalan, set out  the

position clearly in this House on 12th March 1991, and  I  quote

an extract:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1896, towards the end of the last century, there was a

dispute  among the family of Sultan Hussain as to  who  was  the

successor  to the Sultanate and to the estate, ie,  the  Kampong

Glam  Estate.   This matter went to court and in December  1897,

the  Court of Appeal ruled that there was no one who could claim

to  be  the  successor.  The estate, therefore reverted  to  the

Crown.  It became State land and it was no longer subject to the

treaties which previously affected it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Kampong Glam Estate including the former

Istana has been State Land since 1897.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Government then enacted the Sultan Hussain

Ordinance in 1904.  The intention of the Ordinance was  to  take

care  of the financial needs of the family at that time  of  the

late  Sultan  Hussain  who were described by  the  then  British

Governor  as "very improvident people".  The Ordinance  provided

for  annual  payment of monies to the family of the late  Sultan

Hussain  pegged  to  the income derived from  the  Kampong  Glam

Estate.   These  payments were not intended to be in  perpetuity

but  were  intended to be made only to "the family of  the  late

Sultan   Hussain"  at  the  time  the  Ordinance  was   enacted.

Nevertheless,  for  historical  reasons,  annual  payments  were

continued to be made by subsequent Governments all these 100-odd

years.   This  has  led  to  a  very  unsatisfactory  situation.

Firstly,   while  the  number  of  beneficiaries  has   steadily

increased, the payments are getting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>

smaller as the income from which the payments are

made has diminished.  Secondly, in future the payments would

become even smaller over time as the number of beneficiaries

increases.  In view of these factors and with the recently

announced new conservation projects for Istana Kampong Glam and

the adjacent building as a Malay Heritage Centre, Government has

decided that it is timely to review the scheme of payments under

the Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided on a new scheme of

payments.   Firstly,  we will increase the  actual  payments  to

$350,000  per  annum.  Secondly, this new sum  of  $350,000  per

annum will be maintained for a fixed period of 30 years starting

from  this  year to be distributed among the existing number  of

beneficiaries in the same proportion to the total annual payment

that  they are receiving at present.  This revised fixed  income

will  be a substantial increase of more than 10 times the actual

annual payment to the beneficiaries at present which amounts  to

about  $29,231.   In  addition, if any beneficiary  wishes,  the

Government  will allow him the option of receiving  a  lump  sum

payment up-front which would be equivalent to the present  value

of the future stream of payments under the new scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new scheme will apply to all existing beneficiaries

regardless  of  where they presently live.  Those  beneficiaries

who  are  now occupants at the former Istana Kampong  Glam  will

benefit from this new scheme of payments in addition to whatever

resettlement benefits they may get as described earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new scheme is an equitable way of meeting the

interests  of  the existing beneficiaries.  The  alternative  of

maintaining  the status quo will mean progressively  diminishing

amounts of payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office will contact the beneficiaries individually

to explain the new scheme to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> I would like to thank the

Minister for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>

know whether this would include the beneficiaries who are

resident overseas.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Indeed, because under the present scheme,

all  the 79 beneficiaries are entitled to the payments,  so  the

revised scheme would also apply to them.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, what

about  those present beneficiaries who do not want to  take  the

lump sum?  Will they draw that sum after 30 years?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> This new scheme, as I said, is for a

period of 30 years, which we think is more than reasonable.   It

should  take  care  of  most of their  adult  life.   It  cannot

obviously be in perpetuity because the intention was never to be

in perpetuity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Zulkifli

bin Baharudin -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry, in respect of

the  Venture Capital Fund for technopreneurs, (a) what  are  the

criteria  for  eligibility;  (b) whether  there  are  any  other

schemes to help technopreneurs have better access to loans;  and

(c)  whether  there are plans to have more liberal  policies  to

deal with problems of business failures and bankruptcies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Question No. 5, Sir.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Venture capital is smart money. All venture capital

funds  will subject projects seeking their investment to careful

analysis.  They  will  assess  the  value  of  the  intellectual

property,  the risk involved and the expected rate of return  on

investment.  Ultimately, the success of the funds will depend on

their   willingness  to  assess  industry  potential  and   take

calculated risks.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government venture capital funds must also be governed by

the  same principles of risk-return.  Through EDB and NSTB,  the

Government  helps  to provide seed funding  for  new  start-ups.

Projects  invested by these funds are subject to  standard  'due

diligence' analysis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technopreneurship 21 Committee will consider other

schemes to help technopreneurs gain better access to loans.  Our

support   of  technopreneurs  should  extend  beyond   financial

assistance.  It is equally important to give adequate support in

other  areas, such as providing business guidance and developing

market  intelligence.  To illustrate, NSTB's  recently  launched

$10  million  Technology Incubator Programme not  only  provides

seed funding for technopreneurs, it also engages individuals and

companies  as  incubator  managers  to  nurture  local  start-up

companies.  Our technopreneurship development strategy  must  be

comprehensive,  covering not just financing but also  education,

facilities and regulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important requirements in building up a

technopreneurship  sector in Singapore is a change  in  mindset.

We  need a culture rich in innovation and enterprise. We need to

reduce  our social cost of failure and encourage those who  fail

to  try again.  In this respect, our rules and regulations  will

be  reviewed  under the T21 initiative, with a view to  removing

the  obstacles for risk-taking.  A private sector committee  has

been  set  up  to  review our existing rules and regulations  in

order    to    facilitate   technopreneurship.    The    initial

recommendations of the Committee would be announced by the third

quarter of this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister, when speaking about

standard  due  diligence, does this mean that the fund  will  do

exactly  the  same as the banks and other financial institutions

do  and  therefore what advantage is there in Government setting

aside a special fund for technopreneurs?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> It is important we adopt the best

practices

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>

which obtain in Silicon Valley and in America.  The

purpose of starting this new fund is to help create an

indigenous venture capital sector in Singapore.  Mr Inderjit

Singh told me that he once had a project which could not be

funded in Singapore and that he had to go to Taiwan where there

was so much expertise in this area to get the financing.  We

should have such a developed sector in Singapore so that those

who are starting start-ups here would be able to get local

financing.

Board to safeguard workers' CPF contribution.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe (for the Minister of</b>

<b>Manpower):</b> There had been a slight increase in the default

cases  for  1998 as compared to 1997.  In 1998,  an  average  of

1,389 employers per month did

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>

not pay their employees' CPF contributions

continuously for 2 months.  In 1997, the average number of

defaulting employers was 1,326.  The average two-month default

rate (ie, the percentage of employers who have not paid CPF

contributions for their employees for 2 months) was 1.47% for

1998, as compared with 1.39% for 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that CPF contributions form an

integral  part of employees' wages and workers depend  on  these

savings  to service their housing loans and to meet medical  and

retirement  needs.  The CPF Board, as trustee  of  CPF  members'

savings, takes a serious view of such default cases.  It was for

this  reason  that  the Board amended the CPF  Act  in  1998  to

expedite the recovery of CPF arrears and to ensure that the  CPF

Board  could  deal effectively and promptly with  employers  who

failed  to pay CPF contributions for their employees within  the

prescribed  periods,  and to recover these  contributions  which

were due.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, however, my Ministry is aware that many

employers  are  facing  financial difficulty  in  this  economic

downturn  and the CPF Board will assist them wherever  possible.

In  enforcing  CPF payments from employers, the CPF  Board  will

balance  the  need  for quick action to recover  employees'  CPF

contribution with the flexibility to allow employers to overcome

their  temporary cash flow difficulties to survive this downturn

and  to  save  jobs.   For example, the  CPF  Board  will  allow

employers   who   are   taken  to  court  for   defaulting   CPF

contributions  to  pay their arrears by monthly  instalments  if

their  current contributions are paid on time, on the  condition

that  they  must produce evidence of their ability  to  pay  the

arrears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board also compounds the offences of employers who

are able to settle their CPF arrears before the court hearing so

that they do not have to appear in court and pay heavier fines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure the Member that the CPF Board

will continue to monitor default cases closely, exercise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>

flexibility where arrears could be paid by monthly

instalments and take quick action to recover the arrears through

Court action if the need arises.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun):</b> Sir, may I have your permission to take Questions 8 and 9

together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the traffic congestion at the

Woodlands  Checkpoint  is the result  of  the  large  number  of

vehicles  leaving  Singapore at the same  time.   On  a  typical

weekday, about 44,000 vehicles pass through the Checkpoint, half

of  which  pass through between 5 pm and 10 pm.  As Bukit  Timah

Expressway  (BKE)  and Woodlands Road are  the  only  two  major

access  roads  to  the Checkpoint, the traffic queues  at  their

junction are not surprising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this and in anticipation of future increases in

traffic,  the  Government has built a new  Woodlands  Checkpoint

together   with   supporting  road  infrastructure.    The   new

Checkpoint, which will be operational in the latter half of this

year, will be linked to the BKE and Woodlands Road.  Traffic  to

the Checkpoint will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>

then be separated from traffic to Woodlands Centre Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An electronic Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) will be

implemented at the new Checkpoint. Variable Message Signs  (VMS)

will be placed along BKE, Woodlands Road and other nearby roads,

to  provide  real-time  information  on  the  traffic  condition

surrounding the Checkpoint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran suggested allowing motorists to pay tolls

using  cashcards.  My Ministry has been planning this  for  some

time  and  I am pleased to inform him that we will be automating

the  collection of tolls and the Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP)  for

foreign  motorists with effect from January 2000.   This  system

will  be  implemented at both the Causeway and the 2nd Crossing.

With  the  new  system, motorists will be able to pay  VEP  fees

and/or toll charges using stored-value cards.  The new automated

system  is  a  convenient  method  of  payment  that  will  also

facilitate quicker clearance at the Checkpoint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new Checkpoint, the new road system, the new

automated  toll/VEP collection system, the traffic situation  at

Woodlands Road and BKE should improve significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, should the traffic congestion persist despite

these   improvements,  we  may  have  to  consider   introducing

congestion  pricing to optimise the use of the roads leading  to

the Checkpoint.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am happy to hear that the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment

Scheme (SERS) is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>

implemented  in  sites that have potential  for  more  intensive

redevelopment.  As the redevelopment of such sites would benefit

the  country as a whole, HDB flats affected by SERS are acquired

under  the Land Acquisition Act.   Voting is not used to  decide

whether a site will undergo SERS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected flat lessees are compensated for their existing

flats  at  the prevailing market values as at the  date  of  the

announcement of SERS.  In addition, they are assured  allocation

of  new replacement flats at subsidised prices, frozen as at the

date  of the announcement of the SERS, plus a 20% price discount

up  to a maximum of $30,000, if they are eligible to buy a  flat

directly from the HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blocks 1 to 8, 10 and 12 to 14 of Hillview Avenue were

announced for redevelopment under SERS on 21st March 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB conducts a survey among the affected lessees

immediately after the announcement of each SERS site  to  obtain

their  feedback.   The  survey  also  serves  to  ascertain  the

lessees'  preferred rehousing options so that the HDB  can  plan

and  build  the  new flats at the replacement site  taking  into

account their preferences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERS has been well received by the affected lessees in

those precincts that have been announced for redevelopment under

the Scheme.  For the 29 SERS sites announced from August 1995 to

end  1998,  the average support level from affected  lessees  is

about  94%.   Even  for the Hillview Avenue  site,  84%  of  the

residents  who have returned their survey forms so far supported

the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MP for Bukit Gombak has requested for a higher mortgage

loan  to be granted for SERS lessees in Hillview Estate who have

bought their existing flats from the open market at a high price

and  who still have substantial outstanding mortgage loans.   As

it  is, HDB already grants mortgager loans of up to 90% to those

lessees  who  have  opted for 4-room new replacement  flats  and

whose  available CPF monies in the ordinary account and  balance

compensation  are insufficient to meet the downpayment  and  the

stamp

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>

and conveyancing fees for the new flats.  This will

include cases where the compensation is not sufficient to pay

for the outstanding mortgage loans of the affected SERS flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are specific cases of existing 5-roomers having

problems purchasing 5-room replacement flats, HDB is prepared to

take a look at how to help them on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessees under SERS are also exempted from the payment of

resale  levy,  unless  they  have previously  sold  their  first

subsidised  HDB  flats elsewhere and have opted  to  pay  resale

premium or levy on the next direct purchase flat from HDB.   The

amount of resale premium or levy to be paid will depend on  when

their  first  subsidised flats were sold.   According  to  HDB's

record,  87%  of  the  lessees at Hillview Estate  will  not  be

required to pay any resale premium or levy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the small group of lessees who need to pay resale

premium  or  levy, they have currently a few options  to  choose

from:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) They can pay the resale premium together with the

selling  price of the replacement flat.  This can then  be  paid

using CPF or through the mortgage loan taken from HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) They can re-opt to pay the graded resale levy based on

the lower percentages prevailing at the time of resale (plus the

5%   interest  since  then),  instead  of  the  current   higher

percentages of resale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) They can sell the existing flat together with the

rehousing  benefits  in  the  open market  to  eligible  buyers,

instead  of  taking up a replacement flat themselves.   In  this

way,  they  will  not be required to pay the resale  premium  or

levy.   With  the  sale proceeds that would  include  a  premium

fetched  for the rehousing benefits, they can buy an  equivalent

resale flat from the open market with some cash balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) They can transfer the existing flat to eligible

persons,  eg, family members.  The rehousing benefits will  then

be based on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>

the transferor or the transferee's eligibility,

whichever is more restrictive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding these measures, I have asked my Ministry

officials  to  take a look at how this group of lessees  can  be

further  assisted if they still have problems paying the  resale

premium or levy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered the

those  flats;  and (d) when did the HDB decide to acquire  those

flats.   I have got a further supplementary question.  Will  the

HDB  consider giving a waiver for third-time buyers of HDB flats

requiring them to borrow at market interest rates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I have

answered  the questions.  What was the basis of the  quantum  of

compensation?   It  is on market value as at  the  date  of  the

announcement.  What is the purpose of acquiring these flats?  We

acquire  them  because  these sites show  potential  for  higher

intensity development.  When did the HDB decide to acquire those

flats?   We  announced this on 21st March 1999.  On  his  fourth

question  of  whether  we  would grant a  waiver  to  third-time

buyers, our policy so far is that every Singaporean family  will

enjoy  two  concessionary mortgage loans.  The third  loan  will

have to be at market interest rate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, does intensive development mean

building condominiums there?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Intensive development would cover both

more  intensive public housing as well as higher  value  private

housing.  This means that the site reflects higher potential for

redevelopment,  and we acquire these sites.  We  redevelop  them

for  the interest of the country and we share the benefits  with

the lessees.  We pay the lessees market price for their existing

flats.   We  assure them a new flat in the vicinity at  a  price

which is subsidised, and we give them an extra 20% discount.  So

the benefits of the redevelopment are shared between the lessees

and the country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

I would like to thank the Minister for his answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the resale premium, I would like to inform the Minister

that  about  15% of the residents will have to pay the  premium,

and  they have sold their flats five or 10 years ago.   If  they

have not been affected by the SERS scheme, they may not have  to

pay  the  resale  levy  or premium.  I would  ask  the  Minister

whether he would consider waiving the levy payment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, let me explain the situation of

these  cases  who  are required to pay resale premium  or  levy.

Basically, they have already enjoyed a subsidised flat from  the

Government.   They bought a subsidised flat from the  Government

many  years  ago.  They sold away this flat.  At  the  point  of

selling  the flat, you have to decide whether to pay a  levy  on

the  flat  that you sell or that you pay a premium on  the  next

flat  that  you buy from the Government.  So when  these  people

sold  their flats, they had to opt.  Either they decide  to  pay

the levy or they decide to pay the premium.  Many of them decide

to  pay the premium.  When they sold their first flat, they have

already  made  an undertaking that when they buy the  next  flat

from  the Government, they will pay a 10% or 20% premium.   Now,

when  they  are  buying this flat from the  Government,  we  are

asking  them to pay the premium.  So this is part of  what  they

have decided, because if they have paid the levy, now they would

not  have  to  pay  the premium.  So you cannot  say  that  just

because  they have opted to pay the premium, now they should  be

excused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what happens to all those people who have paid the

levy  when they sold off their first flats?  It is not  fair  to

the  other  group.   So  we say that for these  people  who  are

affected by the premium that they have paid, we are prepared  to

back-track the decision, go back to the original date when  they

sell  their flat, pay the premium as what the others have  done,

plus  the  5%  interest since then, which is very  fair.   If  a

lessee cannot pay, he can sell his flat to somebody and he  does

not have to pay the premium.  The flat that he sells today

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>

in Hillview Estate to another person in the open

market attracts a higher price because it comes with the option

to buy another brand new flat in the Bukit Gombak area with a

discount and all the benefits associated with SERS.  So if he is

not happy with buying a new flat from the HDB, he can sell his

existing flat which will fetch a higher price than the current

market value.  Why?  This is because it comes with a rehousing

option.  With the price that he gets from his present flat, he

can buy back the same type of flat, the same remaining lease and

still have some cash balance in his pocket.  So it is eminently

fair.  They have so many options that they can choose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower, with the

growth  in  the chemical, electronics, financial and information

technology  industries and the effect on  workers'  health  from

waste  and chemical disposal giving rise to the risk of chemical

contamination  and  leakage as well as  from  prolonged  working

hours  on  the computers, what measures are being taken  by  his

Ministry  to  review the Factories Act to make it a more  broad-based legislation.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (for the Minister for</b>

<b>Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the current Factories Act in

Singapore provides for the safety, health and welfare of persons

working in premises defined as "factories".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factories within the chemical and electronics industries

are  therefore covered under the Factories Act. The  workers  in

the  financial  and information technology industries  including

those  who have to work with computers are not presently covered

under  the  Act.   The workforce covered by  the  Act  is  about

700,000, which is about one-third of the total workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its enactment in 1958, the Factories Act has been

amended several times.  The last amendment in 1995 extended  the

coverage of the Act to premises such as laboratories, warehouses

and  aircraft parking bays.  My Ministry is considering  further

extension of the coverage to workers engaged in maintenance work

on  the MRT and LRT, ie, repair or maintenance work carried  out

on  any  rail, track, including viaducts and tunnels.   However,

there  is  a  limit to which the Factories Act can be  extended,

beyond which the term "factories" would become meaningless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently reviewing the safety health

legislation to ensure that workers, including knowledge  workers

of the future, will be adequately protected at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>

work.  New legislation on Occupational Safety and

Health may be required to cover such workplaces and to promote

greater self-regulation by employers and manufacturers of

machinery, equipment and work tools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Communications  (Dr  Yaacob  Ibrahim)  (for  the  Minister   for

Communications): Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with Mr Rai  that  air

rage is a menace, which needs to be dealt with firmly. Under our

laws, it is already an offence for an individual to imperil  the

safety  of  an aircraft or any person on board by any disorderly

conduct. Such an offender passenger, if convicted, is liable  to

a  fine  not exceeding $5,000 or to an imprisonment term of  one

year  or  both.  Criminal acts carried out on board a  Singapore

aircraft   can  also  be  prosecuted  under  our   Penal   Code.

Nevertheless,  the Ministry of Communications is  now  reviewing

the  legislation, including the penalties, to see how these  can

be made more effective in curbing air rage.

15, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (for the Minister for Communications):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bus Lane Enforcement Camera System (Buscam)

was  first introduced on two bus services (Service Nos.  51  and

97)  in April 1997 to discourage motorists from encroaching into

dedicated  bus  lanes during the peak hours.  In February  1999,

Buscam was extended to cover 10 bus services (eight SBS services

Nos.  7,  8,  51, 67, 81, 93, 97 and 147, and two TIBS  services

Nos.   854  and  855).   Currently,  LTA  processes  about   950

violations  each  month, or about 4 violations per  service  per

day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buscam has been effective in assisting scheduled buses to

travel  more  smoothly  in  the bus  lanes  during  peak  hours.

According to the bus operators, buses have been able to  improve

on their schedule adherence and bus journey time.  LTA, however,

will  continue to monitor the effectiveness of Buscam  with  the

bus  operators and extend the system to more bus services as and

when necessary.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry

recognises  that breast cancer has been increasing steadily  and

is  now  the  commonest cancer among women  in  Singapore.   Our

polyclinics have run Well Women Clinics for over 10 years  which

include screening for breast cancer and health education on  the

disease.    We   are   working  hand  in  hand   with   relevant

organisations  like  the Singapore Cancer  Society,  the  Breast

Cancer Foundation, the National Cancer Centre and hospitals, on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>

further  expanding  our  programmes to  control  breast  cancer.

These  programmes include health education, promotion of regular

screening  for the early detection of breast cancer and  updated

treatment  modalities aimed at improving the survival and  well-being of breast cancer patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 years, my Ministry has held two large

National  Cancer Education Programmes, in addition  to  the  on-going  public  education to reach out to the target  population.

During  the  Breast Cancer Awareness Month, jointly launched  in

October  last year by my Ministry, the Singapore Cancer  Society

and   the  Breast  Cancer  Foundation,  several  innovative  and

interesting programmes were used to highlight the importance  of

breast  cancer and of regular screening.  My Ministry  plans  to

organise this Breast Cancer Awareness Month as an annual event.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, MOH also set up a Breast Cancer Workgroup

involving leading authorities in breast cancer control from both

the  public  and  private sectors.  This  is  part  of  the  MOH

Committee  on Women's Health, which is chaired by myself.   This

Workgroup is tasked to recommend measures to further improve the

control  of breast cancer in Singapore and to improve acceptance

of  programmes for early detection and improved cure  of  breast

cancer, by women in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave is designed to help patients pay for acute

hospitalisation expenses. Exceptions have been made for  certain

expensive  outpatient  treatments,  such  as  radiotherapy   and

chemotherapy for cancer, and renal dialysis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that Medisave is not prematurely depleted, it is

important  that we extend Medisave coverage only  to  treatments

that  are  proven, cost-effective and are expensive in terms  of

the patient's out-of-pocket payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is looking into the possibility of extending

Medisave  coverage  to  mammograms.   In  considering  this,  my

Ministry will bear in mind that charges for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>

mammogram range between $100 and $170 and that

screening by mammography is an important measure for the early

detection of breast cancer, which in turn contributes to

improved survival and well being of the patient.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes the following amendments to the

Parliamentary Elections Act and the Presidential Elections Act:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to introduce more efficient authentication methods;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to have a common cut-off date to determine voter

eligibility and change of address;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to extend the powers of election agents to appoint

polling and counting agents; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to modify the election agent system for the

Presidential Elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with each of them in turn.

<br><br><i>(A) Ballot paper authentication</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain the problems of the current system of

authenticating ballot papers.  On Polling Day, a voter is  given

a ballot paper by the Presiding Officer to mark a candidate or a

group  of  candidates  of  his  choice.   The  ballot  paper  is

perforated with the official mark made by a perforator as  proof

that the ballot paper is an authorised one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perforator is a precision instrument which is delicate

to  handle.  Those unfamiliar with its usage tend to jam it when

attempting  to  perforate the ballot  paper.   This  causes  the

ballot paper to be stuck to the perforator.  In trying to remove

the paper, it often ends up torn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These perforators, belonging to the Elections Department,

were purchased in the 1950s and are relics.  With the passage of

time,  they  are prone to breakdowns despite regular  servicing.

The  Elections  Department has therefore been  looking  at  more

efficient means to authenticate ballot papers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Department is proposing that ballot papers be

henceforth  authenticated in the form of a pre-printed  security

pattern,  rubber-stamping or other markings.  Clause  4  of  the

Bill  amends  section 40 of the Parliamentary Elections  Act  to

provide  for  the authentication of ballot papers by  these  new

methods.   Clause 9(2) amends the corresponding section  of  the

Presidential Elections Act for the same purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 42(2) of the Parliamentary

Elections  Act  to  provide for an election official  to  either

affix  or  stamp or mark the ballot paper to officially complete

the  authentication,  if  a  ballot paper  has  not  been  fully

authenticated.  Clause 9(3) amends the corresponding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>

section of the Presidential Elections Act for the same purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the change in the method of authentication, a

ballot  paper shall be rejected if it is not fully and  properly

authenticated  by  a  pre-printed  design,  stamped,  marked  or

initialled  by  the Presiding Officer.  Clause 7 amends  section

50(1)  of the Parliamentary Elections Act and clause 9(6) amends

the  corresponding section of the Presidential Elections Act for

this purpose.

<br><br><i>(B)  Common cut-off date to determine voter eligibility/address</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me explain the rationale for aligning the cut-off

date  for  changes of addresses with the cut-off date for  voter

eligibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the cut-off date for voter eligibility is 1st

July  or  such other cut-off date as specified by the  Minister.

Following  the cut-off date for voter eligibility, the Registers

of  Electors are printed and exhibited for public inspection for

14  days.   However,  the present cut-off date  for  changes  of

addresses is the last day for public inspection of the Registers

of  Electors.   With two different cut-off dates, the  Registers

are therefore produced twice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give this as an example. In the 1996 Registers of

Electors, there were two cut-off dates, ie, 15th April for voter

eligibility, and 23rd May 1996 for the changes of addresses.  In

this instance, the Registers had to be produced twice.  One  set

of  Registers was produced on 9th May 1996 for public inspection

on  voter  eligibility, and the subsequent set was  produced  on

27th  June 1996 after the public inspection to incorporate fresh

changes  of addresses up to 23rd May 1996.  This is unproductive

and a waste of resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed amendment for a common cut-off date for

both  voter  eligibility  and changes  of  addresses,  the  same

Registers  of  Electors will be printed,  exhibited  for  public

inspection,  and subsequently certified for use.  No  reprinting

will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>

be  done.   Should there be any amendments as a  result  of  the

public  inspection,  they  can  be  produced  as  additions   or

deletions  to the same Registers of Electors.  With  one  common

cut-off  date, the period between the production and  exhibition

of Registers for public inspection and certification is reduced,

as there is no processing of address changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 13(4) of the Parliamentary

Elections  Act  to  exclude  alterations  to  the  Registers  of

Electors  on  account  of changes of addresses  notified  on  or

before  the last day of inspection of the register prior to  the

certification.   With  this amendment, the Registration  Officer

will prepare the Registers of Electors based on the addresses of

electors   as   recorded   by  the  Commissioner   of   National

Registration as of 1st July or the common cut-off date specified

by the Minister.  He will not be allowed to accept any change of

address  made  after 1st July or the prescribed  common  cut-off

date.

<br><br><i>(C)   Empowering Election Agents to appoint Polling and Counting Agents</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now explain why there is a need to

amend the Parliamentary Elections Act to empower election agents

to appoint counting and polling agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, in a Group Representation Constituency (GRC),

there  is  a  Principal Election Agent and a number of  Election

Agents.   Only the Principal Election Agent can appoint  polling

and  counting  agents.  This involves much administrative  work,

which  could be done by other Election Agents.  Clause 6  amends

section  49  of  the Parliamentary Elections Act  to  allow  the

Election Agent of any candidate in a group, in addition  to  the

Principal  Election  Agent for that group, to  appoint  counting

agents.   Clause  9(5) amends the corresponding section  of  the

Presidential Elections Act for the same purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the election agents of candidates in a group

will  be  allowed to appoint polling agents.  This will  relieve

the  workload of the Principal Election Agent, who is  currently

the only one allowed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>

appoint polling agents.  Clause 8 amends section 64(1A)  of  the

Parliamentary   Elections  Act  and  clause  9(8)   amends   the

corresponding section of the Presidential Elections Act for this

purpose.

Presidential Elections Act (Cap 218)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the Presidential Elections Act

amendment.   The  counting  of ballot papers  is  undertaken  in

counting  places,  which  are usually  located  in  schools  and

community  centres.  The results of the count at  each  counting

place are tallied at constituency level by a number of Assistant

Returning  Officers.  Once these results are tallied,  they  are

transmitted to the Returning Officer who will then  add  up  the

results of all the constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first Presidential Elections held on 28th August

1993,  only  one  election agent could  be  appointed  for  each

candidate.  This was found to be inadequate, as there  was  much

administrative  work to be done.  Clause 9(7)  therefore  amends

section 43 of the Presidential Elections Act to provide for  the

appointment  of  up to 20 persons as Election  Agents  for  each

Presidential  candidate,  of whom one  shall  be  appointed  the

Principal Election Agent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there would be up to 20 Election Agents, one of whom is

the  Principal  Election Agent, there is a need to differentiate

or  identify  the  main roles of the Principal  Election  Agent.

These  roles are spelt out in the relevant clauses in the  Bill.

Clause  9(4) amends section 31A(2) of the Presidential Elections

Act to make it mandatory for the Returning Officer to inform the

Principal  Election  Agent of a presidential  candidate  of  the

counting places.  Clause 9(5) amends section 32 of the same  Act

to   provide  that  only  the  Principal  Election   Agents   or

presidential candidates may be present at any principal counting

place where the votes are eventually added.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(14) amends section 49 to require personal expenses

of the candidate exceeding $1,000 to be paid by his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>

Principal  Election Agent.  This is a change  from  the  current

position where the sole Election Agent is responsible for paying

such  expenses.  The same clause also amends section 56  of  the

Presidential  Elections Act to impose on the Principal  Election

Agent  the  sole  obligation to file  the  returns  on  election

expenses.   Section 64(2) of the Act is also amended to  require

the Principal Election Agent to inform the Returning Officer  of

the candidate's campaign offices in each polling district.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these amendments are necessary to further

improve our election processes without compromising the security

of  the  process.   The amendments in this  Bill  are  practical

changes   to   enhance  and  fine-tune  the  current   electoral

processes,  and hence make our elections, be it the Presidential

Election  or  the  Parliamentary Election, more streamlined  and

efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for giving me

this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has comprehensively dealt

with  the proposed amendment to the Bill.  I would like to share

some  of  the concerns which I have.  First of all, we have  had

very fair elections from 1959 to now.  There is no question ever

raised  as to the secrecy of the vote.  The secrecy of the  vote

is  protected  and  I  hope  the Minister  will  reiterate  this

position  again today, that the changes will not affect  in  any

way but will in fact improve the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another suggestion which I have is this. Although we

have  had  fairly fair elections, in other countries (in  Africa

and  Asia), the United Nations (UN) has to observe the electoral

process.   Here,  we  have  been  fortunate.   May  I  ask   the

Government  to  consider whether it will be  in  the  long  term

interest   of   Singapore  to  have  an   independent   election

commission, which is a practice in many other countries?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Presidential Election is likely to take place this

year.   I am glad that the amendment is being made.  And  may  I

again  urge political parties not to take part in the  elections

and  leave the electoral process as non-partisan, which had been

done in the last election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I end my speech, may I say that the reason why

we  have had very clean and fair elections since 1959 is because

of  what  the  political parties themselves have  done  and  the

people  have  taken the trouble to vote in fair and  independent

elections.  Democracy is still young in Singapore.  It  is  very

important for us to have a system whereby the public is  assured

that the electoral process would always be protected.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to focus

on the amendment which provides for the authentication of ballot

papers  by new means, instead of by perforators.  There are  two

larger  issues or principles involved here.  The first principle

is  that  every  vote should be genuine.  In other  words,  that

there should be no false votes by fictitious persons or votes by

persons masquerading as other persons.  The second principle  is

that every vote should be secret.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amendment Bill seeks to update techniques for providing

for  an  official  mark on the ballot papers for authentication.

Since the authentication of ballot papers is precisely to ensure

that the first principle of genuineness of the vote is upheld, I

therefore  do not see any problems on this score.  The question,

however,  that  I  have  is: do the new  authentication  methods

uphold  the  second principle, that of secrecy of the  vote?   I

note  that  section  40(3) of the Parliamentary  Elections  Act,

which  is  just  before  the  proposed  insertion  of  the   new

authentication  clause, states that, "Each  ballot  paper  shall

have  a  number  printed on the back and shall have  attached  a

counterfoil with the same number printed on the face."  If  this

is  the  case, then it is technically possible to trace  how  an

individual  voted  by matching his name and  IC  number  on  the

counterfoil against the serial number on the ballot paper.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>

Could  the  Minister please clarify whether this is  indeed  the

case, and whether the vote is indeed secret?  In addition, could

the Minister please clarify the purpose of these serial numbers?

This  is  in  order to allay fears that those who vote  for  the

Opposition could be identified and, therefore, possibly included

in  the  black book of the Government which would be counter  to

the  daily cherished democratic principle that elections  should

be free and fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, to the extent that the Bill before the House

does  not  in any way impinge upon the two principles: (1)  that

the  vote  should be genuine; and (2) that every vote should  be

secret, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I only have three

points  to  raise.   Firstly, how does the Elections  Department

ensure  that every ballot paper is fully authenticated and  does

not  end  up  being  void by default?  Secondly,  is  there  any

procedure where it would ensure proper authentication  of  every

ballot  paper  that is being issued?  Thirdly, the  question  of

serial numbers printed on the ballot papers, which was raised by

Dr  Lee.   I would like to know whether it is necessary to  have

the  serial  number  in  view of the new authentication  method.

Would  the  Minister clarify why is there a need for the  serial

number to be printed on the ballot paper and what is the purpose

of the serial number?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for their

comments  and  questions.  First, on Mr  Rai's  question  on  an

election commission.  I do not think there is any doubt that our

Elections  Department  has carried out  its  duties  faithfully,

dutifully,  and without any fear and favour.  As he himself  has

said,  our  elections since 1959 have been clean and  fair.   So

far,  there has been no allegation that the Department has  been

unfair.   At  every election, a Returning Officer  is  appointed

from  among the senior civil servants who would ensure that  the

whole process is carried out smoothly.  And there is no question

that  the whole process has been done properly.  There had  been

very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>

few  election  petitions to the courts to open up the  vault  to

check  the  ballot  papers  or to question  the  whole  election

process.   The results speak for themselves.  Since  the  system

works  well and the Elections Department is doing a good job,  I

do not see any need for an election commission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question which all our three colleagues

mentioned  here  is the secrecy of the vote.   This  subject  of

secrecy  of the vote is, I suppose, as long as we have elections

in  Singapore.  Members may not know that this subject has  been

raised  periodically and, every time, when it is raised  answers

are  given.   Sometimes, we forget the answers and sometimes  we

are  still  wondering whether the answers are indeed  what  they

are.  We want the people's fears to be allayed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has stated very clearly why we need to

have the serial number on the ballot paper as well as to have  a

counterfoil.  The counterfoil is to establish that indeed such a

ballot  paper has been issued.  On the ballot paper itself,  the

number  is  to  establish clearly that there is  indeed  such  a

ballot  paper and there is a corresponding counterfoil  to  show

that there is such a ballot paper.  It shows the genuineness  of

the  ballot  paper.  The writing of the person's number  on  the

counterfoil  is  to show that that particular  ballot  paper  is

given  to that particular voter so that in the event that  there

is  a dispute, such a vote can actually be traced and that it is

a genuine vote and not a forgery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This numbering of ballot papers is not an invention of the

PAP  Government.   I  think people tend  to  forget  that.   The

British  introduced this in the late 40s.  I  am  told  that  in

Britain, New Zealand and Canada, they have similar provisions in

the  law for the numbering of ballot papers.  One of the reasons

for  numbered  ballot  papers  is to  prevent  crooked  election

practices, such as the stuffing of election ballot boxes.   More

importantly,  after the election, all the unused ballot  papers,

as well as the counterfoils, are put

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>

into the boxes and sealed and they are then kept in the vault of

the  High Court.  The boxes cannot be opened without an election

petition and without the permission of the court, and permission

will  only be granted if there is a petition to show why such  a

process needs to be taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months after the polling day, these boxes are then

taken  out  of  the  vault  of the  court  and  brought  to  the

incinerator for burning.  When they are taken out, anybody could

go  and take a look at them and see whether indeed the seals  of

the  ballot  boxes were broken, and anyone had seen  the  ballot

papers  to  find  out  who  voted for  whom.   That  process  is

transparent and I am sure Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam  -   I

do  not  know  about  my  other  colleagues   -   have  actually

witnessed this process.  The members of the press are very  keen

to  see  this.   Every time, the Elections Department  announces

that  the  ballot  papers would be taken out for  burning,  they

would go to the High Court and look at the boxes to ensure  that

the boxes' seals had not been broken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This controversy came out again in the 1976 general

election  and Dr Lee Siew-Choh, the Opposition leader then,  had

said  that nobody, not even the Government, would know who voted

for  whom.  He was trying to assure the voters not to worry  and

that  their  vote was secret.  So if Dr Lee Siew-Choh  has  also

said  that the vote is secret, and we have been saying that  the

vote  is  secret, I think the people should not doubt  that  the

vote  is indeed secret.  In the rally speech in Queen Street  in

December  1976,  Dr Lee Siew-Choh told his audience  not  to  be

afraid  to  vote,  I suppose not to be afraid to  vote  for  the

Barisan  Sosialis, as the vote is secret and he  also  explained

the  elaborate process that had to be followed before the ballot

papers could be taken out to be examined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, my colleague, Prof. Jayakumar, also explained that

the   numbered  ballot  papers  provided  the  means  to  settle

allegations  of  election  fraud.  If voters  alleged  that  the

ballots  had been switched with forgeries, the numbered  ballots

would  then  allow the charge to be settled conclusively.   With

the numbered ballot papers,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>

no one can accuse the Government of rigging an

election.  If we do away with the numbering of ballot papers, as

Mr Low's last point seems to suggest, I think we will also face

a new problem.  The new problem would be: how do we know that

some of these ballot papers are genuine?  How do you trace that

they are genuine?  Even with the mark, stamp or signature, it

will not be easy to tell.  But with the number in the

counterfoil and the number at the back of the ballot paper, we

can then compare the two and say, "Yes, indeed, such a paper was

issued and the counterfoil is here, apart from the stamping, the

marking and the perforation.".

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my

query  about the authentication procedures.  How do  you  ensure

that every ballot paper is indeed properly authenticated and not

void?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think Mr Low knows the process quite

well.   Just briefly, it is something like this.  When the voter

goes to the polling station, he presents his IC and his name  is

called.  The Presiding Officer or his assistant will then  check

to  make sure that he is indeed a registered voter.  Once it  is

confirmed that he is, the Presiding Officer will then record  on

the  ballot  paper his IC number and give him the ballot  paper.

That ballot paper, before it is given to him, is perforated with

a  perforator,  in  the  presence of everybody.   But  with  the

present  system, sometimes when the Presiding Officer pulls  out

the  perforator, the ballot paper is torn and when the  vote  is

actually counted, there could be questions about that vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new system, it is the same thing. The Presiding

Officer or his assistant will ensure that it is properly stamped

in  the  presence of the voter that he is indeed the  voter  and

that  is  indeed  the  piece  of  paper  from  the  counterfoil,

perforated,  stamped,  marked or signed.   So  that  process  is

totally transparent. He will then take his ballot paper  to  the

ballot box, mark it and put into the box.  If there is any doubt

at all, the whole process can be questioned there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I clarify with the

Minister?  The new authentication will not require a

perforation, just only a stamp.  Am I correct?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, he is correct. It could be a stamp

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> What we are doing now is to provide for

other  methods  of  authenticating the ballot  paper.   What  is

So we are making provisions for it to be also authenticated by a

stamp, a marking or a signature.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, this may not be related to the

Bill, but I would like the Minister to comment.  I have received

feedback that the booth for the marking of the ballot paper does

not seem to be private in the sense that somebody may be able to

see  how  you mark at the booth.  I wonder whether the Elections

Department will consider improving the booth with maybe  a  box-like enclosure where you have some cover at the back.  Now it is

quite  exposed.   You can mark, but people will know  where  you

mark.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If that is indeed a problem, I will ask

the Elections Department to study it.  From what I see, and what

I have experienced, indeed there is enough space and privacy for

the person to hide his ballot paper and mark it.  So there is no

need to worry about the secrecy of his vote.  Nobody is going to

peep at the other person and see what he does with his vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act was

enacted  on  21st  October  1955.  Since  then,  Parliament  has

extended  it  nine times. The last time was five  years  ago  in

1994.   The  Act will expire on 20th October this year.   Hence,

this Bill which seeks to further extend the Act for another five

years to enable Government to continue dealing effectively  with

secret  society or "SS" activities, drug trafficking and serious

crimes.   The Bill also seeks to give officers from the  Central

Narcotics  Bureau  or  "CNB" certain  powers  which  the  Police

already  has under the Act.  This will enhance CNB's operational

efficiency and streamline its work process.

<br><br><i>Rationale for the Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act provides for the maintenance of public order and

detention of criminals in the interests of public safety,  peace

and good order.  Let me, however, emphasise, at the outset, that

we  do  not  invoke  the  Act  as a  convenient  alternative  to

prosecution  in court.  The Government's consistent approach  is

always  to  consider a court conviction in the  first  instance.

Hence,   the  vast  majority  of  cases  are  prosecuted.    But

prosecution  is  not always possible, not because  there  is  no

evidence, but because witnesses and accomplices are not prepared

to  testify in court for fear of reprisal or for other  reasons.

This  is especially so when accused persons are associated  with

SS   activities,  organised  crime  gangs  or  drug  trafficking

syndicates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS members often refuse to give evidence in court against

fellow  members.  As for drug traffickers, witnesses are usually

drug  addicts  who  refuse  to testify against  their  suppliers

because of their vulnerable status or for fear of reprisal.   An

additional difficulty is that traffickers have resorted to using

couriers and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>

go-betweens to conceal their involvement, thus making it  harder

to apprehend them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Act's enactment in 1955, it has proven to be an

effective tool in suppressing SS activities in Singapore.   This

is  evident  in  the number of SS incidents recorded  by  Police

which has fallen from 416 in 1959, to 10 in 1988, and 3 in 1998.

The  number of Detention Orders (DOs) issued against SS  members

has also fallen from 72 in 1988, to 42 in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for drug trafficking, the Act has enabled the CNB to

cripple  many  drug  syndicates and shatter  their  distribution

networks  in  Singapore.   This  has  contributed  to  the  much

improved drug situation today.  As a result, the number  of  DOs

issued against drug traffickers has also fallen from 192 in 1988

to 48 last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act has also been invoked against criminals who have

committed  serious crimes, such as murder where  witnesses  were

not  prepared  to  testify in court.   However,  let  me  assure

Members that the Act is used sparingly for these cases.  Indeed,

the  last  time the Act was so invoked was in 1994 when  5  Thai

nationals were detained for their involvement in the murders  of

security guards and construction workers while committing thefts

of  surveying equipment or "theodolites".  Since then, no DO has

been issued against any serious crime offender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the number of DOs issued has declined from 270 in

1988  to  90  in  1998.   The number under  detention  has  also

declined  from  1,260 in 1988 to 463 in 1998.  These  statistics

prove  the  point  that the Act is effective in  suppressing  SS

activities,  drug  trafficking  and  other  organised   criminal

syndicates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it therefore mean that we can now do away with the

Act?   The  answer is an emphatic "no".  The Act still  plays  a

useful  role  today.  We cannot be complacent.   Despite  strict

laws  and  tough  police enforcement, SS incidents  still  occur

today.   For  example,  in March last year,  a  group  of  triad

members  viciously attacked rival triad members at a  coffeeshop

with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>

gangland weapons, such as home-made samurai swords

and parangs.  Four innocent customers were seriously injured in

the attack.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no indication that we have completely eliminated

secret societies in Singapore.  They still pose a menace.  Apart

from  rioting,  SS  members are involved in syndicated  criminal

activities,   such   as  extortion,  illegal  moneylending   and

smuggling of illegal immigrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in May 1997, the Police detected some SS

members extorting `protection' money from contractors soliciting

for   renovation  contracts  at  several  new  housing  estates.

Contractors  who  refused  to pay up  were  chased  away.   This

lucrative  monopoly  led  to  an atmosphere  of  lawlessness  as

different gangs wrestled for territorial control of the estates.

The  gangs'  activities went undetected initially as  victimised

contractors kept quiet for fear of reprisal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police acted swiftly and crippled five `protection rackets'

between  September and December that year.  23 SS  members  were

arrested under the Act.  15 of them were issued with DOs  and  8

with  Police  Supervision Orders.  Since then,  Police  has  not

detected  any  `protection racket' at new housing estates.   The

Act  has  therefore provided Police with the arsenal to nip  the

problem in the bud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS gangs are also involved in illegal moneylending. In

June  last year, Police crippled a loanshark syndicate operating

in  the Geylang area.  The syndicate organiser cum financier had

recruited about 50 SS members to be his loansharks and  financed

some  of  them.   These  loansharks  assaulted  and  intimidated

debtors  and their families, vandalising their property  if  the

repayments were late.  The victims could not identify the leader

because he operated behind-the-scene.  He had no direct dealings

with  the debtors. It was under these circumstances that  Police

invoked  the  Act to detain the organiser cum syndicate  leader,

together with a henchman.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to street gangs. The SS scene today is

characterised  by  loosely-organised  street  gangs  with  fluid

membership.  Despite Police action, new gangs are detected every

year.  In 1998, 55 street gangs were detected and dealt with  by

Police  under  the Act compared to 79 in 1997 and  45  in  1996.

These  street gang members are not as vicious as traditional  SS

members  but  they  still fight over trivial  matters,  such  as

staring  incidents,  passing of remarks and accidental  contact,

thus impacting law and order and lowering Singaporeans' sense of

safety.   We  must  therefore  deter  these  street  gangs  from

becoming  full-fledged secret societies.  Where  necessary,  the

Act will be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned the above examples to show why,

despite  the good law and order situation prevailing today,  the

Act  is  still  necessary.  Some Singaporeans may  think,  quite

naively,  that the Act was enacted in 1955 to deal with  rampant

gang  lawlessness, and therefore has no further use today.  But,

Sir,  nothing  is as far from the truth.  The setting  may  have

changed but the threat remains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries are losing their battle against triads

because  of  the lack of sufficiently deterrent penalties.   The

recent  gangland  warfare in Macau is a  grim  reminder  of  the

violent  nature of these triad groups.  In an interview reported

in  the  Straits  Times  on  25th May  1998,  Mr  Victor  Ng,  a

Legislative Assembly member of the Preparatory Committee set  up

by  China  to  oversee  Macau's return to  Chinese  sovereignty,

commented, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The sort of crimes being committed are very serious, and

the  government  cannot  control.   It  proves  that  the  Macau

government has no means, no capacity, to rule Macau in a  lawful

manner.'

<br><br>Another  example,  which those of us who have  followed  in  the

press  would know, is the murder of Dr Victor Chang, the  world-renowned heart surgeon, in Sydney in 1991.  Two Malaysian  triad

members  were  convicted of killing him because  he  refused  to

accede  to  their extortion demands.  Again, these are  examples

which highlight the danger of letting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>

triads gain a foothold in any society.  Law

enforcement agencies must have sufficient teeth in their legal

arsenal to deter such violent gangs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore constantly be on guard. Police has

assessed  that there are gangland members in Singapore  and  the

region  who are linked to prominent East Asian Gangs  (EAGs)  in

Hong Kong and Taiwan.  But these EAG members are discreet.  They

are  not  involved  in  triad  activities,  such  as  initiation

ceremonies and extortion.  However, they have the "muscle",  the

money and even the firepower to commit cross-border crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Police, EAGs consider Singapore to be an

unattractive operational base.  Police attributes this primarily

to  the deterring effect of the CL(TP) Act.  But we cannot  rule

out   the   possibility  of  these  triads  transferring   their

operations here.  Hence, Singapore needs the CL(TP) Act  as  our

shield  against  this  potential threat.   Our  law  enforcement

agencies must be well-equipped to counter any attempts  by  such

triad  groups to infiltrate Singapore.   Singapore has, so  far,

managed  to  avoid the many pitfalls currently  faced  by  other

countries  in dealing with organised triads and criminal  gangs.

The  Act  is  a critical factor in deterring such foreign  gangs

from gaining a foothold in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the drug situation. Drug trafficking is

an  extremely  lucrative trade.  Drug traffickers and  syndicate

leaders  have become very sophisticated in their modus operandi.

They  stay  clear  from physical drug transactions  by  engaging

money  couriers,  organisers  and recruiters  to  conduct  their

trafficking businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the drug situation in Singapore is under

control,  drug  traffickers  play a high  stakes  life-and-death

game.  They will not hesitate to do everything necessary to save

their  own  skins.   We  have  a duty  to  protect  our  people.

Allowing  the Act to lapse may be misinterpreted as a  softening

of our tough

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>

stance  and  a  weakening  of  our ability  to  deal  with  drug

trafficking.  This may encourage international drug  trafficking

syndicates to use Singapore as a staging point for their illicit

drug  activities.  More drugs will then find their  way  to  the

local  population,  resulting in higher `contamination'  levels.

Such a scenario has implications on crime.  We should not expose

ourselves to this possibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, SS and drug trafficking activities have declined

considerably  but  the threat of resurgence is  very  real.   We

therefore still need the strong deterrence offered by the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having explained why the Act is still necessary today, let

me  assure  Members that there are safeguards  in  the  process.

These safeguards ensure that Police and CNB cannot take the easy

way  out  by  invoking the Act when a person should  instead  be

charged  in court.  They are both built into the Act  itself  as

well  as  found in administrative procedures which  ensure  that

enforcement agencies do not resort to using the Act without  the

strongest justification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, any proposal by Police or CNB to detain a person

under  the Act or to place him under police supervision will  be

scrutinsed by senior officials in MHA and the Attorney-General's

Chambers  and  indeed by the AG before the Detention  or  Police

Supervision Order is issued.  Departments cannot take  the  easy

way out.  They have to justify the use of the Act in every case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, an Advisory Committee comprising prominent private

citizens such as Justices of the Peace, senior lawyers and a few

community  leaders scrutinise the investigations and documentary

evidence  and may examine investigation officers and  witnesses.

At  the Committee's hearing, the detainees or supervisees may be

represented   by  legal  counsel.   The  Committee   makes   its

recommendation  to  the President.  I must  reiterate  that  the

Committee  is  not  a rubber-stamping body.  Over  the  past  10

years, the Committee has disagreed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>

with  MHA's  recommendations  on 12 occasions,  by  recommending

instead that DOs be either revoked or changed to PSOs.  We  have

taken  the  objections seriously and accepted  the  majority  of

these recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, DOs are reviewed annually by a separate Review

Committee,  also comprising prominent private citizens.   Hence,

no  detainee  is  just locked up and the key thrown  away.   The

Review Advisory Committee members are distinct from the Advisory

Committee,    ensuring    independent   decision-making.     Any

recommendation  to extend the detention for a  further  12-month

period must be approved by the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fourth, a separate Review Board, also with a different

set of members, considers all cases of detention cases extending

10  years  or  more.   This  process ensures  that  longer  term

detainees' cases are specially looked at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this exercise of coming before Parliament every 5

years  to renew the Act is an additional safeguard.  An Advisory

Committee  Chairman has asked why the Act is temporary  and  not

permanent.  The reason is that, this way, the Government has  to

come  to the House to justify the continued use of the Act every

5 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, let me assure this House that where there are

witnesses  willing  to  testify in court,  we  will  charge  the

culprits in court.  But where victims and accomplices refuse  to

testify  in  open  court,  the CL(TP)  Act  prevents  the  chief

offenders  from getting away scot-free.  Even when invoked,  the

Act is not used as a blunt instrument.  Depending on the gravity

of the offence, either a Detention Order or a Police Supervision

Order  would be issued.  Therefore, this allows for the exercise

of flexibility based on the facts of each case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the proposed amendments to the Act.

Currently,  only  Police officers are empowered  to  arrest  and

detain  a  suspect without a warrant for not more than 24  hours

under  section 44 of the Act.  Section 44(2) of the Act  further

empowers a police officer of the rank of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>

Assistant  Superintendent  of Police  or  above  to  extend  the

detention period for another 24 hours.  Under section  44(3)  of

the Act, a Police officer of or above the rank of Superintendent

of  Police  may authorise further detention up to  14  days  for

investigation  into  the  case to be completed.   Under  current

practice, CNB must obtain authorisation from a Police officer of

the  appropriate  rank  to arrest and detain  a  suspected  drug

trafficker  under the Act.  CNB investigates a large  number  of

drug  trafficking cases under the Act  -  51 in 1997 and  48  in

1998.   The  requirement  for CNB to obtain  authorisation  from

Police hampers CNB's effectiveness and efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it is proposed that Part V of the Act be

amended  to give CNB officers powers, similar to that of  Police

officers,  to  arrest and detain suspected drug traffickers  and

persons  who  had  assisted  these traffickers  in  one  way  or

another,  eg, in collecting monies.  A new section 46A  will  be

introduced   to  empower  the  Director,  Deputy  Director   and

Assistant  Directors  and other Narcotics Officers  of  CNB,  to

exercise  the powers conferred on Police officers to detain  and

arrest  suspected persons, and to enter and search  premises  to

effect  arrest.   Under section 46A(2), any CNB officer  holding

the  appointment of Assistant Director or above may exercise the

powers  conferred  on  a  Police officer  holding  the  rank  of

Assistant  Superintendent of Police  or  above.   Under  section

46A(3), the Director or Deputy Director of CNB may exercise  the

powers  conferred  on  a  Police officer  holding  the  rank  of

Superintendent of Police or above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a right move. CNB officers, like Police

officers,  are responsible law enforcement officers.   In  fact,

currently, CNB officers can already exercise powers of a  police

officer  under  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  in  relation  to

investigation  of drug offences under the Misuse of  Drugs  Act.

Hence, this amendment plugs a gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments will allow CNB to be more efficient.

The  enhanced powers will only apply to drug trafficking-related

cases, unless approved by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>

Minister.   The  Director and Deputy Director  of  CNB  will  be

responsible  for authorising investigations related to  Criminal

Law   cases.   These  enhanced  powers  will  thus  be   tightly

controlled.  As in the case of police officers, any  abuse  will

be severely dealt with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always been recognised as one of the safest

cities to live in.  We have been enjoying a relatively low crime

rate  and free from any major organised crime activities.   This

fact  has been acknowledged by almost any visitor who is  living

in  or  visited our country.  It is because our Government takes

the  maintenance  of  public safety, peace  and  good  order  in

Singapore  seriously.  We come down hard on criminals,  although

our   policy  in  crime  and  punishment  may  have  drawn  some

criticisms  from  the west.  We have never  apologised  for  our

stand to punish criminals severely in order to protect victims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well known fact that some major crimes such as drug

trafficking, gambling, prostitution are secret society  related.

Although  the menace of secret societies has been under  control

since  the 60s and 70s, we must, however, be vigilant to  ensure

that  they  are  kept under control at all  times,  as  we  face

constant threat that their activities may surface not only  from

within but from the surrounding region.  It is not unknown  that

from  time to time, our police have detected importation of such

secret society activities from as far as Hong Kong and Taiwan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to have secret societies under control in

order  to  keep  major  crime  rates  low.   The  Criminal   Law

(Temporary  Provisions) Act has to be extended  because  of  its

effectiveness  in  dealing with persons associated  with  secret

societies, drug trafficking and other subversive activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue and ask why our courts cannot deal with such

criminals.  Again, it is a well established fact that because of

the depth of influence and the intimidating tactics these secret

societies employ on the ordinary citizens are so effective, very

often  no  witnesses  are willing or dare  to  come  forward  to

testify and therefore even if they are caught and every evidence

points to their guilt, the culprit will often be set free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one of the most illustrative examples of this is in

the  case  of the famous American gangster, Al Capone.  Everyone

in  America  knew  that  he  was  the  most  notorious  criminal

controlling  almost the whole underground during the prohibition

period.   Despite  all  the efforts by  the  most  powerful  law

enforcement agencies in the US, including the FBI, CIA,  Police,

DA,  at the end, they could only succeed in convicting him on  a

lesser  charge  under the IRA Act.  Therefore, I have  no  doubt

that in order to ensure a peaceful and safe environment in which

our   citizens'  well-being  is  protected,  the  Criminal   Law

(Temporary Provisions) Act has to continue to be one of the very

important  law  enforcement  tools  to  be  used  against   such

criminals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the new section 46A in the Amendment Bill.

It  is  only logical that the CNB officers should be  given  the

same  powers conferred upon a police officer, so that  they  can

carry  out  their  duties in dealing with  drug  offenders  with

greater efficiency and effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who argue that there may be abuse of such Act on

the innocent, so far, it has not been proven that any person has

been detained arbitrarily or wrongfully.  This is because of the

safeguards  built into the Act that every case will be  reviewed

by the Advisory Committee consisting of people from all walks of

life, from senior members of the Bar, professionals, Justices of

Peace, academics, etc, to ensure that the decision is made by  a

cross-section of prominent citizens after a thorough review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to ask the Minister whether the

review report can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>

disclosed  upon request, if necessary, to ensure that the  whole

process  is  truly  transparent,  thus  eliminating  any   doubt

whatsoever  in the manner of administering the Act, and  whether

the  identity of the persons who are appointed to this  Advisory

Committee  could be made public, so as to lay to rest any  doubt

that the Act can be abused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving

me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As students of law, the concept of fairness and natural

justice is ingrained in us.  We learn very early in school  that

no man shall be condemned without a fair hearing.  The fact that

this law has a long life in the statute book and is still called

temporary  provisions is reflective of our philosophy.   I  hope

that  this will truly be temporary provisions but I am  sanguine

enough  to believe that the law will be in existence for a  long

time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, Sir, William Goode, the then Colonial Secretary,

moved  the Second Reading of the Bill.  Communist terrorism  was

on  the  rise  and  secret societies were a menace  to  society.

There  was no alternative.  The British, who believe in  natural

justice, had no choice but to introduce this law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the most heartening things I would like to

share  in  this House is the confidence the public  has  in  our

Police Force.  I agree with the Minister that no person has been

persecuted.   Every case is thoroughly examined.   But  I  agree

with  Mr  Kenneth  Chen  that we should try  to  work  out  some

transparency in the system.  I am not for a moment doubting that

our  system is far from fair.  We should improve on the  system.

The  last  time the Bill came before this House, there was  some

suggestion.  I reiterate it again, Sir.  The Minister will still

be  responsible for the appointment of members of  the  advisory

committee.  But may I ask that he invite the Academy of Law  and

the   Chambers  of  Commerce  to  nominate  one  person  to  the

committee.  In this way,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>

public confidence will be further increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite a very strong effort by the Police Force and

the  schools,  we find that street corner gangs are  increasing.

Secret  society activities have moved even to our  schools,  and

this is most unfortunate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the reasons why people are prepared to come and

invest in this country is because we have law and order.  And  I

think this is the safest country in the world, and we must  make

it  that way.  I would have no hesitation in giving the power to

the  Minister, knowing full well that this power will  never  be

abused.  As a practising lawyer, I have had opportunities in the

earlier days of my practice to represent some of these cases.  A

parent would come and tell us, "Oh, my son is innocent.  Nothing

has  gone wrong."  And when you face the advisory committee, the

truth  is  there, and the truth is always that the  Police  have

done  their  work thoroughly.  As the Minister has pointed  out,

the Attorney-General's Chambers is consulted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to maintain the record of the safest city in

the  world, may I urge the Minister to take the necessary steps.

While the law will still be there, we must allow the educational

process to go on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wholeheartedly support the proposed amendment to

include  section 46A.  I think more than secret societies,  drug

pushers  and  traffickers  are the most  dangerous  and  heinous

criminals in the world, and their tentacles spread all over  the

world,   in   million  dollar  businesses  and  million   dollar

operations.   We must do everything to assist the  international

agencies and ourselves.  We are going to have the world at large

if  we  can  see  that this place is clean from these  dangerous

elements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, as a lawyer, I am in a dilemma

whether  to support this Bill when I look at fundamental issues.

But  when  I study the reality of the situation, I find  that  I

cannot but agree wholeheartedly with the Minister.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill and I hope the House will support

it.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank both Mr

Kenneth Chen and Mr Rai for supporting the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, what they say is correct. The role of the

private citizens in the process is important, because they  play

an  important role to ensure that the process is indeed fair and

that  there  is no abuse.  When we talk about transparency,  the

fact  is  that the process, raison d'etre, is that witnesses  do

not  want to testify.  So that circumscribes the extent to which

there can be transparency.  But all the committees do their work

carefully,  fairly, examining every case and, as  I  have  said,

those   cases  where  the  committee  has  disagreed  with   the

Ministry's  order, we have also looked at their  recommendations

and in some of them, we have followed the committee's views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Rai asked whether we should in fact have designated

appointing authorities where we can invite recommendations,  for

example,  from  the Chambers of Commerce or  whatever.   Let  me

assure Mr Rai that the Ministry of Home Affairs takes much  care

in  surveying the field to look at who is available and  who  is

suitable.   If we were to take his suggestion, we  are  in  fact

restricting our flexibility.  Let us leave it this way where  we

do  look  at the composition of the various committees  and  the

kind  of work they do.  We will continue to have a good  mix  of

prominent  people who have proven themselves in various  fields.

Like  I  have  said before, there are 37 prominent citizens,  of

whom 11 are Justices of the Peace and about 30 lawyers.  In  the

nature of the task at hand, there will be a need for lawyers  to

be  there to examine the evidence available.  At the same  time,

it  is  also good to get other views.  Therefore, there is  this

mix.  So let us leave it at that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think Mr Kenneth Chen's suggestion is worth

considering.  He asks whether we could have some publicity as to

who these people are.  That will instill

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>

some confidence in the system because a lot depends

on them. We can consider that.  The next time the Ministry of

Home Affairs appoints or reappoints members to the various

committees, we can consider making these appointments public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (Chapter 248

of  the 1985 Revised Edition) was passed in 1980 to provide  for

the  control,  licensing and inspection  of  private  hospitals,

medical  clinics  and  clinical  laboratories  and  to  prohibit

trading  in human blood.  The Act came into operation  when  its

regulations were gazetted in 1991.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act was passed in 1980 when most hospitals were run by

the  Government  and the Act did not apply to  them.   With  the

restructuring of Government hospitals, the conversion  of  homes

for  the  aged into nursing homes and the increasing  number  of

private  hospitals, clinics and clinical laboratories being  set

up,  it  was  necessary  to implement the  law  to  oversee  the

operation of these healthcare institutions and uphold  the  high

standard  of medical care in Singapore. Regulations to  the  Act

were  finalised and  the Act came into operation  in  1991.   My

Ministry  then  established the Medical Audit and  Accreditation

Unit  (MAAU)  to  license  all private healthcare  institutions,

including   the   restructured  hospitals,  to  regulate   their

professional standards and to audit their clinical activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With recent changes in medical practice and rapid advance

in  medical  technologies, there is need for some amendments  to

the  legislative  framework under which MAAU  works.   Before  I

brief the House on the amendments to the Bill in detail, let  me

present  the three main objectives that my Ministry  intends  to

achieve with these amendments.  They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to ensure a high level of professional standard

practised at health care establishments;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to provide for greater flexibility in licensing the

establishments; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to enhance our capability for regulatory enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will help to ensure a high level of professional

standard by providing, firstly, for :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) more effective quality assurance (QA) programmes at

health care establishments; and,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) more effective medical audits carried out by my

Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QA programmes comprise a range of activities directed at

ensuring  the  quality  of patient care  through  objective  and

systematic  monitoring, evaluation, identification  of  problems

and  action  to improve the level and appropriateness  of  care.

The  programmes  are by and large institutional  activities  for

self-monitoring purposes.   These have been established  in  all

hospitals   as   a   requirement   for   licensing   since   the

implementation of the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics  Act

in 1991.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry monitors closely these activities by requiring

hospitals  to  submit  regular six monthly returns  on  clinical

performance  indicators such as unexpected deaths; perioperative

deaths;  unplanned  re-admissions to  hospitals;  and  unplanned

returns  to the operating theatres, and so on.  We also  require

six  monthly returns on any report of Committees of Inquiry into

medical incidents as well as the results of tissue audit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of these returns are then closely scrutinised

by  my  Ministry  and in-depth medical audits are  conducted  if

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is important to retain the self-monitoring element

in  QA  programmes, they are, however, based on  a  peer  review

process which requires doctors to evaluate and pass judgement on

each  other's  professional performance.   Understandably,  many

doctors  have  been reluctant to participate  in  QA  committees

because  firstly,  the  findings of a  QA  committee  under  the

current  provision  of the law are open to legal  discovery  and

could  provide the basis for legal action against the  hospital.

Secondly, QA committee members are exposed to personal liability

for  the  opinions they have expressed and to  legal  suits  for

defamation by aggrieved doctors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But QA programmes must have the active involvement of

doctors  to be effective.  There is therefore a need to formally

recognise  the  roles  and functions of  QA  committees  and  to

provide the necessary safeguards for the hospital and members of

the  QA committees that will facilitate the conduct of effective

QA  programmes.  Countries like Australia and the United  States

have   also  recognised  the  importance  of  effective  quality

assurance programmes in health care and have enacted legislation

to address these legal issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill lays down more definitive requirements for

hospital  QA  programmes.   It will also enable the Minister  to

make  regulations  on  the composition, procedures,  duties  and

responsibilities of QA committees in hospitals and other  health

care establishments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will, secondly, enable my Ministry to conduct more

effective  medical  audit  programmes.   To  ensure  that   high

standards  of  professional  practice  are  maintained,  it   is

necessary for my Ministry to conduct medical audits to  evaluate

the medical treatment that has been given to patients.  To do so

effectively,  my  Ministry must have  access  to  the  patient's

medical records so that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>

clinical  data,  investigations performed, treatment  prescribed

and  the  outcomes  of clinical management  can  be  objectively

reviewed and assessed for their quality and appropriateness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, section 12(3) of the existing Act prohibits access

to  a  patient's  medical  records  except  with  the  patient's

consent.   This  prohibition  is  unduly  restrictive  for   the

purposes  of  statutory  medical  audit.   Medical  audits   are

conducted  mostly on common medical conditions, and this  should

be done before any conclusion is reached on the quality of care.

Obtaining  the patient's consent at this stage will  potentially

cause undue alarm to the patient, and may raise doubts that some

error  in  medical management has occurred, where none may  have

been  made at all.  The need for the patient's consent  is  also

not  practical  when  a  large number of a  particular  type  of

patients   is  studied.   For  example,  when  we  audited   the

appropriateness and outcome of caesarean sections performed  for

pregnant  women under different clinical situations, we  took  a

random sample of 10%.   In 1997, out of 46,000 deliveries,  some

12,600 or 27% were by caesarian section.  A 10% sample for  1997

therefore entailed a study of 1,200 cases of caesarian sections.

It is obviously impractical to ask each and every patient chosen

in  the  sample  for  her  consent to have  her  medical  record

examined.  It will be more practical to allow access to  medical

records  specifically  and  only for the  purpose  of  statutory

medical audit, while at the same time safeguarding the principle

of  medical  confidentiality.  I  want  to  emphasise  that  the

objective  of having access to the medical records  is  for  the

purpose  of  studying the pattern of management of a  particular

group  of  patients and not for identification of the individual

patient.   The  identity  of  the individual  is  protected  and

safeguarded under new provisions of the Bill (clause 10, section

12), which I will elaborate on later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is selectively auditing areas of clinical

practice where there is a large

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>

number  of patients or high volume, where the cost is high,  and

where  there may be a potential for `errant practice'.  Examples

of  areas  being audited are caesarean sections, hysterectomies,

endoscopies, arthroscopies and balloon angioplasties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the audits done so far have shown that there is a

very  high degree of conformity with acceptable "best practice".

This  is  to the great credit of our medical profession.   Where

`deviations'  are  found,  for  example,  with  indications  for

performing  caesarean  sections,  the  doctors  or  professional

bodies  are  given  feedback  to enable  corrective  action  and

improvement of practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the manner in which healthcare is delivered is

evolving  rapidly.   The second objective  of  the  Bill  is  to

provide  for  greater  flexibility in  licensing  of  healthcare

establishments.  The Act currently provides for only three types

of licences:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Hospital licences for hospitals, nursing homes and

maternity homes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Medical clinic licences for medical and dental clinics;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Clinical laboratory licences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Act was passed, new types of health care

establishments  have  emerged, for example, ambulatory  surgical

treatment  centres, renal dialysis clinics and MRI  centres.   I

have  no  doubt  that  this  trend of new  types  of  healthcare

establishments being set up will continue.  There is therefore a

need to build greater flexibility into the Act for the licensing

of  new  health  care establishments which can  then  be  better

controlled through their own specific regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objective of the Bill is to enhance my Ministry's

power  of enforcement.  The existing Act only allows my Ministry

to inspect health care establishments but does not allow for the

seizure   of   evidence  which  is  frequently   necessary   for

prosecution.  The revision of the Private Hospitals and  Medical

Clinics Act  will facilitate the enforcement work of my Ministry

by allowing the seizure of evidence during raids especially on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>

unlicensed premises.  Presently, we have to rely  on

the  police  to  exercise such powers.  This is  an  unnecessary

burden  on  the  police  and  can be removed  by  enhancing  the

investigative powers of the officers acting under the  authority

of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all offences under the Act require prosecution

in  court  before  any  penalty can be  imposed.    For  greater

flexibility  in  enforcement, there is a  need  to  provide  for

composition of offences especially for the more minor ones.  The

penalties for offences under the Act also need to be updated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now brief the House on the main provisions of

the Bill which will address the concerns I have listed earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 10 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 10 is

enacted   to  require  the  setting  up  of  quality   assurance

committees in hospitals.  To facilitate the conduct of effective

quality  assurance  programmes  in  hospitals  and  health  care

establishments, the section provides that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Documents arising from the deliberations of quality

assurance committees cannot be compelled to be divulged  to  any

court, tribunal, board or person;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Findings and recommendations made by quality assurance

committees  on  changes to be made to practices,  in  particular

healthcare  establishments, shall not be used as  evidence  that

the service or practice was inadequate or inappropriate; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Members of quality assurance committees are protected

from  personal liability when they exercise their duties in good

faith.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are similar to legislation which has been

enacted  in  the United States and in Australia  to  support  QA

programmes in health care.  These two countries have also  drawn

up  legislation to prevent forced legal disclosure of QA matters

in  hospitals  and other healthcare establishments.   They  have

also enacted legislation to protect members of QA

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>

committees from personal liability when they act in good faith.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 of the Amendment Bill also amends section 17 of

the  Act  to  allow  the  Minister to make  regulations  on  the

composition,  procedures,  duties  and  responsibilities  of  QA

committees of healthcare establishments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 10 of the Amendment Bill, another new section

11  is  enacted which provides for the access to medical records

of  patients  notwithstanding that  the  prior  consent  of  the

patient has not been obtained in order to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) investigate whether this Act or any regulations made

thereunder has been or is being contravened; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to assess the quality and appropriateness of the

services provided and the practices and procedures being carried

out at the healthcare establishment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 of the existing Act which requires the patient's

consent  for  access  to medical records is therefore  repealed.

The new section 11 stipulates that the access to medical records

without  consent  is  allowed only for medical  audit  purposes.

Access  to medical records is also strictly confined to officers

authorised by the Director of Medical Services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 10 of the Amendment Bill, a third new section,

section  12,  is  enacted  to  prevent  the  disclosure  of  any

information  contained in a patient's medical record  which  has

come to the knowledge of the Director of Medical Services or  an

authorised  officer in the course of performing any  duty  under

this  Act.   This provision safeguards the need for  doctors  to

maintain confidentiality of medical information.  It provides an

essential  balance  to  the provision  which  allows  access  to

patients' medical records by authorised officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 12 only allows for disclosure of medical

information  for  specific  statutory  purposes  such   as   for

disciplinary proceedings under the Medical Registration  Act  or

the Dentists

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>

Act.  The maximum penalty for wrongful disclosure of information

under  the  Act  has  been increased from a fine  of  $2,000  to

$5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 2A is

enacted  to allow the Director of Medical Services to  authorise

any  person  to assist in the administration of the  Act.   This

section also provides for the Minister to establish one or  more

advisory  committees  to  advise on matters  pertaining  to  the

administration of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 13 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 16B is

enacted  to  protect  all  authorised officers  and  members  of

advisory  committees from legal liability for anything which  is

done in good faith in the performance of their duties under  the

Act.  These amendments ensure that the appointed medical experts

are  adequately  protected  from any  personal  or  professional

liability in the exercise of their responsibility and judgement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 2 of the Amendment Bill, section 2 of the Act

is   amended   to  include  the  definition  of   a   healthcare

establishment as any premises or conveyance which is declared by

the  Minister  to  be  an establishment that requires  licensing

under  this Act.  This will give my Ministry the flexibility  to

license  new  types  of healthcare establishments  as  and  when

required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 10 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 11

provides   the  Director  of  Medical  Services  and  authorised

officers  with additional powers to seize evidence, make  copies

or take extracts from relevant records or require the persons in

charge  of  licensed establishments to do so when enforcing  the

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 13 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 16D is

enacted to allow for the composition of offences up to a maximum

of $2,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill updates the penalties for various

offences  under the Act, and proposes a couple of new  offences,

such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>

as  the  failure  of an unlicensed healthcare  establishment  to

comply with an order to close the establishment; and failure  to

comply  with  an  order to stop using an equipment  or  to  stop

carrying out a practice deemed dangerous or unsuitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, medical knowledge, medical technology and medical

practice have changed and advanced tremendously in the last  two

decades  and  will continue to evolve into the  new  millennium.

New   diseases  pose  new  challenges  that  will  present   new

modalities of treatment and new approaches to patient care.   In

the  midst  of  these changes, there will always be  a  need  to

ensure  that a high level of professional standard is upheld  in

healthcare establishments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in this Bill will strengthen the

regulatory  framework so that we can meet these challenges  with

confidence and achieve our goal of providing good quality health

care to Singaporeans that is appropriate to their needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support

of  the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics (Amendment)  Bill.

I would like to declare that I am a medical practitioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that the introduction of this Amendment

Bill  is  necessary and indeed timely.  The extensive amendments

are  welcome as they suitably update the 1995 Edition of the Act

to cater for the vast

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>

changes in the healthcare industry.  It would appear to me  that

the main crux of this Amendment Bill seeks to rope in control of

the so-called "healthcare establishments".  I would suggest that

the  words  "healthcare establishments"  be  inserted  into  the

preamble  of  the  original Act.  Sir, this  notwithstanding,  I

would  like  to seek clarification on several other  matters  in

this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Senior Minister of State for Health clarify on

one  of  the  main  objectives of licensing the various  private

healthcare  establishments, laboratories, clinics and  hospitals

in  Singapore  as provided in this Bill?  Is the  assurance  for

quality  of  such  premises or the control of quantity  of  such

premises the priority?  Sir, my concern is that with the latter,

we  shall create, in the future, a tradable commodity for  those

licences of existing practices.  This will pose difficulties for

young  doctors  to  set  up  new  medical  practices  and  other

healthcare  personnel and concerns to set  up  laboratories  and

hospitals.   The  problem  may  be  further  compounded  if  the

controlled  and  restricted numbers of  licences  from  existing

holders invariably become scarce commodities.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,

I  would  like  to know if the licensing mechanism  will  enable

better  distribution of healthcare establishments in  Singapore.

Let  us  be  reminded of a past incident where six clinics  were

opened  in  the same block of an estate.  No doubt, the  problem

then was due to the "tender scheme" for HDB shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the amendment of section 2 under clause 2(b), the

definition  of  "healthcare establishment" as  any  premises  or

conveyance  (not  being a private hospital,  medical  clinic  or

clinical   laboratory  or  part  thereof,  and  not   being   an

establishment or conveyance maintained by the Government or  the

National  University  of Singapore) that  aims  to  provide  the

services  stated  would mean that a wide range  of  premises  or

conveyance  will fall within the ambit of the Act.   Sir,  would

the  Senior Minister of State for Health confirm whether a wider

definition  like  this is intended so that  traditional  Chinese

medical clinics, acupuncture centres,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>

health spas, and the like, can be included for licensing?   That

these   establishments  may  provide  or  attempt   to   provide

diagnosis,  treatment,  or care of persons  suffering  from  any

disease, injury, or disability is indisputable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the provision for Quality Assurance Committees in

new  section  10 to enhance and ensure the quality standards  at

private hospitals and healthcare establishments.  This amendment

provides for transparency in quality control and reassurance  to

recipients of healthcare in Singapore.  New subsection 10(3)  is

good,   as  this  will  give  protection  to  quality  assurance

committee  members  and will facilitate their  unrestrained  and

efficient contributions.  My concern is on new subsection  10(4)

in  that  the minutes of the meetings can be made available  for

any  proceedings.   Will these not erode the protection  to  the

said members in any proceeding?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the implementation of the Act, I would like to

urge  the  Senior  Minister of State for  Health  to  cause  her

Ministry to be mindful of two issues:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A surfeit of fees chargeable for various licences. For

instance,  in  the case of a medical practitioner,  besides  the

$600  fee for the clinic licence every two years, there are fees

for  the  practising  certificate, medical insurance,  equipment

like  an  ultrasound machine, and so on.  All these  add  up  to

higher  costs and run counter to our aspirations of  containment

of  healthcare  cost.  Would the Minister consider  waiving  the

fees or at least keeping them reasonably low?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The new section 11 gives the Director or an authorised

officer  very  wide  powers to enter,  search  and  inspect  any

premises and to ask a licensee to furnish information.  Although

we  can  understand that such powers are necessary to facilitate

checking and compliance, I hope the licensees are not subject to

excessive   demands   for  inspections,  data   collection   and

submission  or  for surveys and audits.  These  can  be  counter

productive   insofar   as  they  are  fundamentally   laborious,

disruptive and expensive.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this Amendment Bill will enable the

Ministry to fulfil an effective "watchdog" role.  Sir, I support

the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.  I agree,

in  principle,  with the main thrust of the  Bill  which  is  to

regulate  the standards of medical care in the interest  of  the

public.   Although this Bill is intended to enforce good medical

audit  on healthcare institutions that are "western" in  medical

orientation  and treatment, I urge the Minister  to  expand  its

scope to regulate non-western and experimental health practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, we observe the growth of a grey

spectrum  of  healthcare practices which some call  "alternative

medicine" and others call "complementary health systems".   Some

are  more acceptable forms of alternative medicines like Chinese

herbal   treatment,  homeopathy  and  acupuncture  which   apply

different  modalities towards health recovery.  There  are  also

the  high-tech "clinical" centres offering services  in  colonic

irrigation, live cell therapy, hair transplants and other  forms

of transformative cosmetic surgery.  We have had cases of people

dying  because  of botched up colonic irrigation or  scarred  by

plastic  surgery performed by inadequately trained  beauticians.

Hence,  we have to be wary of these medical practices which  are

of questionable medical benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is therefore timely, some may even argue that it

is  long overdue.  It is an enabling instrument which will  give

the  authorities  the legal teeth to classify and  regulate  all

healthcare   practices   and  to  vigorously   intervene,   when

necessary,  to safeguard the integrity of the medical profession

and  protect  the public.  But, Sir, I do have  some  qualms  on

certain  elements in the Bill which, if not corrected,  may  not

provide  sufficient guidelines and checks on the authorities  in

the pursuit of their duty.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to clarify four points. My first

query is on the notion of "healthcare establishment".  The

advocates of alternative and complementary medicine will regard

their healing modality as more holistic and less invasive than

"western" institutional medical practices.  Are these healing

"clinics" in meditation, aromatherapy, acupuncture, foot

reflexology and other holistic and wellness centres classified

as "healthcare establishments"?  Not only had these new

approaches gained popularity among entrepreneurs who wished to

develop them within medical institutions in the new millennium,

users in the community have argued in favour of their

"treatment" potency.  A massage, for example, is regarded as

having more healing power than the panadol.  This marks a shift

of medical preference in some pockets of Singaporeans away from

western clinical methods of healing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to articulate at this juncture,

other than the institutions earlier named by her, what would she

define  as "healthcare establishment".  In line with my  concern

with  the  non-traditional  medical institutions,  are  slimming

centres,  beauty parlours and hair transplant salons  classified

as  "health establishments"?  Do the practitioners like  Chinese

sinsehs  and  counsellors with non-credentialised qualifications

in  the new healing trades come under the scrutiny of this Bill?

If  they are not, I urge the Minister to consider broadening the

scope  of  the Bill that enables the Ministry to regulate  their

growth, classify the plethora of healthcare practices, supervise

and sanction their service and professional standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern is on the notion of "prescribed

standards"  in  relation to the issue  or  refusal  to  issue  a

licence  by the Director.  Alternative health healing  practices

are  now  carried out by individuals who are paid to  make  home

visits to attend to the sickly, often without assistance of  any

nursing staff.  Some are trained healers, having studied abroad,

where  alternative  medicine has become institutionalised,  many

others are not accredited by any training body but have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>

gained  their  healing  experience  through  work.   These  same

practitioners  are  invited sometimes  by  private  clinics  and

hospitals  to  conduct  limited  healing  programmes   for   the

patients.   If  any mishap happens during the  treatment  and  a

patient  suffers  or  dies, is the institution  employing  these

holistic practitioners held responsible for the problem?   Where

do  these freelance practitioners stand in relation to the Bill?

I  urge  the  Minister  to  develop  some  broad  guidelines  of

"prescribed    standards"   in   each   field   of    "western",

"traditional",  alternative or complementary medicine  to  guide

entrepreneurship   in  this area.  I  can  understand  that  the

Minister   may   not  want  to  come  down  "heavy"   on   these

practitioners  by  killing the industry with  a  narrow  set  of

"do's"  and "don'ts", but neither do we want to leave the matter

so  open  that  will  lead  to  explosive  contention  upon  the

disagreement of definitions and standards between policy  makers

and practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to my third question on safeguards for

practitioners.   In  the  event that the  Director  revokes  the

licence  of a medical establishment, what recourse is there  for

the  licensee  to  have  his  case heard  independently  without

prejudice?   The  Bill provides for appeal to  be  made  to  the

Minister  who will then set up an Advisory Committee  to  review

the petition.  Would the Minister consider setting up a recourse

mechanism   and   procedures  that  allow  an  independent   and

professional judgement of alleged offences?  In relation to this

matter,   does  the  Medical  Council  have  a  regulatory   and

disciplinary function in adjudicating the judgement process?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and last concern questions the total protection

from any suit or other legal proceedings which the Director, any

authorised  officer  or  any member  of  an  Advisory  Committee

enjoys.   What is the rationale, Sir, for this protection?   And

how can we make sure that they will execute their duties in good

faith,  consistently and by maintaining a high  level  of  sound

judgment   if  they  were  not  held  responsible  for  wrongful

decisions or malicious decisions?  If directors in any  business

corporations come under the scrutiny of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>

the laws, why not the Director in executing this

Bill?  Is it appropriate or necessary to endow so much power in

one Director since the Attorney-General's Chambers are already

entrusted with the jurisdiction to try any offence related to

health malpractices?  Could the Minister elaborate on some of

the qualified privileges which the Director has to abide by

before he proceeds to search and seize documents from private

practices?  I hope that the Minister would clarify these points

in her response.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will attempt to answer

the  points  raised  by  Dr Lily Neo  first.   In  general,  she

supports the Bill but she has raised a couple of issues.  First,

the  issue  of quality versus quantity.  She asked  whether  the

main objective of the Bill is to regulate quality, that is,  the

standard  of the professional services or control the  quantity,

that  is, the number of healthcare establishments that  will  be

set up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that the main objective of the Bill is to

give  my Ministry more effective means to ensure that hospitals,

clinics  and nursing homes maintain a good quality of  care  and

that  there are provisions within the establishments for the  QA

activities.    So  the  Act  primarily  seeks  to  enforce   the

parameters  that the hospitals, nursing homes and  clinics  must

work under in order that the health services given to the public

are  of  a  high  standard.  The new section 5(3)  of  the  Bill

defines  the parameters for the Director to issue or  refuse  to

issue  a  licence  but  none of these parameters  refer  to  the

distribution  or  the number of hospitals,  clinics  or  nursing

homes.  In other words, the Bill does not control the number  or

distribution of such premises.  She was correct in pointing  out

that  one sometimes finds in HDB estates a concentration of five

or six medical clinics.  But this is the result of the tendering

process  where  the  doctors make a  decision  to  locate  their

clinics in a certain locality.  We have, in the past, left it to

market  forces and I think we should still leave  it  to  market

forces  to  decide on the number and distribution of  healthcare

establishments.  The Bill is not intended at all to  cover  this

aspect of her concern.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would discuss her point about whether traditional

Chinese medicine or acupuncture clinics can be considered as

healthcare establishments under this Bill, and other kinds of

healthcare establishments that we might want to regulate, later

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was concerned also about new sub-section 10(4) which

states  that "the minutes of meetings can be made available  for

any  proceedings" and whether it would erode the  protection  of

the said members in any proceedings.  Under sub-section 10(3) of

the  Bill,  a  person who is a member of a QA committee  is  not

compelled   to  disclose  the  proceedings  of  the   committee.

However, sub-section 10(4) would only apply if the Ministry  has

adequate  reason to believe that this person has  not  acted  in

good  faith and there is some deliberate cover-up of wrongdoings

by  the  doctor  under  investigation.  The  Director  can  then

require that the relevant information or minutes of meetings  be

made  available for review.  This is the same question that  Mdm

Claire  Chiang  has asked about qualified privilege.   In  other

words, a member of a QC committee is protected by this Bill  and

is  not  compelled to divulge any proceedings, but if  there  is

reason for the Ministry to suspect that there is some wrongdoing

or  that the QC member did not act in good faith, the minutes of

evidence could still be called for.  The Ministry can still look

into  this  evidence and an aggrieved patient  or  doctor  would

still  have  recourse to the normal process of the law  to  sue,

because  if  the QC member was found not to have acted  in  good

faith,  then  what he said and his opinions in the QC  committee

would still be open to legal judgment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the high fees that Dr Lily Neo talked about, I would

like to clarify that the $600 clinic licence fee is actually for

two years.  It is not for one year.  Also, this licence allows a

clinic  to have up to five doctors or dentists.  The onus  on  a

single  or  individual doctor or dentist is not  that  heavy  in

terms  of financial burden.  I take her point that doctors  have

to pay for their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>

practising certificate, clinic licence fee and also some charges

or  fees for equipment such as ultrasound, laser, x-rays and  so

on.   These are meant to cover only administrative expenses  for

enforcing  the  regulations under the various  requirements.   I

have   actually  thought  about  this  and  I  asked  for   some

comparative figures on what lawyers have to pay to stay  in  the

practice.   They  pay  much  more,  in  fact.   For  example,  a

practising  certificate for lawyers can vary  between  $450  and

$750  per  year.  All of them have also to pay for an  indemnity

policy, on an average of $4,000 for every million dollar revenue

collected, as compared to the doctor's medical defence insurance

which  is just between $1,000 and $2,000.  But this is  for  the

good  of lawyers and doctors.  They should cover themselves with

such  funds.   On top of that, if lawyers want to  be  a  notary

public  or  a  Commissioner  of  Oaths,  they  have  to  pay  an

additional  registration  fee of  $1,000.   I  should  say  that

lawyers are comparable to doctors as professionals, but the fees

they  pay  are  higher than what doctors are  paying  under  our

present schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take her point that these fees should not be too onerous

and  her  point that the requirement for licensees of healthcare

establishments   to  furnish  information  on  their   practice,

procedures, and so on, should not be too onerous.  I would  like

to  assure  her  that  the visits would be  coordinated  by  the

various sections of the Ministry and my officers would make sure

that  the data collection and submission will not place an undue

demand  on  healthcare establishments at the  expense  of  their

productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she asked that the term "healthcare establishment"

should be put in the preamble of the Act.  I can look into that.

I  think  there  is  no  problem  with  putting  back  the  term

"healthcare establishment" into the preamble of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mdm Claire Chiang's concerns, I find her reference to

the  Director  of  Medical Services as being comparable  to  the

director  of a company rather puzzling.  I think we are  talking

about two different things.  The Director of Medical Services is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>

charged with the responsibility to oversee the

professional standards of the entire health sector.  I find that

it is not really a comparable issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as appeals are concerned and on safeguards, if the

licensee  commits a certain breach of the licensing requirement,

this  would  be under the purview of our Ministry's regulations.

The  Act  already provides for the composition of fines, instead

of bringing the licensee to court.  If it is a matter of medical

ethics or a professional lapse, then the person would be brought

before  the  Medical Council.  So it is a matter of professional

judgment  and the Council is an independent body.  I can  assure

her  that various bodies are in place to regulate the healthcare

establishments  and  to  ensure that  they  perform  to  certain

standards  within  the  purview of this appeal  process.   If  a

licensee  is  aggrieved, he can appeal to the Minister  and  the

Minister  can  appoint  an  Advisory Committee.   This  Advisory

Committee would be a panel of experts, depending on the type  of

healthcare  establishments you are talking about.  Obviously,  a

dental  clinic  would be under a panel of dentists.   A  medical

clinic would be referred to a panel of medical professionals who

are  in  that specialty.  We are talking about having panels  of

experts  to  assist the Minister in Advisory  Committees.   This

appeal process is in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should they be protected in the same way for their

opinions?  As I explained, both the QA committee and members  of

the  Advisory  Committees  are to give  their  opinions  to  the

hospitals,  the healthcare establishments or to the Minister  in

good faith.  They can express their opinion very frankly in such

committees and they give their opinion in good faith.  But  they

are  only given qualified privilege.  If there is any reason  to

doubt that they are trying to cover up any mistakes done by  the

hospital  or  to  protect another colleague,  then  there  is  a

process whereby their evidence could still be discovered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for alternative medicine, I share her concern that there

is a proliferation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>

so-called alternative medicine, complementary

medicine or alternative healthcare practices springing up in

Singapore.  This is a world-wide trend and I think many

countries in the world are still grappling with how to regulate

and recognise them.  I would not want to give my opinion on

whether these alternative practices are more holistic than

western medicine.  I would not want to give an opinion on

whether they are holistic or not.  But definitely, they exist.

Some have long traditions, like traditional Chinese medicine.

Some have sprung up recently, like the revival of customary

healing practices and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, traditional medicine, whether it is of the

Chinese, Malay or Indian tradition, is exempted from the Private

Hospitals  and  Medical Clinics Act, just as these practitioners

are  exempted from the Medical Registration Act.  But as I  have

informed  the  House  in the Budget debate  last  year,  we  are

already  going  into the area of registering acupuncture  within

the  near  future.  With the registration of acupuncturists,  we

would  go into the registration of acupuncture clinics and  then

maybe  we  would  move on to other areas of traditional  Chinese

medicine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other kinds of complementary medicine, I think we

have  to  tread  with great care.  We have to be very  cautious.

The  boundaries are vague and the claims are also very difficult

for  us  to  evaluate.  We have to tread very slowly.   But  the

Amendment  Bill  will precisely enable us to go into  regulating

them,  if  there is a need.  At the moment, health  or  wellness

centres  and health spas do not carry out the kind of diagnosis,

treatment   and   care  of  people  with  disease,   injury   or

disabilities  in  the same way as medical practitioners  do.  So

they are not under the purview of this Act.  I think we have  to

be very careful about going into the area of regulating slimming

centres,  beauty  salons and so on.  We have already  gone  into

regulation of cosmetics.  The Amendment Bill will allow  us  the

flexibility  of  regulating  these  other  kinds  of   so-called

healthcare establishments, if there is a need to.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her point about colonic irrigation clinics, the case we

know was an unlicensed clinic, and it is precisely because of

this incident that we need to enhance our powers to go and

search premises, and seize evidence because we had difficulty in

getting evidence to prosecute this case.  We had to seek the

support of the Police because it was done in unlicensed

premises.  I think I have covered most of the points that she

has raised, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move  "That the Bill be now read a Third time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Muslim community has shown keen interest in the

development  of the amendments to the Administration  of  Muslim

Law Act (AMLA).  My colleagues, the Malay Members of Parliament,

and  I received much feedback from the public last year and also

this year.  Members of the public have also written or discussed

the  Bill  with my Ministry and MUIS.  The Select  Committee  on

this Bill received a total of 31 written representations from  a

wide  variety of individuals and organisations.  I  am  grateful

that so many have taken time to give their views and suggestions

on the Bill and I thank them all for their contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee considered all the

representations  submitted.  It heard oral evidence  from  seven

representors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>

To  reflect  the  diverse views, the Committee also  decided  to

publish  four  other  written  representations  in  its   Report

submitted to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommends a number of amendments to the Bill

after studying the written submissions and the oral evidence  of

the  representors.  The Committee also considered all the  views

that  Members of Parliament expressed during the debate  on  the

Second  Reading of the Bill.  The Report of the Select Committee

has been circulated to Members of the House last month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the Select Committee's

deliberations and recommendations.

<br><br><i>Allowing the Civil Courts to Hear Ancillary Matters on Divorce</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, read with section 17A of the Supreme Court of

Judicature  Act  (SCJA),  section  35A  of  the  amendment  that

provided  for  the  Civil Courts to hear  matters  ancillary  to

Muslim divorces, namely, custody and division or disposition  of

matrimonial  property  on divorce, drew the  most  interest  and

comment   from  the  Muslim  community.   Eighteen  representors

expressed  concern over or were against the amendment  and  four

supported  it.   The  main issues raised by  these  representors

were:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that the amendment would dilute the status and powers

of the Syariah Court;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that the Civil Law applied by the Civil Courts may

contradict Syariah law; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that more Muslims would turn to the Civil Courts to

resolve  their matters when they should be going to the  Syariah

Court instead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to present the Committee's deliberations on

these  concerns.  On the first point, the Committee  notes  that

the Bill does not -  and I repeat  -  does not dilute nor remove

the  powers  of the Syariah Court.  The amendment is  really  to

clarify the jurisdiction between

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>

the Civil Courts and the Syariah Court on ancillary issues.   In

the  Second  Reading of the Bill, I emphasised that the  Syariah

Court  continued to have jurisdiction over all matters presently

within  its jurisdiction where the parties are Muslims  or  were

married  according to Muslim law.  In fact, under new provisions

in the Bill, parties would now be required to obtain the Syariah

Court's   leave  or  to  be  counselled  before  commencing   or

continuing proceedings in the Civil Courts on issues relating to

property  on divorce or custody of children.  The provisions  in

AMLA  make  it explicit and transparent the system for  applying

for  leave  to  commence or continue civil proceedings  and  the

staying of these proceedings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, the Committee finds little cause for

concern over possible conflict between Civil and Syariah laws if

ancillary  matters  were  heard  in  the  Civil  Courts.    Some

representors, for example, were particularly concerned over  how

Civil  law  would  apply to disputes on the  custody  of  Muslim

children.   The   Committee  consulted  the   Attorney-General's

Chambers,  Muslim lawyers who practise in both civil courts  and

Syariah  Court and MUIS and found that there are no  differences

in  basic principles between Syariah law and the Guardianship of

Infants Act, as both consider the welfare of the child to be  of

paramount  importance.  The AMLA, in addition, also specifically

provides  for the Civil Courts, in cases where religious  issues

could  be  a  consideration, to seek advice from the  Legal  (or

Fatwa) Committee of MUIS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several representors strongly pushed for the Syariah

Court  to be the only forum to hear matrimonial disputes between

Muslims, fearing that giving an avenue to the Civil Courts would

undermine and diminish the authority of the Syariah Court.  They

felt  that in the past, Muslims had little choice but to  go  to

the  Civil  Courts, as the Syariah Court did not  have  adequate

resources  to  deal with their disputes.  The  Select  Committee

deliberated  over these concerns at length.  It  concluded  that

Muslims,  as citizens of this country, must be allowed the  same

right of access to the Civil Courts as non-Muslims.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may also be instances where the legal issues in a

case  need  to or can only be resolved in the Civil Court.   For

instance,  in  disputes  over property, the  legal  claim  could

involve third parties who are non-Muslims.  Another example will

be  cases  involving  property  or  parties  overseas.   Let  me

reiterate  that  the  Bill does not in  any  way  undermine  the

authority of the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee saw the need for sufficient safeguards

to  ensure that parties intending to resolve ancillary issues in

the Civil Court did so with full knowledge and understanding  of

the implications.  Under the Bill, the legal processes give that

person  ample  opportunity for such knowledge and understanding.

Firstly,  he or she must first seek leave of the Syariah  Court.

Secondly, he or she may appeal to the Appeal Board in MUIS for a

final decision, if dissatisfied with the Syariah Court's ruling.

However, the Committee found that there is no such safeguard for

couples  who, by  mutual consent, want to go to the Civil  Court

to settle their matrimonial disputes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some representors held that the Bill should provide a

safeguard in the form of counselling for this group.  They  will

at  least  be making an informed decision should they insist  on

going  to  the  Civil  Courts  despite  being  counselled.   The

Committee agrees and recommends amending the Bill to provide for

mandatory counselling to such couples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some members of the community expressed concern that

the  legal process which I have described may generate more work

for  the Syariah Court and distract it from performing its  core

functions.   This  is unlikely to be the case, because  a  clear

jurisprudence on the conditions for granting leave will  develop

after  the  initial set of cases going before the Syariah  Court

and  the  Appeal  Board.   Over  time,  there  should  be  fewer

applications as the Syariah Court grows in stature and  improves

its efficiency.

<br><br><i>Strengthening the Syariah Court</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the measures to make the Syariah Court

stronger.  The Select

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>

Committee received several useful suggestions on ways to improve

the Syariah Court.  The Committee considered all the suggestions

received and recommended the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To appoint a Senior President amongst the Presidents

in  the  Syariah  Court to head and provide directions  for  the

Court   and  to  issue  practice  directions,  lay  down   court

procedures and review rules and regulations;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To appoint a panel of ad hoc Presidents of the

Syariah Court to help cut down the present backlog of cases; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To appoint a Registrar to help relieve the

Presidents of their non-substantive legal work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these, the Syariah Court will be able to dispense

justice  to the community effectively and speedily.  My Ministry

will  also  be  looking  separately at administrative  measures,

procedures and manpower needs to enhance the efficiency  of  the

Court to dovetail  the Committee's recommendations.

<br><br><i>Incorporating the Women's Charter Principles for Disposition or Division of Matrimonial Property on Divorce</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill provides that the Syariah Court shall apply

principles in section 112 of the Women's Charter relating to the

disposition  or  division  of matrimonial  property  on  divorce

provided  that  they are consistent with Syariah  law.   Several

representors felt that the Syariah Court should not be bound  by

the  Women's Charter despite the qualification or to  explicitly

mention   in   AMLA  of  the  application  of  Women's   Charter

principles, as they may suggest  that the Syariah law lacks such

principles.  To correct any misperception, the Select  Committee

recommends incorporating into AMLA those principles from section

112  that are consistent with Syariah law, but without reference

to the Women's Charter itself.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Matters Pertaining to MUIS</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal with matters pertaining to the Majlis

Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS).

<br><br><i>Wakafs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of wakafs, a representor suggested putting the

onus  to register wakafs on the trustees.  Wakafs are properties

that  Muslims have dedicated under Syariah law.  All wakafs,  by

law,  are vested in MUIS.  It follows, therefore, that they must

be  registered with MUIS.  However, it is impossible for MUIS to

know  which  properties  have been  so  dedicated  unless  their

trustees  dutifully inform MUIS about them.  In the  past,  MUIS

has   had  to  initiate  court  proceedings   to  recover  wakaf

properties disposed of by their trustees.  The Select  Committee

agrees  with the suggestion and recommends an amendment to  make

registration  of  wakafs mandatory to safeguard  the  properties

from  being disposed of indiscriminately.  The registration will

help  prevent  costly litigation and will protect  the  innocent

buyer  of a wakaf property.  It will also enable MUIS to develop

and enhance the value of the wakaf properties for the benefit of

the  community.   MUIS will ensure that all trustees  of  wakafs

have  ample  notice before registration is made  mandatory.   It

will  launch a public awareness drive to inform Muslims  of  the

requirement.  The trustees of existing wakafs will be given  six

months from the operation of the law to register. Trustees  also

have six months to register new wakaf properties.

<br><br><i>Haj services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also agrees with a suggestion that persons

acting  as  guides  for pilgrims should be  qualified  religious

teachers  so  that the pilgrims who go to the haj  are  properly

advised on the performance of haj rites.  This will be taken  up

in the Rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to reiterate that the

amendments  to  the  Bill  seek to resolve  the  ambiguity  that

existed until now between the jurisdiction of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>

Syariah  Court  and Civil Courts and to strengthen  the  Syariah

Court.   They do not diminish the status nor do they  take  away

any jurisdiction of the Syariah Court.  Muslims will continue to

have  access  to  the Civil Courts to settle  their  matrimonial

disputes albeit with prior approval by the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law alone cannot move the institution forward.

The  Syariah Court will need the understanding, support and help

of  counsellors, lawyers, religious officials, community leaders

and  others,  to enable it to become a court of choice  for  all

Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<div align="center"><b>ADMINISTRATION OF MUSLIM LAW</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek  bin Saniff) (In Malay): Mr Speaker, Sir, the decision  to

bring  the  AMLA amendment to a Select Committee is  a  decision

that is correct and of great importance.  It is obvious that the

decision has given rise to three positive effects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives society plenty of time and chance to analyse in

detail,  especially  on the controversial  aspect  such  as  the

concurrent  jurisdiction  and  at  the  same  time  giving   the

Government a chance to explain any doubts or misconceptions that

might  exist, to gain consensus in many areas and to  develop  a

deeper understanding towards other issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its acceptance or approval in Parliament today gives rise

to two significance:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) This amendment is more comprehensive and thus

strengthens the powers of MUIS and the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Concurrent jurisdiction, God willing, will give rise to

a  feeling of responsibility and care in handling this sensitive

issue.  We  hope that the appointment of a Senior  President  of

Syariah  Court,  an  ad hoc President and a Registrar,  together

with  its  powers, will make the society understand even  deeper

and  thus  accept this amendment and the issues associated  with

it.   In fact, the cooperation between the Syariah Court and the

civil  court  from today will make way for a new  journey  which

will  not  only affect the Malay-Muslim community but  also  the

society as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make a unique journey or pathway. This

uniqueness is obvious because the decision involves two  courts,

ie,  the  Syariah and the civil courts which are  based  on  two

different  backgrounds, one being religion and the  other  being

secular.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate that our secular system is not against

religion,  unlike in some socialist and communist  states  which

regard  religion  as  opium or drug that is detrimental  to  the

state  and  its  social system.  In fact,  our  country  is  too

sensitive  with  the concept of multi-racialism, multi-religions

and  multi-lingualism,  that it has  taken  action  to  protect,

preserve and safeguard these three aspects. The concept of multi-lingualism  is embodied in the Maintenance of Religious  Harmony

Act  and  the Inter-Religious Council, are some of the  positive

measures that were taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures are made possible because in a secularised

system where there is no concept of after-life, there are  still

three sensitive factors that it stands by: Principles, Fact  and

Moral.  Even  though  there are no "spiritual  qualities"  in  a

secular  system,  this system ensures that its moral  aspect  is

applied.  Sometimes differentiating between the  wrong  and  the

right  goes  in  line with the spiritual demands,  just  as  the

importance  of  cleanliness, anti-corruption, misuse  of  power,

theft, murder, abasement and the like.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also times when these go against the customs,

culture and religion, when culture, some say religion, does  not

allow  the  burning  of firecrackers, which would  endanger  our

property and lives; especially so in the recent legalisation  of

football  betting, to save society from fraud, the use of  force

and   victimisation.   Secularism  at  this  juncture   has   to

differentiate between the evil and the lesser evil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the cooperation between the Syariah Court and

the  civil  court  would open a new phase that is  positive  and

unique,  when  the  two  parties  will  respect  each  other   - especially in Moral and Faith.  As long as morality does not  go

against   faith,  I  am  sure  that  the  journey  or  path   of

cooperation, however long it may be, will be a learning  process

that  will bring benefit of mutuality in a multi-racial country.

Let  us say that a wrong decision has been made, correction must

be  made  immediately, this could separate  the  wise  from  the

foolish.    Whichever  is  right  hopefully  could  be  refined,

especially  on  the  issue of child custody,  joint  income  and

divorce claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a heavy responsibility that we all must take. It

is  a  vista that should be explored with care. Being  cautious,

mutual  respect  and tolerance itself have  been  shown  by  the

Prophet  Muhammad 14th Century ago till the birth of the Medinah

Declaration in the 6th Century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim thinkers have made a conclusion that making this

first  Human Rights Declaration shows the universality of Islam.

It  involved  the  Muslims, Christians and  Jews.   Even  though

Medinah  is  under the rule of Islam, the declaration  does  not

stress  on  Darus Islam (Land of Islam) but more  on  Darussalam

(Land  of  Peace).  I have asked Megawati who recently  came  to

Singapore.   I asked her when her father introduced the  concept

of  pancasila, who among the Imams introduced this concept.  She

could  not  answer.  She said perhaps pancasila existed  before.

She  said  that  the concept of Darussalam (Land of  Peace)  and

Darus Islam (Land of Islam) may not be understood by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>

many.   Even among the Muslims themselves, they are still  vague

about the concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept that was encompassed in the Medinah Declaration

existed  hundreds of years before the birth of the Magna  Carta,

which  existed in the year 1215. This spirit, I believe,  caused

the  bishop Nestoria to write to his friend and this  letter  is

still being kept safely:



<br><br>(In English)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These Tayites (Arabs/Muslim) to whom God has accorded

domination in our days, have also become our master; yet they do

not  combat at all the Christian religion. On the contrary, they

even  protect our faith, respect our priests and saints and make

donations  to our churches and our convents.  They all inherited

this and enjoyed freedom of conscience, justice and prosperity.'



<br><br>(In Malay)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors too must have inspired Dutch orientalist

Prof.  Wensinck,  a  professor  in  Arab  language,  before  the

outbreak  of the Second World War, made efforts to decipher  the

sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (hadith) and he said:



<br><br>(In English)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'.the idea of a concordance of the principal collections of

hadith  should  be prepared with a view to facilitate  reference

work  among  the  western  scholars  who  were  working  on  the

different aspects of Islam.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wensinck died before World War II and his works were

continued by Prof. Mensing.  The book entitled "Concordance  and

Indices  of  Islamic Tradition" shows to the hadith recorded  by

Bukhari,  Muslim,  Tirmidzi,  Ibnu Majah,  An-Nasai,  Abu  Daud,

Musnad  Ad-Darami,  Muwatta' Imam Malik  and  Musnad  Ahmad  ibn

Hambal.  This  book became one of the references  for  graduates

pursuing their PhD.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.10 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of tolerance should be our inspiration when we

enter the next millennium, the millennium of biotechnology.  For

instance,  our  cell,  nucleus, chromosome,  DNA  and  the  ATGC

(adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine).  The AMLA debate gives us

the chance to strengthen the fabric of our society. Any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>

multi-racial,  multi-religious  and  multi-lingual  state   that

ignores this fact will face paralysis, in fact, destruction.  In

1991,  Sahid Sahoman criticised the Prime Minister by using  the

word "religion".  The opposition said that he should not be  the

leader  of Muslims and Malays, because he is not a Muslim.   How

religion has been misused!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the following day, we had a press

conference and the Prime Minister, when explaining to the press,

he  looked  at me and I looked at him.  Maybe it is  because  we

have  been together for so long.  I think he knew that I  wanted

to  say something.  Usually, I would just listen and keep quiet.

So  he  gave me the opportunity to speak.  I said that what  the

opposition  had done was wrong, because Islam is not so  narrow.

Islam  divides  non-Muslims  into  three  categories.   Firstly,

harabi  non-Muslims.   No one has to be a Muslim  to  fight  the

oppressor.  Secondly,  dzimmi non-Muslims, the good  ones.   Our

Prophet  treated  them well.  Even the Muslims were  envious  by

this  treatment.  The Prime Minister can perhaps belong to  that

category, or at least an ahdi non-Muslim that can become partner

in,  say,  business.  It is better if you trust  the  ahdi  non-Muslims,  rather  than  do business with Muslims  who  might  be

corrupt.    So,   the  next  day,  gentlemanly,  Sahid   Sahoman

apologised to our Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gus Dur or A Rahman Wahid, in a television interview, has

expressed his dislike to what had been happening in his country,

Indonesia.  He hoped that an atmosphere of tolerance and  mutual

respect  will  come  into its re-existence.  He  has  said  that

before, all pastors, priests and imams used to engage in healthy

banter or humour even if they are from different religions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that there are three religious leaders, Christian,

Hindu  and  Muslim leaders.  While they joked, they asked  which

one  among  them  are the closest to God.  The Christian  priest

said that it is Christianity "because we call God our Father."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hindu priest also claimed that they are also

not far from God because they use Om. According to my Hindu

friend, Lingam:

<div align="center"><b>(In English)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Om is a spiritual sound to the Hindus. It prevails in the

heart  of the Hindus. It pervades the universe. It is a powerful

mantra.  You can recite it 21 or 108 times. Depends. It cleanses

your Karma. Purifies your heart. It is a majestic sound.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, some Hindus will recite Om Nama Sivaya. "Om"

in the Indonesian language means Uncle.

<div align="center"><b>(In Malay)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it is Father for the Christians, for the Hindus,

it  is  Uncle.   Both priests looked into the direction  of  the

Muslim Imam. So he said in reply, "We are close to our God  too.

We  only  need to climb the tower or minaret and call  His  name

five times a day."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the smiles on our faces in the House today

would also infect those outside of this Parliament till the wave

of  tolerance is felt by our society. God willing, the universal

society as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every morning the sun rises. Every afternoon it sets.

It  is  so simple. But in between the rising and setting of  the

sun,  many  things happen.  Good or bad. We should work  towards

the good.   Towards peace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make our country a peaceful one, Darussalam, the

Land of Peace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  find  the anecdote given by Encik Sidek just  now  very

fascinating.  I am still smiling, hoping that we would not  only

be close to God but also close to each other here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to speak

on this Bill.  I rise in support of the Amendment Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is a secular state. But as I

have said before, unlike secular states in the West, and even in

the  Muslim majority Turkey, ours is quite unique.  I call  ours

"secularism with a soul".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we handled the Administration of Muslim Law Act (or

AMLA)  and  its  current  amendments in the  House  today,  bear

testimony  to that feeling.  This says a lot about the tolerance

and  the understanding that exist in our multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, all the Members of the Select Committee are Muslims,

but  it was chaired by Mr Speaker, a non-Muslim, in his capacity

as  the  Speaker  of Parliament.  I do not know how  Mr  Speaker

feels  about  Islam  or  about the Muslims,  but  I  admire  his

tolerance  and  understanding  of  the  issue  at  hand.   I  am

confident, however, that the Select Committee sessions  that  we

went  through must have allowed Mr Speaker to better  understand

how  the  Muslims in Singapore feel about AMLA and to appreciate

their aspirations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admire, in fact, the patience of Mr Speaker. With your

indulgence,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I  cite  one  example.

After  a long session and serious debate about the controversial

issue of allowing the Civil Courts to hear ancillary matters  on

divorce,   the   representatives  of  the  Young  Women   Muslim

Association, persisted with their arguments, refusing to relent.

The  Chairman  of  the  Select Committee  intervened,  reminding

gently  that they were repeating the same points.  The President

of the YWMA, Ms Fatimah Azimullah, persisted and argued further.

Then the Chairman, Mr Speaker, interjected and assured them that

they  had made their point and that they would be given the last

word.   And despite that, another member, Ms Sakina Yusof Kagda,

insisted  on  adding a few more "last words" to reinforce  their

concerns  and  to  clear  their conscience.   The  Chairman,  Mr

Speaker,  then heard them patiently, still giving them the  last

word.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, I hope this exercise would also give the

opportunity  to  all Singaporeans, particularly non-Muslims,  to

better  appreciate  what AMLA is about  and  what  it  means  to

Singapore  Muslims  and to our multi-racial and  multi-religious

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, I trust this exercise will also allow

Muslim  Singaporeans to better understand the position of  Islam

and Muslims in secular and multi-religious Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims have their own Syariah Court and family and

personal  law  of  inheritance.   They  also  have  the   Muslim

Religious  Council  (or MUIS) as a statutory board  to  regulate

matters  of  religious  life, including the  haj,  endowment  or

wakaf,  halal food and mosques.  But the Muslims know and accept

that  they  are  still  an  integral part  of  our  multi-racial

Singapore.   The  Muslims know that they are different  in  some

ways but they also realise that they cannot completely live in a

system within a system divorced from mainstream Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the need to remind ourselves about the

bigger  picture while we tackle the specific needs of the Muslim

community,  in  this case the AMLA amendments.   This  was  also

achieved  in  the deliberations of the oral evidence,  including

during  the sessions with the Association of Religious  Teachers

(Pergas), Jamiyah, Ms Noor Aisha Abdul Rahman, and a few others.

The   written  representations,  to  my  mind,  generally   also

reflected  a  considerable level of maturity  about  the  issues

dealt with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that this Select Committee had

attracted  31 representations.  During the last Select Committee

on AMLA hearing in 1966, there were 18 submissions, and that too

after its closing date for submissions was extended three times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the quality of the representations and the

positive  approach taken by the Committee, many amendments  have

subsequently  been made to the earlier amendments and  presented

by the Minister for Community Development and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>

Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi,  just

now.   This  again,  Sir,  speaks well of  the  system  and  the

openness therein.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments, no doubt, have strengthened both the

Syariah  Court  and the Majlis Ugama Islam (MUIS).   With  these

amendments,  I  am confident that the Muslim community  will  be

able  to stand tall, as far as the administration of the  Muslim

law is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt too that the system is not perfect.

Neither  do I think there is presently a perfect system  in  the

administration of Muslim law in countries where  Muslims  are  a

minority.  Even in Muslim majority countries, systems differ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to look at Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia, three

of  our  ASEAN  neighbours with Muslim majority,  we  will  find

different levels and shades of implementation of the Muslim law.

If  we  were to compare the implementation of the administration

of  Muslim  law  in Singapore with that of the  Philippines  and

Thailand,  two  other  ASEAN countries with  substantive  Muslim

minority   population,  I  think  we  can  be   proud   of   our

achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there were concerns expressed on the question of AMLA

proposing to allow the Civil Courts to hear ancillary matters on

divorce.   True, there are areas where the Civil Courts handling

ancillary divorce matters could end up unIslamic in nature,  but

as  explained by Minister Abdullah, they are marginal and  there

will   be   sufficient  safeguards  to  avoid   such   pitfalls.

Meanwhile,  there is a lot more to gain when Muslim Singaporeans

are  allowed to benefit from vast state resources available from

the Civil Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the sensitivity and the fear some may still

have,  despite the assurances, it is worthwhile for the  Syariah

Court  and MUIS to closely monitor such ancillary divorce  cases

going to the Civil Courts so as to avoid such complications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, this recent exercise has shown what can

be done to improve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>

the  Administration of Muslim Law in Singapore.  Yes,  many  had

wished it should have been done much earlier, but more important

now,  progress  definitely has been made.  I am optimistic  that

there  will be more progress in the future.  I support the Bill,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, share my views on some of the principles and

issues in this Bill.

<br><br><i>(1)  This is not just a Malay or Muslim Bill.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many in Singapore view this Bill as just another Malay

or Muslim Bill.  They do not appreciate the ramification of this

Bill  to  the  larger  issue of race  relations.   I  hope  that

Singaporeans can learn from the current regional situation  that

the  rest  of  Singapore  cannot  be  insulated  from  otherwise

unrelated  religious problems if ethnic communities in Singapore

or,  in the case, Malay-Muslim community feels that their  fears

and concerns are not adequately appreciated or understood by the

majority of the Singapore population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this Bill is as much about Singapore as it is

about  Malay-Muslims in Singapore because the issues  have  wide

implications on the relationship between ethnic minority and the

State.  This  Bill  is about managing the complexity  of  multi-racialism in Singapore.

<br><br><i>(2)  Potential conflicts exist.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans may be unaware and ignorant of the fact

that  whenever a case involving matrimonial property and custody

is being decided in court and given wide publicity in the press,

there is great anxiety and apprehension amongst the Malay-Muslim

population  because of the concern that the decisions  taken  by

the  Civil  Court may be in conflict with Islam.   Many  Muslims

have  the  perception  that there are wide  differences  between

Muslim  and civil laws although, in actual fact, there are  only

slight, if any, differences between Syariah and civil laws

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>

relating to the maintenance, custody and division of property on

divorce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, and it is also shared by those who

presented  themselves at the Select Committee, the Civil  Courts

have  been extremely fair and sensitive when dealing with  cases

that  have implications on Islam.  I must compliment our  judges

and journalists who have been very careful in dealing with these

sensitive  issues.   I  think  they  have  done  their  jobs  so

successfully that a large section of our population  today  have

become  unaware of the potential conflicts and problems some  of

these  cases  may bring.  Having said that, some of  the  Malay-Muslims  still fear that when the crunch comes, and there  is  a

conflict  between  the interpretation of the Civil  and  Syariah

Courts,  the Civil Court would never compromise its position  in

terms  of  justice  and equity for the sake  of  any  particular

religion.    While  my  friends  in  the  predominantly   Muslim

neighbouring  countries take comfort that should  there  be  any

conflicts  between Islamic and civil laws, there will be  enough

political or judicial intervention to ensure that the reputation

of  Islam  is not compromised.  Some Malay-Muslims in  Singapore

are  not  similarly  assured.  As ethnic minorities,  some  feel

inadequate  in dictating or influencing the judicial process  as

can  be  done  in some other predominantly Muslim countries  and

therefore  are concerned that the Civil Court may not adequately

consider Islamic interpretation when making its decisions.

<br><br><i>(3)  Participation and consensus.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I compliment the Minister for referring the Bill to the

Select  Committee  for  out of it has  come  numerous  practical

suggestions  and recommendations that have resulted  in  further

amendments  to  the Bill.  Perhaps another less obvious  but  no

less  significant consequence is the fact that  the  process  of

participation  by  a large cross section of the  community  from

professionals  to  Ulamas, social workers and community  leaders

have brought about a sense of collective ownership and a strong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>

desire that the amendments represent a process that would  bring

the  present status closer to the aspirations of the  community.

There  is today a sense that each and every Malay-Muslim counts.

That  each  has  a  role  to  play in strengthening  the  social

institutions  like  the Syariah Court and  overcoming  the  many

problems that continue to beset the community.  Whilst some  may

disagree  with a number of specific provisions proposed  in  the

amendments, what cannot be denied is that the Bill requires  the

moral  support of all Malay-Muslims if we are to see  solid  and

visible improvements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this sense of ownership can be translated into

action,  for example, volunteers and social workers to help  the

counselling  process of those contemplating divorce,  especially

now  that  this  process can be delegated to the  community  and

lawyers  and other professionals to help strengthen the  Syariah

Court that is extremely short of trained resources and lacks the

experience in handling complex Muslim issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also not disputed is the fact that there is a

strong desire in the community to develop the Syariah Court into

a  full-fledged  Family  Court when it has  acquired  sufficient

experience in establishing the tradition and jurisprudence  that

would  enable it to handle increasingly complex problems of  our

society.   This is an issue that confronts many Muslim societies

the  world  over.   With good support from the community,  I  am

confident that Singapore can develop a unique model of balancing

Syariah and civil laws that can serve as an example to the multi-racial society the world over.

<br><br><i>(4) Malay Paradox.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, coming to terms with multi-racialism. Sir, there

is  also  the view that the aspirations of the Malay-Muslims  in

Singapore to have an independent and full-fledged Syariah  Court

is  a  sign  of Malay-Muslim fundamentalism in Singapore.   Sir,

this  is  an incorrect assessment.  In my view, there  exists  a

paradox in the Malay-Muslim community and in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>

fact in the heart and soul of a Malay-Muslim Singaporean.  As an

individual,  we  are  expected to reflect  and  demonstrate  our

evangelical spirit and be a role model to other Muslims.  Malay-Muslim  leaders, either in politics or in community, because  of

their  privileged position and the influence that they may  have

on  society, are also expected to be the protector, defender and

crusader  of  Islam.  This is especially so in  Singapore  where

Malay-Muslims  are  ethnic minorities, where increasing  complex

social  problems  are seen as a result of  the  social  ills  of

modernisation  and westernisation and where Islam is  considered

as the only force that is capable of confronting this influence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the dilemma is that Malay-Muslim leaders, by virtue of

their position in society, must necessarily be more aware of the

multi-racial dynamics of the Singapore society and therefore are

constantly  put  under  pressure  to  balance  the  secular  and

religious  interest of the community without being unnecessarily

compromising   in   dealing  with  this  conflicting   interest.

Individually,  Malay-Muslim Singaporeans are still  looking  and

coming to terms with balancing the religious and secular values.

Some are still searching to find the comfort zone where they can

be  completely  Malay-Muslim and wholeheartedly  and  absolutely

Singaporean in our multi-racial society.

<br><br><i>(5) A society in transition.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, historical perspective. Even during the empires

of the Caliphate from AD 632 to 661, there were separate syariah

and  non-syariah jurisdiction.  I quote from S.E. Finer  on  The

History of Government from the Earliest Times:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The caliphs set up syariah courts, conducted by trained

specialists, the gadis, but because so much of syariah  law  was

unsuited  and  unaccommodated to the running of the  state,  the

caliphs  had  also established their own court  whose  principal

duty  had been to deal with complaints against and between their

officials.  It was an "administrative court" of complaints,  the

mazalim.    To   remedy  the  syariah  courts'  inadequacy   for

administering  the  empire, they attracted  into  these  mazalim

courts  entire  classes of business relating to statecraft.   It

was by these steps that the empire came

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>

to   have   one  law   -   the  syariah   -   but  two  separate

jurisdictions:  the  syariah jurisdiction  and  the  non-syariah

jurisdiction, that is, the caliphal one, not unacceptable to the

ulama  who had always recognised that he had the right to define

the  jurisdiction  of the syariah court.  So, while  the  latter

handled  religious, family and most civil matters  like  police,

taxation, criminal justice, and military affairs fell within the

caliphal jurisdiction.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even in modern Islamic history, we could see that one

of  the  crucial  issues defining the political  future  is  the

relationship of Islamic forces and democratic political systems.

Competition,  cooperation  and conflict  are  amongst  the  most

important dimensions of Muslim life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Malaysia to Morocco, Indonesia to India, societies are

concerned  with  the compatibility of Islam  and  democracy  and

their  respective  roles in the political  evolution  of  Muslim

societies.   While  in some of these countries,  revolution  and

reformation are characteristics of this process, we in Singapore

can  and  should take a more evolutionary approach  in  managing

this process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to some of the more specific provisions of

the  Bill.   There  were genuine concerns  that  allowing  Civil

Courts  to  hear  ancillary matters on divorce  may  dilute  the

powers  of  the Syariah Court.  I am, however, of the view  that

there now exist sufficient safeguards to ensure that Muslims, as

a  matter  of  choice, will go to the Syariah Court  to  resolve

their disputes, that is, requiring parties to seek leave of  the

Syariah  Court and provision for counselling even  if  there  is

mutual  consent  by  both parties to go to the  Civil  Court  to

settle their disputes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Syariah Court is the people's court. Utlimately,

the  status and reputation of the Syariah Court depends  on  the

support it gets from the community.  While it may be possible to

regulate  and  make it mandatory for people  to  go  to  Syariah

Court, this alone may not necessarily ensure the good reputation

of  the  Syariah Court.  Besides, Malays have progressed so  far

that  there are complex issues, for example, involving  overseas

properties  and  other assets that may be too  complex  for  the

Syariah Court alone to shoulder this responsibility.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>(6) Strengthening the Syariah Court.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the various initiatives to strengthen the Syariah

Court  to  review  the administrative measures,  procedures  and

manpower  needs  and  the call for Muslims  to  volunteer  their

services  towards this cause.  We can all agree on the  ultimate

goal  of  having a full-fledged Syariah Court but may differ  on

the pace and time it will take to achieve this.  But we must  be

careful to ensure that our hopes and wishes are matched  by  the

capacity  and  the capability of the Syariah Court  to  shoulder

this responsibility.

<br><br><i>(7) Future amendments to separate laws for AMLA and MUIS.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that we have separate laws for AMLA

and MUIS to reflect the different roles and responsibilities  of

MUIS  and  the Syariah Court and to give these two matters  more

specific focus and attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, with these amendments, we have, in my

opinion, the necessary prerequisites to make the Syariah Court a

great  Muslim  Family  Court.  More importantly,  those  seeking

legal  remedies can now expect better and prompt service because

justice is also about efficiency and productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly by no means the last amendment to the

Bill.   As  we progress, we will need to amend AMLA periodically

to  keep  pace with the progress and aspirations of  the  Malay-Muslim  society.  For now, Sir, only a solid endorsement by  all

concerned  is the most appropriate support that we can  give  to

this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Select

Committee   has  received  31  proposals.   The  Committee   has

painstakingly  examined all the proposals and  has  incorporated

many  of  the proposals by the Members of this House as well  as

members of the public.  This is very encouraging, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been representations both from individuals as

well  as  Muslim organisations.  This is encouraging.  The  Bill

has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>

benefited from the public representation.  It is important  that

this legislation will reflect the social norm of our time.  This

House  must be prepared to change laws which need to be amended,

and AMLA is such a law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one concern which I would

like to share with this House.  Other Bills which were committed

to  a  Select  Committee, the representation made by  the  Malay

community  was  not  very encouraging.  May  I  urge  the  Malay

community leaders that they should be forthcoming and air  their

views  on  national issues as well, not just on  Muslim  issues.

The minority community should participate in activities from the

grassroots level to the national level.  Only in this  way,  can

we build community bonding and multi-racialism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my other NMP colleagues and I have received a letter

from  one  Muslim group, and there have been some serious  views

expressed in the letter.  I would like to assure the group  that

I  have  considered  their views very  carefully  and  I  cannot

support  them.   One  of  the  proposals  was  that  the  AMLA's

amendment  would  in fact contravene the Constitution  which,  I

think,  is  not  correct.  No provision of the  Constitution  is

being contravened and that proposition has no foundation at all.

Therefore, I would like to assure the group that their view  was

represented  in the Select Committee.  The Select Committee  had

published  and considered their view.  Nevertheless, since  they

had  written  to the NMPs, we owe a duty to have  this  publicly

aired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must bear in mind that not all

proposals  before  any Select Committee can be  accepted.   Only

proposals  that are workable and within the legal framework  can

be  accepted.  Therefore, many representors may be wondering why

their  views have not been heard or accepted.  The simple reason

is that only views which will reflect the majority view and will

be good for the Bill are accepted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the civil law and the syariah law are going to operate

side by side.  The Muslim

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>

community  has  a  choice.  I would like to  assure  the  Muslim

community  that the civil jurisdiction does not  take  away  the

Muslim  position.   Whenever the law is being  interpreted,  the

Muslim  position  is considered by the judges.   Another  aspect

which  I would like to share is this.  We should strengthen  the

Syariah Court's position, as is being done in the Family  Court.

We  should  allow  for more mediations and discussions  to  help

people who are going through a dispute.  In the past years,  the

Family Division of the Subordinate Court has done very well.   I

hope  the  Minister will take this point and advise the  Syariah

Court  that it should treat legal dispute for hearing as a  last

resort.   After  all, we are an Asian society and  the  practice

that  has  been  followed  in  the Family  Court  is  worthy  of

consideration.  I would seriously urge the Minister to  get  his

officials to look at it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that some of the proposals have been

accepted.  I am also glad that we will have two Presidents,  one

of  them would be senior, ad-hoc Presidents and a Registrar  who

will  help in the administrative work.  And I would suggest that

we should have a Deputy Registrar, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I

would  like  to  thank  the  Members who  have  expressed  their

widespread and strong support for the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sidek and

Mr  Zainul, in their own inimitable way, spoke at length of  the

need  for  tolerance,  understanding and  mutual  respect  in  a

society like ours, especially in areas where things spiritual  - faith, religion, beliefs  -  come into contact with the secular,

the  need  for  accommodation and the  need  for  reconciliation

between these two spheres.  I share this sentiment, Sir, and  it

is  indeed in this spirit that the amendments to AMLA are  being

proposed.   As suggested by Mr Zainul, the Syariah Court,  MUIS,

and  certainly my Ministry, will monitor the progress  of  these

amendments  to  ensure that if things need  to  be  reviewed  or

improved upon, we would certainly do so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli spoke about our multi-racial society. I

can readily appreciate and emphathise with the Member's points

on the sensitivities and the issues of concern in our society

and the need to consider our multi-racial and multi-cultural

context in anything we do.  As for AMLA and MUIS to be treated

separately, it is, I think, a separate issue and one which will

have to be studied very closely, especially the implications of

the separation.  I agree with the Member on the need to monitor

the progress of the amendments, and we would certainly do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai supported the Bill too. I am aware of the complaint

from  the  three  persons whom Mr Rai mentioned and  the  trio's

attempts  at  lobbying the NMPs to pursue their  cause  in  this

Parliament.   I have checked the allegations and arguments  with

the  relevant  experts  and they are  of  the  view  that  these

allegations  and arguments are misconceived and  without  basis.

As  to  mediation, whether it should be encouraged, I think  the

Member  would be pleased to note that there is indeed a  culture

of  mediation in the Syariah Court, and it is certainly an  area

which we will develop further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has gone through extensive consultations, study

and  discussions by individuals, organisations and  experts  and

among  the Malay MPs and the institutions concerned.   I  accept

that not everyone would accept every amendment to AMLA.  Indeed,

I  think  it is unreasonable for us to expect this.  But  I  am,

Sir, comforted by the fact that almost everyone agrees that,  as

a  whole,  the amendments serve to strengthen the Syariah  Court

and  also MUIS, the two important institutions to Muslims  here.

I  think this is how we should look at the Bill.  Each amendment

is  like a piece of mosaic, each fitting into each other  to  be

built  into  a very fine mural which no single piece  of  mosaic

would be able to conjure, no matter how ugly or attractive  that

individual  piece  of mosaic is.  I would like  to  commend  the

Muslim  community  to  adopt  this  approach.   We  should  also

consider  how the Bill will serve the needs of the community  in

the  context of our multi-racial and multi-cultural environment,

as has been expressed by various Members.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is not the amendments alone that will make

the  Syariah Court stand tall and proud but also how it conducts

itself after this.  This depends on the quality of the principal

officers, the efficiency of the staff, the effectiveness of  the

processes  and the procedures adopted, and the adequacy  of  the

resources, both manpower and physical.  This, the Syariah  Court

and  my Ministry would certainly look into and make improvements

where  necessary, and members of the community  are  welcome  to

make  any suggestions on how we could improve the Syariah  Court

or MUIS further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said and done, Sir, the proof of the pudding will

ultimately  be  in  the eating and I hope  the  community  would

accept  these changes with an open mind or, at least, give  them

and the Syariah Court

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>

a chance to prove themselves or, as mentioned by Mr

Rai, give the Bill a chance to work.  I am confident that, given

time, experience and support from the community, the Syariah

Court would emerge stronger, more effective and an institution

worthy of the hopes, inspirations and the trust of the Muslim

community in Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister (a)

whether  the Government's position in determining the  pace  and

path  of  banking mergers in Singapore is contradictory  to  the

principle of adhering to free market forces in Singapore's  open

economy; and (b) whether the Government has assessed its  impact

on  credit facilities which are currently extended by  banks  to

small and medium-sized enterprises.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Government must set the pace of liberalisation in

the  banking  sector,  because we do not start  from  a  totally

laissez  faire situation. While we have promoted competition  in

the   banking  industry,  MAS  has  restricted  foreign   banks'

activities in the domestic retail markets to protect  and  build

up local banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign banks are subject to limits on opening branches,

setting   up   off-premise  ATMs,  participating  in  shared-ATM

networks and offering Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale

(EFTPOS) services. Nevertheless they enjoy a larger market share

in  Singapore than elsewhere in Asia, or in any major  financial

centre.   They  compete freely with local banks in many  banking

activities ranging from wholesale domestic banking, to  treasury

and capital market activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking system is a key component of our economy.

Strong  domestic  banks  anchored in  Singapore  have  interests

closely  aligned to the interests of Singapore.  They  are  more

likely to take a long term view of the business, especially in a

crisis. A financial system in which the local banks have a large

market  share  is  therefore  likely  to  be  more  stable   and

resilient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, globalisation and rapid technological change are

transforming the banking environment globally. Inevitably,  this

means  more  foreign competition for local banks,  for  example,

through  Internet  banking  or  non-bank  institutions  offering

financial  services.  MAS could retard the process by tightening

regulatory  restrictions on foreign banks. But that  would  mean

shielding  the local banks from pressures to upgrade,  depriving

Singaporeans  of  quality  banking  services,  and  making   the

ultimate adjustment more traumatic, when change can no longer be

postponed and the barriers finally come down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition, not protection, is the best way to upgrade the

industry,  and  develop  strong and  robust  local  banks  which

measure  up  against the best international players. Competition

will  encourage  local  banks to rationalise  their  operations,

further  exploit  economies of scale and deliver  efficient  and

innovative  services comparable to the best available  in  other

major financial centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By taking steps to liberalise the banking industry now, we

can pro-actively manage this change. But we cannot simply remove

all  restrictions overnight because the industry needs  time  to

adjust  to  the new environment, and we must maintain confidence

and stability in the banking system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition from the present state to the new one must

be  paced so as not to jeopardise this confidence and stability.

MAS is, therefore, drawing up a 5-year programme to do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to shape the final outcome of the

liberalisation, and not leave things purely to chance.  Our  aim

is  to have an open banking sector with strong local banks,  not

an  industry  from which local banks have been marginalised.  We

will  liberalise  in such a way as to allow  and  encourage  the

local  banks to upgrade themselves into strong players.  We  are

confident they will use the next five years to do so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has been discussing its plans with the local banks,

both  to seek their feedback, and to impress on them the urgency

of  change.  At  the same time, MAS has also been  meeting  with

foreign  banks to discuss how we can encourage strong and  well-managed  foreign  institutions to make  further  commitments  in

Singapore  and take a stake in the growth and stability  of  our

financial system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local banks are well run for their size, and are highly

rated  compared  with  other Asian  banks.  But  they  lack  the

economies of scale to hold their own against foreign banks  that

operate  globally.   If  the  local banks  can  consolidate  and

rationalise,  and  continue to build up and attract  outstanding

management   teams,  they  can  upgrade  their  operations   and

services,  earn  better  returns for  shareholders,  and  become

stronger players both in Singapore and the region. That is  what

MAS is encouraging the local banks to do. However, MAS is not in

a  position to compel the banks to merge, let alone dictate  who

is  to  merge  with  whom.   That can only  be  decided  by  the

shareholders of the bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Traditionally, MNCs in Singapore have chosen to bank

with  large  international banks with which they have  a  global

banking  relationship, while our domestic  banks  have  built  a

profitable franchise lending to the SMEs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike some other countries, we have not maintained a

protected   and   inefficient  sector  of  domestic   companies,

insulated  from  the  efficient,  export-oriented  part  of  the

economy.  Instead  we  have  encouraged  domestic  companies  to

upgrade and compete, because that is the only way they can offer

well-paying jobs to Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since lending by local banks has always been on a

commercial  basis,  any  merger  of  banks  resulting  from  the

liberalisation of the banking sector should not adversely affect

credit  available to SMEs. Indeed SMEs will be  best  served  by

strong local banks providing efficient and innovative services.

to  why  the  beaches of Pulau Ubin are polluted and what  steps

have been taken by his Ministry to keep the beaches there clean.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main beaches at Pulau Ubin that are popular

with  the public.  Both are located at the northern end of Pulau

Ubin and are subject to seasonal Northeast Monsoon from December

to March every year. During the monsoon period, large amounts of

flotsams  are  washed  ashore onto  the  beaches.  Visitors  and

picnickers are another source of beach litter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry deploys workmen daily to clear the flotsams and

other  litter  that  are washed up onto the beaches  during  the

monsoon  season  and school holidays when the beaches  are  more

heavily  utilised.  But during the off-peak season, the  beaches

are  cleansed less frequently - twice weekly, namely, before and

after the weekend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help keep the island clean, my Ministry has initiated a

litter  bag  programme with the Pulau Ubin Police  Post  to  get

campers to bag their refuse.  When campers report* to the Police

Post for overnight camping on the island, the police officer  on

duty  will issue our litter bags to the campers for them to  bag

their refuse for proper disposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will monitor the cleanliness of the beaches and

step up our cleansing efforts, if necessary, to ensure that  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower, with an

aging  workforce  emerging,  if his Ministry  will  promote  and

facilitate the job redesign programme to enhance job security of

older workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry considers job redesign as one of the

adjustments  needed to cope with an ageing  workforce.   In  job

redesign, we aim to get employers to make work and the workplace

more accommodating for older workers.  It may be necessary,  for

instance, to modify the actual duties to reduce physical  stress

which  may exact a greater toll on older persons.  Working hours

and  even  the location of the workplace may need to be reviewed

in  order  to accommodate the needs of older persons.  New  work

arrangements such as job sharing and telecommuting  should  also

be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working with the Productivity and Standards Board

(PSB)  to  promote job redesign at the company level.   A  pilot

programme with several companies to redesign jobs to suit  older

workers  has  been  initiated.  These companies  will  serve  as

models to demonstrate how work arrangements could be adjusted to

suit  the  needs of older workers.  PSB will help more companies

to embark on job redesign programmes, and develop blue-prints to

be  shared with other companies so as to achieve optimal  labour

utilisation and productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that the success of

initiatives  such  as  job  redesign would  depend  on  changing

mindsets regarding the employment of older workers.  On the part

of  the employer, older workers should be considered as valuable

human resources to be properly managed and retained for as  long

as possible.  Employers will have to accept the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>

reality  of  a labour force with a growing proportion  of  older

workers  in the workforce.  On the part of the older worker,  he

may  need to be more realistic about the nature of his  job  and

the expected remuneration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues of an ageing population and workforce are also

being studied comprehensively by the Inter-Ministerial Committee

on  the Ageing Population.  The Committee has set up six working

groups,  one of which is on Employment and Employability.   This

working group will look at increasing the productive lifespan of

older  persons, including promoting flexible and part-time  work

as  well  as elderly-friendly employment policies and practices.

My  Ministry  will consider the outcome of their  study  in  due

course.

<div align="center"><b>NEW LEGISLATION ON OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY HEALTH</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if his

Ministry  will consider introducing legislation to  have  a  new

Occupational Health and Safety Act or to amend the Factories Act

to   extend  its  coverage  beyond  factory  building  to  other

workplaces.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Factories Act in Singapore provides for the

safety,  health  and  welfare  of persons  working  in  premises

defined  as  "factories".  These "factories"  are  traditionally

premises  in  the manufacturing, construction, shipbuilding  and

ship-repairing   industries  where  hazardous   work   processes

are  carried  out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its enactment in 1958, the Act was amended several

times.  The last amendment in 1995 extended the coverage of  the

Act  to  premises such as laboratories, warehouses and  aircraft

parking  bays.  My  Ministry  is  reviewing  the  Act  with  the

intention  of  covering workers engaged in maintenance  work  on

the  MRT and LRT, ie, repair or maintenance work carried out  on

any  rail, track, including viaducts and tunnels. However, there

is  a  limit to which the Factories Act can be extended,  beyond

which the term "factories" would become meaningless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workforce covered by the existing Factories Act is

about  700,000, which is about one-third of the total workforce.

In  the  next millennium, Singapore's economy will see  a  shift

towards the knowledge-based economy (KBE). In order to support a

vibrant  KBE,  we must create a safe and healthy workplace  with

world class occupational safety and health standards. This  will

allow our workforce to work safely and productively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently reviewing the safety and health

legislation to ensure that workers, including knowledge  workers

of  the  future  will  be  adequately protected  at  work.   New

legislation on occupational safety and health may be required to

cover  the workplace of the future and to promote greater  self-regulation by employers and manufacturers of machinery and  work

tools.

Information   Technology   Plan  (MITP)   with   the   following

objectives: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) use IT as a tool for productive and efficient

administration of the madrasahs;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) use IT as a source of Islamic academic research and

information and as learning and teaching aids;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) equip madrasahs with IT technology hardware

and   software   to  fulfil  its  executive  and  administrative

functions as an Islamic academic institution;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) create an IT culture within the madrasah system to

include  not  only  students and teachers but their  parents  as

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the plan, IT is used not only as a tool for

communication  and  teaching but also as a  means  to  stimulate

creative and critical thinking among the students and teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS has already developed the basic infrastructure in some

madrasahs.   For  example,  Madrasah  Aljunied  has  a  computer

laboratory with 30 PCs, teachers' and students' workbenches  and

personal e-mail addresses for all staff. MUIS is in the  process

of  installing PCs, teacher and students' workbenches and  email

in  Madrasahs  Maarif,  Irsyad  and  Arabiyah.   Multi-media  CD

curriculum  is  being  used at primary level  education  in  the

teaching  of  English and Mathematics.   MUIS  is  looking  into

recommending   educational  programmes   for   other   subjects.

Teachers and students have IT training road maps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS is also helping to develop the E-Resource Centre,

homepages and computer syllabus for the madrasahs and  will  run

IT  camps  for students and IT awareness programmes for  parents

during the June holidays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS is aware of the importance of a positive IT culture in

the  madrasahs and is working closely with them to foster  this.

It  has arranged for the madrasahs to visit top schools like RGS

to  share  experience and to learn from  them.   A  team  of  IT

coordinators from the madrasahs is monitoring the implementation

of MITP.
