<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, with effect

from this day's sitting until 28th February 2001, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Question Time may continue for up to one and a half

hours from the commencement of a sitting; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the existing time in Standing Order No. 88(2) be revised

from "1.30 pm" to "2.00 pm".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been requests by Members to have more

time  set aside for Question Time as many Members have  asked

many  questions  but  there was not  enough  time  for  their

questions  to  be  reached.  In March  this  year,  when  the

subject  was raised I said that we would leave the  situation

be until the Standing





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



Orders  are reviewed.  There are currently no urgent  matters

that warrant a review of the Standing Orders.  Hence, to wait

for  that  would  take a long time for us  to  look  at  this

question of Question Time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to allow for more time for questions, I

have therefore proposed the business motion which I have just

moved  as a temporary measure.  Some of the reasons  why  not

many  questions could be reached during the one-hour Question

Time  were  that  the  Members asked too  many  supplementary

questions  and my ministerial colleagues sometimes gave  very

long  answers.   I  hope that Members  will  try  to  refrain

themselves and keep some of their supplementary questions for

other  occasions when they make their speeches  and  that  my

colleagues  will  also keep their answers short.   Otherwise,

even  with  the  additional half an hour Question  Time  many

questions may still not be reached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<div align="center"><b>UPSURGE IN OIL PRICES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  the upsurge in oil prices,  if  sustained,

will  (i)  affect economic growth for Singapore;  (ii)  exert

inflationary pressure; and (iii) lead Government to introduce

measures to curb oil-related consumption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what in his assessment are the various  effects  of

rising  oil  prices on the economy and its various  component

sectors, especially





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>





those  that  are  dependent on oil, such  as  transportation,

public utilities and manufacturing.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take

Question Nos 1 and 2 together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Oil prices have risen sharply

over  the  last two years, from a low of US$10 per barrel  in

January 1999 to a high of US$37 in September this year.  This

has  raised global concerns about the impact on inflation and

economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil shocks in 1974 and 1980 triggered global

slowdowns1.  However, the economic impact of the recent surge

in oil prices is likely to be much less severe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, energy conservation and the shift to

alternative fuels have made the global economy less dependent

on oil.  Since 1974, the oil consumption per unit of real GDP

has  fallen  by almost half in the US, EU and Japan,  and  by

about 30% in the rest of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the US$10 per barrel price in January 1999 was

abnormally low. The average price over the last 4  years  has

been US$18.  Compared to this, the present price of US$33  is

not very high.  Adjusted for inflation, the present price  is

only  two-thirds (62%) of the 1974 level, and one-third (35%)

of the 1980 level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies of the economic impact of high oil prices have

shown  that it should be quite small.  The OECD has estimated

that  a  US$10 increase would only raise inflation by 0.4-1.1

percentage  point  and lower real GDP by  0.2-0.5  percentage

point  in  the  US,  EU  and  Japan.   Similarly,  the  Asian

Development Bank (ADB) has projected that a price of US$35  a

barrel  for a year would reduce real GDP growth in the  world

by 0.2- 0.25 percentage point,

<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World  growth slowed from 6.9% in 1973 to 2.8% in  1974, and from 3.8% in 1979 to 2.3% in 1980.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>





and  in  Asia by 0.4-0.5 percentage point.  The IMF has  also

estimated  that  high  oil  prices  may  only  slice  0.3-0.5

percentage point off its world growth forecast of  4.2%  next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, although the surge in oil prices has

caused import prices to rise, CPI inflation has remained low.

CPI  has  only increased by 1.1% in the first 8  months  this

year.  There are several reasons for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, oil and related commodities account for only 10%

of the CPI basket in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, housing costs have been kept low by the weak

property rentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, market liberalisation measures and stronger

competition   have  kept  inflation  low   for   items   like

telecommunications and clothing.  MTI has estimated that even

if  oil  prices  stayed at US$35 for a year, Singapore's  CPI

inflation  would  only be pushed up by 0.5 percentage  point,

and GDP growth would be reduced by only 0.5 percentage point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the Singapore economy to perform well for the

rest  of  this  year and next, despite the high  oil  prices.

However, the impact of oil prices will vary among industries.

Industries  which  are more dependent on  oil,  such  as  oil

refining, petrochemicals, utility and transport, will be more

affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the oil refineries and petrochemicals industries,

increasing crude oil prices have raised raw material costs as

well  as  other  oil-related input costs such  as  transport,

electricity and fuel.  This has squeezed profit margins.   In

the  utility industry, the electricity tariff has had  to  be

revised  upwards  3  times this year  because  of  fuel  cost

increases.   In  transport, SBS,  TIBS  and  SMRT  have  Fuel

Equalisation  Funds (FEF), which are designed to  soften  the

impact  of sharp increases in fuel prices.  This has  enabled

them to put off fare increases in the short-term. But if fuel





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>





prices   stay  high,  eventually  fare  increases   will   be

unavoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Lim Hwee Hua has asked whether the Government will

introduce  measures  to  curb  oil-related  consumption.   At

present, there is no need for Government to ration usage,  as

the  cause of the oil hikes is mainly due to a surge in world

demand, rather than any supply disruption or shortage of oil.

The  higher prices will already help to reduce oil usage  and

choke off excessive consumption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I read in a

recent  press  report that some lecturers in the Econometrics

Department  of  the  National University  of  Singapore  have

actually  assessed that, with increasing oil prices  and  the

positive  impact on our neighbouring countries like  Malaysia

and  Indonesia which are oil-producing countries, it  may  in

fact  have a beneficial effect on Singapore.  What  does  the

Minister think about that assessment?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that would be

a consolation prize.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I

ask  whether  the  Government has taken note  of  the  rising

demands  in other countries for their governments to cut  the

duty or tax on fuel oil?  Has this Government considered  it?

Why is it not possible to reduce the tax or duty?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, we have a Question

further down on the Order Paper.  Unless the Minister  has  a

reply, I suggest we wait till we come to that Question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  he will impose a cap, in absolute dollar  terms,  on

the  ad  valorem  duty  imposed on  petrol  prices  which  is

currently pegged on percentage basis, so as to alleviate the

sectors.

whether  he  will lower the ad valorem duty on  fuel  oil  to

mitigate the effects of a rise in oil prices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in

view  of  the  increase in oil prices, whether the  utilities

rebates for low-income families will be enhanced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  the  Government will take measures to  mitigate  the

rising  utilities bill to reduce the cost of living  pressure

on households.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  may I have your permission to  take  Question

Nos. 3 to 6 together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Ong and Mr Leong have asked

that  the  Government lower petrol duty to mitigate the  cost

pressures on the economy, by lowering the ad valorem rate  or

placing a cap on petrol duty.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first point out that at present customs duty is

imposed only on petrol. There is no tax on diesel fuel or jet

fuel. There is also no tax on fuel used for the generation of

electricity. The impact of customs duty on the cost of public

transportation, commercial traffic and household  electricity

bills  is thus very limited. Our petrol tax is used primarily

as  a traffic management tool. It amounted to $466 million in

FY99.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to lower the duty on petrol or put a

cap on it. For a typical 1.6 litre car in Singapore, even  at

present  prices, petrol duties paid as a percentage of  total

operating  cost  of the car is only 5%. Our pump  prices  and

petrol  duty  are not excessive compared with those  of  many

other  countries. For example, in the UK, the price per litre

of  petrol  is about S$2.22. In South Korea it is S$1.98,  in

France  S$1.97.  In  Singapore the  average  price  is  about

S$1.50. In Malaysia and Indonesia the retail prices of petrol

are  lower,  but  that is because of heavy subsidies  by  the

governments as they are oil-producing countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for petrol duty, at 40% ad valorem, Singapore's rate

is  lower than all the European countries and Australia. Only

the US is lower2. Pump prices of petrol

and  diesel oil also do not fluctuate as widely as crude  oil

prices. In fact, when crude oil prices increased by 26%  from

US$25  in December last year to US$32 in September this year,

average  pump  prices of petrol increased by only  15%,  from

S$1.23 to S$1.42 per litre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not place a cap on petrol duty on previous

occasions,  when oil prices rose sharply, and  were  in  real

terms  much higher than today. I therefore do not see a  need

to do so now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong and Mr Low have also asked the Government to

consider measures to help households cope with rising utility

bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last sitting of Parliament, Minister George Yeo

gave  a  full explanation of the measures the Government  has

taken. To help lower-income households cope with the changes,

the  Government  has granted them rebates  on  their  utility

bills.  This  year, the rebate is $200 for 1- to  3-room  HDB

flats and $100 for 4-room flats.  The amount will be credited

to  their utilities accounts in mid-October this year. For 1- to  3-room HDB households, the $200 rebate is more  than  the

average  annual  increase in utility bills.  For  4-room  HDB

households,  the  $100  rebate  is  about  half  the  average

increase  in  utility bills. In addition the  Government  has

also  given service and conservancy charge rebates for  these

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rebates help the lower income households to cope

with  price  increases. Overall, despite the higher  oil  and

electricity prices, CPI inflation will be less than  2%  this

year,  including for the lower income households.  Therefore,

while  the  price increases are not welcome, they should  not

cause significant hardship or disruption to households.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should see the current oil price levels in

perspective, and should not over-react to them.  As  a  price

taker  who  imports all our oil, we cannot  shield  ourselves

from  global  fluctuations  in  oil  prices.  Nor  should  we

subsidise the consumption of oil or electricity, not even  by

lower income households. But we will





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>





help  them in other ways. If the economy continues to perform

well,  in  future budgets we will again be in a  position  to

consider further rebates for lower income households.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I would like to know

from  the  Minister  for Finance whether in  calculating  the

rebates  on  utility  bills he would take  into  account  the

average  utility  bill size, besides the  recent  fuel  price

increase, the water conservation tax as well as the  increase

in  water-borne  fee.   These add up to quite  a  substantial

increase  compared to the old charges.  How  is  the  average

bill size arrived at, and what is the average?



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not have the detailed

figures but I am assuming that the figures I gave Members for

the  utility charges would include the size of utility  bills

borne  by  the various family sizes.  So they should  account

for  all  the  changes that take place.  But  if  the  Member

wishes, I will send him the details of the breakdown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Based on my rough calculation on the

old  charges,  a 3-room HDB household has an average  utility

bill  of  about  $80 to $90.  Currently, it is being  charged

$127.   Does the Minister for Finance think that the  current

rebate given to lower income households is sufficient?



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Why do you not let me have your

calculation?  We will make a reconciliation with our figures?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I come back to my question, Mr

Speaker,  which  was  asked earlier?   As  I  understand  the

Minister, the duty on petrol is to control the number of cars

on  the  road.  May I ask whether this has had an impact  and

whether  there has been a reduction in the number of vehicles

on the road as a result of the duty?



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It has a contributory effect. We

have  a package of measures to regulate the growth and  usage

of  cars  in  Singapore.  The most important is  the  capital

cost, which





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>





includes import duties, additional registration fee and  COE.

So  the capital cost of a car is substantial. As I have  said

earlier,  petrol duty accounts for only 5% of  the  operating

cost  of a typical 1.6 litre car.  It is therefore relatively

insignificant.  For example, a 1.6 litre Toyota  Corolla  car

could  cost  $96,000.  The capital charge would therefore  be

large relative to the cost of petrol duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask whether if that is the

position.   Why is it not considered feasible to  reduce  the

petrol tax?  It seems that it does not really have any  great

effect on controlling the number of cars on the road.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I did not say that it does not

have  any  impact.  The capital cost of cars  influences  the

increase in car population.  But the price of petrol helps to

regulate  the  use of cars which are already in  the  market.

The  high  cost of cars influences the increase  in  the  car

population whereas the cost of petrol influences the usage of

cars.

<div align="center"><b>'BABY BONUS' SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Inclusion of first child and effective date)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he

will  consider granting the 'Baby Bonus' to include the first

child, and whether the effective date for this scheme will be

the date of announcement instead of 1st April 2001.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng) (for the Prime Minister):</b> The Total Fertility Rate or TFR was

1.48  in  1999.  In other words, on average, each Singaporean

woman  was having at least one child.  Therefore, it  is  not

necessary  to provide incentives for the birth of  the  first

child.   The  "baby bonus" and other pro-family measures  are

meant  to  encourage married couples to go on to  have  their

second  and  third  child  if  they  can  afford  to  do  so.

Nonetheless, the baby bonus which will be given for the birth

of  the  second and third child will help defray total family

expenses  and  benefit  all  the  children  in  the   family,

including the first child.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effective date has been decided after taking into

consideration the time for families to respond  to  the  call

for bigger families. There is no one date, which will satisfy

all  parties.   Even if it were effective from  the  date  of

announcement, there would still be those who will miss it  by

a day. As the Prime Minister in his National Day Rally Speech

indicated,  Government  has  been  generous  in  setting  the

effective  date as 1st April 2001 to cater to  early  babies.

Technically,  it  should  be nine months  from  the  date  of

announcement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Will the Minister

clarify whether the "baby bonus" would be given to those  who

conceived after the announcement but deliver before 1st April

2001 due to unforeseen premature births?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is very

difficult  to be precise as to the date of conception.   Some

allowance has already been provided in the announcement  that

it will be effective from 1st April 2001.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether it is unfair

to  these  couples who have responded to the call for  having

more children after the Prime Minister's announcement and yet

be  deprived  of the "baby bonus" because of nature  and  not

through the fault of their own?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Sir, it is not a matter of fairness.

We   have  to  look  at  this  "baby  bonus"  in  its  proper

perspective.  It is an encouragement to families to have more

children.   We cannot count every dollar and cent as  to  who

would  benefit and who would not.  As in drawing a  date  for

the effective implementation of this "baby bonus", there will

be some who will miss it even by a second.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Can I ask the Minister why

are they so clinical?  Why can we not be more generous, since

people are responding to the call?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> We are not trying to be clinical. We

are trying to set a date for implementation.  As I said in my

earlier





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



answer,  even  if we set the effective date at the  point  of

time  when  the  Prime Minister made the  announcement,  some

people will still miss it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister not think that

parents  who do not need encouragement but already have  more

children in contributing to the population growth should also

be given some rewards?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we should look at

this  in its proper perspective.  We have a falling fertility

rate.   What  Government can do is to offer incentives  as  a

signal  to  the  people that we encourage  families  to  have

children.  As I said, it is not a question of whether  it  is

fair  or  not fair, whether we are being unfair to those  who

have children of their own accord naturally, even without the

encouragement.   It  is  to address  a  national  problem  of

declining birth rates, the consequence of which we  will  see

only  many years from now.  Look at these measures  that  the

Government  has announced as an encouragement, signalling  to

the  people that we should have marriage and procreation, and

that this is good for the future of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

"baby  bonus" is geared towards encouraging the  families  to

have  more babies, but it should not be confined to  monetary

measures only.  Concessions in childcare centres and priority

in  housing should be given as incentives for them to produce

a  second  or  a third baby to fulfil the goal of  the  Prime

Minister.  Has the Government considered these measures?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Some of the measures to encourage

couples  to have children have been announced.  I  know  that

there  are many other suggestions that people would  have  on

how  we  can give further encouragement to couples to do  so.

The  measures  which   Mr Ang mentioned  will  be  considered

together with all other suggestions that we have





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>





received  from  the public.  I would like  to  encourage  all

Members   and  members  of  the  public  to  send  in   their

suggestions.   All  of  them would be  considered  for  their

practicality  in  a holistic manner and not on  a  one-by-one

basis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I suggest another important incentive,

ie,  to  encourage  young  married couples  to  start  having

children  earlier  in order to address the present  trend  of

later marriages and postponement of having children?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> If the Member has effective

suggestions  as to how to encourage people to  marry  younger

and have children younger, please forward the suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, even if our parliamentary colleagues are

going  to give suggestions on the issue of "baby bonus",  the

support from Government is just lukewarm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Vasoo, are you asking a supplementary

question or you are asking the next question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I am trying to ask the Minister whether

he  would  relook  at the whole issue by encouraging  younger

people  to have family formation and see whether we could  be

more  generous by looking at other incentives which would  be

necessary to support population growth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the cost of raising

children  varies from family to family but I hear  that  many

people  think  it  is  not  expensive.   Whatever  bonus   or

incentive  that the Government gives to couples  for  raising

their  children cannot fully cover the total cost of  raising

those  children.   As  I  said, the measures  are  really  to

signal,  to encourage, and not to pay for the full  costs  of

bringing up children.  It is not a simple subject why  people

marry earlier and have more children, and why other people do

not.  So over the next few months, maybe even years, we would

have to consider all the various aspects of this issue, learn

from the experience of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>





other countries, find out what works and what does not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more difficult area to consider would be the social

changes  that have taken place in society, not only  in  ours

but  I  think  worldwide, and whether those  changes  can  be

reversed.  It has to do with the values that people hold  and

when  we  talk  about  the  subject of  marriage  and  family

formation,  we are really going back to the old fundamentals.

As  I said, if there are good ideas and viewpoints as to  how

we  can do it, and do an effective job of getting more babies

born,  please  let  us  have these suggestions  and  we  will

consider  them carefully and, in due course, perhaps  another

set of incentives could be announced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we have enough baby talk for one

day.  Can you ask the next question, Dr Vasoo?

families  own  their first homes.  Under the Special  Housing

Assistance  Programme  (SHAP), the monthly  household  income

ceiling  for the 3-Room Buy-Back Scheme and Rent and Purchase

Scheme has been raised from $1,500 to $2,000.  Similarly, the

monthly  household  income ceiling for the Low-Income  Family

Incentive  Scheme,  an  easy mortgage  loan  scheme  for  the

purchase  of  4-room budget or smaller HDB  flats,  has  been

raised from $1,500 to $2,000.

family  living,  HDB also allows multi-tier families  with  a

total household income of up to $12,000 per month to purchase

a subsidised flat from HDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current income ceilings are adequate to cater to the

<div align="center"><b>MEDISHIELD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Age of coverage)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Health if his

Ministry  has  any  plan to raise the  age  of  coverage  for

MediShield.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my  Ministry is aware that with longer life expectancy,

there  would be a need to raise the maximum coverage age  for

MediShield.    As  such,  there  have  been  regular   upward

revisions  in the maximum coverage age.  When MediShield  was

first  introduced in 1990, the maximum coverage age  was  65.

This was subsequently raised to 70 in 1992, and 75 in 1996.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the maximum coverage age for MediShield is 75,

there  are  other  Medisave-approved insurance  schemes  that

offer insurance coverage up till age 80.  Such schemes ensure

that  Singaporeans have a choice of being insured beyond  age

75, if they wish to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, my Ministry would like to assure the Member

that  we  are  reviewing MediShield's  maximum  coverage  age

limit, and will raise it if necessary, to keep pace with  the

longer life expectancy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister if it is correct to

say  that  we  are pegging the age of coverage of  MediShield

with  the  life expectancy of Singaporeans.  As Singaporeans'

life expectancy has





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>





increased,  should not this age of coverage be  increased  in

tandem?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I would not use the word "pegging".

I  think  we  will  review  and  increase  the  coverage  age

accordingly as the life expectancy of Singaporeans  has  also

increased.  But I would not use the word "pegging".  It would

not have a direct linkage as a peg.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> As the life expectancy of Singaporeans has

increased  to about 80, why are we still sticking  on  to  75

years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When MediShield was introduced in

1992,  I  do not think the life expectancy was only 70  then.

So  there was no implicit or explicit linkage or peg  between

the MediShield coverage age and the life expectancy.  We want

to  make  sure  that  the  MediShield  coverage  is  sensible

compared  to the life span of Singaporeans.  So there  was  a

general  move  that  as the life expectancy  of  Singaporeans

increases,  we  should look at the coverage  and  extend  the

coverage age of the MediShield scheme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether there is a

need  to  review  the quantum of coverage for  MediShield  in

keeping  with  the  rising medical costs?   Is  the  existing

coverage  adequate  for  those  who  have  to  fall  back  on

MediShield?  Has there been a study done on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We are in the process of reviewing

the  coverage.   But  I  must  stress  that  the  reason  why

MediShield   works  is  that  it  is  a  very  well   defined

catastrophic insurance scheme.  We have contributions of  co-insurance  and  also  a high deductible  so  as  to  make  it

affordable.   There is no free lunch.  If  you  want  a  more

extensive medical insurance coverage, then the premiums  will

have to go up.  So we always have to strike a balance between

adequate coverage as well as affordable premiums.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND ACCOUNTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Payment of mortgages)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower,

with  the  proposed adjustments to the contribution rates  to

the  Central Provident Fund's Special and Medisave  Accounts,

whether  there is any plan to help those who have not  enough

savings in their Ordinary Account to pay for their mortgages.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the CPF Board has consulted HDB on the  impact

of the total CPF allocation rates on the affordability of HDB

flats  prior to the announcement of the changes (I  refer  to

the  changes for the Special Account and the Medisave Account

contribution rates).  Sir, the conclusion is that the changes

to  the Special Account and Medisave allocation will not have

a  significant  impact on first time HDB  buyers.   The  vast

majority  of  the first time 4- and 5-room flat  buyers  will

still  be  able to service their entire mortgage  instalments

from their Ordinary Account contributions.  Some first time 3-room  flat  buyers may need to pay a small  amount  of  their

mortgage instalments in cash. This amounts to typically  less

than  10% of their monthly household income and is manageable

for most households.  Upgraders will also face minimal impact

as  they  can use the proceeds from the sale of their earlier

flat to offset the price of their new flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there are measures in place to help CPF

members  who have difficulty paying for their mortgages.  The

various housing assistance measures, which were introduced to

help   members   affected  by  the  cut  in  employers'   CPF

contribution  in January 1999, are still in  place  and  will

remain so until the CPF cut is fully restored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition, the Government had announced that from

1st  October 2000, all young couples buying a 4-room HDB flat

can  pay  their  20%  downpayment in  two  instalments.   The

Government  has also made available an additional $26 million

per year to help low-income





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>LIBERALISATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Compensation to SingTel and StarHub)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology if he will quantify

the  benefits to be derived from faster liberalisation of the

telecommunications industry and the $1.94 billion paid out to

SingTel and StarHub.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology how the  Government

justifies the payment to SingTel and StarHub for ending their

licences prematurely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, may I have your

permission to take Question Nos. 11 and 12 together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the Government is committed to

introducing  full market competition in the telecoms  sector.

Competition  spurs  innovation, raises  efficiency,  improves

services  and  lowers prices to the benefit  of  the  people,

public and businesses.  Advancing full market competition  is

necessary  because  the openness of the  telecoms  regulatory

environment  has  become  a  key  factor  in  attracting  new

investments.   We must therefore have a globally  competitive

telecoms  market, with many players offering a wide range  of

innovative, high quality and cost effective services.    This

is  the  rationale for the accelerated liberalisation of  the

telecoms market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a serious and responsible Government, we

also recognise our earlier commitment to SingTel and





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>





StarHub  to  maintain a duopoly until 1st  April  2002.   Our

decision  to bring forward full liberalisation would  have  a

significant impact on their business, investment and  rollout

plans.  We must thus be fair to both SingTel and StarHub, and

compensate  them accordingly for any potential  loss  of  net

revenue from the earlier introduction of competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure transparency and objectivity in deriving the

compensation  figures,  IDA hired a third  party  consultant,

Deloitte  Consulting.  Deloitte Consulting took a  discounted

cash flow approach to determine the net revenue positions  of

SingTel  and StarHub, under the two scenarios of  a  two-year

duopoly  and  accelerated liberalisation.  Specifically,  the

analysis is restricted to public basic telecoms services,  or

PBTS,   and   excludes   other  services   such   as   mobile

communications and Internet access services because these are

already open to full competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forecasts made by Deloitte Consulting were based upon

both  the historical growth in Singapore and in consideration

of  overseas  experience based on information available  from

research  organisations, regulators, and investment analysts.

It is with such detailed analysis that the final compensation

figures  of  $859 million for SingTel and $1,082 billion  for

StarHub were derived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted that these figures were

derived  objectively and are fair and reasonable.  The  long-term  benefits brought about by full liberalisation will  far

exceed  the compensations paid to these two companies.   Some

of  the  benefits are already evident today.   Within  a  few

months  of liberalisation, IDA has issued more than  150  new

telecoms licences.  These new entrants are expected to invest

a  total of $3 billion in Singapore by the year 2003.   These

investments would strengthen the capacity and quality of  our

national   information  infrastructure,  as   well   as   our

connectivity   to   the  regional  and   global   information

infrastructures.   Let  me  illustrate.   Singapore's  global

connectivity is set to increase to 15 Terabits per





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>





second  over  the  next  18 to 36 months.   This  is  a  huge

increase  of  300 times compared to only 50 Gbps  early  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition has also benefited businesses and consumers,

by  bringing  about lower prices, faster pace of  innovation,

and better quality of service.  As an example, IDD rates have

fallen by an average of 20% and up to as much as 60%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, put in perspective, the payments of $1.94 billion

as  compensations to SingTel and StarHub are essential to the

strengthening of Singapore's economic competitiveness in  the

era  of the New Economy, while preserving the credibility  of

Singapore  as  a  leading  investment  location  for   global

leaders.  As  is evident, earlier liberalisation  and  keener

competition  have  indeed reaped benefits not  just  for  our

economy  as  a whole, but also for individual businesses  and

consumers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, is it true that

the  total amount of compensation is now less because  it  is

tax exempt?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the figure of $1.94 billion is

net  of tax, that means, if it was liable for tax, you  would

have  to gross it up further.  So this is the figure that  is

net of tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why was it found necessary to assure

SingTel  and StarHub that there will be no players until  1st

April 2002?  Would they not have come into the market without

that assurance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, that was part of the commitment

given  by  the  Government when we invited  tenders  for  the

establishment of the second public basic telecoms service  in

1996.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the reason is very simple. The

establishment of a second fixed line network involves a  huge

investment.  In the case of StarHub, the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>





commitment is $2.6 billion.  To ensure that we have a  viable

business model and to ensure that there are enough interested

companies,  the  Government therefore made a commitment  that

the  investor would have a two-year grace period in which  to

build  up market share and to ensure that they can derive  an

economic return from this huge investment.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask  the  Minister, with this payment  to  StarHub,  what

assurance is there that the fixed line operators would  still

be  more  than  one, in other words, that StarHub  would  not

perform  its  role in a perfunctory way by offering  a  token

service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in the first place, IDA has

already  informed StarHub that it is obliged to roll out  its

network, as committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, having invested so much money, $2.6 billion in

the  system eventually, I do not think any company would want

to  just offer a perfunctory service and collect very minimal

revenue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister says that at the point

of  tender, to ensure commitment, the Government allowed them

to monopolise the market up to 2002.  My question is, why did

the  Government, at that point in time, fail to see the  need

to  liberalise the telecommunications market and allow  these

two  companies to monopolise the market up to 2002 and,  now,

suddenly,  discovered that there is a need to liberalise  the

market  for the benefit of the nation, and thereby  about  $2

billion  is needed to pay out from the Government's  coffers?

Is  this the result of the Government failing to foresee what

is happening in the future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it is very easy at this point

in  time,  having  seen all the rapid liberalisations  taking

place around the world, to say that the decision in 1997  was

perhaps  faulty.  We have to bring ourselves back  to  1995-6

when  most of the global telecoms market was still not  fully

liberalised and, therefore, setting a





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>





timeframe  of 2002 at that point in time was already  a  very

aggressive timetable.  So it is not that we did not have  the

foresight.   We  knew  that there was  liberalisation  taking

place,  which was why we moved up the date for liberalisation

or the introduction of competition by seven years for SingTel

from  2007  to 2000.  But in order to attract a  new  serious

player  into  this market of public basic telecoms  services,

which  involves such a huge investment, companies would  want

to ensure that there are certain safeguards in order to build

their  market share before prices start collapsing  with  the

introduction of full competition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to find

out from the Minister whether he considers it staggering that

the  loss of monopoly over two years for the industry amounts

to a net revenue of $1.9 billion.  In my mind, there are very

few industries that if they lose a monopoly for two years, it

will  come to that amount.  Would he agree that perhaps  this

number shows that Singaporean consumers have been paying  too

much for their fixed-line service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the figure would appear

staggering  and, I am sure, to many people, it is staggering.

But  then, one must also consider that SingTel's profit  each

year exceeds a billion dollars.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> That is precisely my point, Sir,

that,  as  a monopoly, SingTel's profit is outrageous.   And,

the Government, being a regulator, perhaps had not been doing

a very good job by allowing SingTel to make so much money out

of Singaporeans through the use of telephones.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, global practice, prior to this

time, has been for national telecoms monopolies and, in fact,

in  most countries of the world, the norm is still a national

telecoms  monopoly.  Of course, because we are  part  of  the

global  network  and we want to be a knowledge-based  economy

and  we  also want to be a telecoms and business hub for  the

region, we have no choice but to open up the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>





telecoms  market  as rapidly as possible in order  to  ensure

that  the new investments that are being considered  for  the

region will now come to Singapore or, at least, much of those

investments   in  the  pipeline,  will  come  to   Singapore.

Therefore,  the  price of $2 billion, in the context  of  the

overall economic development, is a small price to pay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Two questions for

the Minister.

The first is that the Minister has explained the promise that

was  given of a duopoly to StarHub and the fact that StarHub,

based on this, has committed to certain investments.  But how

does  the  logic  apply to SingTel, given  that  SingTel  was

already  first  a  monopoly,  and  has  already  made   those

investments?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is more general, regarding

duopolies.  The Government has also recently announced  plans

to   basically  create  a  duopoly  of  competition  for  the

newspaper  media and television media.  Looking  forward,  is

there  a  danger that we have to liberalise this sector  more

quickly  and we end up in another position where  we  end  up

paying compensation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the reason for having to

compensate  SingTel  too  is  that  we  have  made  a  public

commitment that there will be a duopoly for two years,  which

means  that  SingTel would have also gone ahead to  make  its

investments  on  that basis.  So, therefore, the  commitment,

although not explicit to SingTel, is an implicit one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the duopoly of newspaper and television

media,  I  would suggest that he raise the question  with  my

colleague.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, two supplementary

questions  for  the Minister.  One, is to follow  up  on  the

StarHub  payment.   The Minister says that  StarHub  will  be

committing more than $2 billion into infrastructure.  Shortly

after  the  announcement that the Minister  would  liberalise

telecommunications, they announced that they  would  withdraw

their





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>





investments.  So are they now committed again to  putting  in

that  investment for the more than $2 billion they originally

were committed to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question, Sir, is about the monopoly. If the

Minister  is stepping back by liberalising and by emphasising

self-regulation in all these public announcements, how is  it

going to be possible for self-regulation in a market which is

so dominated by one player still?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> In reply to his first question, no,

StarHub  will  not be reneging on its investment  commitment.

It is still required to roll out the local network and we are

in  discussion  now  with  Starhub  on  their  plan  and  the

schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second part, that with such a dominant

player, how can self-regulation work, there is still  a  need

for  a  regulator, which is why we have IDA.  IDA will remain

as  the  telecoms regulator to ensure that there is no  anti-competitive   behaviour  by  the  dominant  player   and   to

facilitate the smooth development of the entire industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister has spoken of accelerated

liberalisation  and  the benefits that  are  to  be  derived.

Would he tell us how many players are queuing up for licences

to be issued?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I have answered just now in my

main answer that IDA has already, in the short period of time

since I announced the move to liberalise,  issued a total  of

150  new  telecoms  licences, and  these  would  comprise  11

facilities-based  service  providers  and  130  service-based

operators.

<div align="center"><b>(Performance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry how the small and medium enterprises are faring





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>





in  the  present economic recovery and whether there will  be

indicators for the SME and local economy, in addition to  the

gross national economic indicators.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, SMEs are

enjoying  better  business growth in line  with  the  overall

economic  recovery from the Asian crisis.  For instance,  the

turnover  of  SMEs  in the services sector has  rebounded  by

12.4%  in 1999 from the decline of 7.9% in 1998.  Growth  has

remained strong at 9.6% in the first half of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the performance of SMEs is uneven and varies

across  industries.  In wholesale trade, SMEs as a group  are

enjoying  buoyant  business, while in construction  and  real

estate,  performance is still weak, reflecting the  different

pace  of  recovery  among  sectors.   Similarly,  within  the

manufacturing  sector, SMEs in fast-growing  industries  like

electronics are enjoying better business than those  in  slow

growing ones like ship-repair and furniture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for industries that are recovering, some SMEs

continue to face strong competitive pressures.  SMEs are also

more  dependent on the domestic and regional markets compared

to  the  MNCs.   For  instance,  in  the  food  manufacturing

industry,  feedback  from  the Singapore  Food  Manufacturers

Association  indicates that while business  has  improved  by

about 10% after the crisis, profitability has declined.  This

is due to higher operating costs and more intense competition

from lower cost food manufacturers in neighbouring countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our SMEs will have to find ways to increase efficiency

and  develop  higher value products that can  command  higher

price  premiums.   Fewer and fewer of  them  can  escape  the

challenge of globalization and the New Economy.  They have to

leverage   on  technology,  create  attractive   brands   and

packaging,  and  actively  pursue  alternative  markets   for

growth.  The Government has developed many





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>





programmes to help SMEs do this.  In fact, there are 60  such

programmes altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Productivity Board (PSB), in partnership

with the private sector, has developed SME 21, a new plan  to

accelerate   SMEs'  development  for  the  next   10   years.

Strategies  addressing the needs of SMEs at  the  enterprise,

industry  and broad-based levels would be rolled  out  within

the next two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay has also asked about the indicators for SMEs and

the  local economy.  Currently, although we have some  annual

and quarterly data of SMEs and local enterprises for selected

sectors   like  commerce  and  services,  we  do   not   have

comprehensive indicators. This is partly due to the resources

needed to gather statistics from SMEs, which number more than

100,000.    These   small   companies   also   have   greater

difficulties  than the larger firms in providing  timely  and

accurate  data.  However, PSB will work with DOS and  EDB  to

see  how  more  and  better indicators can  be  developed  to

monitor  the  performance of SMEs.   The  Singapore  Business

Federation, when it is formed, can also help to gather data.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the plan to consider giving more

data  and indicators for the SMEs is welcomed.  Can we expect

when this will be?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> As I said just now, PSB will have to

work with DOS and EDB on this because the number is very big,

more  than 100,000.  These SMEs have a problem with resources

and  we  have to wait until the end of the year for  them  to

submit  their report and from there, DOS will take  over  and

compile  the  data.   When  it is  ready,  we  will  make  an

announcement.

<div align="center"><b>WATER SUPPLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Contamination by sewage pipe leakage)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry what measures his Ministry is taking to ensure  that

the Public Utilities Board's water





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>





supply  will  not be contaminated by leakage of sewage  pipes

anywhere  in Singapore as had happened at the Sherwood  Tower

Condominium.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry what is his Ministry's view on the response  of  the

Public  Utilities Board to the contamination of  fresh  water

supply at the Sherwood Tower Condominium.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will take

Question Nos. 14 and 15 together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> The contamination of water supply in

Sherwood  Tower  Condominium on 22nd August  is  an  isolated

incident.   It  affected Bukit Timah Plaza,  which  comprises

Sherwood  Tower  Condominium, a shopping complex  and  eating

outlets.   Waste water from a corroded sanitary  pipe  seeped

into an uncovered water tank located below the sanitary pipe.

The  problem was confined to this 20-year-old building.   The

integrity of our public water supply system was not in doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When PUB and ENV were alerted to the problem, they

worked immediately with the managing agent of the building to

clean  and  disinfect  the  contaminated  water  reticulation

system.   ENV  also closed all food stalls in the  Plaza  and

advised  all residents to boil their water. The contamination

was  contained  and residents were provided with  alternative

water  supply through water tankers and nearby fire hydrants.

Water  supply  to  the  residents and  businesses  was  fully

restored  in the morning of 24th August. Continued monitoring

by  PUB  and  ENV  showed that the water  supply  within  the

building is now normal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General's Chambers is reviewing the case to

determine if the managing agent should be taken to  task  for

the failure to keep the water supply and sewerage systems  in

proper working order.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have specific regulatory requirements in our water

services,  sewerage and sanitary works to ensure safe  supply

of  water  to all buildings.  Our regulatory code  stipulates

that  water  tanks should not be located below  sewer  lines.

This  was  disallowed  since 1989  for  new  buildings.   The

requirement was not applied retrospectively to old  buildings

since  they  might not be adequately designed to comply  with

this  requirement.   Furthermore, such contamination  problem

would not have arisen if the sanitary pipes were kept in good

condition and the water tanks covered. The new rule  in  1989

was an added precautionary measure.  In view of the incident,

PUB  and  ENV  will  require old buildings to  take  adequate

measures to prevent a recurrence of the incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB and ENV have inspected 972 buildings of 10 years or

older.   The  water reticulation systems of  these  buildings

were found to be safe. The sanitary pipes and the water tanks

were  in  good  condition  and posed  no  risk.   49  of  the

buildings checked have sanitary pipes located above the water

tanks.  The  management corporations of these buildings  have

been  requested to divert the sanitary pipes or relocate  the

water tanks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, PUB has also instructed management

corporations  of  high-rise buildings to check  their  entire

water piping systems and water tanks to confirm that they are

in satisfactory condition and that unauthorised access to the

tanks  is  prevented.  They are to submit  a  report  by  end

October 2000 to PUB.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would like to ask the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary how did it come about that the design

of water tanks below the sewerage line came to be approved by

the   building  authorities.   Was  PUB  involved   in   such

approvals?  And of the 49 buildings which were found to  have

certain  problems, would he identify those buildings?   Would

he take action to inform residents of those buildings so that

if





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>





something happens in future, they will know something may  be

wrong with their water supply?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On compensation to the tenants, it was reported in the

newspapers  that the management corporation was  prepared  to

compensate  the tenants.  But in my mind, would  not  PUB  be

responsible  too  and would PUB be held  responsible  to  pay

compensation to the tenants as well because, after  all,  the

business relationship is between the tenant, someone who pays

for the water bill, and the water supplier, that is, PUB, and

not the management corporation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> Applications for installations of

water  tanks  and  water  pipes  have  to  be  submitted   by

professional engineers for approval.  In this case,  we  have

to see whether there is any alteration to the original plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 49 cases, I was informed that 15 out of these 49

cases,  in  fact, have plans to either relocate  their  water

tanks  or  make changes to their water pipes.  I think  their

water supply is normal and safe.  On compensation, it is  the

responsibility of the registered customer of  PUB  to  ensure

that the water piping system is in order.  This means that if

anything is not in order, the registered customer has to take

responsibility.  The compensation between the tenants and the

management  corporation is a matter for the  tenants  of  the

building and the management corporation to resolve.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> The Senior Parliamentary Secretary

said  that  once the problem was notified to the authorities,

they  took immediate action.  But to my mind, Sir,  the  time

lag  between notification and action seemed to be  too  long.

The  report was made by the doctor to the authorities and  by

the  time PUB took action, I believe there was a time lag  of

24  hours.  For your information, Sir, during those 24 hours,

I  was one of those invited guests to the dinner function  at

that particular location.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> From what I know, PUB and ENV were

alerted to this problem





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>





on  22nd  August  but apparently, the doctor discovered  this

problem on 18th August. So from 18th to 22nd August, it was a

matter  between the doctor and the management corporation  or

may  be the managing agent and the authorities, PUB and  ENV,

were not alerted to the problem.  On 22nd August, PUB and ENV

took  immediate  action  after  they  were  alerted  to  this

problem. So there is no lapse on the part of ENV and PUB.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I believe that the press report

said  there  was a laboratory test that PUB took and  it  was

after  the  laboratory  test confirmed  that  the  water  was

contaminated  that action was taken. So to  my  mind,  if  my

impression  was correct, there was indeed a time  lag  of  24

hours for the laboratory test to be confirmed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> From the report I have, PUB

immediately  took  action  when they  were  alerted  to  this

problem.

<div align="center"><b>MAERSK'S SHIFT TO TANJUNG PELEPAS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact on Port of Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology what is the  impact

of  Maersk's shift to Tg Pelepas on the Port of Singapore and

what  plans the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore  has

to improve our port competitiveness.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Maersk Sealand is reported to

have  taken  up  a  30% equity stake in the Port  of  Tanjung

Pelepas  (PTP). As such, it has indicated that it  will  move

its  hubbing  operations to PTP by the end of  the  year.  In

1999,  the  shipping line accounted for about  11%  of  PSA's

throughput or 1.7 million TEUs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maersk's move to PTP is a commercial decision on its

part.  Apart from being a major global shipping line,  Maersk

runs many dedicated shipping terminals around the world. This

move by Maersk must, therefore, be viewed in that context. It

does  not  reflect a lack of competitiveness on the  part  of

PSA.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All over the world, whenever new ports come on stream,

they  take  market  share from existing  players.   One  such

example was when the South China ports of Yantian, Shekou and

Chiwan  were  developed a few years ago.  However,  as  trade

volume grew, a new equilibrium was soon established, and Hong

Kong terminals continue to grow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With charges at about a third to a half of those for

ports in Hong Kong, Japan, Europe and the United States,  PSA

remains  the world's leading port in terms of competitiveness

and  the  value that it provides to its customers.  PSA  does

not compete on price alone.  It intends to retain its premier

position  through even better services and greater efficiency

to  meet  the  needs of its customers.  For example,  PSA  is

helping  its customers enter the world of e-commerce, through

its  Portnet system. This system enables all players  in  the

global  shipping  community to make  paperless  and  seamless

integrated transactions with each other effortlessly, and  at

the lowest costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a premier port, one must have superb shipping

connectivity and frequency.  PSA has, through its high levels

of  efficiency  and  service, built  an  unrivalled  shipping

network   of  120  container  shipping  lines  that  connects

Singapore  to over 500 ports.  This has enabled PSA  to  move

15.9  million TEUs last year.  For this year, it  expects  to

move  over 17 million TEUs. Many of the major shipping  lines

are  increasing their throughput through PSA by  double-digit

growth.   This is a strong reaffirmation in PSA's  value-for-money services by its customers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) has

adopted  various  measures to enhance the competitiveness  of

the  Port of Singapore over the years. Since May 1996, it has

granted  concessions of 20% on port dues for container  ships

using  our  port.   It  has also fully deregulated  tug  boat

services within our port waters, to give shipping lines  more

choices that offer more competitive rates.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA has developed electronic services such as the

MARINET and the Singapore Maritime Portal to speed up various

statutory  clearance  processes.   Combined  with  a   strong

commitment  to high standards, these and other measures  have

helped to ensure that the Port of Singapore is able to  offer

cost-competitive services of the highest quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA is also working closely with other relevant

Government agencies such as TDB and MAS to develop  Singapore

into  an International Maritime Centre (IMC).  These agencies

work  in  close consultation with the shipping  community  to

develop  our expertise and build up our critical market  mass

in  the  areas of ship financing, marine insurance,  maritime

arbitration, ship management and repairing, and shipbuilding.

The agencies will continually assess, evaluate and re-examine

our  policies  to align them to the emerging industry  trends

and ensure that we remain competitive.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I have two supplementary

questions  for the Minister.  First, it was common knowledge,

before the move, that both Maersk and NOL were looking at the

PTP.  Would the Minister explain whether the move was because

PSA did not act fast enough, eg, cutting prices before Maersk

moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is trite wisdom that if you cannot beat them,

you  join them.  Since PTP is looking for investments,  would

PSA consider buying a stake in PTP?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, negotiations between PSA and its

shipping  lines'  clients  are commercial  issues  which  the

Government does not get involved in.  I believe PSA has  been

in  close  contact  with all the shipping  lines  and  it  is

dedicated  and committed to giving cost competitive services,

not  just in terms of the charges for lifting the containers,

but  also through the provision of other value added services

as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to PSA taking a stake in PTP, I think

this  is an issue for PSA to decide upon, and I believe  this

issue has





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>





now been settled by Maersk taking up a 30% stake.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I think the Minister

is  aware  that  the Tanjung Pelepas Port won a  major  award

recently  at  some international shipping conference  as  the

most  improved port.  Coupled with the fact that it is  going

to  be  managed  by  Maersk Lines, I would say  that  Tanjung

Pelepas will, in fact, pose very serious competition  to  the

Port of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this move by Maersk Line, the volume of the port

seems  to  be substantially affected.  Will this  affect  the

time table for the initial public offer of PSA?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, with regard to strong

competition posed by PTP, PSA is used to competition, because

there are already many well-established ports such as in Hong

Kong  and in the region which PSA has to compete against  for

transhipment business.  Much of the business that PSA handles

are  transhipment  containers, and they do  not  need  to  be

transhipped  in  Singapore.  They can be transhipped  at  any

port   along   the  route  taken  by  the  container   lines.

Therefore,  PSA  is quite used to competition  and  with  the

development of PTP and with the involvement of Maersk in PTP,

I am sure PSA will now be even more attentive to competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the date for the flotation of PSA, I

think  this  is an issue which Temasek Holdings has  to  deal

with, and that comes under the Ministry of Finance.

<div align="center"><b>OPPOSITION MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Disallowing of speech-making at constituency dinner)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs why an opposition Member of Parliament is not allowed

to  make a speech at a dinner organised by his party, held at

his constituency, when the Government is promoting freedom of

speech by opening a Speakers' Corner.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the

Police  has  reviewed  its policy and has  decided  to  allow

Elected  Members  of  Parliament  to  make  speeches  in  the

constituencies in which they were elected if their speech  is

part of a constituency event organised for the benefit of the

constituents  and  where the intended participants  are  from

that constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, is this policy

intended  to  gag  the  Opposition?  The  Minister  of  State

mentioned "if it is organised as part of a constituency event

.". Of course, the dinner organised by my Party is part of  a

constituency  activity, and yet I was not allowed  to  speak.

Sir, as far as I know, I was not given permission to speak.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, to repeat the answer, the

policy  has  just been changed.   But, of course, the  Police

will  have to look at the event.  We have said that the event

should  be  a constituency event, in other words, a community

event.  The idea here is that a local MP who has been elected

by his ward's constituents should have enough support so that

the potential mischief and law and order problems that in the

past  have  persuaded Police not to grant a permit  will  not

apply.   He  is  a  local MP in a local  community  event   - events  that those of us on the ground will be quite familiar

with,  ie, karaoke, magic show, puppet show, etc, and if  the

local  MP  wants to speak, the Police will say,  "carry  on",

because he is speaking to his own constituents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, this is the first time I am

having  this  knowledge.  Up to last month, we  were  refused

permission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to seek clarification

from  the  Minister of State.  He said "elected MP".   Is  he

saying  that  besides the MP, others who are  from  the  same

Party will not be allowed to speak at the event?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the answer is very

clear.  The context is that





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>





the local MP who has been elected by the residents can make a

speech  in a community event.  If somebody who is not elected

by the residents in that ward comes, he is making a political

speech.   He  is not making a speech in a community  setting.

Sir, that will not be allowed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, does this apply to a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the answer is very clear.

It  applies  only to MPs who have been elected  to  represent

constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I clarify two points? Firstly,

if the event is organised by a political party rather than  a

constituency,  does  it mean that it  will  not  be  allowed?

Secondly,  is  there  any duty on the  organising  people  to

ensure that constituents from neighbouring constituencies  do

not come to the event?  Obviously, in the second case, it  is

going  to  be very difficult to check people if it is  a  fun

fair or an event.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the intention, as I have

said  just  now, is that it is a local community  event,  for

example, a block party where residents will come down.   When

you  organise  the  event,  your  target  audience  will   be

residents in the block.  And I do know, so also those  of  us

who  know  the  ground, that people from other constituencies

would not come and attend such a function.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my answer to the second question. What is the

first question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I asked whether it makes a difference if

an event is organised by a political party.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Again, the context is that it

must  be  a  community event, a local event,  meant  for  the

residents.   I  know  that some MPs,  for  example,  organise

events on the ground through the town council.  For the  town

council, the rule applies and the MP has to make an





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>





application.  In the past, even for Opposition town councils,

speeches have been allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Low Thia Khiang organises an event, for example,

and  I think he has organised many events in his constituency

under the Hougang Constituency Committee, we all know that Mr

Low  Thia  Khiang is behind it.  If it is an MP who organises

the  event for his residents, Police will look at what is the

context of the event.  The context is important, because when

the  context  is a local community event, the  fears  of  the

Police  in  the  past  concerning  a  political  rally  where

potential   law   and  order  problems  may  arise,   because

disaffection   from   the  crowd   may   arise,   all   these

considerations are absent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, it seems to me that the

Minister  of State keeps on stressing "community event".   Is

he  implying  that  such speech should not be  political  and

confined only to community events, like greetings?   Is  that

what he means?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> When you are an MP, you are

elected.   And  when you go to grassroots events  and  events

like  that, you will talk to residents.  You tell them  about

how  well you have done in your ward, what are the plans  you

have for the ward.  I think that is the context in which this

relaxation has come about, so that as an elected MP, when you

want  to  go  to the ground and talk to your residents  in  a

setting like this, you can because, after all, you have  been

elected by them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State if,

in that sense, the policy has not changed, because Mr Chiam's

question here, as posed, the event is organised by his party.

Am I correct, therefore, that if this question is still posed

today, he will not be allowed?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I have said, he has to

make  an  application.  It is not for the Ministry to decide.

Police will





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>





look   at  the  application  and  see  whether  or  not   the

considerations in the past that applied will still  apply  in

the  context  of a big political event.  Take Mr  Chiam,  for

example,  who  held his National Day Dinner in  Potong  Pasir

which  he  had done in September, he made the application  in

July.   I  understand  that it was a very  big  function  and

outsiders also came.  So members of the SPP would also  come.

The  Police would look at it and see whether it is  indeed  a

local  community  event that falls within the  ambit  of  the

relaxation.  It is not a consideration that we will make, but

Police  will  make that in the light of why such events  were

not  allowed  in the past and why the rule is  being  relaxed

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I get further clarification?

I  still  think that there is no change of policy.  In  other

words, if the function is organised by a political party,  it

will  not  be allowed, unless it is organised by a grassroots

or a community organisation.  Am I right?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Right now, if Mr Chiam

organises an event, which is not a town council event, it  is

an  event  like a magic show, lantern festival or  children's

party, the current restriction applies to such events.  If it

is  in  the  open,  Mr Chiam, even as an MP,  cannot  make  a

speech.  Now, there is a relaxation because for these  events

-   I  think  Members of this House know what we are  talking

about  including  Opposition Members,  because  Mr  Low  Thia

Khiang's Hougang committee has organised many such events, so

has Mr Chiam  -  events in his basketball court, that sort of

setting,  now  if he wants to make a speech  as  a  local  MP

elected  by residents, he should make an application and  the

Police  will  assess it.  If these criteria are satisfied,  I

will expect the Police to say "go ahead".



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Another clarification, Sir. This

question is specifically asked when a dinner is organised  by

a  political party.  Will the MP be allowed or not allowed to

speak?   The  answer,  as I get it, is still  no.   So,  what

difference  does  it  make?  There is no  relaxation  of  the

policy.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>





Although  the event is organised by a political party,  there

is participation by the constituents of my ward.  How can you

say   that  it  is  not  a  constituency  event?   It  is   a

constituency event.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> All of us here can see a

distinction between an event which is organised, say, by  the

SPP  in  a big field where there are 80-100 tables, or  more,

and  not  only  residents come but SPP supporters  come  from

other  wards,  and  Mr  Chiam makes a  speech.   In  an  open

setting, there may be other members of other Parties present.

Then, the potential for law and order problems will still  be

present  which, in the past, the Police have said  that  they

were  the  reasons  why  no speeches  were  allowed  in  that

setting.  So the setting is important.  On the other hand, if

Mr  Chiam  now organises a  children's party at a  basketball

court.   In  the past, unless it was organised  by  the  town

council,  he would not be allowed to speak.  But now,  if  he

makes  an application, I would expect the Police to  say  "go

ahead and speak".

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>AND REPEAL) BILL</h4></div>



<br>2.10 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>





to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill strings together a number of minor, and

mainly  technical amendments to several Acts.  The amendments

can be grouped into several categories which I will deal with

in turn.

<br><br><i>Repeal of obsolete Acts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first set of amendments repeals a number of obsolete

Acts.   In 1999, the Attorney-General established a Committee

to  review  outdated Acts with a view to repealing or,  where

appropriate, updating and re-enacting them.  As a  result  of

the  work  of the committee, Clause 13 of the Bill  seeks  to

repeal :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Land Officers Powers Act;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Preservation of the Peace Act;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the Prevention of Crimes Act; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the Tin and Tin-Ore (Disclosure of Smeltor's

Stocks) Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Officers Powers Act was enacted in 1926 to

remove  doubts  as to the powers and duties of land  officers

under  various  statutes existing at the time  because  these

land  officers  were  referred to by different  titles  under

different  statutes.   As the relevant legislation  have  all

been  modernised,  no  such doubts  exist  today.   The  Land

Officers Powers Act is therefore no longer needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Preservation of the Peace Act was enacted in 1872.

It  allows the Government, by proclamation, to vest  Justices

of Peace with certain emergency powers to preserve the peace.

This  is no longer necessary as sufficient provision has been

made   in   other   legislation   like   the   Public   Order

(Preservation) Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prevention of Crimes Act was enacted in 1939. Some

of  its provisions are either obsolete or no longer consonant

with  modern  penal laws, while other provisions are  largely

duplicative of provisions existing in other laws.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tin and Tin-Ore (Disclosure of Smeltor's Stocks) Act

is obsolete as there are no more smelters in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Amendment of Interpretation Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of amendments concerns the Interpretation

Act.    These  amendments  were  proposed  by  the  Attorney-General's Chambers to facilitate legislative drafting, mainly

by  including  standard  provisions  for  certain  frequently

occurring  matters.  For example, Clause 2(3)  provides  that

where  a  written  law is to come into  operation  on  a  day

specified  by  notification,  the  notification  may  specify

different days for different provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another situation is where provisions in Acts of

Parliament contain examples and illustrations to show how the

provisions  are  intended  to work.   A  new  section  7A  is

inserted into the Interpretation Act to make clear that these

examples are not meant to be exhaustive, and are not intended

to override the operative words of the provision.

<br><br><i>Amendments to Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and compensation) Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 amends the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks

and  Compensation) Act for the better administration of  that

Act.   Under this Act, the Public Trustee is tasked to  watch

over  the interest of persons making claims against motorists

and their insurers for personal injuries arising from traffic

accidents.   Section 6 of the Act requires  all  payments  of

compensation exceeding $5,000 to be made through  the  Public

Trustee.   If  the Public Trustee considers the  compensation

payment  to  be  inadequate, he can require  the  parties  to

submit the case to the courts for scrutiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act protects the interest of claimants by requiring

lawyers acting on behalf of claimants to submit their charges

to  the  courts  for scrutiny.  This is to  ensure  that  the

lawyers' charges are fair and reasonable.  The Bill makes two

adjustments to this system.  First, the Bill





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>





makes  it unnecessary for a lawyer to submit his charges  for

scrutiny by the courts if the Public Trustee agrees with  the

charges.   This will result in savings in time and  resources

for  the  courts and the lawyers involved.  Second, the  Bill

allows  the Public Trustee to decide what charges the  lawyer

should  claim if the lawyer fails to submit his  charges  for

court  scrutiny  within three months after  the  compensation

amount has been approved by the Public Trustee or fixed by  a

court.  Delay by a lawyer in submitting his charges for court

scrutiny  means delay in the payment of compensation  to  his

client.  This is unfair to the client.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also empowers the Public Trustee to appear and

argue in any court case involving a claim of compensation for

personal  injury  arising from traffic accident.   This  will

give the Public Trustee greater flexibility in fulfilling his

role  of  protecting the interests of persons  claiming  such

compensation.

<br><br><i>Other Miscellaneous Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap up, I will take the House briefly through the

remaining key provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends the Legal Profession Act for two

purposes.   The  first is to provide that foreign  joint  law

ventures  which are incorporated companies will  be  exempted

from the requirement to carry the words "limited" or "private

limited" in their names.  This is a privilege which local law

corporations  currently  enjoy.  The  second  purpose  is  to

enable  rules  to  be  made  for the  registration  with  the

Attorney-General of all foreign lawyers practising in foreign

law  firms, Singapore law firms and joint law ventures.  This

is  to  widen  the existing provision which is restricted  to

foreign  lawyers  resident in Singapore and practising  in  a

foreign law firm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends the Medical Registration Act to allow a

Magistrate's Court or a District Court to mete out  the  full

penalties for offences under the Act. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>





the   offences  under  the  Medical  Registration   Act   are

regulatory  in  nature,  such  as  unauthorised  practice  of

medicine,  it is more appropriate to prosecute such  offences

in the subordinate courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends the Moneylenders Act to do away with the

need  for moneylenders to deposit copies of promissory  notes

with   the  Commissioner  of  Stamp  Duties,  as  there   are

alternative sources of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 amends the Securities Industry Act to ensure

consistency  between  a  criminal  prosecution  for   insider

trading  under section 103 and an action under  section  104A

for  civil penalty for insider trading.  The amendment  makes

clear  that  the defence in section 103(11) applies  to  both

types of action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 amends the Trade Marks Act to provide that a

lawyer  acting  on  behalf  of a client  is  not  liable  for

groundless  threats of infringement proceedings.   This  will

bring  the Trade Marks Act in line with the Patents  Act  and

the Registered Designs Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Bill amends the Air Navigation Act, the

Monetary   Authority  of  Singapore  Act,  and   the   Mutual

Assistance in Criminal Matters Act to allow regulations to be

made for the purpose of complying with obligations which  are

binding  on  Singapore under international agreements  or  by

virtue  of  our  membership of an international organisation.

These provisions are modelled after similar provisions in the

Maritime   and   Port   Authority  of  Singapore   Act,   the

Telecommunications  Act,  the  Postal   Services   Act,   the

Singapore  Broadcasting  Act and the Public  Utilities  Board

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>REMUNERATION OF THE SPEAKER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pursuant to Article 41 of the Constitution of the

Republic of Singapore, the Speaker shall be paid with  effect

from 1st July 2000:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a monthly salary and allowances equal to 40 per

cent  of  1.64 times the salary and allowances payable  to  a

Senior  Administrative Officer on the minimum  point  of  the

Ministerial  Range  4  (MR4)  as  specified  in  the   Senior

Administrative Officers' Scheme of Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a non-pensionable annual fixed bonus pegged at the

norm  Performance  Bonus  rate  of  a  Senior  Administrative

Officer on the minimum point of the Ministerial Range 4 (MR4)

as specified in the Senior Administrative Officers' Scheme of

Service;  and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a GDP Bonus pegged at the GDP Bonus rates payable

to  a  Senior Administrative Officer on the minimum point  of

the  Ministerial  Range 4 (MR4) as specified  in  the  Senior

Administrative Officers' Scheme of Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 23rd March 1995, Parliament had resolved that

the  Speaker's salary and allowances to be 40% of  the  Staff

Grade  IV  plus 1%, as specified in the Senior Administrative

Officers' Scheme of Service, as you are performing  the  duty

on  a part-time basis.  This was done in order to obviate the

need  to  move  a motion every time the salaries  of  office-holders  and  senior  public  officers  are  changed.    This

principle has not changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the review of the 1994 White Paper on

Competitive  Salaries  for Honest and  Competent  Government,

fundamental  changes  were  made  to  the  salary  and  grade

structures  of the Ministers and the Administrative  Service.

A system of salary ranges was introduced





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>





to  replace  the  system of salary points  and  fixed  salary

scales  in the Administrative Service.  Consequential changes

were  made  to  the  gross monthly salaries  of  the  various

appointments, whereas specifically, the salary and allowances

of  the  Speaker are now to be expressed as a  ratio  of  the

minimum point of MR4, the salary range corresponding  to  the

old  salary grade, ie, Staff Grade IV plus 1%.  In  terms  of

quantum,  there  is  no reduction in the monthly  salary  and

allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review also saw the introduction of the Gross

Domestic  Product  (or GDP) Bonus, which  was  introduced  to

provide  a  direct link between the remuneration of  officers

and the performance of the Singapore economy.  It is proposed

that the GDP Bonus also be extended to the Speaker, as is the

practice  for  other  Statutory  Appointments,  such  as  the

President,  the Attorney-General, the Chairman of the  Public

Service Commission and the Auditor-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Parliament is requested to approve the new formula

that  pegs the Speaker's salary and allowances to the minimum

point  of  MR4, as well as for the introduction  of  the  GDP

Bonus for the Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pursuant to Article 41 of the Constitution of the

Republic of Singapore, the Speaker shall be paid with  effect

from 1st July 2000:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a monthly salary and allowances equal to 40 per

cent  of  1.64 times the salary and allowances payable  to  a

Senior  Administrative Officer on the minimum  point  of  the

Ministerial  Range  4  (MR4)  as  specified  in  the   Senior

Administrative Officers' Scheme of Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a non-pensionable annual fixed bonus pegged at the

norm  Performance  Bonus  rate  of  a  Senior  Administrative

Officer on the minimum point of the Ministerial Range 4 (MR4)

as specified in the Senior Administrative Officers' Scheme of

Service;  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br><i>Rationale for Compulsory Education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore education system has always served both an

economic  and  social function - to prepare our citizens  for

work  and to provide a common educational experience  to  our

young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, with improvements and refinements, the

participation  rates in primary, secondary and post-secondary

education have been rising.  Achievement levels are high, and

our  education  system  enjoys a well-deserved  international

high  reputation,  especially  in  Mathematics,  Science  and

Information Technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the future, the role our schools play will become

even  more  critical,  in  providing  Singaporeans  with  the

necessary  foundation  to become knowledge  workers,  and  in

imbuing our young with a robust sense of national identity in

the face of globalisation and rapid change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is a small country with limited resources,

we  need to ensure that children who would otherwise miss out

on  the  full  benefits of an education in national  schools,

will  have the opportunity to get the education they need  to

develop  to  their fullest potential, and be  ready  for  the

future.   The  introduction of Compulsory  Education  in  our

national schools signals this intent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education will help assure that our children

have  firstly,  the necessary common core  of  knowledge  and

strong  foundation  for further education,  and  secondly,  a

common educational experience to build national cohesion.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Re-cap of CE recommendations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration and form of Compulsory Education, proposed

by  the Committee on Compulsory Education chaired by Dr Aline

Wong, and accepted by the Government, balances these two  key

objectives  with the views and aspirations of  the  different

communities in Singapore.  The recommendations also re-affirm

the appropriate balance in responsibilities of the family and

of  the  State  for  a child's education, while  taking  into

consideration  practical problems in  terms  of  enforcement.

Permit  me to briefly go over the key recommendations of  the

Compulsory Education Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education up to primary 6 is recommended,

even  though  10 years of general education would  be  ideal.

This  is  a pragmatic compromise given the practicalities  of

introducing   and   enforcing  Compulsory  Education   during

secondary  education.  Compulsory Education should  therefore

be   seen  as  the  minimum  period  of  education  for   all

Singaporean children, and not the ideal duration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education will need strong support from the

various  communities to be successful.   The  form  in  which

Compulsory Education is implemented should therefore give due

consideration to how the aspirations and needs of the various

communities  can be taken into account in the  implementation

of  Compulsory Education.  Hence we have provided for certain

groups  to  be exempted from Compulsory Education subject  to

certain  conditions.  These are children attending designated

institutions  which  have  a long historical  record  in  our

society,  like madrasahs and San Yu Adventist School.   Home-schoolers are exempted.  Children with special needs are also

exempted  as  their needs are catered for in accordance  with

their specific requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some children will be given exemption from

Compulsory   Education  in  national   schools   to   receive

alternative forms of education, we are putting in





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



place  mechanisms  to  ensure that we can  try  to  meet  the

objectives  of  Compulsory Education as best as  practicable,

like  prescribing a minimum standard to be  attained  in  the

PSLE.   All children who are given exemption to attend  full-time  madrasahs,  San Yu Adventist School and  home-schooling

will be required to sit for the PSLE with their cohort.  Each

of  these  institutions  must meet stipulated  benchmarks  in

order   to  be  allowed  to  admit  children  exempted   from

Compulsory Education, and parents of home-schoolers  need  to

satisfy the Ministry of Education that the two key objectives

of  Compulsory  Education can be achieved for their  children

before they are granted exemption from Compulsory Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for children with learning disabilities, some are

already  admitted to mainstream schools if that is  the  best

for  them.   But  others are much more able to develop  their

full potential if they attend special education schools where

they  can learn at their own pace.  There they are taught  by

specially  trained  teachers who are  assisted  by  medically

trained  personnel and support staff, with a  curriculum  and

environment specially tailored to their needs.  Children with

special  needs  are  therefore  automatically  exempted  from

Compulsory Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the introduction of Compulsory Education,

parents will still be responsible for ensuring their children

attend  school  regularly.  The family and  community  should

play  an  active role in convincing and helping parents  send

their  children to school before the State steps in to compel

them to do so.  This is consistent with the principle of self-reliance and sense of parental responsibility which undergird

the  family as the basic unit of society.  At the same  time,

penalties,  in the form of fines and in the extreme  case,  a

jail  term, will be provided under the law to allow effective

enforcement   of   Compulsory   Education   and   to    deter

irresponsible parents.  However, penalties will  need  to  be

meted  out  judiciously to ensure that they are  not  to  the

detriment of the long term interest of the children and their

families.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>CE Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compulsory Education Bill will provide the necessary

framework for implementing Compulsory Education.  It sets out

the  key  definitions, gives powers to the Minister  and  the

Director-General  of  Education (DGE) to  enforce  Compulsory

Education,  and lays down penalties.  It will give regulatory

effect  to  the key objectives of Compulsory Education  while

operational  details  are regulated by administrative  means.

In  this  way, the Ministry can better respond to changes  in

environment  and circumstances.  Whatever can be  facilitated

by  administrative  measures and regulations  have  not  been

duplicated in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me to highlight the key clauses of the Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clause 3 sets out the definition of Compulsory

Education.   Every Singapore citizen born after  1st  January

1996,  residing  in  Singapore and of  school  going  age  is

required to attend a national primary school regularly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 4 makes provision for exemption from

Compulsory Education.  The conditions for granting  exemption

will be spelt out in the subsidiary legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clauses 5 and 6 provide for the establishment of

the  Compulsory Education Board, and defines the  duties  and

powers of the Board to investigate cases of non-compliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Clause 7 prescribes the penalties for non-compliance with Compulsory Education.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, the recommendations of the Compulsory

Education  Committee  represent  a  considered  and  balanced

response to the demands of the new knowledge-based world.  To

succeed in the future, we will need Singaporeans to have  the

necessary  educational  foundations  to  undertake   lifelong

learning; and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>





keen sense of what it means to be a Singaporean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education, by providing a common core of

knowledge  and a common educational experience,  is  a  first

step  for  all communities to move forward together into  the

future.  Compulsory Education can only succeed in meeting its

objectives  with  the strong commitment of  parents  and  the

various  communities.  I therefore urge Members of Parliament

and  community leaders to encourage all Singaporeans to  give

their  full support to making Compulsory Education a success,

and  help  give all our children the best possible  start  in

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is stating the

obvious to say that education would allow a person to develop

his inherent capability and fulfill his full potential as  an

individual.  It is through education that children from  poor

families  could  move  up the social ladder  and  escape  the

poverty  trap.   In so doing, the able and the diligent  lift

their  families  out of poverty along with them  and  prevent

social stratification.  We, as a people, are passionate about

our children having the best possible education.  And many of

us  in this House have benefited from the education policy of

this  Government and are in full support of the  Government's

education  programme.   This is reflected  in  MOE's  budget,

which   is  the  second  largest  in  our  annual  Government

expenditure, standing at 3.7% of our GDP.  As a result of our

steadfast effort, 97% of our cohort are enrolled in Primary 1

of our national schools.  59% have achieved at least five "O"

Level   passes  and  about  60%  are  enrolled  in   tertiary

institutions  such as the polytechnics and the  universities.

All   these   we  have  achieved  without  making   education

compulsory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current education policy, as the Minister of State

stated  earlier,  has  served  us  well.   So,  why  are   we

introducing  Compulsory  Education  now  -  35  years   after

independence?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to go through the history of

Compulsory Education elsewhere.  History shows that countries

with  Compulsory Education can be grouped into basically  two

categories.  In the first category are western countries that

introduced  Compulsory Education in the late 1880s  or  early

1900s as education of the common person had become recognised

as  the cornerstone of democracy.  The State of Massachusetts

in  the  United  States  was the first  to  enact  compulsory

education attendance laws way back in 1852.  By 1918, all the

states  in  the  US  had  laws on Compulsory  Education.   In

England  and  Wales, Compulsory Education was  introduced  in

1880,   close  to  120  years  ago.   Over  time,  Compulsory

Education  spread  throughout the western  countries  as  one

country  after  another implemented CE.  By  the  1920s,  the

concept  that every child has a right to education was  fully

implemented in the western countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has strong influence on emerging countries. These

countries  too  aspire to implement Compulsory  Education  as

part  of  their nation-building process.  These are countries

in the second group.  Their founding fathers set out to build

new  societies  out of the old.  They saw  education  as  the

means  for  their population to bootstrap themselves  out  of

poverty.   Let  us look at a few countries in  Asia.   Taiwan

introduced Compulsory Education for primary schools  in  1945

after  the  Second World War.  By 1951, six years  after  the

enactment,  the enrolment rate in their primary  schools  was

only  81.5%.  Nonetheless, by 1968, when Compulsory Education

was  extended  to nine years, their enrolment rate  stood  at

97.7%.   India's 1949 Independence constitution provided  for

Compulsory  Education.  However, compulsion to-date  has  not

been   enforced   due   to   socio-economic   and   political

considerations.  Hong Kong introduced Compulsory Education in

1971.   Indonesia made primary education compulsory  in  1987

and  extended  it  to  nine years in  1993.   Thus,  emerging

countries tend to introduce Compulsory Education early in





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>





their  nationhood.   They primarily  use  it  to  enshrine  a

certain set of principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective is to use it as a political

platform  to bring education to all their children, those  in

the  cities as well as those in the countryside.  It was also

common to implement Compulsory Education for six years in the

first instance and then later extend the duration to a longer

period such as nine years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by now almost all nations or self-governing territories in the world have implemented

Compulsory  Education.  The 1998 UNESCO Statistical  Yearbook

on  National  Education System yields some  interesting  data

about  the  universality  of Compulsory  Education.   In  the

Africa   region,   50  out  of  56  nations  or   territories

implemented  Compulsory  Education.   In  North  America,  35

countries out of 35 did so.  In South America, 14 out of  14.

In  Europe,  40  out of 42.  The standouts  are  Andorra  and

Latvia.   In Asia, only 37 out of 50.  In the Oceania region,

16  out  of  19.   In the ASEAN region, Indonesia,  Thailand,

Philippines,  Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,  Myanmar,  and  Brunei

Darussalam  have  Compulsory Education laws  on  their  book.

Only Singapore and Malaysia do not.  We are in the company of

Bhutan, East Timor, Lebanon, Maldives, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar,

Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.  On paper, Sir, at

least,  it is indeed an anomaly that Singapore, a progressive

country, does not make education compulsory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of duration, Compulsory Education duration

ranges from as low as five years in Iran, Turkey, Bangladesh,

Nepal,  Myanmar  and  Vietnam, to 12  years  in  Belgium  and

Germany,  with the Netherlands as high as 13  years.   It  is

nine  years in Japan, 10 years in the US and 11 years in  the

UK.   There  is  only  one  small territory  in  Africa  that

implemented a Compulsory Education of four years.  Nine or 10

years seem to be the duration of choice for most countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have chosen to make primary

education compulsory when practically all our children are





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>





already  enrolled in schools of one sort or  another,  if  we

include private schools and religious schools.  In fact,  90%

of our children are already in the national schools.  At this

point  in time, our education system is more focused  on  the

quality of education to enhance creativity and originality in

our  children  in response to the changing world  instead  of

focusing on the number of children being enrolled in  primary

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, based on past events in this House, it would appear

that  the  Government was galvanised into  action  after  NMP

Claire  Chiang raised an Oral Question on 4th August 1999  on

the  topic  "Children  Not Registering for  Primary  School".

When  she declared that "one child not in school is  one  too

many",  it  did strike a chord in many of us in  this  House.

The  Minister,  responding  at  that  point,  reiterated  the

argument that since we have already passed the stage where we

need  to  make  education compulsory, there is actually  very

little  need  to  do so.  Therefore, when the Prime  Minister

addressed the House on 13th October 1999 proposing  that  MOE

consider the introduction of Compulsory Education of a 4-year

period, the impression in the public mind is that NMP  Claire

Chiang had won the argument against a long-standing policy of

MOE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that impression would not have given

credit  to other Members of Parliament, past or current,  who

have  spoken on this subject because the call for  Compulsory

Education  in this House was not new.  I looked  through  the

Hansard,  Sir,  and  it shows that Mr  Tang  See  Chim  first

brought up the subject in December 1966.  Mr Goh Chee Wee and

Mr Liew Kok Pun raised the issue in March 1982 in the context

of  reducing  school dropout rate.  Compulsory Education  has

been a favourite topic of Mr Chiam See Tong who raised it  in

no  fewer  than seven occasions from 1989 till 1999,  and  Mr

Chiam will be speaking after me as well.  NMP Kanwaljit  Soin

brought up the subject in February 1993 and again in December

1993.  Mr Lew Syn Pau raised the same topic in March 1994.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could only conjecture as to why we did not implement

Compulsory  Education  in  the  early  years  of  our  nation

building.  Perhaps, Singapore being a multi-racial and multi-religious  society, Compulsory Education would  be  perceived

differently   by  the  various  communities.   Instead,   the

Government  had chosen to make education as widely  available

to our children as possible without making it compulsory.  In

retrospect, this would appear to be a wise decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, there were strong reactions by the

various   interested  parties,  in  particular,  the   Muslim

community,  regarding the future of the madrasahs  after  the

Prime  Minister's suggestion on 13th October 1999.   Some  of

these  reactions were rather emotional ones, with the extreme

ones even expressing doubt regarding the Government's intent.

The  community  was  only reassured when the  Prime  Minister

personally  met  with  the  representatives  of  the   Muslim

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the past ministerial statements on this subject, we

can  also deduce that the Government was preoccupied with the

problems   of   enforcement  when  it  comes  to   Compulsory

Education.    This  might  be  true,  because   while   other

governments  might  be  comfortable  about  not  having  100%

compliance,   this   Government  would   have   wanted   100%

compliance.  Yet, we are aware that in most cases, penalising

parents  for  not sending their children might  make  matters

worse  for  the  families.  When a  child  is  not  attending

school,  the  root  cause is traceable to the  family,  often

times broken families and dysfunctional families.  These  are

not  situations  or  problems that can be resolved  with  the

stroke of a pen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, Sir, we recognise that a child not given

the  opportunity  to  blossom to  his  full  potential  is  a

terrible  waste.   At  a time when our birth  rate  is  below

replacement  level,  this  becomes  an  inexcusable  and   an

intolerable  waste.  In proposing Compulsory  Education,  the

Prime  Minister  has  decided  that  it  was  time  for   the

Government  to  make  an affirmation that  every  Singaporean

matters.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>





Making   education  of  a  child  compulsory   elevates   the

visibility of this commitment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, once the Government decided that

Singapore  should have a Compulsory Education Act,  it  is  a

logical  step to define what Compulsory Education  means  for

Singapore.    This  task  was  entrusted  to  the  Compulsory

Education  Committee  set  up  in  December  1999  under  the

chairmanship of Dr Aline Wong, Senior Minister of  State  for

Education.  I was the Vice-Chairman of the Committee.   After

examining  the  role  of education in a  young  country  like

Singapore, the Compulsory Education Committee reaffirmed  the

two objectives of the National Schools system:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to give our children a foundation for life-long

learning in the preparation for the knowledge-based economy;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to give the children a common educational

experience to enhance national identity and social cohesion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two principles are still the basis of this

Compulsory Education Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to reiterate that, even after the enactment

of  this  Bill, the responsibility of the upbringing  of  the

child  still rests primarily with the parents.  This  is  the

right  approach as our parents have been very  serious  about

the future of our children.  In fact, the main reason why the

Singapore   education   system  is   stressful   and   highly

competitive is the strong emphasis on education placed by our

parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now to elaborate upon some of

the  deliberations  of  the  Compulsory  Education  Committee

leading  to  its  recommendations.   The  Feedback  Unit  has

reported that the majority of respondents polled by the  Unit

felt  that  four years of Compulsory Education is too  short.

Many  felt  that six years is the minimum, with 10 years  the

ideal.   This view is also reflected by the Minister  in  his

speech.  Several members





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>





of  the  Committee felt that to truly meet the  objective  of

preparing  our children for the knowledge-based economy,  the

minimum  requirement  is  10 years of  Compulsory  Education.

After extensive deliberation, the Committee finally agreed to

confine  Compulsory  Education to primary  education  in  the

first  instance.  This is so because it is more important  to

get  every Singaporean, every community, to accept Compulsory

Education  at  this juncture than to aim  for  the  ideal  of

Compulsory  Education at the first go.  If need be,  the  Act

could  be amended in future to provide for another four years

of secondary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as expected, some members of the Muslim

community  are concerned that Compulsory Education  would  or

could  legislate the madrasahs out of existence.  This is  of

course  not the intent of Compulsory Education.   It is  also

very  positive  that  the  community itself  understands  the

challenges  of  the future and is prepared to deal  with  the

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the madrasahs' curriculum is geared towards

the  training  of religious teachers and leaders.   Yet,  for

those  who  do  not take up religious vocation as  a  career,

these young people trained in madrasahs are not well prepared

for  the KBE.  I would like to quote some recent studies that

have shown that in the knowledge-based economy, the wage  gap

increases  as  jobs  go upscale in skills  and  training.   A

recent  study  by a Stanford professor using real  life  data

from  a  US  corporation  proved this conclusively  [Stanford

Business School Social Scientist Roberto Fernandez].  As  the

study  surveyed working adult Americans, it showed  that  the

correlation between race and income was very strong  as  jobs

move   upscale.  As  the  corporation  turned  towards   high

technology,  white workers with higher wages  were  hired  to

replace  African American workers with lower  wages.   So  it

seems  that  the  digital divide not  only  increases  income

disparity between the skilled and unskilled, but also  widens

the  chasm  between  racial  groups  of  different  aptitudes

towards technology.  It would be a tragedy for this to happen





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>





in  Singapore.  This we must avoid at all costs.   The  Prime

Minister  had  done  a  great  job,  convincing  the   Muslim

community  to accept Compulsory Education for their children,

while making special provision for the needs of the community

for religious teachers and leaders.  The madrasahs themselves

have voluntarily set a PSLE benchmark for all madrasah pupils

to  aim  for  after the Compulsory Education Act  comes  into

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the pupils in the madrasahs, the Compulsory

Education  Committee has recommended exemption for two  other

groups  of  children,  namely, children attending  designated

private schools and children who are being tutored at home by

the  parents. The Minister has indicated that he has accepted

these recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why did the Committee recommend that home schooling

be exempted from Compulsory Education?  Since there is only a

very  small  number of children every year being  tutored  at

home,  the  question  could be asked  as  to  why  a  special

provision  should  be created just for  these  children.   In

fact, several members of the Committee felt that no exemption

for  home  schooling should be made.  Firstly, parents  could

make  use  of this provision as a loophole to circumvent  the

Act. Secondly, unlike the educational institutes such as  the

madrasah  and  the  San Yu Adventist School  whose  exemption

could  be  revoked if they fail to meet the  PSLE  benchmark,

there  is  no such recourse when it comes to home  schooling.

These  are  very  strong  arguments.   However,  I  have  the

privilege as a member of the Feedback Unit to have met a  few

parents  who  are  tutoring their children  at  home.  I  can

reassure  the  House that these are dedicated  and  committed

parents. A few of them are former school teachers themselves.

In  almost all cases, one of the parents will give up his  or

her full-time job so as to stay home to tutor the child.   If

we  truly  believe that education is primarily  the  parent's

responsibility, these parents are the exemplars of dedication

and  commitment.  To forbid home schooling will be sending  a

wrong





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>





message.  Therefore,  I  support  the  exemption  for   home-schooling   from  Compulsory  Education.    I   believe   the

safeguards  and  the guidelines contained in  the  Compulsory

Education Committee's Report to monitor the progress of these

children  would be sufficient to prevent home-schooling  from

becoming a loophole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also advocates who would like Compulsory

Education  to  address  the issues of  handicapped  children,

including  their  call to integrate these children  into  our

national  schools.  They would like all children to  grow  up

and attend school together, instead of being segregated today

into  special  needs  schools. The objective  is  to  promote

awareness  and compassion of our children of the  handicapped

and  the  less able from a very young age.   Sir,  since  our

education  system is an ability-based system,  with  children

with  different  learning  abilities  streamed  to  different

streams, this idea would have required a complete overhaul of

our  education system.  The Committee feels that the  current

approach  involving the voluntary welfare organisations  with

regard  to children with special needs is the right  approach

and we recommend that this be retained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 7 of the Bill contains provision on penalty

for recalcitrant parents.  Most members of the Committee feel

that  penalty  should  only  be imposed  as  a  last  resort.

Counselling  instead  is  a  preferred  approach.   In   this

respect,  I am glad to note that this Bill provides  for  the

establishment of a Board of Compulsory Education.  The duties

and  powers of the Board are given in clause 6 of  the  Bill.

It  is  appropriate that no person should be charged for  any

offence  under  this  Bill except on  a  complaint  from  the

Director-General of Education.  When the Board of  Compulsory

Education   has   exhausted  their  avenue  to   persuade   a

recalcitrant  parent,  it would recommend  to  the  Director-General  of Education to bring the parents to court.   Unlike

other  laws,  for instance, the Maintenance of  Parents  Act,

other interested parties cannot bring the parents to court on

their own. This is a recognition that since such families are





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>





already  in distress, bringing the family to court should  be

the  very  last  resort  and  should  only  be  left  to  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has the support of all the communities in

Singapore.  There  is one major shortcoming  in  my  opinion,

which  is  its  duration.   By  any  measure,  six  years  of

Compulsory Education is not enough for a person to  hold  his

own  in  the future.  Globalisation is an irreversible  trend

and is picking up pace across the world. Singaporeans have no

choice  but to be fully engaged in the race.  To be  able  to

stand  up  to  the best in the world, we should put  all  our

children through at least 9 or 10 years of education  instead

of  just  six  as  provided in the  Bill.   Hopefully,  after

Compulsory Education has been implemented for several  years,

the  worries and concern about Compulsory Education would  be

assuaged and we could think about extending the duration to a

longer period.  Hopefully, this could be done soon. Even now,

more  and more of our children are already voluntarily having

at  least  9  years  of  education, if we  include  technical

education. This is so because those without such an education

would find it increasingly difficult to find a job in the job

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Compulsory Education Bill as it stands is the

most appropriate one at this point of time for Singapore.   I

support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I rise to support

the  Compulsory  Education Bill.  I wish to congratulate  the

Committee on Compulsory Education chaired by Senior  Minister

of  State  for  Education,  Dr Aline  Wong,  for  the  clear,

comprehensive and balanced report on the issues the Committee

had  to  address  and  deal with.  They have  clarified  what

Compulsory Education means and the process that led  to  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Compulsory Education is defined as education in

national   schools,  aimed  at  giving  children   a   strong

foundation for the knowledge-based economy and building





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>





a  sense  of  national  identity and cohesion  in  the  young

Singaporeans.   Up to now, we have allowed  the  parents  the

choice  of whether to send their children to school  and  the

vast  majority of parents have done so. This is  because  the

parents  generally appreciate the value of a  good  education

for  their  children.  Public opinion is  not  against  those

parents  who  wish  to teach their children  differently  but

rather the parents who do not educate their children at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By making education compulsory, the schools are not

about  to  take  over  the responsibility  of  educating  the

children.  The responsibility rightly belongs to the parents.

At  best, it is a joint responsibility when the child  is  in

school.   With Compulsory Education, the Government  and  the

community must be prepared to extend help to parents who face

serious  difficulties in sending their children to school.  I

hope   the   community  organisations  can  make  a  positive

contribution in helping families who face difficulties living

in  their  neighbourhood.   Besides  the  madrasahs,  San  Yu

Adventist School and home schooling programmes, children with

physical  and  other  disabilities  are  also  exempted  from

Compulsory  Education. This, to me, is a  practical  approach

because  we do not want to put the added pressure  and  undue

burden  on parents of children with disabilities. If  we  are

not  careful,  we may compound the problems  of  parents  who

would  feel  guilty if they could not afford  to  send  their

children  with  disabilities for  appropriate  education  and

training on a full-time basis.  Of course, some cynics may be

quick  to  surmise  from  this exemption  as  a  way  of  the

Government  to  avoid the responsibility of committing  funds

and resources needed to look after this group of children.  I

am  sure it is not due to a lack of compassion on the part of

the  Government.  Indeed, a special programme is required  to

cater  to  the  special needs of children with  physical  and

other  disabilities.  I know that the Minister has  just  now

alluded to this point.  Perhaps, it is also useful later  for

the  Minister  to  clarify  the  position  of  the  Education

Ministry  regarding  the provision of educational  facilities

and resources for disabled children.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the study and consultation undertaken by

the   Committee,  we  have  a  better  understanding  of  the

madrasahs  and what they are doing.  I am quite surprised  at

the  low  standards  of  achievements  of  the  students   in

madrasahs compared to the Malay students who attend  national

schools.   I wonder whether many Malay students from families

that  needed  special help have been directed  or  gravitated

towards  the  madrasahs instead of national schools.   Is  it

because  of  the  real or perceived help  they  are  able  to

receive  only  from the madrasahs in the education  of  these

poorer  children?  Perhaps, the Education Ministry  can  help

redress this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the madrasahs' role is to produce Muslim religious

teachers, we should not allow the number to grow beyond  what

is  required. I therefore support the move to cap the maximum

number  of  students in the six madrasahs to 400  pupils.   I

also  hope that the benchmark set for the madrasahs  at  PSLE

aggregate scores that match those of EM1 and EM2 Malay pupils

in the six lowest national performing schools be only a start

because  the benchmark set is six lowest performing  national

schools.  This relatively low benchmark should be reviewed  a

few years later. The standards should be raised gradually  so

that  the target set is higher and the madrasah students will

be  encouraged  to constantly improve their performance  over

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disturbed by the comment in the Report alluding to

the  possibility  of  parents  defying  the  requirement  for

Compulsory  Education  in the form of civil  disobedience  if

they  are not allowed to instruct their children through home

schooling programmes.  The impression might have been created

that  the concession is given because of the threat of  civil

disobedience.  I thought the whole exercise is to ensure that

the  children receive proper education.  In fact, and I  echo

what Dr Wang Kai Yuen had said, parents who consciously chose

home-schooling   could  be  considered   to   be   the   most

conscientious  and  fully committed to  ensuring  that  their

children  receive the best education.  I hope  these  parents

also





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>





appreciate   the  inadequacies  and  shortcomings   of   home

schooling  programmes.   Their children  will  not  have  the

necessary   exposure  and  experience  they  would  otherwise

receive  in  school.  These children miss the opportunity  to

interact  with teachers and fellow pupils.  I  am  very  sure

that these parents will take steps to plug the gaps that  the

home schooling programme lacks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is through instruction, discipline and practice that

we  learn  the skill of living our lives in such a  way  that

will amount to something excellent or worthwhile. We all have

that desire to educate our children to the fullest.   We want

our   young  children  to  grow  up  leading  meaningful  and

fulfilling  lives.   I  hope  this  Bill  to  make  education

compulsory will help the 1,000-odd children who missed school

the opportunity to have a good start in their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have spoken up in Parliament

on the need to have Compulsory Education during the debate on

the President's Speech in March 1985, and I have followed  up

that  call  for Compulsory Education on many other  occasions

during the debate in Committee at Budget time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government agreed to implement Compulsory

Education  and appointed a Committee on Compulsory  Education

to  study  the issues and prepare a report.  The  Report  has

been prepared and presented to the Minister, and the Minister

has  accepted all the recommendations of the Committee.   The

Chairman  of the Committee is the Senior Minister  of  State,

and  I note that many of its members comprise PAP Members  of

Parliament.   With such a strong presence of  politicians  in

that Committee, what I am afraid is that the decisions of the

Committee  may  be heavily influenced by politicians,  rather

than  looked at from the educational point of view.  This  is

an  educational matter and if the Government  wants  what  is

best for





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>





our  children,  then  they  should  leave  the  decision   on

Compulsory Education to professional educationists,  and  not

be  influenced by politicians.  We can see that the decisions

of   the  Committee  are  not  purely  based  on  educational

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out in the Report that for those

countries  which  have  chosen to have Compulsory  Education,

they  have fixed the Compulsory Education period between 9-11

years,  while  Singapore decides only  to  have  6  years  of

Compulsory  Education.   Six years of  compulsory  schooling,

from  the educational point of view, is definitely not enough

for  a  pupil to master the three Rs -  reading, writing  and

arithmetic.   In  Singapore's context, reading  involves  the

reading  of two languages.  Therefore, how can six  years  be

enough?    The  Committee's  recommendation  of   six   years

compulsory primary education is merely a political expediency

to satisfy the needs of the Government's policy as envisioned

in   Singapore  21,  which  inter  alia   says   that   every

Singaporean counts.  Under this policy, the Government cannot

be   seen  every  year  to  be  abandoning  1,000-odd   young

Singaporeans who do not attend school at all.  Therefore, the

Government   has  to  implement  Compulsory   Education   but

grudgingly  at six years.  I say that six years of compulsory

attendance  in school is not enough.  The minimum  number  of

years  we  should make a pupil attend school is eight  years.

At  eight  years of schooling, our pupils would then  have  a

chance to master the core subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report says that, ideally, a pupil should attend

school  for 10 years.  But 10 years' education, from  my  own

experience,  is too long for pupils who show no  interest  in

schooling, and it is a waste of the students' time and  State

funds.  For this reason, many countries implement a nine-year

Compulsory  Education programme.  But I  think  that  in  the

Singapore  context, we can start with eight years' schooling.

If  it  is  proven that it is still not sufficient, then  the

Government should increase it to nine years.  I call  on  the

Government to increase the period of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>





Compulsory  Education to eight years and  not  stick  to  its

proposed six years.  I think if our Government wants to  give

our   children  the  best  education,  then  it  should  make

Compulsory Education at eight years rather than just a  token

six  years.  The Government is purported to have reserves  of

$110   billion.   Then  it  should  have  funds  to  maintain

Compulsory Education at  eight years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards enforcement, I agree that the parents should

be made responsible for ensuring attendance of their child at

school.   However, I do not agree that the parents should  be

punished  with imprisonment.  How can the law force a  parent

to  ensure  that his child attends  school if the  child  for

some reason refuses to do so, although such cases are few and

far  between?  I think the maximum fine of $2,000  should  be

sufficient  punishment for a parent whose child of compulsory

age fails to attend school regularly.  The fine of $5,000, in

my  view,  is too excessive.  Normally, I would imagine  that

once  a  parent has been apprehended by the police  and  made

aware  that  he has committed an offence by not  sending  his

child  to  school, the parent would certainly make sure  that

his child does go to school unless, of course, he is deep  in

financial difficulty, in which case the MCDS should  step  in

to  assist.  A hefty fine or a jail sentence would definitely

be counter productive.  That would only antagonise the parent

and  make  him  less  cooperative, to the  detriment  of  the

interest  of the  child.  The best course is to win over  the

parent  and make him know the benefits of education  for  his

child and induce him, on his own accord, to want to send  his

child of compulsory school age to school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the madrasahs and San Yu Adventist School, I

think  the  recommendations of the Committee are  fair.   The

pupils  of  madrasahs and San Yu Adventist School  should  be

made  to attend minimum standards for the PSLE.  I would like

to  add  that  those schools be given five years  to  upgrade

themselves.   In  that  period, they should  bring  up  their

standards  and be at par with those in the national  schools.

The Government should give a helping hand in teacher training

for these schools.

<div align="center"><b>COMPULSORY EDUCATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for

allowing  me  to  join  in  this  debate  on  the  Compulsory

Education Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at first glance, this Bill would appear to be

something  of an anomaly.  We live in a society  which  holds

educational  achievement in high esteem and as a core  value.

We  have  an economy which attaches significant and  tangible

premium to education and skills.  We have a Government  which

not  only devotes significant resources to education but also

constantly encourages, cajoles and even admonishes its people

to   train,  retrain  and  pursue  lifelong  education.   The

Minister has given us empirical evidence previously  in  this

House  that  this has worked with 97% to 98% of  each  cohort

enrolling  for  primary one.  The question that  begs  to  be

asked  is why do we need this Bill to make education  at  the

primary  level compulsory.  Perhaps the answer lies  to  some

extent  in  the  fact that in each cohort there  are  several

hundred  students  who  do not enrol for  primary  education.

Many  of  them,  as  we  are aware, do  have  perfectly  good

reasons.   But there would be a minority for whom this is not

the  case  and it is for them that we should be  acting,  and

acting  decisively.  This Bill would be a worthwhile addition

to  our  statutes if it is able to help this small  group  of

young Singaporeans acquire the education that they are indeed

entitled to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill is worthy of support because it makes a

statement  on the importance that we in Singapore  attach  to

education.  It does underscore the responsibility of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>





parents  in  this very important endeavour and it does  endow

the Ministry with the authority and the wherewithal to ensure

that  no  child  misses  out  on education  due  to  parental

neglect.   Indeed, Sir, it is difficult to quarrel with  this

Bill at the level of its ideals and principles which underpin

it.   Who in their right mind can justifiably oppose  a  Bill

that says every child should be given a chance to be educated

and realise his full potential?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge in this Bill, in my opinion, is in its

implementation and the enforcement of its provisions.  As the

proverbial saying goes, the devil is in the details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Compulsory Education Board has an unenviable

task.   It  must steadfastly uphold the spirit and intent  of

this  legislation and yet it must adopt a deft and  sensitive

touch in its enforcement.  Why?  The family is central  to  a

child's development.  Parental involvement and support is key

to a child's educational advancement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my years as CEO of SINDA, there is one thing that I

have learnt and it is that state or institutional support can

never  replace the role of the parents or the family  in  the

child's  development.  Yet the Bill allows for  quite  severe

penalties to be imposed on parents if they do not comply with

the  provisions of this Bill - a fine of up to $5,000 and  up

to 12 months' imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam argued earlier that there should be no

imprisonment  and that the fine should be  reduced.   I  find

that  odd  because  if  an Act is to be effective,  then  the

enforcement  and  the penalties that go with the  enforcement

must  be of sufficient deterrent quality.  This is where  the

catch  of  this Bill lies: vigorous and assiduous enforcement

of  this Bill will, in my opinion, undermine the very  intent

of  the  Bill.  It could lead to non-cooperation,  resentment

and  even  family breakdown.  Certainly, Sir, a dysfunctional

family   is   not  a  conducive  backdrop  for  academic   or

educational pursuits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Compulsory Education Bill cannot be a panacea

for deep-seated





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>





problems that might lie within a family.  No one involved  in

this endeavour should go away with the wrong impression.  The

Compulsory  Education  Board must  therefore  exercise  great

flexibility  and restraint in carrying out its  duties.   The

Committee  under Senior Minister of State for  Education,  Dr

Aline Wong, has already exercised considerable restraint  and

flexibility and that is evident in the manner in which it has

dealt with specific issues such as those to do with madrasahs

and  home  schooling.  And also in wanting to  approach  this

very  new element of our society in an incremental manner  by

addressing primary education first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all said and done, we still need safeguards to make

sure  that  this process does not run awry.  We  must  ensure

that the imposition of the penalties that are provided for in

this  Bill are used only as a last resort and only after  all

other avenues have been exhausted.  In the Bill itself, there

is  a two-stage process.  The Compulsory Education Board  can

investigate and then make recommendations on what ought to be

done  in  a  particular  case  to  the  Director-General   of

Education.   He or she in turn would then be the arbiter,  as

it  were,  for  the final course of action.   This  two-stage

process has its merits.  Certainly, Sir, I would go one  step

further  and  say that we need to ensure that  even  for  the

manner  in  which the Compulsory Education Board carries  out

its  duties,  there are adequate provisions and protocol,  if

necessary, to make sure that they do not go about this  in  a

manner that might create more problems than it solves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one would certainly not be unhappy if the

provisions of this Bill, particularly those pertaining to the

extreme penalties, are observed more in their breach than  in

their practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other level, Sir, is resources. If the Compulsory

Education  Board is to do a proper job, and by  that  I  mean

making a concerted effort to investigate thoroughly into  the

circumstances of the families





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>





referred  to  it,  then it needs resources - social  workers,

educationists,   and  maybe  psychologists  to  counsel   the

family,  etc.  That is the very minimum we must  ensure  that

this Board has so that it is able to come out with robust and

worthwhile  recommendations.   I  would  therefore  ask   the

Minister to assure this House that that indeed would  be  the

case,  that  first  the  provisions  of  this  Bill  will  be

implemented  with  a  deft touch and sensitivity.   Secondly,

that   the   Compulsory  Education  Board  and  the   related

authorities  that  will  enforce this  Bill  would  be  given

adequate resources to ensure its intent is fully realised  in

practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank you for allowing me to join in the debate on  the

Compulsory Education Bill.  This is an important but  also  a

sensitive   subject  that  requires  careful   and   rational

handling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, key to our success in remaining at the forefront in

an  increasingly competitive world is our ability  to  create

and  produce  the educated, qualified, skilful  and  creative

people.  To achieve this objective, there is no substitute to

a  sustained  effort in improving the level of education  and

skills  training for our citizens.  Those who wonder  why  we

place  so  much  emphasis  on  our  education  system  should

understand  that this is the only way for us to keep  abreast

of and remain relevant in the changing world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back over the past 40 years, we could see how

responsive our education





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>





system has been to the changing needs.  When we launched  our

industrialisation  programme to  provide  employment  to  our

newly independent country, we introduced technical education.

As  we  progressed, we set up VITB and pressed  on  with  our

vocational  and industrial training programme.   We  expanded

our  polytechnic education in response to the demand  created

by  the  variety  of  industries set up here.   Our  tertiary

institutions  too  had  undergone change  in  both  areas  of

studies  as  well as the number of intake.  These qualitative

and  quantitative changes were made to meet the demand in the

labour market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world moves from an old economy to the new

knowledge-based  economy,  we can anticipate  changes  taking

place  at  a  faster tempo.  Newer frontiers will be  opened,

thus  throwing challenges and at the same time  offering  new

opportunities  to those who are able to see  and  grab  them.

Only  two decades ago we were struggling to sustain our  role

in the mainstream of the world's industrial community through

an  attempt  to  restructure  our  economy  by  applying  and

attracting   capital-intensive  production.    Although   the

recession in the mid-80s had forced us to shelve our plan and

caused  a  setback,  it was temporary.  We  remained  on-gear

towards  keeping ourselves relevant to the world.  While  the

world  economic upturn and downturn necessitate  us  to  make

adjustment, we remain on-track in seeking and securing a role

in the sunrise industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are talking not only about the super microchips

but  also  about the potential  genetic discoveries and  what

other  advances  in life sciences have to offer  to  us.   An

article  in the Far Eastern Economic Review dated 15th   June

this year quoted Prof. Chris Tan, Head of Singapore Institute

of  Molecular  and  Cell Biology, as  saying  that  the  21st

century  will  belong to biology, just as  the  20th  did  to

physics.   He  said  that at the start of the  last  century,

scientists  were beginning to map out the periodic  table  of

elements; now they are starting to sequence the human genome.

This  discovery of DNA sequence in scientific journal  itself

did not





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>





change  anyone's  life but it could lead  to  new  medicines,

agricultural  advances and the ability to accurately  predict

whether you are genetically predisposed to heart disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as we enter the era of borderless or globalised

world characterised by the movement of knowledge, technology,

talents  and capital across the border, the need  to  develop

the potential of our people to the highest possible level  is

even more urgent.  This is the era where those in control  of

information  hold  the power, those in  possession  of  great

knowledge ensure their success and those who are able to  use

technology  create  wealth.  This is also  an  era  of  rapid

change  with  greater threat of digital divide between  those

who are able to ride on the new tide and those falling off to

the side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the phenomenon with all its ramifications mentioned

above  is  universal.   It affects every  society  and  every

country in the world.  I believe that the best way to prepare

our  people  to face the challenge of a globalised  world  is

through education, training, re-education and retraining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of reasons why education, training,

the  acquisition of knowledge and improved ability  of  every

citizen  is  of great importance to us.  Firstly, our  people

are our only natural resource.  We have to manage and develop

this resource as best as we can.  Secondly, as a country that

upholds  the principle of meritocracy, education is a crucial

vehicle  for our social mobility.  It is the best  answer  to

the  threat of digital divide facing our society in the years

to  come.  Thirdly, as a country with a small population,  it

is  important for Singapore to develop the potential  of  its

citizens to the maximum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, students of demography may be familiar with the

concept   of  population  pyramid.   Countries  with   bigger

population  can continue to survive, and even  prosper,  with

their  broad-based educational pyramid.  This is because  the

talent  pool of those at the top of the pyramid is big enough

to meet the requirement and





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>





propel their economies.  As our population is small, we  need

to  create  a  rather narrow base educational pyramid.   This

means  we  have  to ensure that we increase  the  educational

qualification of our people at every level, be it  PSLE,  GCE

'O', post-secondary or tertiary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the operative phrase here is "at every level". It

is in this context that Compulsory Education should be seen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, the Committee on Compulsory

Education, chaired by the Senior Minister of State, Dr  Aline

Wong,  had  gone at great length in its consultation  and  in

seeking   views  from  the  members  of  the  public   before

presenting  it  to the public.  I generally  agree  with  the

substance  of  the Bill, especially on matters pertaining  to

the  six-year  period  of  CE and the  manner  it  is  to  be

enforced.  I subscribe to the objective underlying the CE  in

meeting  the need for a minimum foundation for every  student

in  the  core  subjects - English, Mathematics  and  Science.

This  is  to  prepare such school leavers for the  knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general public appeared supportive to the

proposal.  Those who had expressed some reservations  on  the

legal  and  enforcement aspect were assured on  knowing  that

there  is a mechanism in place to deal with individual cases.

Most  people would agree, in principle, that there must be  a

shared responsibility in achieving the objectives of the CE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there has been some disquiet among the

members  of  the  Muslim community.  While  nobody  seems  to

disagree   that  the  broad  objectives  of  the   Compulsory

Education  were there, some were concerned about  the  impact

the CE has on madrasah education in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Muslim, I share their concern. I even

understand their fear.  However,





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>





I could not agree with those who questioned the motive behind

CE  and viewed Compulsory Education as a means to effect  the

closure   of  the  madrasahs.   Expressions,  such   as   the

Government has "sinister motive", were reported in the media.

I  am  sad at the atmospherics surrounding the debate on  the

issue.   Some  quarters  had  even  taken  advantage  of  the

prevailing debate in the media and Internet then by  stirring

up  the  emotions and religious sentiments even  though  they

fully  know  that such an approach would not help in  solving

the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, the Malay MPs, who sensed that the issue

had  developed into a political one and that some groups were

trying  to  split  the Muslim ground and putting  the  Muslim

community   on  a  collision  course  with  the   Government,

persuaded the hon. Prime Minister to intervene.  I would like

to  take this opportunity to thank Prime Minister Goh for his

timely  and masterly intervention through dialogues with  the

Muslim community leaders and for his assurance that madrasahs

would not be closed.  My colleagues and I have never believed

for  a moment that CE would result in the end of the madrasah

education.   We  are  nevertheless happy with  the  assurance

given by the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister had continuously kept in close

consultation  with the Malay MPs on the madrasah  issue.   In

one  of  such heart-to-heart discussions, the possibility  of

exempting  the  madrasah from CE was raised.  This  was  then

discussed  in  the dialogue the Prime Minister had  with  the

Muslim  community  leaders and the  proposal  received  their

support.   Now,  the  benchmark has  been  agreed  and  I  am

encouraged to learn that the madrasahs are now focusing their

mind on the need to make the necessary qualitative change  in

their  curriculum to prepare themselves for the inclusion  of

required examinable core subjects at the PSLE level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there are people out there who still have

a lingering doubt about the Government's motive.  If there is

such a doubt, we would certainly be doubly





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>





happy  if the Minister could assure this House again that  it

was  not  the Government's intention to close or  effect  the

closure of the madrasahs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my unwavering belief that religious education

is  important for the Muslim community and it is more so  for

rapidly changing Singapore with all its open characteristics.

However, I strongly believe that it is equally important that

the  Muslims,  just  like  other  people  in  Singapore,   be

sufficiently  and properly equipped to face the  era  of  the

knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, the Muslim community will have to

continue to examine this and other issues related to our well-being.  This is due to the fact that the world is not static.

It is changing and the change is becoming even more rapid and

it  includes the requirements for education.  Upmost  in  our

mind  is  to  ensure the balance between the educational  and

spiritual needs of our community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CE is the manifestation of our desire to carve a

better   future   for   everyone,   Muslim   and   non-Muslim

Singaporeans.   It involves making changes and being  sincere

about  its objective.  I know changes are not easy  to  make,

but our track record shows that if a change is necessary,  we

will  endeavour to effect the change no matter how  difficult

and  how painful it can be.  Time will be the ultimate  judge

on  whether  the  change is beneficial or  otherwise  to  the

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for this opportunity to speak on the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember well the reply that Minister Teo Chee Hean

gave just over a year ago in response to an Oral Question  by

NMP  Mdm Claire Chiang on Compulsory Education.  I agree with

the  response.   With some 97% of our young  already  in  the

national education system at the primary level, there  is  no

pressing need to make education compulsory.  So when Prime





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>





Minister  announced some two months later that the  issue  of

Compulsory Education was to be reconsidered, I was surprised.

However, the Prime Minister went on to explain that,  to  the

Government, the statement that every Singaporean  matters  is

not  merely  a  slogan.   We have the  means  to  give  every

Singaporean child an education.  So we should do it.  In  the

new   economy,  life  would  be  better  for  every  educated

Singaporean and his or her family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision to take another look at the issue of

Compulsory  Education thus has its origin in the  heart,  not

just  in  the  head.   For  everyone  who  thinks  that   the

Government has an ulterior motive, let him or her dispel this

doubt.  The PAP Government cares for the people.  It has  the

interest  of Singapore and every Singaporean at  heart.   Our

children  need  the knowledge to fit into  the  new  economy.

They  also  need the knowledge and experience to  help  build

national  identity  and  cohesion.  These  are  the  two  key

objectives of our national school system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recognising that here are needs that cannot be met

within the national school system, the Bill proposes to allow

some  of  our  young  to be educated outside  of  it.   I  am

confident  that  parents  of these  children  have  a  vested

interest  to  ensure that their children receive  the  needed

knowledge for their future economic wellness.  But  they  may

not  be as concerned about national identity and cohesion or,

most  probably, they do not know what needs  to  be  done  to

ensure that their children grow up to be strong Singaporeans.

Hence,  I  hope  that  the Ministry  would  develop  a  basic

national education syllabus with materials that can  be  used

to  inculcate  this  important integrative  spirit  in  these

children.   The  national education syllabus adopted  by  the

national  school  system  can be adapted  for  this  purpose.

Immersion   programmes  during  vacation  time,  like   those

organised for young Singaporeans living abroad could be  part

of the syllabus.  The Ministry should then make this syllabus

compulsory under clause 4(1).





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a good policy is not only strong in concept, but

also   effective  in  its  implementation  and   enforcement.

Implementation and enforcement will cost money and bodies.  I

presume  the  Ministry  of  Education  will  have  people  to

administer and enforce Compulsory Education.  I believe  that

principals  and  teachers will also get involved,  adding  to

their  responsibilities.  They must be trained  and  prepared

for  the task.  Enforcement will be an issue and effort  must

be  made  to thoroughly investigate each case and  to  ensure

that only those really guilty of neglect are punished.  I  am

assured by the Minister's assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children may not be in school for many reasons. Some

may be family problems and others may be financial in nature.

Making  primary  education compulsory does not  automatically

change  the  financial  ability of  families  to  afford  the

education.   The  Government must recognise  that  in  moving

towards  Compulsory  Education, additional  efforts  will  be

needed  to  help  these  families  register  and  keep  their

children in school.  The efforts will not only be in monetary

terms,  but  also  non-monetary support for the  children  in

their  school work, for example.  The community will be asked

to  do  more,  but the Government must take  the  lead.   The

Government  must  be prepared to provide the  funds  to  help

those  needing financial assistance and to enable  grassroots

and community organisations to provide other support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our parents have done a marvellous job in providing

and  caring for their children.  They must continue  to  take

responsibility for their children's education.  I  hope  that

the  availability of Government and community  assistance  to

parents does not constitute a moral hazard in respect of this

responsibility.  However, given the keen concern and interest

of  parents in general to the education of their children,  I

am  hopeful that making primary education compulsory will not

diminish this sense of responsibility.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Senior Minister of State for Education, Dr Aline

Wong,  and  her  Committee on Compulsory Education  and  many

other  people  and organisations have put in  much  time  and

effort  to study, discuss and understand the issues  involved

in    Compulsory   Education.    Their   contributions   have

strengthened  this Bill.  We owe them thanks for  their  time

and  effort.  Mr Chiam is unfair to cast doubt on the  report

and  therefore the efforts and time of so many people.  Where

is  the  politics?  Anyone reading the report cannot fail  to

see  that  it is an excellent, fair and comprehensive  report

which  is  sensitive to the nature of the Singapore  society.

In  his  speech as a whole, Mr Chiam has in fact agreed  with

the  report.  He only squabbles over some fine details  which

would  after  all change with time and circumstances.   I  am

sure  most  Singaporeans  will  not  agree  with  Mr  Chiam's

criticism of the report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that with over 93% of

each  year's cohort completing secondary education,  we  have

achieved  almost universal education at both the primary  and

secondary  levels.   In making primary education  compulsory,

the  country is putting a lot of efforts for the few who drop

out.  We are doing this because every Singaporean counts.  To

the  PAP Government, this is not merely a slogan.  The  money

and efforts used to make primary education compulsory will be

money  well  spent  and effort well expended.   However,  for

Compulsory   Education  to  work,  society,  especially   our

parents,  must understand and support it.  I urge the  people

to  give  Compulsory  Education for our young  their  fullest

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Firstly, I

would  like  to  inform the House that I am a member  of  the

Committee  on Compulsory Education led by Dr Aline Wong  that

had  made  recommendations to the Government.  I  would  also

like  to  inform Mr Chiam See Tong that although  there  were

five Members of Parliament in the Committee, a number of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>





feedback  and dialogue sessions were conducted and views  and

feedback   from  various  community  groups  were   received.

Therefore, I am unable to understand when he said that  there

is a political motive in the recommendations of the Committee

on Compulsory Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Compulsory Education Bill because it will

ensure  that  children  in  Singapore  will  have  the  basic

education  relevant  to Singapore. We  will  be  facing  keen

competition.   The technologies being used in  companies  are

more  advanced  and they require our workers to  acquire  new

skills in order to work in such companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working world has also changed. As a result of

globalisation,  our  companies  also  need  to  change  their

operational  structure constantly and this  will  affect  our

workers' employability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education offers a basic minimum education

for  every  child  to  face  a new era  based  on  knowledge.

Although I agree that Compulsory Education is meant  for  the

primary  level  at  this  moment, I  believe  those  who  are

involved  in the education of every child, whether  teachers,

parents,  schools  or community leaders, should  ensure  that

every  child  receives a minimum education  up  to  secondary

level.   With  a strong foundation in education,  each  child

will  be  better prepared in receiving quality education  and

acquire  new skills in the years ahead. With this,  they  are

also   able  to  grab  all  opportunities  provided  by   the

Government, the employers or the trade unions, and they  will

also  be  able to benefit from the opportunities provided  by

the ITE, polytechnics or the universities.  In short, what is

emphasised is basic education for life-long learning  and  in

obtaining skills.  This, I believe, is the best way to ensure

that  our children will remain employable when they begin  to

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the recommendations on Compulsory

Education  were  first studied, some members  of  the  Malay-Muslim community had raised their concerns that the madrasahs

will be





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>





closed when this is implemented.  The Committee on Compulsory

Education did not make any recommendation for the closure  of

the  madrasahs.  I am also confident too that the  Government

does  not  intend  to  close  the  madrasahs.   I  hope   the

Government,  as  mentioned by Mr Yatiman,  will  explain  its

policy  on the madrasah system of education. It must give  an

assurance  that  the madrasahs will not  be  closed  and  the

Government does not have the intention to close the madrasahs

by virtue of this Compulsory Education Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government has already announced that

some  schools, eg, the madrasahs, San Yu Adventist and  those

involved  in home-schooling, will be exempted from Compulsory

Education.  Facilities should be provided for the children in

preparing  them for the PSLE examination, together  with  the

other students in their cohort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question is, especially among the madrasahs and

the Malay-Muslim community, what will happen to the madrasahs

when  the  students  are  not  able  to  attain  the  minimum

standard.   I  hope  a  clarification  by  the  Ministry   of

Education  will  help them to understand  how  the  exemption

criteria will be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that science, mathematics and English are

important basic subjects for our children.  Therefore, it  is

important  for  every  student,  who  is  exempted  from  the

national  school under this Compulsory Education  system,  to

sit for the PSLE examination together with their cohort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the Muslim community have earlier given

a  negative  response to CE.  They were  concerned  that  the

madrasahs  will  be closed, and some of them  felt  that  the

Government intends to close the madrasahs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their concern for the future of religious education is

understood:  who will become the religious leaders  who  will

then  educate the Muslim children with the moral and  Islamic

virtues  if  we are unable to produce religious  teachers  in

Singapore





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>





among  ourselves?   This  is a relevant  question  or  issue,

although  some  of  the  bases of  these  questions  are  not

accurate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay-Muslim community will be able to focus

themselves  on how to assist their Malay-Muslim  children  to

receive religious education.  For children whose parents want

them  to  be religious teachers, there are ways in which  the

religious or madrasah leaders can offer them to achieve  this

objective.   But  there  is  also a  group  of  madrasah  and

religious  leaders  who  need to understand  more  about  the

majority  of  the  needs of the Malay-Muslim  children  whose

parents want them to have religious education besides  having

secular education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever had been decided, every community leader and

parent  should be aware of the global changes that had  taken

place,  including  Singapore.  In a knowledge-based  economy,

and   with  globalisation,  the  working  world  has  changed

tremendously.  If we do not equip our children with the basic

education  to  help them to acquire new or additional  skills

for  the  future,  we  would not be  able  to  guarantee  our

children and the country's future.  The children who  do  not

have  a  good  basic education will not be able to  get  good

employment or to learn new knowledge when these are the basic

necessities of survival in a competitive working world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for the Malay-Muslim community in

Singapore  as  well as others is to continue  to  study  such

issues and to bring about a balance between their worldly and

spiritual needs.  We should assist our community in enhancing

their  ability  to discuss this matter at a higher  level  so

that  we  will  be  able to understand  the  challenges  that

Singapore is facing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world that we are facing now is not static. It is

rapidly   changing.   Therefore,  requirements  in  education

should change accordingly.  The Malay-Muslim community should

enhance  the way we educate our children in religion so  that

it





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>





will be in tandem with the changes in this world.  This is to

ensure  that the Malay-Muslim children in Singapore  will  be

able  to  fulfill their educational, employment and spiritual

needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, some members in the Malay-Muslim community

found  that  the  decision of the Prime  Minister  to  exempt

madrasahs  from Compulsory Education is a victory  for  them.

For  me,  this  is  not  a game to  be  won.   In  fact,  the

Compulsory Education system proposed by the Government is  to

assist  or  to  help every child in Singapore, including  the

Malay-Muslim  children,  to be winners  in  this  competitive

world so that their future will be guaranteed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  speak  about  the   wider

implication of this Bill to Singaporeans, especially to those

outside  the Malay-Muslim community.  To me, the  issue  that

has generated a lot of strong and emotional response has been

the issue on madrasahs, and, for this reason, I wish to touch

on a few aspects of this issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been two types of reaction, both outside

and inside the community, and I wish to touch on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people outside the community became very

uncomfortable  about the the way, the zest, in which  Muslims

want to preserve madrasahs, and find that perhaps they cannot

understand  why in this present day and age - it  seems  very

illogical - that Malays want to preserve madrasahs which  are

not producing the kind of educated students that they hope to

achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure these people that this is far from the

truth.   Instead, what they should see is that  Malay-Muslims

in  Singapore,  in  their short history compared  to  Chinese

history,  have  been  able  to  make  economic  progress  and

education  as  a  very important agenda  for  all  of  us  in

Singapore.   And,  I  think,  in that  sense,  we  have  made

tremendous progress.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we need to realise that when we look back, the

Malay  culture has provided quite inadequate examples of  how

education  is  developed in the community.  In fact,  if  you

look  back, a typical Malay-Muslim has to dig far deeper into

his  religious  roots,  because  it  was  Islam  that  really

promoted  education when Islam was first  introduced  in  the

region.   And because of that, it is clear that, not only  to

counter  some  of the social problems that they have,  Malay-Muslims  need to use religion which has motivated its  people

to  really acquire knowledge not only as a choice but  really

as an obligation as Malay-Muslims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the problem seems to be that, in fact, Malay-Muslim religious leaders, and even these Muslim religious

leaders  - non-Malays, Indians and those of Arabic  origin  - have  taken  it  upon  themselves, when they  evangelise,  to

develop  schools.   It is then difficult to  really  separate

what   is  the  religious  motivation,  and  that  of  really

providing secular education in this day and age.  So I  think

the problem really is a question of balance and content - how

can we continue to make sure that Malay-Muslims of the future

and today continue to be inspired to ensure that they acquire

the kind of education but making sure the contents in schools

and  all that could prepare them for the future needs of  the

economy?  In this regard, the Compulsory Education Bill  does

provide an answer for the future, and I hope the sceptics can

see it in this light and give this Bill their full support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reaction from within the community is slightly

different. A lot of people are concerned that the Bill  would

inevitably lead to the closure of madrasahs.  I think this is

where  the  Prime Minister has given assurance.   I  am  very

happy  with the assurance that the Prime Minister  has  given

because  it  has  been made quite clear that while  madrasahs

must  continue to exist, at least to provide for  the  future

leadership  and its religious leadership for the Malay-Muslim

community,  it  is  through madrasahs  that  we  can  produce

religious  leaders for the future.  Whether it will  continue

to produce other scholars outside the religious needs





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>





of  the community is another question.  Here, I would like to

respond  by saying that no amount of institutional  help  can

assure  success  in  this area. Rather, the  success  of  the

madrasahs  should be seen more beyond the point  whether  the

institution  would exist in its artificial sense but  whether

the  future generation of Malay-Muslims will choose madrasahs

as  a  means  of  education to meet both their religious  and

secular  needs,  and  whether students that  go  through  the

system can become useful citizens of the future, not only for

the  needs of the community, but the needs of the country  at

large.  That is a challenge for madrasahs to ensure that they

continue to produce good students for the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that a lot of the members of the

community  tend  to look at the past as a means  to  try  and

defend  and  preserve whatever that is  available.   I  would

rather, if we look at our unique Singaporean way, and the way

that  the Bill has been drafted that we look into the future.

If  we can find a nice blend to ensure madrasahs continue  to

exist,  it is an unique opportunity in fact for Malay-Muslims

in  Singapore not only to solve some of the problems that  we

face,  but  be  an  inspiration and  guide  to  other  Muslim

communities  in  the  region  who  are  also  facing  similar

problems.   There are similar madrasahs in the region.   This

is  where we can look forward and they could be quite  useful

in our contribution to the Malay-Muslim world at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that had caused a bit of controversy of

late,  I must say, has been the issue of what has been termed

collective  leadership.   A  lot  of  community  leaders  and

religious  leaders felt that they want to  play  equal  roles

with  the  Government in ensuring that madrasahs continue  to

survive.   I  respect  their intention and  their  enthusiasm

which  is  very,  very  important  to  ensure  that  this  is

achieved.  However, we have to be very clear on what we  mean

by  collective  leadership.  Elected Members  and  Government

must  be  responsible ultimately for the achievement  of  its

people  and  population, that is, the education  system  must

produce the desired outcome.  NGOs must





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>





be responsible to its members.  It can only be responsible to

its  members.  It cannot be responsible to the population  at

large.   Therefore, its role must be one to support  whatever

existing policies it has or if it does not agree with it,  to

lobby  and  change  and  pursue certain  decisions  that  the

Government would take.  But to call for collective leadership

to  be  equally  responsible is not  relevant  in  this  case

because  when you agree with the policies, that is fine,  but

if  you  do  not  agree,  like what  we  have  seen  in  some

discussions preceding this, who will be responsible, who will

be  accountable?  At  least for the Government,  you  have  a

choice.  If you do not meet the desired outcome, you can vote

them out.  But I do not see how you can exercise those rights

if  this responsibility is given to a group of people  to  be

responsible to take the community forward.  This is an  issue

which  has generated a lot of debate recently but I  wish  to

put  this issue in perspective. At the end of the day, it  is

the  Government  and the Minister, together  with  the  other

Elected  MPs, who will have to decide.  I am sure  that  they

are  responsible  to ensure the outcome.  To have  collective

leadership, to me, is irrelevant at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wish to touch on two other points, and one is

about  the assurance.  Although the Prime Minister has  given

assurance  to the Malay-Muslim community, I personally  would

have  preferred  a more concrete assurance  in  the  form  of

legislation,  in  the sense that this Bill should  have  been

more specific about what it sees as the role of madrasahs, at

least  to  continue  to  provide  education  for  the  future

religious leaders.  If that can be preserved, I think we  are

quite  happy  about it.  I am sure some may come  up  in  the

subsidiary legislation but I would prefer a bit more concrete

assurance  from  the Minister on how he sees  the  status  of

madrasahs today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to make is that there has

been  a  lot of zest and enthusiasm among a lot of people  in

the  community  to want to play a part or at least  influence

the teaching of religion in





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>





school.    I   would   like  to  ask  the  Minister   whether

representatives  from  the  community  can  be  put  on   the

Compulsory Education Board because this is where we  can  see

some  participation.  Like I say, you cannot have  collective

leadership   but  you  can  have  very  strong  participatory

involvement  in  this  process.  And because  the  Compulsory

Education  Board is formed, their involvement  in  the  Board

would send a very strong signal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing to say that we hope the madrasahs would

continue  to prosper, but it is another thing to do something

to  ensure that it prospers.  The madrasahs need to be a  bit

more well-funded. The facilities are usually not so good. The

teachers are not that well-paid.  How more assistance can  be

directed  to ensure their continued survival, maybe  not  for

all,  but  at least for some selected madrasahs, is something

that  may be necessary at this stage. The madrasahs  must  be

given  the  vital ingredients to ensure success.  By  leaving

them  on their own, I am afraid the success of the madrasahs'

survival might be quite questionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I observe a small loophole in the case of home-school. I would like to ask the Minister how that exemption

would  be  exercised because in other countries, in Malaysia,

for  example,  it  is  very hard  for  them.   You  can  stop

madrasahs  but you cannot stop pondok schools,  five  or  six

fellows  in a small corner being tutored by one person.  That

could  be  interpreted as home school as well.  In a  way,  a

small  madrasah can emerge out of home school, and  how  that

will be seen by the authorities as they seek for exemption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, I thought I would join the debate at this juncture

because  there  have been some issues raised  about  madrasah

education which I think, as the Minister-in-charge of  Muslim

Affairs, I ought to address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Messrs Yatiman, Hawazi and

Zulkifli for their support of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>





the Bill.  The three speakers had alluded to the concerns and

sentiments of the Malay-Muslim community about madrarsahs and

the  fear  whether Compulsory Education will really mean  the

demise  of the madrasahs or whether it is one of Government's

ploy  to  close  the madrasahs.  In actual  fact,  Government

recognises  the importance of madrasahs for the  Muslims  and

the   importance   of   religious  education   for   Muslims.

Therefore, it was never the intention of Government to  close

down   madrasahs  and  far  from  Compulsory   Education   or

legislation  being  a  reason or  an  excuse  to  close  down

madrasahs.   The  Prime Minister himself  had  several  times

assured  the  community  that it was never  the  Government's

intention  to  close  down madrasahs.  And  at  two  specific

meetings  with  the  madrasahs  and  other  stakeholders   of

madrasah education, Prime Minister reiterated the point,  and

I  would  also like, on behalf of the Government to reiterate

the  point  again  here, that it was never the  intention  of

Government to close down madrasahs and there was no  ploy  to

close down madrasahs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the input and feedback from the community, the

Government has agreed to exempt madrasahs from the Compulsory

Education  system,  provided that they meet  certain  minimum

PSLE  benchmarks  which they themselves would  have  set  and

which  they  themselves would have to agree to. So  far,  the

madrasahs  have  agreed  to certain benchmarks  and  that  is

something  that  they will adhere to and  hopefully  that  is

something  which, as time progresses, they will increase;  in

other words, make the benchmark higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I empathise with the concern of the community and also

agree with the views of Mr Yatiman and Mr Hawazi on the  need

for  the  madrasah  students not only  to  acquire  religious

instructions and education, but also for madrasahs to produce

enough  religious  scholars and religious  teachers  for  the

future.   But,  at  the same time, we must also  ensure  that

madrasah  students receive at least some basic  education  to

ensure  that they will be able to prepare themselves for  the

coming knowledge-based economy.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, you have heard of Government's intention

to  assist one particular madrasah by facilitating some funds

to  be  given  to  it so that it could be assured  of  having

enough  good teachers to ensure that the students  are  being

taught well in English, Mathematics and Science.  On my part,

I had also formed a Madrasah Steering Committee last June and

to-date,  they  have had three meetings. The  most  immediate

task which they had to do was to decide on the PSLE benchmark

which  they  did.  Apart from that, the Committee would  also

look  into the curriculum of the madrasahs, not only  of  the

assisted  one,  but  also of the other five.  There  are  six

madrasahs  in  all.  They will also look into  the  necessary

training  of  the teachers to ensure that they  are  equipped

with  the  necessary knowledge to teach English,  Mathematics

and Science properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steering Committee would also look into financial

help.  This is what the Nominated Member alluded to about the

kind  of  help that could be given to madrasahs.  We will  be

looking  into  the financial aspect of not only the  assisted

madrasahs  but also the other madrasahs, in other words,  all

the  six madrasahs, to ensure that they will be provided with

sufficient funds so that they can carry out a proper  system,

have  enough  trained teachers in order to achieve  the  twin

goals  of producing religious teachers and also, at the  same

time,  providing  themselves with enough basic  education  to

prepare  them  for the knowledge-based age.   As  the  Member

rightly  mentioned,  we  have to  provide  a  proper  balance

between  the  economic  and the spiritual  for  the  madrasah

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Committee will also look into the management

of  madrasahs  to  ensure  that they are  professionally  and

properly  managed  so that they would fit themselves,  as  it

were, into the whole Compulsory Education environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would like to urge the community to

look  forward,  instead of dwelling on  the  past  about  the

concerns and worries.  I think we have gone beyond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



that.  The  thing to do now is to look forward and to  ensure

that  we  set  up the system and infrastructure so  that  the

madrasahs  will be able to deliver and achieve a balance,  as

the  Member  mentioned  earlier, between  the  needs  of  the

economy and the spiritual needs of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the representation on the Compulsory Education

Board,  I will leave it to my colleague, RAdm Teo, to answer.

As  to  the comment on AMP's collective leadership  issue,  I

think it is beyond this debate for us to discuss.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

since  time immemorial, bringing up children has always  been

the  responsibility  of the parents. There  is  a  well-known

Chinese  saying  that  "If a child  is  brought  up  but  not

educated,  the fault lies with the father." This  has  become

the  philosophy adopted by most parents in the upbringing  of

their  children.  Moreover, parents nowadays  have  a  common

expectation  that  their children would  grow  up  to  become

somebody  of importance and to do well in life.   The  future

progress  and prosperity of the nation depends on whether  we

could  comprehensively raise the level  and  quality  of  the

education of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of the people and the future of our

nation,  the Government has been devoting substantial  energy

and resources to develop our education system.  Well-equipped

primary and secondary schools with full facilities are  built

all  over the island, to ensure that every child in Singapore

will  have  the  opportunity  to receive  a  holistic  formal

education in comfortable school campuses.   This benefits not

only our own people but also attracts a lot of foreigners  to

try  all means to send their children to Singapore to receive

our primary and secondary education.  Therefore, I am puzzled

and saddened by the fact that some parents are still refusing

to  send  their children to school to receive the most  basic

primary education.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a progressive and civilised country, we have all the

conditions   and  responsibilities  to  ensure   that   every

Singaporean  child would be given the opportunity  to  go  to

school happily, like all the children in their neighbourhood,

and  to  enjoy an enriching school life.  This is  a  special

privilege of the children of every Singapore citizen, and the

happiness  they are entitled to enjoy.   I therefore  support

the  Bill  to  prevent irresponsible parents  from  depriving

their children of the opportunity to receive formal education

in   school,  thereby  causing  them  to  face  the   serious

consequences  later  on in life when  they  want  to  go  for

further studies or look for employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Second Reading speech, the

Minister for Education pointed out the two key objectives  of

the  Compulsory  Education Bill. The first objective  is   to

give  our  children  a  common core of knowledge  which  will

provide  a  strong  foundation  for  further  education   and

training  to prepare them for a knowledge-based economy.   On

this point, I feel that Compulsory Education should be for  a

period  of  10  years rather than just six years  of  primary

education. In the era of new economy and new technologies, in

order  to make a living in  society, a  child should have  at

least 10 years of education in primary and secondary schools.

At the moment, the majority in our workforce has only primary

school education. They  have to depend on the Government  and

the  enterprises to provide them with  opportunities for  re-education in order to upgrade their level of knowledge.   The

long-term  solution  is to implement 10 years  of  Compulsory

Education  to  lay down a strong educational  foundation  for

everybody,  thereby generally raising his or her  educational

level.   In  this  way, we would not have to spend  too  much

time, energy and money later on to provide the remedies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we should also pay special attention

to  children  of  special  needs,  such  as  the  handicapped

children, mentally handicapped or otherwise.  They should  be

given the opportunity to a longer period of education so that

they could have more support and a stronger





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>





foundation  to enable them to become self-reliant in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key objective that the Minister for Education

seeks   to  reinforce  is  to  give  our  children  a  common

educational  experience  which will help  to  build  national

identity and cohesion.  This is a very noble political ideal,

but  it  is  not  easy  for every young child  to  grasp  and

comprehend this ideal within a short period of six  years  in

the primary school.  On this basis, I would like to reiterate

that  it  is  all  the  more  necessary  for  our  Compulsory

Education to be fixed at 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the objective of education is not

confined  to imparting knowledge and cultivating a  sense  of

belonging of the people.  A  sound and ideal education system

should embody a clear and firm goal to inculcate in our  next

generation the correct outlook on life, moral values and good

traditional and cultural values that have been passed on from

generation to generation before us. These excellent qualities

will  enable our children and their children to have  rounded

physical  and spiritual development, so that they would  have

the strong will power to counter any undesirable influence or

emerging challenges in the new age.  In the absence  of  this

objective, any form of Compulsory Education will  not  go  to

the  root  of  the  matter to effectively  inspire  the  next

generation  to  strive to achieve greater  success  in  life,

thereby enhancing the quality of education of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to urge the Ministry of Education

to  avoid  putting too much emphasis on science,  mathematics

and  technical  knowledge  at the expense  of   physical  and

spiritual  development and moral education  when  formulating

policies   and  curriculum  for  the  primary  and  secondary

schools.   The  Government intends to increase its  education

budget  from the present $6 billion or 3.6% of GDP  to   $7.5

billion  or  4.5%  of  GDP.   I hope  that  the  Ministry  of

Education  will be resolute in putting into optimum  use  the

rich resources to fortify the important task in this respect,

and to ensure that every





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>





Singaporean  child  is  provided  with  10  years  of   free,

compulsory  and  effective  basic education,  in  order  that

Singapore  will  continue  to enjoy  sustained  progress  and

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.



<br>4.38 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, nowadays, it is trendy for people to talk about

the  "new economy".  Every day, in the newspapers, we read  a

lot  of reports or articles on the new economy.  Recently,  I

read  in  the newspapers that Dr Tan Chin Nam, the  Permanent

Secretary of the Ministry of Manpower described this  era  as

the "new economy era", one which   requires a high degree  of

transparency and a brand-new environment to get things  done.

It is under this new environment that we are debating here on

the question of Compulsory Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many foreigners who do not know Singapore well, they

think  that we are very backward and remote.  They may  think

that many children in Singapore are not attending school  and

that  is  why  the  Government has  to  introduce  Compulsory

Education  now.   In fact, we have 97% of students  in  every

cohort   registering  for enrolment to the  primary  schools.

This  percentage is comparable to Australia, Hong Kong, Korea

and  Taiwan which have introduced compulsory education  many,

many  years ago.  In the Chinese community in Singapore, many

people   told  me   that  they  thought  there  was   already

Compulsory Education in Singapore.  They feel that it is  not

necessary  to  introduce legislation to  make  education  for

children  compulsory in Singapore.  As a matter of  fact,  in

Singapore, most parents have brought upon themselves  to  see

to  it  that  their children not only  go to a  good  primary

school, but even to a renowned kindergarten before that.   It

is  not uncommon to see  many parents queuing up overnight to

get   a   place  for  their  children  in  the  more  popular

kindergartens.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, when we are talking about Compulsory

Education,  our  main  concern is  on  the  3%  who  are  not

receiving  formal  education under our mainstream  education,

and  how they are going to face the future challenges in  the

new economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill and the recommendation of the

Committee  on  Compulsory Education that those attending  the

madrasahs  and  San  Yu  Adventist School  be  exempted  from

Compulsory  Education.  In a multi-racial and multi-religious

society, racial harmony and inter-religious tolerance have to

be  exercised. This has been entrenched in the recommendation

of the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Compulsory Education of six years is practical,

not 10 years or 12 years.  The reason is very simple, because

we are a progressive society.  We are upgrading ourselves all

the  time.   As  it  is,  only 3% of each  cohort  failed  to

register  for  places  in the primary schools  in  Singapore.

There  are actually more than 80% in each cohort who  go  all

the  way to complete their secondary education, and more than

60% completed their tertiary education.  It is envisaged that

these percentages will be further improved every year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small group of students drop out after primary school.

They  either do not want to study or lack the ability  to  do

so.   If we force them to remain in school, there will  be  a

lot  of  difficulties administratively and in the enforcement

of  discipline  on  them. This is one  consideration  of  the

Committee when debating on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of families in Singapore support

Compulsory Education.  In a feedback dialogue session that  I

conducted, most of the people feel that there should be 6  to

10  years of Compulsory Education.  Nominated Member  Mr  Tay

Beng  Chuan  has suggested 10 years.  I believe this  is  the

collective view of the Chinese community in Singapore.   Most

of  the  representatives  of the  Chinese  community  in  the

dialogue session felt that we  should not be too harsh with





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>





parents  who  violated  the provisions under  the  Compulsory

Education  Act.   We should look into the   circumstances  of

each  and every case.   If the children do not wish to study,

there  is nothing  their parents, the principal and even  the

police could do to confine them in the school.  Therefore, it

is  no  point setting up an impractical target.  I  think  we

should   have  a  more  realistic  target.   I  support   the

recommendation of six years' Compulsory Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of the new economy is affecting every

sector of our society.  Those who are not adequately equipped

are  blaming themselves for not having enough education,  and

life is difficult for them.  Yet, in the new economy, even if

we  are well educated, we are not guaranteed a good job.  The

computer,  the   Internet  and information  technology   have

changed our whole competitive environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we said that Government policies changed

very  fast  -  "One small change every three years,  and  one

big  change  every five years."   But now,  in  the  IT  era,

changes  are taking place every day.  The new environment  is

changing   very  rapidly.   Compulsory  Education   will   be

implemented in Singapore in three years' time.  By that  time

we  cannot  predict what will be the competitive  environment

then.   But  one  thing we can say for sure is  that  if  our

younger  generation  of  students  do  not  have  the   basic

knowledge in mathematics, English and science, they will  not

be able to cope with the many challenges in  the new economy.

Therefore,  I  suggest  that when the Ministry  of  Education

start  to  implement Compulsory Education, they  should  also

anticipate  the problems that will follow the implementation.

There  is  a  Chinese  saying to the  effect  that  when  you

encounter  difficulties,  you  make  changes  and  look   for

alternatives.  Once  you  find  the  right  alternative,  the

problem is solved. In other words, we make changes when there

are  difficulties.  Even when we have started implementation,

we have to make changes to adapt to the new circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong alleged that almost all members in the

Committee are PAP





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>





Members.   I  do not agree with him.  If he bothers  to  read

this  Report  of  the  Committee on Compulsory  Education  in

Singapore,   he will see that more than half of  the  members

constituting the Committee are educationists.  Even  for  the

Members  of Parliament who are in the Committee, we represent

different    communities  in our society.   For  example,  Mr

Hawazi  represents the Malay community and  I  represent  the

Chinese community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing Compulsory Education, the emphasis of

the  Ministry  of Education should be on how  to  reduce  the

attrition  rate  in the secondary schools  and  the  tertiary

institutions.   We  always lament the  lack  of  talents  and

emphasise   that  everybody  has  opportunities  to   improve

themselves  in Singapore.  Compulsory Education  will  ensure

that  every Singapore student has an equal opportunity to  be

educated to meet with the challenges of the new economy.  So,

if  the Ministry of Education can do something to reduce  the

attrition  rate  in the secondary and tertiary  levels,  then

more people will benefit from the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in  support  of the Compulsory Education Bill  moved  by  the

Minister for Education.  First and foremost, it is my  belief

that  this  Bill is quite overdue, considering  that  we  are

already  plugged to the globalised world and  also  the  fact

that  we  are  reasonably aware of the  dramatic  changes  in

education  happening in the United States and other  advanced

economies.  But as the saying goes, it is better late and, in

our case, perhaps slightly late, than never.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the importance of providing an increasingly higher

quality  of  education  that could  enable  all  children  to

succeed  in  their  future careers is  becoming  increasingly

apparent.   The amount and quality of education an individual

receives  not  only  affects his earnings  but,  increasingly

evident, the quality of his employment as well.  According to

Jacob Mincer in





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>





his  book  Studies  in Human Capital, educated  workers  have

three  advantages relative to less educated  workers.   These

are  higher  wages, greater employment stability and  greater

upward mobility in income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two factors which contribute to increased

earnings  of  workers with higher education levels  -  first,

increased  human capital results in higher productivity  that

allows workers to earn higher wages. Second, higher education

levels  in turn increase labour force participation, decrease

the  probability  of  unemployment,  and  also  decrease  job

turnover. It follows, therefore, that highly educated workers

put  in  a greater number of hours annually for higher hourly

wages   in   comparison  to  less  educated   labour   market

competitors.  In other words, higher wages for better quality

jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore transforms into a knowledge-based and

information-driven  economy,  it  is  imperative  that   high

quality  education  ranks  high  in  our  priorities.  It  is

inevitable  that income gaps will widen, but we  must  ensure

that  a  quality  education  is  secured  for  all  children,

including  those from disadvantaged backgrounds,  to  prevent

the emergence of an underclass in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proven in advanced economies that the more

education  individuals  acquire, the  better  will  be  their

likelihood  to absorb new information, acquire new  knowledge

and  skills and familiarise themselves with new technologies.

By  investing in human capital, workers are able to  increase

their  labour  productivity and that of  other  capital  they

employ at their workplace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If increased productivity reflects higher levels of

human  capital,  which are primarily a  result  of  increased

education, it follows that a positive relationship is  likely

between  educational  attainment  and  earnings.  The  United

States  Census Bureau, in its 1998 study of individuals  aged

25  and  older  by  educational attainment, reported  that  a

bachelor's  degree  holder tends to earn US$20,000  more  per

annum compared to the average high school graduate.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the investment costs of education, evidence

in  the US again indicates that a tremendous increase in  the

value of schooling has occurred since 1979.  According  to  a

private study by two researchers at Princeton University, the

return  to an additional year of education rose from 6.2%  in

1979  to about 10% as far back as 1993. Recent trends in  the

new  economy clearly show that the demand for high levels  of

human  capital  is  steadily  rising,  which  correspondingly

increase the future financial returns to education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also other intangible benefits tied to

the effect of better and higher quality education. Apart from

increased   earnings,  individuals  with  higher  educational

qualifications  also tend to look after their  health  better

than  those  with lower education. They tend to  protect  the

investment   in  themselves  by  taking  greater   preventive

measures  to  increase  the  probability  of  better  health.

Individual initiatives such as regular annual medical  check-ups,  proper eating habits and regular exercise can  also  be

looked  upon  as  investments in  the  maintenance  of  human

capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of education is usually also extended to

their  loved  ones. There is generally a positive association

between  an individual's level of schooling and his  family's

health status and overall well-being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on education of the last several decades

has  enabled  Singaporeans  to be  better  fathers,  mothers,

children,  citizens  and responsible  voters.  Investment  in

education   has   also   generated  positive   "neighbourhood

effects",  ie,  outcomes that yield significant  benefits  to

others. As Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman puts it, "a  stable

and democratic society is impossible without a minimum degree

of  literacy  and knowledge on the part of the  citizens  and

without  widespread acceptance of some common set of  values.

Education can contribute to both."





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also strong correlation between educational

attainment  and items associated with a stable and democratic

society,  ie,  informed  and interested  voters.  The  better

people  are educated, the more they want to be kept  informed

about  the  issues and the environment surrounding them,  and

the more active will be their interest in public affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the advent of the new knowledge-based economy is

rapidly  evolving a new kind of information fabric  in  which

learning, working and playing co-mingle with each other.  The

World   Wide  Web,  in  particular,  is  proving  to   be   a

transformative medium, as important as electricity was  first

discovered more than a century ago.  Most noticeable  is  the

fact  that  the Web is two-way, in contrast with the  one-way

media  we  have  all  been familiar  with  -  from  books  to

newspapers  to television. It combines the one-way  reach  of

broadcast  with  the two-way reciprocity of a  mid-cast.  Its

user  can  at  once be a receiver and sender of  "broadcast".

This  will  present a new set of dimensions and shifts  along

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first has to do with literacy and how it is

evolving. Literacy today is not only concerned with text  but

also  image  and  screen literacy. This new literacy,  beyond

text and image, is concerned with information navigation. The

real literacy of tomorrow entails the ability to be one's own

personal  reference  librarian -  to  know  how  to  navigate

through  complex  and  confusing data  and  information,  and

feeling comfortable about doing so. "Navigation", Sir, may be

the main form of literacy in this new 21st century we are in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next dimension concerns learning. We are all

accustomed to formal learning in a lecture-oriented classroom

setting.  Now,  with  large amounts of information  available

through  the Web, we are finding a new kind of learning  that

is  assuming pre-eminence - learning that is discovery-based.

We  are constantly discovering new things, new information as

we surf and browse through the emergent digital libraries.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know the Minister for Education and his Ministry

are  doing  everything  within their  means  to  prepare  our

children  for  these new dimensions. This Bill is  therefore,

important and I cannot imagine anyone not supporting  it.  It

is  clearly  noted in the Bill that one of the key objectives

is to equip our children with a strong educational foundation

that  will  enable  them to pursue life long  learning  in  a

knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is for madrasah students who will be given

exemption from Compulsory Education. While I truly appreciate

the  Government's sensitivity in accommodating the  needs  of

the   Muslim  community  to  exempt  madrasah  students  from

Compulsory   Education,  I  am  worried  of  the   madrasah's

readiness  to  evolve an infrastructure that  can  adequately

prepare  Muslim  children to confront  the  KBE  environment.

Passing the PSLE is one thing but whether madrasahs can bring

about  a  learning  environment that  can  simulate  national

primary schools, which incorporate the latest in teaching and

learning  techniques, is another. This is a choice  that  the

community  has  made and as such, it must take responsibility

to  ensure that the madrasah system is reviewed and  revamped

so  that  they produce students who are not only  religiously

inclined  but  also  can comfortably co-exist  in  a  rapidly

changing economic and global environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other concerns I have, such as the need to have

religious  teachers who are also proficient  in  science  and

mathematics  and  who could relate with a  globalised  world,

have  already  been  addressed by the  Minister-in-charge  of

Muslim  Affairs and prior speakers in this House or in  other

forums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, investment in human capital enables

individuals  to  increase their future earnings  and  enhance

their  employability in the job market.  In the  information-driven  and  knowledge-based economy  of  the  21st  century,

education is of paramount importance. Investment in education

leads  to  enhanced  productivity  and  paves  the  way   for

individuals to





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>





become  more  responsible citizens and  parents,  apart  from

being better workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the Compulsory

Education Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be quite brief

in  what  I have to say.  There is no doubt, of course,  that

this  Bill  is  long overdue.  But may I  say  that  this  is

another  instance  of  the  PAP Government  introducing  half

measures to meet the problems confronted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last sitting of Parliament I moved a motion on

the growing gap between the rich and the poor, and I referred

to  the  measures  that the Prime Minister announced  at  his

National Day Rally as lollipop measures totally inadequate to

meet  the  problem that had arisen.  Similarly, I think  this

Bill is a half measure.  Why do I say this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other speakers have referred to the period of six years.

We  in  the Workers' Party have called, way back in  1987  or

even  earlier,  for  a minimum of 10-year education  for  our

children.  Now, 13 to 14 years later, Government still  talks

about  a  6-year minimum education.  May I ask  how  is  just

primary   education  going  to  prepare  our  children,   our

citizens,  for  the 21st century?  Is that enough?   We  have

heard  a  speaker or two talk about the quality of education,

about  the  need  for our children to be  better  and  higher

educated.   Is  primary  education  adequate?   Why  are   we

stopping  with  primary education?  Why should  they  not  be

extended further?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fact is about the quality. Mr Chiam has

referred  to  the  Committee  which  sat  to  consider   this

Compulsory   Education   Bill   as   consisting   mainly   of

politicians.  We have called, again for a long  time,  for  a

Commission to be appointed to inquire into the whole purpose,

the  why and wherefore of education, a Commission which would

receive   representations  from  parents   who   are   widely

interested  in  the  education of their  children,  from  any

member of the society who is interested, and then come





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>





up  with  what  they  think should be the education  for  our

children in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli talked about collective responsibility but

he   seemed  to  be  asking  what  is  meant  by  "collective

responsibility".  He was suggesting that it has to be left to

the   Government   or   to  the  leaders.    The   collective

responsibility  lies with our people.  It  is  they  who  are

responsible in the end, not the Government or a Committee  or

a  few  people,  but our people as a whole.   The  collective

responsibility  lies  with them.  So they  should  have  been

consulted  on this. There should have been a public  hearing,

representations received from people who are interested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is this. Some speakers have spoken

about  the  difficulties parents may have  in  sending  their

children  to  school,  and  one of  them  of  course  is  the

financial   restraint,  straitened  financial  circumstances.

This  Bill will not achieve its purpose unless, at  the  same

time, the Government announces its readiness to take over the

education  bill  for  our citizens, particularly  in  primary

schools.   I do not want to be told that education  is  free,

but  what they pay is for something else.  I think we  should

stop  all this pretence of education being free in Singapore.

We  should  assure  parents that there  will  be  no  payment

required  at  all  for anything if they wish  to  send  their

children  to  school, at least at the primary  school  level.

Can  we  not find the money for that?  It is only if  we  are

prepared to go that far, can we say that we are really intent

with one purpose, with one mind, to see that all our children

are  better  educated and prepared for the future  that  lies

ahead of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I finally touch on this drafting problem, if I may

say  so, and that is the Director-General is given permission

to  exempt  any  child  if the parent  submits  a  prescribed

reason.   No  guidance is given as to what is the  prescribed

reason  for  which the parents may be exempted.  Should  that

not be spelt out?  At least,





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>





should  it  not say that families whose household  income  is

below  $1,500 will be given free education, if  that  is  the

reason  put  forward by parents that they may have  financial

difficulties or problems in sending their children to school?

So  I  would  urge  the  Government  to  rethink  about  this

Compulsory  Education Bill and to bring in a full measure  to

provide  free  education  for  children  of  families   whose

household  income is below $1,500 a month and,  at  the  same

time,  to  rethink whether primary education is good  enough.

Should  our  children not deserve a bit more  than  just  the

primary education?



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

would like to raise several interconnected issues relating to

first,  the  objective; second, the duration; and third,  the

coverage and content of Compulsory Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the context of a broader discussion on how to

sharpen Singapore's global competitiveness, the Minister  for

Education  must be congratulated for taking a fresh  approach

towards  a  range of issues which impact on the  learnability

and  creativity  of  students  from  pre-school  to  tertiary

levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of Compulsory Education being introduced at

this juncture is therefore timely.  I want to thank the Prime

Minister  for  paving  the way.  This will  be  a  millennium

initiative which he will be remembered for.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>5.05 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bewilders me still, Sir, is the rationale for

fixing  the compulsoriness up to Primary 6 only.  As  several

categories  of  children are already exempted,  the  cut  off

level is not a relevant issue for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for those who have no reasons to be exempted,

how  is  six  years of primary level education sufficient  to

make a person prepared in any way to





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>





meet  even  the  most basic challenges of our knowledge-based

economy?  There is no need for me to convince this House that

a  12-year  old is not equipped to face the real world.   For

those of us who are parents to teenage children, we know that

the ages between 13 and 16 years are critical formative years

when  teenagers  need good instruction, strong  guidance  and

enforced discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Committee on Compulsory Education in

July  2000 showed that in 1997, there were a total  of  1,677

children  not  registered with national  schools  or  special

education  schools  at  the  end of  Primary  1  registration

exercise.   Apart from those living or studying overseas,  or

schooling  in  madrasahs, private schools  or  enjoying  home

tuition,  there  remained 700 children who were  deprived  of

education  due  to  family-related  or  individual  problems.

Other than these unregistered children, there are about 2,000

premature  school leavers every year, the majority  are  from

secondary schools and about 200 are primary school drop-outs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Compulsory Education policy, as it is,

will  affect or sanction a student population of only 200  at

the primary level while there are more than a thousand at the

secondary level who will fall out of this policy net.   These

are  unlikely the exact numbers as there will be  more  drop-outs whom we could not track.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill, no adult, including parents or an

institution,  is empowered to compel a recalcitrant  teenager

to  go  back  to school to get the common core knowledge  for

further   education  and  an  educational  experience   which

provides  them  an  outlook in life that  serves  as  rudders

against  an uncertain future.  They are the likely candidates

for  becoming  dysfunctional adults.  In  many  countries  in

Europe,  the current debate is about keeping children  longer

in school up to 19 years so that the right social outlook and

values  can be inculcated to prepare their youths  for  life,

not simply to score 288 points in PSLE examinations!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the Bill, as it is, falls short of

targetting the student population which





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>





is  more problematic and critical in our overall concern with

manpower   shortage  and  a  growing  digital  divide.    The

objective of this Compulsory Education Bill is hence  limited

in scope and myopic in reach, because it fails to send out  a

strong enough signal that a minimum education of at least  10

years  to  the equivalent of an 'O' level is what a Singapore

youth  must  be assured of and be equipped with to  meet  the

challenges of the knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not having had a Compulsory Education Bill for so many

years,  if  we  now  adopt one, it should not  be  to  simply

redress   past  oversights,  but  to  signal  our   society's

intentions for the future.  If we had this one chance to  fix

a  policy, why not aim for the ideal?  Why instead settle for

pragmatic  compromises, an incremental tweaking of a  policy?

And  for those who say that the State should not compel young

people to do things and it should be left to the family, then

why do we have laws governing the social behaviour of minors,

such  as  smoking and drinking?  I would in fact  argue  that

sanctions  regarding  minimum levels of  education  are  more

important  and have longer and lasting impact than  sanctions

on smoking and drinking!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, parents have the moral responsibility to make

sure  that  they  have the best interests of their  child  at

heart  by  sending them to school.  However, on a  matter  as

significant as education which is the cornerstone  of  nation

building and considering the huge sums of capital as well  as

human  resource investment involved, the State has to  assume

the  primary role in shaping the direction and management  of

the educational experiences of youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong, since the enforcement of Compulsory

Education up to Form 3 secondary level 20 years ago, only one

case  has  been brought to court and the parent was convicted

with a fine of HK$400.  The student resumed school after  the

sentence.   In  the  past 10 years, 23 warning  letters  were

issued to parents who failed to bring their children back to





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>





school without reasonable excuse.  No court proceedings  were

necessary  because all parents complied with the requirements

of the attendance orders.  This information was obtained from

the  Education  and Manpower Bureau in December  1999.   Sir,

only with a Compulsory Education policy can we guarantee that

a  youth will stay in school to be protected from the  snares

of  street gangs.  By compelling parents to act, a compulsory

school   education   restores,   not   take   away   parental

responsibility.   And  if  finance  is  an  issue,  let   the

community  step  in to help.  Judging from  the  pocket  fund

initiative   organised  by  the  Straits  Times   -   and   I

congratulate  their success - we note that  Singaporeans  are

generous  and  they will contribute to help a child  get  the

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to rethink the extent of coverage

of  this  policy and if this House today so decides that  the

Bill  is  sufficient, and I am a reluctant consenter  to  it,

then  I would request for serious intervention effort by  the

school  administrators to reinforce counselling  services  in

schools or work with parents and neighbourhood VWOs to  track

school  leavers at the secondary level to try to  bring  them

back to school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that schools are already working hard toward this

direction, and projects like Project Bridge organised by  the

National  Youth Council are targeting this problematic  youth

segment.  But I also know that their effort will be  all  the

more  effective and fruitful if they are backed by  a  strong

Government policy and adequate community resources  committed

to   upholding  a  compulsory  policy.   The  importance   of

continuing  secondary school in reforming young offenders  is

shown  in  studies  on  the  after-conduct  of  a  cohort  of

probationers.   The  report published by MCDS  in  July  1999

showed  that  probationers  with post-primary  education  had

consistently higher completion rates than those with  primary

education, and those with upper secondary education were more

likely





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>





than  those with lower secondary education to complete  their

probation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we commit resources to provide for youth

drop-outs  to  attend  some  kind  of  courses  or   academic

institutions which are able to help them realise  their  life

interests   apart   from  pure  academic   pursuits.    Here,

Compulsory Education at the secondary level would take  on  a

more  flexible perspective.  As long as a teenager  under  16

who  dropped  out  of  a  mainstream school  due  to  various

personal,  family  and  academic  reasons,  continues  to  be

engaged   in   an   accredited  teaching   institution,   not

necessarily  government-run secondary  schools,  to  learn  a

skill,  a vocation, an art or other subjects of interest,  he

or  she  has  more of a chance to become a useful and  worthy

Singaporean  in the long run.  Denmark's continuation  school

and  liberal  education  curriculum  catering  to  youths  of

diverse needs and aptitudes as well as a diverse programme in

challenging  the  gifted and building the capacities  of  the

average  student  in  the  US are  good  case  studies  worth

learning from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By creating more teaching and learning institutions of a

broader  range to meet the diverse and changing  expectations

of  the  growing  numbers of "Generation  Y"  youth  -  those

currently  under  20  years old - we  will  not  risk  losing

precious   human   resources  due  to  a  restricted   school

assessment   structure,  but  instead   we   will   gain   by

complementing the mainstream education structure  with  other

flexible,   open   curriculum   which   taps   the   multiple

intelligences and interests of our young population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also clearly uphold the fundamental principle of

meritocracy  which our society thrives on and that  is  -  to

each  according to his or her own capability; and live up  to

the  S21  promise  that  everyone  counts,  by  helping  each

individual  structures  his or her  learning.   This  is  one

critical step in bridging the digital divide between the more-educated and the less-educated in a KBE.  It achieves  in  an

overall  sense,  an  even higher level goal  beyond  economic

ones, that is, the goal of educating for the good society.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the exemption of children who have

disabilities  or  special  needs.  I  agree  that  Compulsory

Education  must have exemptions as long as we  put  in  place

safeguards on setting the appropriate standards.  However,  I

would  like  to know how is the term "children  with  special

needs"  being  defined.  How do we balance the  judgement  of

parents  with that of an educationist or vice versa,  in  the

case  of  a  marginal  child who has merely  slower  learning

capabilities but not limiting enough to stay home or attend a

school  for the mentally challenged?  The Bill is  silent  in

defining this category and in imposing restrictions on  those

parents who neglect to send their children under the cover of

giving them "home tuition".  Will the Ministry of Education's

experts  be  the final decision-maker, or a panel of  outside

experts?  It would be useful to have this spelled out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to read in the Straits Times an informative

reply  by  Mrs  Mok Choon Hoe from the Ministry of  Education

about the development of nine more schools for children  with

special needs.  It reflects the Ministry's strong signal that

the  State regards them as a precious resource and  does  not

shirk  from  its responsibility in giving them the  education

that they rightly deserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that some of these schools are built next to

the mainstream national schools to minimise the social stigma

and   exclusion   of   children  already  disadvantaged,   by

encouraging some designated area of shared activity and study

to  enhance peer interaction and motivation.  Another concept

of  a  satellite  school, meaning a special school  within  a

school  catering  to  the  moderately  handicapped  class  of

children who will not benefit from the segregated schools for

the  severely handicapped but also cannot completely cope  in

mainstream schools either, would be very welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is sufficient evidence, Sir, that children with

moderate learning disabilities thrive under mainstream school

settings  and  interacting with other  children;  over  time,

these children will





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>





grow  up to be useful citizens, and less of a liability to  a

society.  In the USA, for example, between 1986 and 1996, the

percentage of children with disabilities who were educated in

regular classrooms increased from 26% to 45%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry will broaden its multi-tier approach

to  special  education  by encouraging  and  committing  more

resources  to  schools which wish to integrate children  with

special  needs within a normal teaching programme.  Empirical

evidence  has shown that this integration benefits  even  the

advanced  students who will learn to respect differences  and

reach  out  to  offer a helping hand.  This  is  a  start  in

nurturing  graciousness,  a subject  that  Dr  Lily  Neo  had

eloquently spoke about in the last session.  I make one  plea

to  the  Minister,  to put the agenda of the  integration  of

children  with  special needs in mainstream  schools  as  one

priority  in  his  next  plan  on  the  desired  outcome   of

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to a slightly different, but no less

controversial  issue.   In the context of  fixing  compulsory

school  attendance  at  primary  school  level,  is   it   an

opportunity for the Minister to rethink the school assessment

system  by  examining if the streaming exercise is  disabling

students from wanting to go to school and killing the joy  of

learning  far  too  early?  Surely, it  is  not  an  intended

outcome  that  our  educational machinery becomes  a  sorting

device  that  celebrates the examination-smart  ones  at  the

expense  of committing emotional damage to children as  young

as nine years old who have other kind of aptitudes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can we think out of this habitual box which entraps

our thinking, and look at other ways of enhancing competences

and skills without channelling children into gifted, express,

normal,  above-average,  average and  below-average  streams?

Certainly, for the past two decades, we spoke of our students

as  digits  in  an  industrial economy,  as  manpower  to  be

efficiently produced for industrial needs.  But, surely, when

we now talk about creativity and maximizing





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>





our  young  peoples'  potential in a knowledge-based  economy

where  they will undergo several different careers  in  their

lifetimes, some of which have not even been created - how can

streaming be appropriate for this new environment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming at an early age has been controversial for

many  years,  but  it has always been a  sacred  cow  of  the

Education Ministry.  If we are to start from first principles

now  and examine every aspect of our education system, I urge

that  we re-examine streaming and, at the very least,  modify

it  substantially.  The recent report by the Teachers'  Union

published  on  15th September, offered numerous insights  and

discussions  on the principles of education which  are  worth

reflecting  upon.  Some aspects of our education system  need

to  undergo  creative destruction.  With declining fertility,

it  is  all  the  more  important to  focus  on  every  young

Singaporean,  and maximise his or her full  potential.   That

potential, I would argue, is certainly more than a Primary  4

or   6  education.   Let  us  make  sure  that  every  single

Singaporean completes a qualifying education programme up  to

16  years old - is that too ambitious or unrealistic a  goal,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I be permitted to seek a

clarification  from  Mdm  Claire  Chiang?   In  her   opening

remarks,  she  referred  to the problem  of  registration  of

children  in  Primary 1, and she mentioned a number  that  is

close  to over 700 children who are not registered in Primary

1 because of family situation.  Did I hear it correctly?



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> If we are referring to the same data,

my  impression  is  that  there are  very  few  children  not

registered in Primary 1 as a result of family situation.   In

fact,  if  I recall correctly, if we were to exclude children

not  already living in Singapore, children who have migrated,

children  attending madrasahs and all the designated schools,

in fact, the numbers





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>





must be very, very small, maybe one or two, or no more than a

handful.   Maybe we are interpreting the number  differently.

Of  course,  I  also exclude children with special  education

needs in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> This is from a summary

report  from  the National Council of Social  Service,  which

probably obtained their data also from the report.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> If you refer to Annex 4.1 of the

Report  of  the Committee on Compulsory Education,  page  35,

actually the numbers are very, very small.  Of course,  there

are  over  400 pupils not contactable.  They just  cannot  be

traced, despite all the efforts by the Ministry of Education.

So  we  must be referring to very different data.  I  do  not

know which one is correct.  But I think this is perhaps quite

authoritative.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me

to  join in the debate.  Claire Chiang has given such a  long

exposition  on the whole issue so I shall be very  brief,  Mr

Deputy Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill on Compulsory Education in principle.

However, I have a few reservations to make, which I hope will

be addressed by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a very simple question that I will ask is: why

should  we  make  education  for children  compulsory  up  to

Primary  6?  The issue is very simple, but I think there  are

complex  problems related to this.  I hope we are not  giving

the  wrong  signal  to  people  that  we  now  have  a  lower

expectation in education.  I am afraid that such a  benchmark

is  not  in  sync  with our aspirations to make  Singapore  a

learning  nation and give priority to educate people  to  the

fullest.   Sir, fixing Compulsory Education at Primary  6  is

just saying to some people, "Play in the primary league, that

is  enough".  I hope this is not the thing that  we  want  to

promote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, surely we can be more ambitious than that. What

has happened to our Singapore 21 drive?  That, Sir, is what I

am asking.  I think we should be bold and





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>





make education compulsory up to at least Secondary 3, if  not

Secondary 4.  This is at least to ensure that we have a  more

educated  workforce  and  prevent premature  school  leaving,

which  is quite conspicuous at lower secondary school  level.

I think we should address this upper end of the issue so that

we  can tackle educational wastage and, perhaps, enhance  the

potential of this group of people who otherwise may drift out

of the secondary education net.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also disappointed that we have excluded

disabled  children or special children from  the  purview  of

Compulsory  Education.  We may argue that they  have  special

needs and they should be catered for separately.  I see  that

such a reason is persuasive but, it is unconvincing. Sir, all

that  I  am  appealing  is, should we  not  protect  disabled

children  by  ensuring  they are not  denied  education  like

normal  children?   All  the more  we  should  protect  them,

because  they  are  most  likely to  be  neglected  in  their

education.   Therefore, I see no cogent reason  for  disabled

children to be excluded from Compulsory Education.   Sir,  in

this  respect,  are  we not discriminating  against  disabled

children?   One may argue we are not, but by excluding  them,

we are keeping them out to some extent from the mainstream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good that we should accord the same

Compulsory Education status to all children, irrespective  of

their background.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to say is that it is not Compulsory

Education  requirement  that  will  have  an  impact  on  the

development of our children.  It is not the legislation  that

counts.   Many countries have Compulsory Education, but  many

children remain unschooled.  It is the software which is very

important,  eg,  good  teachers, principals,  good  schooling

culture,  which will make the difference in the  learning  of

our  children.   In this respect, I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether  we are taking more bolder  steps  to  make

primary education more effective and exciting, and to  ensure

that  it is able to maximise the potential and provide a very

good headstart for our children themselves.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many countries have Compulsory Education, but many

children are not able to get the best from education  itself.

So  I  hope that the Ministry of Education would be deploying

more resources to provide the best of support we can for very

young children who will be entering into our primary schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to address some

of  the points that have been brought up by Members so far in

this debate on the Compulsory Education Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister Teo has said earlier, the Singapore

education  system  has always played two roles,  firstly,  in

preparing our young for work, and, secondly, moulding them as

citizens.  These objectives were foremost in the minds of the

Committee on Compulsory Education, which I chaired.   Indeed,

when  the  Prime Minister asked the Ministry of Education  to

consider the introduction of Compulsory Education in  October

last  year, he reiterated the need for our children to attend

school and be given the same headstart in life to develop his

or her full potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Committee recommended Compulsory Education to be

introduced in Singapore, and I must thank all the Members  of

this  House  who spoke this afternoon; all of  them  were  in

support of introducing Compulsory Education.  I think  it  is

an  important step for Singapore.  It is an important step in

ensuring  that  our  children are prepared  for  the  future,

particularly  for  the  requirements of  the  knowledge-based

economy in an age of globalisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Committee also shared MOE's long standing

position  that  Compulsory Education  does  not,  in  itself,

ensure  full enrolment in schools or solve the root  problems

of non-attendance.  Nor was it the intention of the Committee

to  use Compulsory Education as a means to improve access  to

and  support  for  children with special  needs.   These  are

already taken care of by existing





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>





measures,  and improvements will continue to be made  by  the

Ministry  of  Education.  Let me deal  with  this  and  other

issues in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the issue of parental responsibility. My

Committee  was  very  clear that the  principle  of  parental

responsibility must be upheld so that Singapore society  will

continue  to be rooted in strong families.  Again,  this  was

one  of  the  long  standing  concerns  of  the  Ministry  of

Education.    But  because  the  future  of  all  Singaporean

children is important, we need to provide the State with  the

power to compel parents to send their children to school when

all  other methods of persuasion fail.  Such children, though

small in number, would otherwise miss out on the benefits  of

education in the national schools. This number is small.  Mdm

Claire  Chiang  has probably looked at the  wrong  source  of

information. What is provided in the Annex of my  Committee's

Report is the accurate number.  The number was obtained  when

some  children  failed  to register during  the  time  of  P1

registration.  So we came up with 1,500 children,  two-thirds

of   whom   did   not  register  either  by  choice   or   by

circumstances,  and  the  remaining one-third  could  not  be

traced in spite of all efforts by the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of questions on the recommendations of the

Committee deal with the reasons why we recommended Compulsory

Education  only up to primary six. This point was brought  up

by  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Tay Beng Chuan, Mr Chiam See  Tong,

Mdm  Claire Chiang, Dr Vasoo and others.  I think we have  to

look   at  the  total  picture  and  the  amount  of  careful

deliberation the Committee had put in before we came up  with

this  recommendation. We spent a lot of time in  deliberating

on  this. We looked at the experience of other countries  and

we realised that in the context of Singapore, the duration of

Compulsory Education, as well as the form in which it  should

take, are two issues which are closely inter-related and they

must   be  considered  together.   In  coming  up  with   our

recommendation that





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>





Compulsory Education should cover up to primary six education

in our national schools, our main reasons are two-fold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the problem of school drop-outs at the

secondary  school level. At the secondary school  level,  the

problems  of  school drop-outs are quite complex.   In  fact,

these would not be solved with the introduction of Compulsory

Education.   Sir,  when adolescents reach  secondary  school,

some  of  them drop out for various reasons, often by choice,

such  as the loss of interest in their studies.  No doubt  we

can   compel  them  to  remain  in  school  under  Compulsory

Education,  but  there  is no guarantee  that  they  will  be

motivated  to  study  and complete secondary  education.   In

fact,  even Mr Chiam, who advocated eight years of Compulsory

Education, that is, to cover up to secondary two,  said,  "It

is  useless.   It is a waste of resources to compel  them  to

study beyond that because if they had lost interest, there is

no point to keep them in the system."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the question of loss of interest, there is

the  question  of  how to make sure that they  attend  school

regularly  - the question of enforcement.  The experience  of

other  countries  shows that at the secondary  school  level,

more  and more resources and more severe penalties will  have

to be put in place. The government in the United Kingdom, for

example, is devoting more than 500 million pounds in the next

few  years  to crack the problem of truancy.  They  are  also

considering  whether  to  issue warrants  of  arrest  to  the

parents  whose  children do not turn up in  school.  In  some

states  in  America, they are considering  whether  to  issue

warrants to the students, the adolescents themselves, for not

attending  school regularly.  On the one hand,  advocates  of

Compulsory Education feel that every means must be brought to

bear  to  ensure children stay in school up to the  secondary

level.  On the other hand, they do not want extreme measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to make up our mind, we have to balance the

pros and cons, the practicality of enforcement, the amount of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>





resources  required and see, whether in  the  end,  we  would

still  be  able to ensure 100% enrolment and 100% attendance.

The  experience of other countries proves that  this  is  not

assured.  In  fact, 100% is not possible.  Mdm Claire  Chiang

quoted the example of Hong Kong where, over so many years  of

Compulsory  Education,  only one case  had  been  brought  to

court, and only a few cases had been fined. But this does not

mean  that  there  is 100% compliance. This  means  that  the

machinery  of enforcement may not be 100% working.   I  think

this is the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we considered and recognised the impracticality of

implementing Compulsory Education at the secondary level.  In

fact,  in the interest of the students who have lost interest

in  their  studies, a more desirable outcome for them  is  to

receive  some vocational skills training to prepare them  for

employment.  This course of action is presently available  in

the  various  training schemes that the ITE has designed  for

them. Specifically, there are courses that lead up to the NTC-3   level  of  certification  for  those  without  'N'  level

qualifications.  There are also NTC-2  courses,  as  well  as

Certification  in Office Skills for those students  who  left

school  with 'N' level qualifications only.  In other  words,

there  are  existing schemes and educational  programmes  for

students  who  drop  out  of secondary  school.   The  better

solution  for students who have lost interest in studying  is

not  to  force them to attend school, but to give  them  more

opportunities   to  receive  pre-employment   or   vocational

training.   As  for other students who drop  out  because  of

family  and  financial reasons, please be  assured  that  the

school and the community have been doing their best to render

assistance.   In  fact, before one single student  is  marked

down  as  a premature school drop-out, the school would  have

gone through several layers of tracking, persuasion, help and

assistance  rendered by the teachers, school counsellers  and

social  workers already.  So we do not give  up  on  them  as

easily as you would have thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why the Committee recommended

Compulsory Education up





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>





to primary six level was because we wanted to accommodate the

wish of the Muslim community to train their religious leaders

and   teachers  in  madrasahs.   The  Muslim  community   was

concerned about the introduction of Compulsory Education even

for a duration of four years.  Members will remember that the

Prime  Minister suggested four years of Compulsory  Education

up  to  Primary  Four at the beginning.  And even  then,  the

madrasahs  were concerned whether, with Compulsory  Education

in  national  schools,  they would be  able  to  have  enough

students  who would want to study in madrasahs afterwards  to

become   religious  teachers.   Six  years  is  therefore   a

practical and workable compromise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reiterate, the stand of the Committee on the duration

of  Compulsory  Education is that the recommended  six  years

should  not be seen as the ideal length of education.  We  do

not pretend that it is the best length of education that each

child must have. In fact, we know its shortcomings. It is not

the  ideal.   It  is not an adequate amount of  education  to

equip  you  and go right into the workforce.  But it  is  the

foundation  or  base from which the children  can  go  on  to

further education and training in secondary school.  In fact,

more  than  94%  of  our primary school children  go  on  and

receive 10 years of education in total.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In coming up with the recommendation for Compulsory

Education  up to primary six, the Committee was mindful  that

any  proposal  should take into consideration the  views  and

aspirations  of  our  different  communities.   I  think  the

criticism  of  both  Mr  Chiam and  Mr  Jeyaretnam  that  the

composition of the Committee was biased or political  in  its

orientation from the beginning was unfair.  Yes,  there  were

Members  of  Parliament  on  the Committee.  There  were  PAP

Members,  but they represented the views of different  ethnic

communities in our society. There was also a Nominated Member

of  Parliament on the Committee, Dr Jennifer Lee. The  others

were  educationists.  They were professionals.  There  was  a

representative from the Ministry of Community Development and

Sports as well.  In our





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>





process of deliberation, we consulted a very wide section  of

society.  We  had feedback sessions, closed-door focus  group

discussions with representatives from all walks of life. So I

think  it  is  unfair  to  say that,  because  of  a  certain

political  bias,  therefore we came up with this  expeditious

political solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Committee found that generally, there was widespread

support  for  Compulsory Education.  But the  various  groups

that  gave us feedback wanted sufficient flexibility  in  its

implementation to accommodate their interest and concerns.  I

believe  our  recommendations have  indeed  accommodated  the

concerns and interests of the various communities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Minister Tarmugi has already replied to the points

on  madrasahs, I would not dwell on them. However, I  do  not

think  Mr  Zulkifli Baharudin's suggestion that the madrasahs

should be represented on the Compulsory Education Board is  a

workable one, because Compulsory Education, in the context of

our   intention,  is  Compulsory  Education  within  national

schools.   Madrasahs are schools outside the national  school

system.  They  are concerned with the religious education  of

Muslim  children and the Muslim community has  to  decide  on

what  role  the madrasahs play and what would be  the  future

directions for its further development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that we should give the madrasahs or the

designated institutions, including San Yu Adventist School, a

reasonable period of time for them to adjust and to meet  the

benchmarks.   He  suggested five  years.   In  fact,  in  our

Report,  we recommended that the madrasahs have up  to  eight

years  to  look  into  how they could improve  the  teaching,

teaching resources, total environment and so on, in order  to

meet  the  PSLE benchmark.  We are quite mindful of the  fact

that  they had no experience in meeting the benchmark and  we

are   prepared  to  give  them  up  to  eight  years  because

Compulsory Education would be introduced





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>





two  years  later,  in 2003; and six years  afterwards,  they

would have the first batch of primary six children graduating

who  would  be benchmarked against the PSLE average aggregate

scores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi expressed concern that he had heard among the

Malay-Muslim  community that if some of the  madrasahs  could

not reach the benchmark by that time-frame, what would happen

to  the pupils.  The institutions which, by the agreed  time-frame, cannot still meet the agreed minimum standards,  I  am

sure   you  will  agree  with  me,  would  not  be  providing

satisfactory instruction in the core secular subjects to  the

students.   It  would be unreasonable for the  Government  to

continue to allow these madrasahs in question which  fail  to

meet  the minimum standards to continue teaching indefinitely

the  core secular subjects and admit students full-time  into

their fold. In such cases, the affected institution will  not

be  allowed  to  admit  pupils who  are  required  to  attend

national  schools  for full-time education.   For  madrasahs,

however,  they  would  still  be able  to  continue  offering

religious  education to students who want it on  a  part-time

and  after-school  hour basis.  The students  themselves  can

enrol  in  national schools or they can enrol  in  the  other

madrasahs which meet the PSLE benchmark.  So, their  interest

would not be compromised.  They would still be able to attend

school in the national school system, just like now.  We have

cases where some parents want to transfer their children from

madrasahs  to  national schools.  The receiving  school  will

give them a test and see which level they could be placed in.

So,  it  will be like now, but the students can also transfer

to other madrasahs which meet the PSLE benchmark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards home schoolers, I think Dr Wang has put it

very  well  regarding the deliberations of the Committee  and

the  kind  of  dilemma we faced.  But I would  also  like  to

correct  a slight misimpression, which I think either  he  or

another  speaker  conveyed,  that  the  home  schoolers   are

actually  doing a very good job in schooling the children  at

home.  I do not





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>





doubt  their keen interest, their good intentions, in wanting

to  home school their children at home.  They put in a lot of

energy.   As  one Member put it, the wife, in one case,  quit

her  full-time  job and stayed at home to take  care  of  the

schooling  needs of her children.  But my worry  is  that  in

spite  of  the good intentions, in spite of the efforts  they

put  in, are they really able to give the children the  best?

And  the best they give, can it match what we can provide  in

our national schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when I met with them during a couple of the

dialogue  sessions,  I was a little bit  disturbed  with  the

vehemence  in which they pleaded their cases.  In fact,  they

even  went on to say that our schools do not provide  a  good

education.  They said, once the children go into the national

schools, they imbibe the wrong values and fall into the wrong

company.  Therefore, they are very worried and withdraw their

children  from  school.   I  think  this  is  not  the  right

perspective on our schools.  Our national schools  provide  a

good  rounded education.   The home schoolers have a  certain

belief  that  they could do the job of the school.   We  said

that  if  they  have such keen interest in  their  children's

education and if they could provide the Ministry of Education

with  enough  evidence that their education  meets  the  twin

objectives  of  Compulsory Education, then we could  consider

exemption  for  their children, but only if we are  satisfied

that the twin objectives of Compulsory Education are met.  It

is   also  why  our  Committee  was  a  little  stricter   in

prescribing the criteria which the home schoolers  must  meet

before  we would continue to grant them exemption.   And  MOE

would look into the methods of monitoring the home schoolers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli pointed out that there is a loophole. I

think  it will be incumbent on the home schoolers to  provide

evidence that they could provide a curriculum which will meet

MOE's  standards and requirements.  The children are required

to meet PSLE standards, pegged at the same benchmark as those

required   for  children  who  are  exempted  from  attending

national schools but who go to San Yu Adventist School.  They

are also required





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>





to  pass  the national education quiz.  I think  we  have  to

watch the situation of the home schoolers a bit closely.  MOE

will  look into various methods of monitoring their  progress

and  will  assess  whether  the criteria  for  exemption,  as

recommended by the Committee, are adequate as we go along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards special education, Mdm Claire Chiang, Dr

Vasoo,  Mr  Loh Meng See as well as some other  Members  have

asked  why  we  have  exempted children in special  education

schools  from  the  requirements of Compulsory  Education  in

national  schools.   They  reflect  the  sentiments  of  some

members  of the special education community in Singapore  who

expressed,   as   I  said,  some  disappointment   with   the

recommendations of the Compulsory Education Committee.    But

let  me  say  again  that  our Committee  had  examined  very

carefully the existing measures to support special education,

and  found  that  the Government together with  the  National

Council   of   Social  Service  and  the  voluntary   welfare

organisations  have given extra resources to the  educational

needs  of  children with disabilities.  Far from ignoring  or

discriminating  against  such  children,  the   Ministry   of

Education  actually  provides funding up  to  2.5  times  the

recurrent  cost  of  educating  a  primary  school  pupil  in

national  schools.   The National Council of  Social  Service

provides  funding  of another 1.5 times, bringing  the  total

recurrent funding for special education schools up to 4 times

the  recurrent  cost of educating a primary school  pupil  in

national schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education also funds 90% of the

development cost of each new purpose-built school.   And  NIE

provides  teacher training and the Ministry seconds  teachers

and  principals  to  these  special  education  schools  upon

request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of integration, let me point out that

there are different models in providing special education and

how  integration is promoted should differ according  to  the

needs  of  the  different groups of children  with  different

needs.  This is so with many countries in the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>





world.   There is no one single model.  We learn  from  them.

We  will  adapt  their practices to our local  context.   The

important  point  is that whatever the setting  of  providing

special  education,  it  should  be  one  that  provides   an

appropriate learning environment that can best cater  to  the

specific needs of the special children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there was a spate of letters in the Forum page

about my Ministry's provision for special education children.

On  3rd October, my Ministry made a detailed reply on what we

have  been  providing  to  the  special  children.   Let   me

reiterate,   very   briefly,  that  for   those   with   mild

disabilities  and those who are able to cope with  mainstream

education,  MOE  has  already  incorporated  facilities   and

resources  in  our  national schools for the  integration  of

these  children.   There  are in our mainstream  schools  the

physically  handicapped,  the mildly  hearing  impaired,  and

visually  handicapped  and others who  are  studying  in  our

mainstream  schools.   They follow our  national  curriculum.

They are given extra resources.  They are given remedial help

and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those with more severe learning disabilities, we

feel  that it would be better off for them if they are taught

and   educated  in  special  schools  where  they  are  given

specially trained teachers, special facilities, and they  are

given  time to pursue their education according to their  own

pace.   So,  the present situation of providing  for  special

education children, in the view of the Committee members,  is

adequate  and  we are assured that the Ministry of  Education

will  continue  to help the voluntary welfare  organisations,

through  the National Council of Social Service,  to  address

the  needs  of  the  special children.  In fact,  because  we

define  "Compulsory Education" as education  within  national

schools that provide the curriculum and the total environment

that  will  meet the two objectives of Compulsory  Education,

special  education  schools are  outside  the  ambit  of  the

Compulsory  Education framework.  Their request for  funding,

for more





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>





resources and better curriculum can still be addressed by the

Ministry  outside this framework of enforcement of Compulsory

Education.   If we enforce Compulsory Education  on  families

with  special children, I think it may become a bit too harsh

for  them.  These families need all our help.  We should help

them  overcome the difficulties, financial or otherwise,  the

problem  of  coping and so on.  They need help.  They  should

not  be brought under the purview of the Compulsory Education

Bill  which  prescribes penalties.  Do not  forget  that  the

Compulsory  Education Bill prescribes penalties  for  parents

who fail to comply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we need penalties? As I said, most of the people

whom we talked to are for Compulsory Education.  They have  a

good   heart.   They  want  every  child  to  have  the  same

headstart.  They want every child to have an education.  But,

at  the  same time, they do not advocate harsh measures.   We

are   not  advocating  harsh  measures.   In  fact,  we   are

instituting a mechanism of many rounds of community  help   - counselling,  mediation  and  so  forth.   But  in  cases  of

persistent  flouting  of  the law,  in  cases  where  parents

wilfully  flout  the  law and are not  cooperative  with  the

assistance given by schools and counselling agencies, the law

must be brought to fall on them.  Otherwise, our legal system

will be brought into disrepute.  Our intention is not to  use

this  liberally.   In fact, our intention is  that  the  full

force of the law will be brought only as a last resort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin said that the Compulsory Education

Board  has  a very difficult task. It should treat  its  work

with   the   greatest  sensitivity  and   flexibility.    The

Compulsory  Education Board will certainly do so.   In  fact,

the  Compulsory Education  Board will comprise  members  from

the  voluntary  welfare organisations, community  development

councils,  Community  and  Parents  in  Support  of   Schools

(COMPASS),  self-help  groups, grassroots  organisations  and

concerned individuals.  Members can be assured that we have a

broad  representation of people who have the  compassion  and

the sensitivity to deal with these issues.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would just like to echo both Mdm Claire Chiang

and  Dr  Vasoo's  concern that our primary  school  education

should not just emphasise the academic kind of outcomes,  but

that   we  should  address  the  multiple  intelligences   of

children.  We should help to develop the child in a  holistic

manner and we should pay attention closely to the quality  of

education provided in primary school, now that primary school

education is compulsory.  I would like to assure both of them

that  the  Ministry has been paying close  attention  to  the

review  of  the  entire spectrum of education,  not  just  in

primary  schools, but also secondary schools,  pre-University

and  tertiary  education.  In fact, we  have  introduced  new

curriculum,  new  subjects,  new  approaches  and  assessment

methods,  beginning  with  the  primary  school  level.    We

emphasise  the holistic education of children, not  just  the

intellectual  aspect  but also the social,  moral,  physical,

aesthetic  aspects  of  education.   We  emphasise   thinking

skills, creativity, life skills, management of self and so on

in  our new approach in education.  We will give education to

these children our best, not only in terms of infrastructure.

The  PRIME  programme, for example, will renew  many  of  the

existing primary schools along with secondary schools  within

the next five years.  They would have spanking new facilities

up  to  the  latest  standards.   Teacher  training  will  be

improved.   Curriculum  has  been  improved  and   is   being

continuously reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that Compulsory Education can

only  be  effective  if  it has the fullest  commitment  from

parents  and  the  community.   The  recommendations  of  the

Compulsory  Education Committee, in my view, signify  a  very

significant  step  forward for education  in  Singapore.   We

affirm the commitment of the Government to give every child a

good  headstart in life and give him the foundation on  which

he  can acquire further knowledge and skills to be productive

workers and to be good citizens in their adult life.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, may I respond?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You may not respond. If you want to

make a clarification, I will allow you.  Mr Simon Tay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not

quite  sure  what I can add after so many people have  spoken

and  the clarifications by the Senior Minister of State.  But

I  think we all have a great belief in education and this  is

why  so  many  of us have spoken today.  Let me  try  not  to

repeat what has been said before and let me try to add what I

can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think our belief in education stems from the fact that

we  believe  that  whatever our beginnings,  we  can  improve

ourselves and be the best that we can be.  Secondly, when  we

face  social problems, we often look to education to  address

the  root  problems.   How  do we promote  education  in  our

society?  We basically have a system of centralised system of

education.   This compares to other countries that  emphasise

more private, family and community-based education.  Instead,

our  state provides the vast majority of education  for  most

people.  There is, of course, in any case of state provision,

a  danger of having one-size fits all.  But with the  various

fine-tunings  to  our  system, we are improving  our  system,

creating  a centralised system, but one with enough  variety,

one   with  the  participation  of  community  and  one  that

emphasises  not just the KBE, of raw knowledge  and  thinking

skills,  but also citizenship, an attribute of being part  of

being Singapore.  In that sense, despite the many points that

have  been  raised today, this debate reveals that  there  is

actually quite a broad consensus that our education system is

on  the right track and that we are trying to do what is best

for  the children and the best in the interest of the  child.

We  then  come  to this particular question  of  making  this

relatively good system compulsory for all.  Again, it is very

important  to emphasise how many people already  are  in  the

system  voluntarily and therefore we are trying to deal  with

actually a very small number and targeted means may  be  very

necessary to reach these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this issue was first raised in the House, I

expressed an initial scepticism.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>





Although  I  am  a  lawyer,  I do  not  really  believe  that

something  really  becomes so much better  when  it  is  made

compulsory  by  law.  It is part of my instinct  that  it  is

sometimes wrong that whenever we think something is important

but  often  unpopular  we think make  it  compulsory  is  the

solution.   It  is  like  the debate we  had  about  learning

literature  or  history.   Making it available,  interesting,

relevant  and  appealing, is even more important.   While  we

take  the  step today to make primary school education  entry

compulsory,  that is the way of making sure  that  after  six

years  of   Compulsory  Education,  as  recommended  by   the

Committee,  students can and will want to go on  further  and

their  parents  will want to support them to go  on  further.

Once  they  are in the system, this attitude plus counselling

and  encouragement, can be as effective as legal  compulsion.

If we do not take this approach, and we just rely on the bare

law,  we  are  doing the wrong thing.  We may  intend  to  be

beneficial  and  liberal in our aims, but  we  end  up  being

dictators  in  our  means.  I still believe  that  making  it

illegal  is not enough.  Parents need to be informed, tracked

and  counselled and the cause of the problem, Government  and

civil  society groups should help address those problems.   I

am  glad for the assurance just given  by the Senior Minister

of State in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like some more clarification about how in the

first  place  do  we  find  all the children  and  all  their

parents.   We  have  some  way of  tracking  them  at  birth.

Perhaps  some may enrol in pre-school, but perhaps  not  all.

Then we have child doctors who can help track children.   But

we  are  talking about some significant numbers,  although  a

very small percentage, who just simply do not register in our

system.   Though Singapore is often called the "nanny state",

we simply do not have a fool-proof net.  No one has.  That is

something  we  should  bear  in  mind  when  we  talk   about

compulsion.   The  Director-General in that sense  will  need

more resources.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my second point. This is that the

schools and the criteria for allowing exceptions are  not  in

the  Bill  before  us.  Much would therefore  depend  on  the

discretion of the Ministry and of the Director-General to  be

appointed.   More  guidance and principles  within  the  Bill

perhaps would have been preferable.  I certainly would  argue

that  we  have  to read in part of the Constitution  such  as

Article  152(2), which recognises the special rights  of  the

Malay-Muslims as the indigenous people of Singapore.  I would

also  urge that the rights of the Child Convention should  be

read  into  the criteria for this is the relevant Convention,

an international UN Convention, that Singapore has signed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to the Government's allowance of

diversity.   Let  me first touch on the point  of  madrasahs.

There  was some initial fear that the Government would  close

down  the  madrasahs.   I  am  very  glad  to  see  that  the

Government  now  would  allow them to continue  with  certain

provisions and certain benchmarks to be set.  In a  sense,  I

am  welcoming  Government's  allowance  for  other  forms  of

education  and the recognition of diversity as  an  important

part   of  Singapore.   This  upholds  Article  15   of   the

Constitution which promises us freedom of religion,   Article

152(2),  which, as I said, recognizes the indigenous position

of  the  Malays  and their religion.  While I  recognise  and

welcome the Government's attitude to diversity, I would  also

ask  the Malay community to take that step forward.  That  is

to ask them to recognise not only the leeway given to them to

have their religious instruction, but also the responsibility

they  have  to the wider community and to their own children.

In  many  cases, in many countries, where they have  tried  a

separate  schooling  system, this  school  system  has  never

become  equal.  Separate and equal is a  principle  that  has

failed  too  often  times.  I would  then  ask  them,  as  an

outsider,  to seek a balance and I am glad to see  that  most

polls show Malays in Singapore among the most patriotic, most

Singaporean  segment of the people.  Therefore,  I  have  the

confidence that they will find this balance.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In helping madrasahs meet these benchmarks, there has

already been talk that Government will support the madrasahs.

There  is  obviously  some need for  people  to  support  the

community project even from outside that community.  But I do

want   to  express  a  concern  about  Article  16   of   the

Constitution.  This sets limits to using Government funds for

educational institutions that discriminate based on religion.

I  hope that no unconstitutional and unrealistic expectations

are  placed  on  Government coffers to  support  basically  a

community project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my last point. This is in regard to

home schooling which is to be allowed in principle, according

to  the report.  Again, as I said, this is welcome because it

has a sense of diversity based on educational values.  I bear

in mind what the Senior Minister of State has said, that some

parents are well-meaning but may not actually provide   well-thought out, well-delivered programmes, not on par with  what

our schools deliver.  But I do think that under this category

of  home  schooling, consideration must be given  to  options

such  as Montissori and what is called the Steiner or Waldorf

Education  schools.   These  are  already  in  existence   in

Singapore, especially the Montissori for pre-school.  But  as

the  Senior Minister of State well knows, in other  countries

these  are  offered  for  school  years.   I  think  this  is

recognised in many countries and it is something that  should

be considered seriously in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education had earlier refused to agree

on   Compulsory   Education  but  the  Government   has   now

reconsidered.    Some  thought  that  madrasahs   and   other

religious or particular types of schools would not be  exempt

from  Compulsory Education.  But this has not been the  case.

Again, the Ministry, as guided by the Committee, has listened

and  allowed  diversity.  In so doing, it has now  created  a

very  broad  discretion for the Ministry  and  the  Director-General  to  exempt or to decide on whether to  prosecute  in

some cases.  I ask that discretion be exercised within the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>





principles  of  valuing  diversity  in  accordance  with  the

Constitution and the best interest of our children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, the wealth of our nation lies in  our  people,

especially  in  our next generation. Our future  in  the  New

Economy  will depend on how well we equip ourselves  and  the

next generation of Singaporeans for the challenges ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, this House has been focusing on

people,  seeking to put in place people-oriented policies  to

address  the  needs  of the elderly and less  successful,  to

cultivate  an  attitude of lifelong learning, to  bridge  the

digital  divide, to forge social cohesion, and  to  encourage

active  citizenship  and closer bonding between  the  various

racial and religious groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people-oriented policies will help our generation

to  collectively face the New Economy challenges. But  it  is

not  enough. We have the responsibility to ensure that  every

one  of  our next generation is also equipped with the basics

to  face  the New Economy challenges. It is in this  context,

Sir, that I speak in support of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teaching our young ones is such an emotive subject.

Almost  everyone  has a personal stake in it.   Almost  every

parent  wants  to  have a say on it. Almost  everyone  has  a

statement to make and expectations to raise. Almost  everyone

has  his  own  concerns about how his children  ought  to  be

educated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some concerns, on the one hand, are justified and

deserve closer attention. I shall elaborate on them later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are concerns based on parochial

interests,  without a fuller understanding of  the  long-term

consequences  or  impact on our nation. We must  not  dismiss

such concerns lightly - both now and in future. To do so,  is

to  seriously  under-rate the emotions of the individual  and

the community on this





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>





emotive  subject of educating the young. Instead, we need  to

be  perceptive,  sensitive and patient.  The  warmness  of  a

genuine heart can melt an iron resolve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged to note from the Committee's very well

written  Report, that they undertook a rigorous  consultation

process. I am also extremely delighted that an agreement  has

been  reached  with  the  madrasah leaders  on  how  to  move

forward. The Bill has provided the flexibility for exemptions

to be made in this regard. The Report also indicates that non-registration  and  drop-out cases  are  very  minimal.  I  am

thrilled  that the Ministry's serious intent to upgrade  both

the hardware and software aspects of education has started to

bear fruits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of its vision, purpose and articulated plans,

MOE  has  done very well. But, there is a reality gap between

what  MOE  intends to achieve and the current situation.  How

well  equipped  is  every one of our  children  for  the  New

Economy?  I do not think that we are up to the mark  yet.  We

still have a long way to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have a long way to go, because I know for a

fact  that some Primary 6 EM3 students are not even  able  to

string  together a grammatically correct sentence in English.

Can  we  say  that  these primary school  leavers  have  been

equipped  with the basics to face the New Economy challenges?

I do not think so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not content ourselves with just casting the

education  net  over the entire cohort using this  Compulsory

Education Bill. Casting this net is but a prelude to  a  more

important  task  - that of preparing the next generation  for

the  challenges ahead. We must not only be aiming for a  100%

attendance  figure.  We  must go beyond  the  statistics  and

honestly  ask  ourselves  how well we  have  taught  all  our

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I wish to raise four main points for the

Minister's clarification.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Assistance to parents and schools</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our schools must be given sufficient resources

to prepare our children for the New Economy challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on this point. MOE correctly recognises

that  the  critical success factor in implementing compulsory

education  is not by imposing fines or jail terms. These  are

deterrents  that  we hope will never be effected.  These  are

measures that will end up punishing both the parents and  the

children.   Instead,  there  will  be  a  mediation   process

involving  MCDS and voluntary welfare organisations  to  help

parents  and  children. Non-registration and  drop-out  cases

will not be referred to the courts unless the counselling and

assistance prove to be unsuccessful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with MOE's approach. But I am concerned as

to whether we are fully equipped to deal comprehensively with

all counselling and assistance cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report indicated that the number of

parents  with  financial or family problems  is  very  small.

These  are  the  only  known  cases  surfaced  to  MCDS   for

assistance.   I  am  concerned that the  number  may  not  be

reflective   of   the  situation  faced  by   some   of   our

neighbourhood  schools. Is this number only  the  tip  of  an

iceberg?  I am sure that there are many unreported  cases  of

parents  struggling  to put their children  to  school.  Some

parents  do not seek help because of their pride, or  because

they are too busy to pay attention to their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE's team of psychologists and guidance counsellors and

the  teachers  in our schools may be able to  cope  with  the

situation now, but you need time to deal with such cases. You

need  additional  resources,  more  specialists,  to  provide

proper  and  proactive counselling to struggling parents  and

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assistance to struggling parents and children should

not   be  on  a  reactive  basis.   We  must  not  apply  the

counselling medicine only when the trouble sets in,





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>





only  when the child has stopped attending school for  a  few

days.  We must instill in our teachers the mindset that every

student matters. Our teachers must be trained to have a  keen

eye  to  nip problems in the bud.  They must be assured  that

when  they encounter difficult cases that they cannot handle,

there are adequate specialist resources to back them up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are serious about helping every child, then

we  need a more proactive and ongoing assistance process,  it

cannot  be touch-and-go.  We must not be satisfied with  just

giving  the  child back to school.  We can only be  contented

when  we see a motivated child returning to school with  full

parental  support.   For this reason, we should  provide  our

schools with additional resources to achieve this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister stated in his National Day Rally

speech  that he has asked MOE to see how our schools  can  be

provided  better administrative support so that teachers  can

spend  less  time on administration and more on teaching.   I

fully support the Prime Minister's initiative.  May I add, in

relation to this Bill, that schools should also be given more

counselling  and  specialist support  so  that  teachers  can

devote  more time to teaching.  In any case, not all teachers

are gifted to counsel.  Those who have just graduated are too

young and inexperienced to handle difficult cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, my first point of clarification to the Minister

is  whether there is any  intention to shore up the resources

to  help  teachers, especially in the neighbourhood  schools.

Given   the  current  resources  available,  when  does   the

counselling process end - will it stop once the child returns

to   school  or  will  there  be  follow-up  counselling  and

assistance to parents and students?  What steps will be taken

to  help  our schools to be more proactive in identifying  in

helping struggling parents and troubled children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is that to render Compulsory

Education  more  effective, all children should  begin  their

learning journeys on a fairer footing.  According





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>





to  the Bill, Compulsory Education will begin only at Primary

1  and not earlier.  This means that children with pre-school

education (or PSE) have a headstart over those with  no  PSE.

Children  who  did not attend kindergarten  classes  are  way

behind  the  starting  line  when  the  Compulsory  Education

whistle is blown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not exaggerating. To illustrate my point, I

know  of  a  kindergarten requiring its student to spell  our

national  pledge.  Can you imagine the kindergarten  students

spelling,  "to build a democratic society, based  on  justice

and  equality,  so  as to achieve happiness,  prosperity  and

progress for our nation"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fault-line for the digital divide really begins very

early.   I  am  also  told  that some  kindergarten  children

already know how to make a simple Powerpoint presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, children who have completed PSE are expected

to  spell and read simple words, not just alphabets, and have

attended  computer enrichment classes.  When  you  put  these

children  together  with those who did not  go  through  PSE,

slower  learners will lose their confidence and may  even  be

labelled  and  stigmatised.  They are not necessarily  slower

due  to a lower IQ but because of deprived opportunities  and

the lack of PSE.  Some parents do not send their children  to

kindergartens  simply because of the fees  involved.   It  is

much  dearer than the subsidised primary school fees and  the

amount  vary according to the prestige and facilities of  the

kindergartens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that MOE understands that children left out of

PSE have to play catch up on Day 1, and that the disparity in

standards  can  be  quite startling.   I  am  glad  that  the

Minister  recently announced in MOE's workplan  seminar  that

MOE  intends to devote more resources to give Singaporeans  a

headstart in PSE and to review the PSE syllabus.  We  should,

and  I  quote him, "give every child a fair shot at achieving

his or her hopes and aspirations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that I pose my second point of

clarification to the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>





Minister.   Can  we  give  every  Singapore  child  a  fairer

opportunity to enrol in a PSE institution?  Can we  keep  PSE

fees  at  an  affordable rate for the lower-income  families?

How   much  would  it  cost  to  provide  subsidies  to   all

kindergartens  to make the fee more affordable?   We  have  a

much more intelligent new generation.  Should we consider  if

Compulsory Education should begin at PSE level?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point, Sir, is that there is a need to review

how  we  are  educating our less successful students.   On  a

national   basis,   we  have  been  adopting  people-oriented

policies to help the less successful in society, and we  also

pay more attention to help students with special needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our concern must not end with just simply

implementing   Compulsory  Education.    Our   responsibility

extends  to  ensuring that proper and adequate assistance  is

given to all our students so that their learning journey will

not lead them to a dead end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to MOE's credit that it seeks to address the

special  needs  of  students who are  slow  learners.   MOE's

Learning  Support programme, started in 1992, is an excellent

programme, except that it is only for students up to  Primary

2.   About  12,000 students in Primary 1 and 2 are  currently

receiving  regular, individualised support  in  language  and

literacy  skills under this programme.  The Learning  Support

programme is supplemented by the Encouraging Achievement  and

Better Learning programme, or Enable, to help students up  to

Primary  3  level in English and Mathematics.  Students  with

special needs have benefited from the two programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are these students with special needs? There are

two  main  groups - those with learning difficulty and  those

with  learning  disability.  A sizeable  number  of  students

experience  learning difficulty because they  did  not  fully

attend  kindergarten classes or face family problems.   About

1,029 are born with learning





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>





disabilities,  like dyslexia, mild autism, attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder,   or  are  educationally   subnormal.

These students are the less successful in our schools.   They

run a high risk of dropping out from the system.  They cannot

even  read simple words like "the", "cat" or "dog" when  they

are in Primary 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the House agrees that every child matters, I think

that  we  should  pay  more  attention  to  help  those  less

successful children with special needs.  Our mildly  autistic

and dyslexic children require specialist attention, attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder  (ADHD)  students  are   often

branded  as  deviants, as the teachers, given the class  size

that  they  have  to manage, cannot give these  students  the

attention   that  their  condition  demands.    Educationally

subnormal (ESN) students are those with IQ between 50 and  70

and need more individualised coaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students with learning disability may attend special

education  schools.   But some parents prefer  them  not  to.

Some  parents  want to hide the fact that their children  are

ESN.   Some  special education schools are too far away,  too

tiring  and  inconvenient  for the  children.   The  cost  of

attending special education schools is also a deterrent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that MOE is very supportive of special education

schools.  MOE has been helping the Autism Resource Centre and

the  Dyslexia Association of Singapore with their funding and

start  up of new centres.  But the fees are still prohibitive

to  some  parents.   For example, the term fee  for  dyslexic

children is $450, not for full-time study, but just for twice-a-week tuition.  Not all parents can afford this amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long waiting list is another reason. I understand

that three new special education schools are being built  and

another  nine  are  being planned.   But  they  can  only  be

completed  in year 2004.  This is a very long wait for  those

on the waiting list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third point of clarification is whether MOE can

devote more attention





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>





to help our less successful students with special needs?  Can

the  Learning  Support  programme be extended  to  go  beyond

Primary  2?  Can the Government review its funding level  for

special education schools, making their fees more affordable?

Can we give more recognition to teachers in special education

schools, who have a more difficult job than most teachers  in

mainstream  schools?  Can we speed up the  planning  for  the

nine  proposed special education schools and in the meanwhile

provide alternatives for students on the waiting list?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Compulsory Education is premised upon the

principle that every child matters, we must do more  to  help

our  students  with  special needs.   We  must  provide  more

support  to  the voluntary welfare organisations and  special

education schools helping these students.  We must give  more

recognition  to  our  teachers in the  Learning  Support  and

Enable  programmes  in our mainstream national  schools.   We

must  also  give credit to the teachers and staff in  special

education schools for their love, patience and care for these

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and final point, Sir, is how we are preparing

our  students for the challenges in the New Economy.  I  have

already mentioned that some Primary 6 EM3 students are unable

to  construct  a grammatically correct sentence  in  English.

Clearly,   this   defeats  a  key  objective  of   Compulsory

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, one reason for keeping the below average

students  in  school  is to keep them off the  streets.   EM3

students can fail all their subjects from Primary 1 to 6 with

no  risk  of  being detained in the same level or kicked  out

from the school.  Even if they fail to pick up any skills  in

schools,  at  least their time with bad company and  negative

influence has been minimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the New Economy has redefined the requirement of

basic  skills.   It  is not good enough just  to  keep  below

average  students in schools, to keep them off  the  streets.

It is of little use to have





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>





Compulsory  Education  in the New Economy,  if  some  of  our

students are not equipped with the basics at the end of their

learning journeys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must dedicate more resources to help our weaker

students.   We  should do more to help those weaker  students

who  are  under-prepared  for  the  challenges  for  the  New

Economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, we have parents who over-prepare

their  children  for the New Economy.  Many parents  complain

that   our  education  system  has  become  too  competitive.

Perhaps,  they are partly to be blamed as they  inject  their

kiasuism  into  the  system.  But if so many  parents  engage

private  tuition  teachers, and you are  not  doing  it,  you

wonder if you are giving enough to your child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many busy dual-income parents engage private tutors for

their  children in the lower primary.  Many secondary  school

students   have   different  private  tutors  for   different

subjects.   The  private tuition fee per hour  for  a  junior

college student is a hefty $100.  Not every parent can afford

this.   I am not sure what our private tutor to student ratio

is, but our ranking in the world must surely be very high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been selling photocopied past year test papers

for  the top primary schools, including papers at the Primary

1  level.   Believe  me,  these are  much  coveted  by  eager

parents.   Bookstores are flooded with assessment books,  and

there  is usually a long queue for these books at the end  of

the  year,  because  parents want their children  to  have  a

headstart on next year's syllabus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, this is why we have the undesired tag as being

the  most-bespectacled nation in the world.  It is  also  not

surprising  that  many of our parents are  stressed  up  when

their  children's examination approaches.  I sometimes wonder

who  is taking the examination in school - the parents or the

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of many working parents who apply leave to coach

their children for





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>





their  examinations, the children's examination, that is.   I

know  of  many  couples who refuse to have any more  children

because  of  the  stress  of  raising  children  through  our

education  system.  Some of these stress factors  were  self-inflicted and unnecessary.  Nevertheless, they are very  real

to almost every Singapore parent.  And the last thing that we

all  want  is a generation of overly stressed-up parents  and

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we cannot put the blame entirely on our

parents for this kiasu attitude in our education system.   If

our school system is fully adequate, will there still be such

a  prevalent need for private tuition?  If we have a  smaller

and   more  manageable  teacher-to-student  ratio,  such   as

students  get  more individual attention from teachers,  will

private  tutors  still be in such high demand?   If  we  have

single  session  primary schools where  weaker  students  are

given extra coaching, will there still be a need for so  much

help  outside the school system?  If we recruit,  retain  and

train  more  teachers, if we ensure more  teaching  time  for

students in school, will parents still need to spend so  much

time and additional money on their children's education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the litmus test for a successful education system

in  Singapore  is  in making the system so adequate  for  all

students  that, parental support aside, there is  still  need

for extra private tuition.  If a huge number of students have

to  turn to outside help, then the system is surely not fully

adequate.   On  this basis, I am not convinced  that  we  are

preparing  all our students and their parents adequately  for

the challenges in the New Economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, are we sufficiently preparing our

below average students for the challenges in the New Economy?

Should  the EM3 system be reviewed?  Can we do more  to  help

our  weaker students?  Can we help them and ensure that  they

have  at  least the basics before they are allowed  to  leave

school?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, are our parents unduly stressed and

over-taxed due to the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>





inadequate  teaching time in our education system?   Are  our

students   getting  enough  individual  attention  from   our

teachers?   Are we contented to maintain the same teacher-to-student  ratio  of 1 teacher to about 30 to  40  students,  a

ratio  that  we  have  probably been  keeping  for  the  past

decades?  Are teachers getting enough attention from  MOE  to

help  them  reduce  the  administrative  workload?   Are   we

creating  a conducive environment for our teachers  to  reach

out to individual students and transform their lives?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill on the premise that every child

matters,  especially as we move into the New Economy.   Given

our   population  size,  the  scarcity  and  value  of  human

resource,  every  child does matter.   If  every  child  does

matter,  we  need to move away from the current system  based

principally on a mass production process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that most of the issues that I have just

raised  in  relation to the Bill are not necessarily  new  to

MOE.   I  know that MOE is considering single session primary

schools, but is only prepared to make a decision on  this  in

two  to  three  years' time.  I know that MOE is  seeking  to

recruit  and retain more quality teachers, and with that,  we

can  hopefully  have a smaller teacher-to-student  ratio.   I

urge MOE to do so speedily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many businesses are able to thrive in the New

Economy  because they dare to adopt a paradigm shift  in  how

they operate.  We have, similarly, come to a juncture where a

paradigm shift is needed in how we teach our children in  the

New Economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister once said, and I quote him, that "In the

21st  century, Education must not just respond to change  but

be at the forefront of change.  For education to be relevant,

it  must  embrace change, while remaining rooted in  timeless

value."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Minister in making these changes and urge

him  to  quicken  the  pace of change.  With  these  changes,

including Compulsory Education, we can hopefully





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>





graduate to a world-class education system where every  child

really matters.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of

all,  I  would  like  to thank Members for  their  views  and

contributions.    Some   of   them   have   given   extensive

recommendations on how to improve the education system  which

are not directly connected with Compulsory Education, and the

Ministry   will   certainly   take   on   board   all   these

recommendations and study them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wong has dealt with most of the questions raised by

the  Members earlier, and Minister Abdullah Tarmugi has  also

responded  to the issues related to madrasahs.  I would  like

to  reiterate  on  this  issue of  the  madrasahs,  that  the

Government had no intention, and has no intention,  to  close

the  madrasahs.   And quite on the contrary,  the  Government

recognises  the  need  of  the  Muslim  community  to   train

religious  leaders  from  among its  own  numbers.   This  is

something good for the community and also good for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to address one important issue with

regard to Compulsory Education before rounding up the debate.

This  is  on the issue related to enforcement.  And  this  is

what  indeed makes a difference between Compulsory  Education

from  the  current  situation  today  where  parents  can  be

persuaded, but cannot be compelled, to send their children to

school.   This is really the basic difference between  having

Compulsory Education and not.  Today there are no  powers  to

compel parents to do so, and no recourse if parents refuse to

discharge  this  responsibility even  after  all  efforts  at

persuasion have failed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have suggested that prosecution should

not  be  the preferred approach, and some Members - Mr Chiam,

Mr  Iswaran  -  have also expressed concerns that  fining  or

jailing  parents will not help to solve the problem  of  non-compliance but may instead adversely affect the children  and

their family and make things worse.  I agree with them that





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>





prosecution, and certainly jail, is not the preferred or best

approach, and I have said so in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuasion is, indeed, the preferred approach to take so

that  parents will understand and want to send their children

to  school  to  take  advantage of  the  excellent  education

opportunities  available for their children.  The  Government

provides school places for all children who want an education

in  national  schools, and will continue to  ensure  that  no

child  is  deprived  of  an education  because  of  financial

reasons.  In fact, primary school education is free and there

are a variety of financial assistance schemes in the schools,

in  the community, from voluntary welfare organisations  and,

most  recently,  in the Straits Times, to  help  ensure  that

beyond school fees, for the daily needs of the children  when

they  go  to  school, whether it is pocket  money,  uniforms,

textbooks  -  there are various schemes to help  ensure  that

children  can  go  to  school  regardless  of  the  financial

situation of their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education buttresses the commitment of the

Government  by  setting  out  a  framework  for  counselling,

mediation and further rounds of counselling and mediation  to

make  sure that every effort is made to get parents  to  send

their  children to school.  Indeed, these things are  already

being done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we want to have Compulsory Education and for

Compulsory  Education  to take effect, then  penal  sanctions

must  be  put in place.  This will send a strong signal  that

this  House means business when it says that education is  so

vital  for  our  children that it should be made  compulsory.

And Government must be prepared to enforce such sanctions  to

give  Compulsory  Education the force of  law  if  persuasion

fails.   It  would be better not to have Compulsory Education

if  we  are  not  prepared  to enforce  Compulsory  Education

through legal means as there would be no action that could be

taken  if repeated attempts at persuasion are ignored, or  if

the person just refuses to turn up to be persuaded.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penal sanctions will only be a last resort, after

extensive efforts in counselling and community mediation have

been   exhausted.   Schools,  the  Ministry   of   Education,

voluntary  welfare organisations, the Ministry  of  Community

Development  and  Sports and the Compulsory  Education  Board

will play a part in this comprehensive process.  This process

is  detailed  in  the report of the Committee  on  Compulsory

Education.  I believe the Clerk of Parliament has some papers

(Cols.  971-972),  which I have requested him  to  pass  out,

detailing this process.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20001009/20001009-HA-0720971.gif">Chart - Mediation Processes for Cases of Non-Registration and Dropout (Cols. 971-972)</a><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed model of mediation and counselling

before  we  take  any  action,  which  incorporates  existing

procedures  I  must  say,  the  Ministry  of  Education  will

identify  the children who have not registered with  national

schools and are not exempted from Compulsory Education at the

end  of  the Primary 1 registration exercise each year.   The

Ministry of Education will attempt to contact the parents  of

these children at their last known addresses and find out why

these children have not been registered for Primary 1.  As Mr

Simon  Tay has said, despite our reputation for being a nanny

state, we do not really know where everybody is all the time,

and I think most Singaporeans will be glad to know that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will advise the parents to

register  their child for a place in a national  school.   If

the advice is not heeded, these cases will be referred to the

relevant organisations, such as Family Service Centres run by

voluntary   welfare   organisations,  for   counselling   and

assistance.   They will follow up to counsel  families,  help

them  deal with their root problems and persuade the  parents

to send their children to school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all counselling and assistance efforts to convince

these  parents to register their children for schooling fail,

the  cases will be referred to counselling officers  who  had

not  handled  the cases previously, to bring to the  parents'

attention the legal





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>





consequences of non-compliance, and to persuade them to enrol

their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parents still refuse to send their children to

school,  the  Compulsory Education Board will  examine  their

case and, if necessary, call them up for a formal

hearing  to  determine what further action should  be  taken.

The Board may then decide whether to refer the cases back for

further  counselling or to the Director-General of Education.

It  is  not intended for the Board to be heavily staffed  for

the  occasional case that may arise and which it may have  to

deal  with.  Instead, the Compulsory Education Board will  be

able to call upon the resources of the Ministry of Education,

the  Ministry of Community Development and Sports,  voluntary

welfare  organisations and other organisations which will  be

able to provide counselling services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every stage, we have provided for counselling and

assistance,  so  that parents have every  opportunity  to  be

given  the necessary advice and assistance to register  their

children for school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only parents who persistently refuse to send their

children to school, despite elaborate and exhaustive  efforts

to  counsel and help them, will be referred to the  Director-General  of  Education to consider taking  action  under  the

proposed Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at this stage, the Director-General can decide to

compound  the offence and impose fines of up to $2000.   Only

as a last resort, will the Director-General refer the case to

the  courts.   I  am  sure  that the  courts  will  mete  out

penalties  in  a judicious manner so as to strike  a  balance

between  sending a clear signal to parents about this House's

seriousness  in wanting to enforce Compulsory Education,  and

the  long  term interests of the affected children and  their

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the tools to give effect to the law have to be put

in place.  Enforcement using legal means is exercised only as

a last resort when all else fails - when the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>





Compulsory  Education Board is of the opinion that  the  case

has to be referred to the Director-General of Education.  And

even  then,  there  is  a gradation of legal  measures.   The

Director-General can compound the offences and impose a fine,

or  refer to the courts which have a range of options in  the

penalties to be meted out.  But I hope that we do not have to

use these tools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has all along taken the

position  that  parental responsibility in the  education  of

their  children  must not be undermined.  The recommendations

of  the Committee on Compulsory Education are consistent with

this  position.  The Bill has made it clear that parents  are

responsible  for  enrolling  their  children  in  school  and

ensuring that they attend school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility of sending children to school still

rests  firmly  on  parents,  and  Compulsory  Education  will

continue to uphold the tenet of parental responsibility.  The

Bill reinforces this position by making it clear that parents

have   this   responsibility  under   the   law.    All   the

opportunities    are   there.    The   Government    provides

opportunities for children to get up to 10 years  of  primary

and  secondary education, and indeed well beyond  that.   And

most children go on to do so:  85% to 90% of every cohort  go

on  to post-secondary education in our ITEs, polytechnics and

the  universities,  one  of the highest  percentages  in  the

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in Singapore, most parents recognise their

responsibility  to  ensure  their  children  receive  a  good

education.  Singaporeans do want the best possible future for

their  children  and know that this is best  secured  through

quality education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education builds on this sense of parental

responsibility   by  setting  out  the  minimum   educational

foundation, and I stress minimum educational foundation - and

on  this  matter I agree with Members of this  House  -  that

every  Singaporean child needs, and overlaying  this  with  a

formal  set of procedures to reach out to parents of children

who  have  not  enrolled their children in  primary  schools.

This sends out a strong signal





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>





to  everyone, especially parents, that education is  critical

for  their children to do well in the knowledge age.  It also

lends  force  to Government's commitment that as  many  young

children as possible have an education to equip them for  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Members for their interest in the

subject, for their support and the many suggestions that they

have made that will help us to implement Compulsory Education

smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>ALLOWANCES OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT</b></div>



<br>6.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I expect Members

are  tired after the long session. Fortunately, we have  only

got  half an hour for the rest of the business, so I have  to

be quite short.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked for an examination on the allowances that

are presently paid to Members of Parliament.  May I say why I

am  raising it.  The main reason is that so far, I have  been

talking  about  salaries  of  Ministers,  the  over-excessive

salaries paid to Ministers.  I do not want to be thought





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>





that  while  I  am  belly-aching about the high  salaries  of

Ministers, I am happy that Members of Parliament can be  paid

the  allowances that they are paid at the moment.  I want  to

show  that  my concern applies equally to the allowances  for

Members  of  Parliament.  I also want to say that  I  am  not

raising this out of pique, as may be thought by some Members,

because  I am not paid the same allowance.  I only get  about

one-seventh of it.  I am quite satisfied with that.  It  only

shows  the sort of puny mind of the PAP that they should  try

and be vindictive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present allowance paid to the Members of Parliament,

I  am  told, is $11,800, if they opt not to take the  medical

benefits that are accorded to Members of Parliament,  and  it

is  $10,800,  if they opt for medical benefits.  Previous  to

this   revision, Members were paid slightly over $9,000.   If

you  consider that Members' allowances are exempt  from  tax,

what  do  you get?  Members are being paid something  in  the

region of $13,000 or $14,000 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to put to the House is: do we lack a sense

of proportion when it comes to paying politicians - Ministers

and  Members of Parliament?  I say this seriously, Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, when one considers that there are people in our

society who are only paid $600  a month or even less, and for

working  for eight hours or more every day.  May I make  this

observation that politics is a vocation.  One chooses  to  go

into  politics  or go into Parliament and  be  a  Member  not

because it is a job, or because it has an attractive pay, but

because  of  one's feeling of a vocation, one's feeling  that

one  would  like to contribute towards a better society,  the

present society which he finds himself.  That is probably why

the  term  "allowances"  is used rather  than  a  salary  for

Members  of  Parliament.  I want to ask:  are  we  lacking  a

sense  of  proportion  when  we are  paying  the  Members  of

Parliament  in  this House $14,000 a month?   The  public  is

entitled  to know, as I have been saying they ought  to  know

how  Ministers are paid.  The public is entitled to know  how

this sum has been arrived at. What is the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>





basis  of assessment that Members should receive an allowance

of the sums that I have set out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not as though Parliament

sits  every  day and for continuous periods with  recessions,

twice  a year or so, to give them some time-off from sittings

of Parliament.  In Singapore, Parliament sits every six weeks

or  so  and only for an afternoon or perhaps two, or it might

sometimes stretch to three.  This, of course, is outside  the

Budget  sessions.  Members are not obliged to give  up  their

other  work or pursuit of their professions to be Members  of

Parliament.   And  even  beyond that, there  are  Members  of

Parliament who have very rarely spoken in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the workload of Members in this House that

justifies a payment of the sums that I have said earlier?  Do

they have to travel long distances to come into Parliament as

is  the  case  in other countries?  Do they have to  maintain

residences near Parliament to be able to attend the sittings,

which  they  have  to  do in other countries?   How  is  this

decided?  What  is the workload?  Has that  been  taken  into

account?   I am only talking about Members of Parliament.   I

have  dealt  with the workload of Ministers and I  have  said

that  their workload did not justify the salaries.   But  the

public  is  entitled  to  ask  how  are  Members'  allowances

justified when Parliament only sits one or two days every six

weeks and that only for an afternoon of four or five hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Members will say, "Well, it is not just work

inside this House. We have got work outside Parliament."  But

there  again, how much work do they have outside  Parliament?

Is  the  work  outside Parliament such as  to  justify  these

allowances?    I   was  a  Member  of  Parliament,   with   a

constituency to take charge of, for four or five years and  I

know  what  was required outside this House as  a  Member  of

Parliament  -  meeting my constituents once  a  week  in  the

evenings.  [Interruption.]  I did not lose.  I was re-elected

with  a majority.  At that time, there were no town councils,

but  now  we have town councils. But again, when we  come  to

GRCs, what





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>





is the workload of Members of Parliament in town councils?  I

am  quite  serious about this.  Let the public know how  this

payment  is  justified and not come up with answers  that  we

would not be able to attract MPs in.  Is that the reason?  If

that  is  the  reason for paying Members of  Parliament  this

amount, then I am afraid it is the wrong reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, politics is a vocation and you seek to

enter  Parliament because you feel you wish to  do  something

about  bettering the society from its present state.  I  hope

whoever  replies  will  give us  an  assessment  of  how  the

allowances  were arrived at.  Unless the public is  satisfied

that  politicians do not just go into Parliament  because  of

salaries    or   the   benefits,   but   there   are    heavy

responsibilities  carried by them, they will  begin  to  lose

their interest or trust in politicians and that will be a sad

thing  for  Singapore.  And as I have said, many  Members  of

Parliament  have their own jobs or professions to  follow  or

practise.  Are they required to absent themselves from  their

other jobs to attend sittings of Parliament?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have a sense of proportion about the payments.

Let  us try and justify to the taxpayers because it is  their

money,  they  are our pay masters, to justify  to  them  that

Members  of  Parliament in Singapore do need and justify  the

payments  that  are  being  made  to  them  in  the  form  of

allowances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam made a

speech  on the allowances of Members of Parliament.  He  felt

that  Members of Parliament were over-paid and there  was  no

basis  for the computation of the allowances.  Let  me  share

with   him   the  criteria  on  which  the  allowances   were

formulated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are you on the Committee?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I am not on the Committee. But the

Member  of  Parliament's allowance has been based on  68%  of

Grade  G  Administrative Officer's salary.  This has been  so

even before the July 2000 salary revision.  This same formula





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>





continues  to  apply.  The criteria of arriving  at  Grade  G

Administrative  Officer's  salary  have  been  very   clearly

explained by the Deputy Prime Minister when he presented  the

salary  revision proposal to this House in June. The  formula

is  what  we  call  the  15P32.  I do  not  know  whether  Mr

Jeyaretnam was here when this formula was presented.   It  is

defined  as  the principal earned income of the  15th  person

aged  32 belonging to the 6 benchmark professions, and  these

are  the  bankers, accountants, engineers, lawyers, MNCs  and

local manufacturers.  So, you get the people who are aged  32

in the six professions, rank them, get number 15, look at the

salary,  that is the benchmark for Grade G.  And the  elected

Members  of Parliament's allowance is 68% of that.  This  was

the  basis  before the salary revision.  This  is  still  the

basis  today.   The fact that elected Members of Parliament's

allowance has gone up by roughly 30% is because the  Grade  G

benchmark based on the market has gone up by about  30%.   It

is  therefore  not  true  that there  is  no  basis  for  the

computation of the elected Member of Parliament's allowance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Do you wish to give way, Mr Chan?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you. Is it suggested that the

workload,   responsibilities  and  duties   of   Members   of

Parliament, the Backbenchers, approximate even anywhere  near

those  drawing  the  salaries which are  being  used  as  the

benchmark?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I am coming to that. Mr

Jeyaretnam  asked  what  was  the  criterion  on  which   the

allowance  of elected Members of Parliament was computed.   I

just explained the basis to him.  Now the workload.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam said that Members of Parliament apparently

worked  one  or  two days every six weeks in this  House.   I

submit  that  more  than 85% of an elected Member's  work  is

actually done outside





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>





this House.  Many Members of Parliament nowadays give our  e-mail  addresses  away.  So, we are on call 24  hours  a  day.

When  there  is a fire, we go to the site.  We  are  on  call

every  day.  We  reach  out  and  keep  in  touch  with   our

constituents, not only once a week during the meet-the-people

sessions.   Many of us attend a large variety of constituency

functions to keep in touch, collect feedback  ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Attend hungry ghost festival dinners.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Jeyaretnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Many of us also donate to constituency

functions,   and   some   give  during   funeral   rites   of

constituents.  These are the kind of intangible  things  that

elected  Members  of Parliament do, not in  this  House,  but

outside this House.  I think the situation has changed  quite

a  bit  since Mr Jeyaretnam was in Parliament in  the  1980s.

That  was  quite  a number of years ago.   So,  now  we  work

harder.   As to whether a Member of Parliament justifies  the

allowance  that  has been given, his or her  electorate  will

judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam said that politics was a vocation, was not

a  job, and that  Members of Parliament should not go for the

job because of the high salary or high allowances.  Well said

indeed.   I would want to assure Mr Jeyaretnam that at  least

for  the PAP, we select our candidates based on whether  they

consider  politics as a vocation.  We the PAP MPs  are  very,

very  clear that we are subjecting ourselves to the  judgment

of   the  electorate,  and  we  trust  the  judgment  of  the

electorate.  The electorate is able to look at every  one  of

us  and  see  whether this MP comes just to  go  through  the

motion  or is he or she really committed to be a good  Member

of  Parliament.  A good Member of Parliament is on call seven

days  a week, 24 hours a day nowadays.  I am not saying  that

he  is  physically in the constituency all the  time.   I  am

saying  he  is on call all the time.  If we do not serve  our

electorate well, we are





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>





very clear that we will be out of the office the next round.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You go on holidays!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Well, once I received an e-mail from a

constituent  when  I  was  holidaying  in  Tianshan  mountain

because of some GST problem.  And I e-mailed an appeal to the

Director-General of Customs to explain my constituent's case.

That  particular problem was resolved by the time I returned.

Such is the new work style of MPs in the new economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> That is why I say that it is very

different from the 1980s.  I would say that whether each  one

of  us  is  taking  our job as a Member of  Parliament  as  a

vocation or just as a job, our electorate will judge.  If any

one  is  judged to be here just for the allowance and is  not

putting  his  heart and mind into the job, he  will  be  out.

This  is  the environment all of us have submitted  ourselves

to.  So, I agree with Mr Jeyaretnam entirely that politics is

indeed  a vocation.  On behalf of all my political colleagues

from the People's Action Party, I say we consider being an MP

a  sacred  vocation we are totally committed to, and  we  are

here to serve the electorate with total dedication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have explained to Mr Jeyaretnam the basis on

which  we  arrived at the amount of allowance.  I  have  also

explained to Mr Jeyaretnam that MPs' jobs have changed  since

he  was an MP some 15 years ago.  We are now the new age MPs,

rising  to  the challenge of the new economy.   At  the  same

time,  we have the good old spirit of putting our hearts  and

minds into the vocation, like what a good MP in any era  will

do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

whether  he will allow the withdrawal of funds from  Medisave

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave is primarily intended for inpatient

hospitalisation  expenses. For maternity  purposes,  Medisave

may  be  used  for  the  delivery of a  woman's  first  three

children. This is in line with the national population policy

of encouraging couples to have three or more children only if

they can afford it. Couples who decide to have a fourth child

or  more  must  rely  on their own finances  rather  than  on

Medisave to pay for the delivery expenses.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL AND OUTPATIENT CHARGES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Health

what  is the rationale for the recent increases in Government

hospital  and outpatient charges and its impact on those  who

need long-term medical treatment and medication.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is aware of the impact of rising health care

cost to the public.  Therefore, fees and charges are reviewed

regularly  to  ensure that fee increases,  if  need  be,  are

minimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last fee revision was more than 21/2 years ago. As a

result  of  the   economic crisis, Government  hospitals  and

polyclinics  refrained from revising their  fees  last  year.

However, with the recovery of our economy this year, there is

a  need  to  revise  the fees to recover  part  of  the  cost

increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospitals and polyclinics need to revise their fees

regularly to keep up with the increase in their running cost.

The  increase in running cost is in part due to the  rise  in

manpower cost, which is the single largest cost component  at

60%  of  total running cost.  To keep pace with  advances  in

medical  technology,  the cost of medical  supplies  such  as

drugs,  which  account for another 15% of the  total  running

cost,   will  also  rise.  The  cost  of  replacing   medical

equipment,  utilities, etc. will also add to the increase  in

hospitals' running cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore unrealistic to expect our hospitals and

polyclinics   not  to  increase  their  fees   and   charges.

Singaporeans  should  therefore  expect  such   regular   fee

revisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will, however, continue to bear the major

responsibility in absorbing the increase in health care costs

for  subsidised patients. Basic medical care in the class  B2

and  C  wards  of the public sector hospitals and  outpatient

clinics  will continue to be heavily subsidised,  and  remain

affordable to the lower income group. Those who are unable to

pay  even  the heavily subsidised rate can apply for Medifund

help at hospitals or waiver of charges at the polyclinics.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND CONTRIBUTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

(a)  what  proportion of the Singapore workforce make  no  or

make  irregular contributions to the Central Provident  Fund;

(b)  whether  this proportion is on the rise;  and  (c)  what

steps  are being taken to ensure that these workers can still

enjoy basic social security benefits provided by the Fund.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, about 1.22 million people in the Singapore

workforce make regular contributions to the CPF.  This is  an

increase  of  16%  compared to 1991.  The proportion  of  the

workforce  that  makes  no  or  irregular  contributions  has

remained  stable over the last 10 years at about 17%.   These

could be self-employed persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July 1992, self-employed persons with a net trade

income  of  more  than  $2,400  per  year  are  required   to

contribute to the Medisave Account.  They contribute  between

6%  and  8%  of  their yearly net trade income, depending  on

their  age.  Such contributions are granted tax relief.   The

number  of  self-employed  persons  who  contribute  to   the

Medisave accounts has increased by 24% from 126,000  in  1995

to 157,000 in June 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage self-employed persons to contribute beyond

their  Medisave  Account,  tax  relief  is  also  given   for

additional    voluntary    CPF   contributions.     Voluntary

contributions    by   the   self-employed   have    increased

significantly  by 35% from 58,000 in 1995 to 78,000  in  June

2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Ministerial Committee for the Ageing

Population  had  suggested  that the  CPF  system  should  be

extended  to  provide  coverage for as many  Singaporeans  as

possible.    One   of   the  recommendations   is   to   make

contributions to the CPF Special Account compulsory  for  the

self-employed.   My Ministry is studying this  recommendation

and  will  consider  ways to encourage  and  help  the  self-employed to further save for their retirement.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND SAVINGS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

the  Central  Provident Fund Board has  thought  of  ways  of

giving better return on CPF savings.





<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board provides a risk free return on members'

CPF savings.  There is a guaranteed minimum interest rate  of

2.5%  per  annum  for  savings in the Ordinary  and  Medisave

Accounts  and  4%  per  annum in the Special  and  Retirement

Accounts.   This has worked to the advantage of CPF  members,

especially  during  periods as in  the  current  low-interest

environment where the minimum interest rate paid by  the  CPF

Board  is higher than the 12-month fixed deposit and  savings

rates  of the four major local banks used to compute the  CPF

interest rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF members who believe they can generate higher returns

and  are willing to take on the investment risks, can  invest

their  CPF savings under the CPF investment Scheme. They  can

invest  in unit trusts, insurance, fixed deposits, bonds  and

shares.   From 1st January 2001, CPF members are also allowed

to use their Special Account savings to invest in appropriate

retirement-related financial instruments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For CPF members who do not want to invest their CPF

savings  but wish to earn a higher interest on their Ordinary

Account  savings, they may top up their Special Account  with

Ordinary Account savings to the prevailing Minimum Sum.   The

prevailing  Minimum  Sum is $65,000  currently  and  will  be

increased by $5,000 every July to reach $80,000 in year 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above measures, CPF members are given the

choice to earn a risk free guaranteed return by leaving their

savings  with the CPF Board.  Those who want a better  return

should  do so under the CPF Investment Scheme.  But  as  with

any  investment,  CPF members will have to  exercise  careful

judgement  and  assess their risk tolerance before  investing

their  CPF  savings.   If  they take  a  long-term  view  and

exercise prudence in their investments, they should  be  able

to enhance their old-age savings.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE LEARNING FESTIVAL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

how  successful is the Learning Festival and whether  it  has

achieved the desired outcome.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inaugural Singapore Learning Festival was held over

two  weeks  from  27th  August to 10th September  2000.   The

Festival  was  supported  by  65 partners  from  the  public,

private and people sectors.  Together we organised more  than

300  learning-related  activities.  The  Festival  sought  to

demonstrate the opportunities for lifelong learning to people

from  all  walks of life.  It also highlighted the importance

of  lifelong learning for everyone - young or old, workers or

professionals, children or adults and individuals or families

and  impressed  upon  Singaporeans the need  to  continuously

acquire new skills and knowledge to remain employable in this

highly competitive fast-changing globalised economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Festival and the other promotional

activities,  we  hope  to  create greater  awareness  of  the

importance  of  lifelong  learning and,  over  time,  achieve

stronger  commitment and increased participation in  lifelong

learning.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has only been a month since the end of the Festival,

so  it  is too early to tell if we have achieved the  desired

outcomes.  However, we are pleased with the participation  in

the festival activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, it is estimated that some 100,000 people

participated in the various festival activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2-day Singapore Learning Symposium focusing on

creativity,  leadership and lifelong learning had  about  900

participants   including  CEOs  of  local  and  international

companies,  community  and grassroot  leaders,  leaders  from

unions  and  professional bodies, government  officials,  and

participants   from   training   providers,    schools    and

institutions.   Ninety-six per cent (96%) of the  respondents

of  the  on-site survey indicated that they would attend  the

Symposium again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Learning Expo attracted over 31,000 visitors.

Visitors  included school leavers, working adults,  families,

students, human resource and training managers and members of

trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 3,000 people took part in the Mind Sports Olympiad

which   featured  mind  games  and  activities  designed   to

stimulate  and  develop  thinking,  innovative  and  creative

qualities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Learning Web which offered over 300 learning

activities  at various companies, community clubs  and  other

public  venues  all  over the island,  also  saw  encouraging

participation - approximately 60,000 participants.  Over  80%

of the activities achieved more than 50% enrolment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received requests from members of the public to

have  more activities conducted in Mandarin.  There were also

many  suggestions  to  bring subsequent festivals  closer  to

home.   At this point, let me take this opportunity to  share

with  you  that the Ministry has commissioned Forbes Research

to  conduct a survey to determine the learning propensity  of

Singaporeans   and   to  establish  the  attractiveness   and

effectiveness of the Learning Festival. The findings  of  the

survey  will be ready by year-end.  We will use the  findings

from  the  survey  to  guide us in our  planning  for  future

learning festivals and other supporting learning activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the inaugural Singapore Learning Festival

2000 is but a first step in our journey towards cultivating a

nation  of  lifelong learners.  We are doing a more  detailed

study  of this first Festival and will use the lessons learnt

to   guide  us  in  future  activities  to  promote  lifelong

learning.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND SAVINGS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower,  in  our  overall  effort  in  promoting  life-long

learning  and  letting individuals decide  their  own  career

changes,  whether  he  will  allow  the  cost  of  continuing

education  to  be drawn from Central Provident  Fund  savings

even  if  the  training  courses are not  what  his  Ministry

considers critical for the new economy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of the CPF is to help members save

enough  for their old age.  At the long-term CPF contribution

rate of 40%, CPF members will only have enough savings to pay

for a home, hospitalisation expenses and basic old age needs.

In fact, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Ageing Population

pointed  out  that CPF members should set aside more  savings

for old age and it is for this reason that the Government has

decided  that the Special Account allocation rate  should  be

raised to 4%-8%, depending on the age groups.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers who need to upgrade their skills, have many

opportunities to do so with the support from their employers,

the   Skills   Development  Fund   (SDF)   and   the   Skills

Redevelopment  Programme  (SRP).  Employers  who  send  their

workers  for  training and upgrading courses certified  under

the  SRP are eligible to claim subsidy of up to 70% of  their

absentee  payroll,  and 80% subsidy from the  SDF  on  course

fees.   Individuals who take up training courses  to  upgrade

themselves  through their unions or the self-help groups  can

also enjoy the training grant of 80% from the SDF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government has committed $500 million

into  a Lifelong Learning Fund to help workers upgrade  their

skills  and  seek  further  training.   This  fund  will   be

eventually  increased  to $5 billion.   For  individuals  who

pursue courses on their own, the Government also grants  them

a tax relief of up to $2,500 of course fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, we believe it would not be

appropriate to allow CPF members to use their CPF savings for

continuing education and training.

<div align="center"><b>CRANE OPERATORS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  he is aware that Singaporean skilled crane operators

in  the construction industry are facing dwindling income and

potential  unemployment as a result of his Ministry's  policy

on employment of foreign workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 800 tower cranes in Singapore serving

the construction industry.  The operators of these cranes are

required  to  complete a course and test at the  Construction

Industry  Training  Institute (CITI).   Currently  there  are

about 1,500 licensed tower crane operators with approximately

37% foreigners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, there had been a drop in income

and  job opportunities for crane operators.  But this is  not

just  the  result  of  entry of foreigners  into  this  area.

During  this  period the construction industry  went  into  a

decline.   For  the first half of this year,  the  industry's

output  is only 81% of the 1998 output over the same  period.

Under   such  circumstances,  it  is  unfortunate   but   not

unexpected  that  workers in the industry  will  suffer  wage

cuts.   Since  there are fewer construction  projects,  fewer

cranes would be deployed and jobs for crane operator is bound

to  suffer.   The prospects for crane operators  are  closely

tied to the prospect for the construction industry.  Once the

industry picks up with economic recovery, I would expect them

to also enjoy wage increase and more work opportunities.

<div align="center"><b>GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS REPORT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what is the significance of Singapore being  ranked

2nd in the global competitiveness report.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has performed well in the Global

Competitiveness Report for many years.  We have  been  ranked

as  the  most competitive economy since 1996.  However,  this

year, the US was ranked 1st pushing Singapore to 2nd place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI studied the Report to find out the reasons for this.

We  found that the change in our ranking was caused mainly by

an  important  adjustment in the ranking methodology,  rather

than  a deterioration of our competitive fundamentals.   This

year,   greater   weight  has  been  given   to   creativity,

innovation, and technology in recognition that these are  key

drivers   for  sustained  economic  growth.  A  new  Economic

Creativity  Index  that  measures these  attributes  was  put

together and given one-third of the total weight.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US was the runaway winner in this category, far

surpassing  second-placed Finland  which  ranked  second  and

Singapore  which  ranked third.  The  US'  number  1  ranking

reflects its strength as the global leader in innovation  and

technology.    The  US  has  a large  number  of  world-class

research institutions in both the public and private sectors.

It  leads in technology sophistication and has a deep pool of

talented  knowledge workers. It also has very dynamic  start-ups and strong availability of venture capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a whole, the Singapore economy remains competitive.

We  have  in  fact  improved in many of  the  technology  and

innovation    indicators    this    year.     However,    the

competitiveness ranking this year is a strong reminder of the

increasing   importance  of  technology  and  innovation   as

determinants  of  competitiveness  and  growth  in  the   New

Economy.   We still lag substantially behind the US  in  this

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitiveness in the New Economy will be driven by

how  successful we are able to attract global talent and  how

we  can  enhance the creativity and enterprise  of  our  work

force. We will only know over the long term how successful we

are.    Judging   from   the   initial   response   to    the

Technopreneurship 21 initiative which was launched  in  April

1999,  I  am  not  pessimistic.   Rules  and  regulations  to

support enterprise have been changed.  Start-ups can now list

on our stock exchange, our taxation of the ESOP scheme is now

more attractive and technopreneurs can set up offices in  HDB

homes.   There are now more venture capital funds and joining

a start-up is no longer unusual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the New Economy will eventually affect all

sectors of our economy.  The tradeable sectors have responded

the  most  quickly.   Many companies have shifted  to  higher

value  added activities in Singapore.  These require  workers

who  are  innovative and better trained.  It is a  matter  of

time  before  the other sectors are similarly  affected.   We

will  continue  assisting  our  less  competitive  companies,

especially some of our SMEs, to respond  to the challenges of

the New Economy.

of  specific competencies in reading, writing and arithmetic.

This is deliberate, as we want to emphasise that PSE is about

preparing  children for lifelong learning, rather  than  just

preparation for P1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are mindful that a child needs to learn in fun ways,

and  his motivation and interest in learning must be nurtured

from  a tender age.  Feeding him a curriculum that he is  not

ready  for  and over-emphasising the academic domain  of  his

development  may raise his P1 performance, but  it  may  also

dampen his love for learning in the longer term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, on past occasions, mentioned that MOE will be

more  involved in PSE by paying particular attention on  high

leverage  areas  like designing a developmentally-appropriate

curriculum,  defining  the  minimum  standards  of   teacher-training,  conducting research and improving  the  regulatory

framework.   The  set  of  desired outcomes  will  guide  our

efforts in these areas and ensure that our aim of preparing a

child  for lifelong learning permeates throughout the various

strands of the review.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how successful we are in providing an

environment  that  is  conducive for  children's  growth  and

learning  is equally dependent on what takes place  at  home.

The  expectations and aspirations of parents  have  a  direct

impact  on their children's learning experiences.  Therefore,

I  would  like to urge parents to help their children acquire

the critical foundations of learning, instead of being overly

focused on academic results.

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYED WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower if he will give an update on (i) the current  extent

and  nature  of unemployment for workers between  40  and  55

years  old;  (ii)  the  amount of funds being  disbursed  for

retraining purposes between 1998 and 1999 and the  nature  of

the  courses;  and  (iii) the reasons for  rejecting  funding

assistance   for   training  programmes  outside   of   those

determined by his Ministry, if any.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at June 2000, there were a total of 95,700 unemployed

persons. 37% (or 35,500) were aged 40 to 54 years of age. The

proportion  of  job  seekers aged  40  to  54  had  increased

compared  with  June 1997, before the onset of  the  economic

downturn.  In June 1997, this age cohort accounted for 26% of

job seekers.  The increase in share of unemployed persons for

the  mature  workers  was  also felt across  all  educational

groupings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the main focus of Government funded training

is  to  enhance  the employability of lower  skilled  workers

because  they are more vulnerable to structural unemployment.

Most  of  training programmes for this group of  workers  are

funded  by  the Skills Development Fund (SDF) and the  Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY98, the SDF committed about $82 million in training

grants.   This  helped support the course  fees  for  530,000

training  places  in the areas of Technical  Service  Skills,

Computer-related  Skills,  Productivity  and  Quality-related

Skills,  Technical  Production and  Engineering  Skills,  and

Trade and Craft Skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of course fee subsidy provided by the SDF, the

Government also spent about $20 million per year to fund  the

absentee  payroll  for employers sending  their  workers  for

certifiable training under the SRP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that older workers face

greater  barriers to re-training. Therefore, the SDF and  SRP

also provide enhanced funding for training of workers aged 40

and  above  with  higher  course fees  and  absentee  payroll

subsidies.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the retrenched, unemployed or self-employed, SDF and SRP assistance are available to them

through  the  Community  Development Councils  and  self-help

groups  acting as surrogate employers.  Individuals can  sign

up   for  part-time  or  full-time  training  through   these

surrogate  employers.  Unemployed individuals are also  given

some  financial  support to tide them  over  their  financial

difficulties  during their training period.   In  1999,  more

than  200  individuals attended full-time training and  about

4,000   participated  in  part-time  training  through   this

arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval for subsidy by SDF and SRP is based on the

relevance  and  quality  of the training  courses.   This  is

necessary  to ensure that training leads to skills  upgrading

and   better  employability.   Both  the  SDF  and  SRP   are

implemented with employer support and inputs so that there is

a minimal rejection of training assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the SDF and SRP cater to lower skilled workers,

the  Government also supports the training of skilled workers

and  professionals, especially in strategic  growth  sectors.

Examples of such programmes include EDB's Initiatives in  New

Technology  (INTECH)  Programme  for  critical  technologies,

IDA's   Critical   Infocomm  Technology  Resource   Programme

(CITREP) for the infocommunication sector and MOM's Strategic

Manpower   Conversion   Programme  (SMCP),   also   for   the

infocommunication sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to help the unemployed, my Ministry has set up

a   Career  Centre  to  provide  assistance  and  advice   on

employment  and  training  opportunities.   Those   who   are

unemployed and have difficulty in securing a job can make use

of  the  free services provided by the Centre.  This includes

advice  on alternative employment opportunities and  relevant

training   courses   that  will  improve   their   employment

prospects.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN WORKERS' AGENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  he is aware of the practice whereby foreign  workers

pay  huge sums of money to 'agents' to work in Singapore and,

if so, what steps are being taken to stamp out this practice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment agents in Singapore are licensed and

regulated  by  my Ministry.  They are liable  to  lose  their

licences   and  security  deposit  should  they  breach   the

regulations  or  conditions  of their  licences.   Under  the

Employment  Agency  Rules they can charge  a  worker  and  an

employer  a  commission of up to a maximum of  10%,  and  80%

respectively,  of the first month's earnings of  the  worker,

for each successful placement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, foreign workers seeking work in Singapore

typically first secure the service of "agents" in their  home

country.  What these foreign "agents" charge for seeking jobs

for their countrymen is totally beyond our laws and control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is aware that some Singapore employment

agents   do  help  their  counterparts  collect  the  foreign

"agents'  "  fees.   However, this is  a  business  agreement

between the parties which  the foreign workers have knowledge

of  and  accepted.  This is not a violation of the Employment

Agencies Act.

<div align="center"><b>FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry what is the progress of the Government's efforts  in

the Free Trade Agreement negotiations with regional countries

and  how the business community and Singapore workforce  will

benefit  from the Agreements Singapore has entered into  with

other countries.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations are

progressing at an encouraging pace.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We completed negotiations on a free trade agreement with

New Zealand on 18th August 2000. This agreement, known as the

"Agreement  between  New Zealand and Singapore  on  a  Closer

Economic  Partnership" or ANZSCEP, has been approved  by  the

Cabinets  of both governments.  The agreement will come  into

force  once the two governments sign and ratify it.  We  hope

to do this within the next few months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joint study between Japan and Singapore officials on

establishing a Japan Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement

(JSEPA) was concluded on 29th September 2000. The report  has

recommended   a  "new  age"  FTA.   Besides  the  traditional

elements  of  liberalisation of trade in goods and  services,

and  investment guarantees, new elements of collaboration  in

high-growth  areas  such  as info-communications  technology,

financial services and life sciences have also been included.

The  report, which has been published, has been submitted  to

the  Prime  Ministers of both sides for  a  decision  on  the

launching of formal negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Mexico-Singapore FTA, we have conducted three

rounds  of negotiations since my visit to Mexico in May  this

year.    As agreed between myself and my Mexican counterpart,

Dr   Herminio   Blanco,  we  should  try  to   complete   our

negotiations for a Mexico-Singapore FTA by November, in  time

for  PM Goh and President Zedillo to witness its signing when

the  President  is in South East Asia for the  APEC  Leaders'

Meeting.   However, if negotiations cannot  be  completed  by

then,  we  will continue the negotiations and aim to complete

these   by   the   middle  of  next   year.    The   incoming

administration  of  President-elect  Fox  has  expressed  his

support for the free trade agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also held exploratory talks with Canada on a

Canada-Singapore FTA.  Singapore sees strategic value in such

an  FTA, that will build a further bridge across the Pacific.

We  hope  to  launch  formal negotiations once  the  Canadian

Cabinet gives its formal endorsement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the AEM meeting in Chiangmai last week, the Ministers

of  ASEAN,  Australia and New Zealand agreed to  put  on  the

official  agenda  the  consideration  of  a  Closer  Economic

Partnership  (CEP) between AFTA and CER. Such  a  Partnership

will  involve an enlarged market size of 530 million  people,

and a combined GDP of over US$1.2 trillion. A high level Task

Force,  led  by Mr Cesar Virata, has completed  an  excellent

report on the value of such an agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay asked how such FTAs benefit our workforce and

business  community.   There  are  substantive  as  well   as

strategic benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantively, FTAs provide for a higher level of

liberalisation  in  trade  in  goods  and  services,  and  in

investment.  Our  manufacturers and traders can  enjoy  lower

tariff  and  better market access. Provisions  to  facilitate

trade  and  to  remove non-tariff barriers will also  promote

faster  and  more  efficient flow of goods, thereby  lowering

business   costs.   These  provisions  include   the   mutual

recognition  of standards and conformance measures,  and  the

simplification  of  customs procedure.   Our  consumers  also

benefit from a greater variety of products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our businesses have also embarked on a

globalisation  strategy.   FTAs  help  to  open  up  markets,

especially  in  services,  and provide  legal  safeguards  on

investments.  This  facilitates  our  businesses   in   their

overseas  ventures.  It also helps us to draw in  investments

and create jobs for our workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FTAs can also have collaboration elements to deepen

economic   linkages  between  the  partner  economies.    For

example,  the  proposed Japan Singapore Economic  Partnership

Agreement (JSEPA) includes collaboration in high-growth, high-tech  areas.  These can help us create high value-added  jobs

in both countries, and enhance our competitiveness.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FTAs are also of strategic importance for our long-term

prosperity, and to our ability to create jobs.  Singapore  is

highly  dependent on trade, which is almost 3 times our  GDP.

As  the  world  is  our  hinterland, a strong  and  effective

multilateral   trading  system  is  in  our  best   long-term

interest.   We  therefore attach the greatest  importance  to

multilateral liberalisation under the WTO.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberalisation of trade and investments under the WTO

takes  time,  as  138 members are involved. To  catalyse  the

liberalisation process, like-minded countries can move  ahead

with  bolder liberalisation measures.  The benefits  of  such

measures  will have a demonstration effect and build momentum

for  further liberalisation.  In this way, FTAs can serve  as

building blocks to the WTO.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, important that FTAs do not lead to the

formation of inward looking, protectionist blocs. Hence,  our

FTAs  are consistent with WTO requirements, and are  open  to

accession by other members.   Singapore's FTA partners, which

span   different  continents  and  regions,  can  help  forge

linkages  across  regions and avert the  danger  of  a  world

fragmenting into distinct trading blocs.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN MISSIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  whether it is timely to establish resident  missions

in  the  capitals  of  Canada and  Mexico,  in  view  of  our

increasing economic and trade links with those countries.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country with a highly globalised economy, we

take the issue of our overseas representation seriously.   It

is  an issue that the Foreign Ministry reviews constantly and

carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, the key issue for our Foreign Service, in

establishing new Missions, is that of human resources.  There

is   a   limited  talent  pool  from  which   we   draw   our

representatives and we have to send our best people  overseas

to represent Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something we have explained to many of our

foreign  partners.  We have to accept the fact that  it  will

not  be  possible  to  open  resident  Missions  in  all  189

countries in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried our best to balance our constraints with

the   need   to   advance  Singapore's  interests   overseas.

Therefore,  we  have several arrangements  to  represent  our

interests  overseas,  even when  we  do   not  have  resident

Missions.  For instance, we have a system of appointing  Non-Resident Ambassadors (NRAs).  There are now 21 NRAs.    These

are  successful  and eminent citizens of  Singapore  who  are

based   in  Singapore  but  travel  to  their  countries   of

accreditation  regularly.  For Mexico, we  have  had  a  Non-Resident Ambassador since 1997.  As for Canada, our Permanent

Representative  to New York has been concurrently  accredited

as  our  High  Commissioner  since  1969.   We  also  have  a

Consulate in Vancouver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These arrangements, given our limited resources, are

working well.  Let me stress that the issue of representation

overseas  is not a static one.  Our representation must  keep

up  with changes in the global economy as well as with trends

in  bilateral  trade and economic linkages.  If our  economic

partnership   with   certain   countries   strengthens    and

intensifies, then we will be prepared to review  the  current

arrangements.   Indeed, that is the hallmark  of  Singapore's

foreign policy, ie, to be nimble and flexible.  Let me assure

the  Member and the House that my Ministry constantly reviews

how  we  should  best  represent and  protect  our  interests

overseas  in  all countries, including in Canada and  Mexico,

which are, as pointed out by the Member, countries with  whom

our economic and trade links have been increasing.

<div align="center"><b>PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether his Ministry will allow foreign students studying  in

institutions   of  higher  learning  to  take  up   part-time

employment  so as to ease the labour shortage in  the  retail

and service sectors.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1st July 1994, my Ministry had allowed foreign

students  above  14  years  of  age  and  who  are  full-time

matriculated  or registered student of approved  institutions

of  higher  learning  (IHLs), post-secondary,  and  secondary

schools to work during their vacation without having to apply

for a work permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1997, we had also allowed full time

foreign  students in our tertiary institutions to  work  part

time without the need to apply for a work permit. The maximum

hours  of  work should be no more than 16 hours  a  week  and

these  students  should first seek the  permission  of  their

tertiary institution before working.  This is to ensure  that

their  studies will not be adversely affected by their  part-time  work.   As the number of foreign students  in  tertiary

institutions  who  intend  to  take  up  part-time  work   is

relatively small, the exemption from a work permit is not  so

much  to  help  ease our tight labour market but  to  provide

foreign  students an avenue to finance part of their  studies

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June this year, foreign students from the Singapore

Management  University  (SMU) have also  been  exempted  from

applying for a work permit if they intend to work part-time.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether his Ministry will consider granting dependant  passes

to  spouses of Q2 employment pass holders with an income  far

exceeding the stipulated salary ceiling of $2,000, so  as  to

encourage  the more mature and experienced foreign talent  to

take up jobs where Singaporeans have no expertise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foreigner whose salary far exceeds the basic monthly

salary  of  $2,000  will be considered favourably  for  a  Q1

workpass  which  will allow him to bring in  his  dependants.

Even  if the foreigner does not possess the equivalent  of  a

full  NTC-2 certificate or 5 GCE `O' levels, we are  prepared

to  consider  him  or  her for a Q1 pass  provided  there  is

adequate and relevant expertise for the job in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the workpass system is to allow us to

differentiate the different levels of talents, e.g. P1/P2 for

the top level and Q1/Q2 for the middle management.  This will

help  us  to  focus  our efforts and grant of  privileges  to

attract  the  different  groups of  foreign  talent.   Making

exceptions to certain groups of Q2 workpass holders will only

distort the current system. It would not be advisable  to  do

so  especially  when  we  can  accommodate  these  groups  of

foreigners under the current framework.

$42.5  million respectively. During this period, the  average

pump price for petrol rose from $1.27 per litre to $1.42.  In

April  1999, when the pump price was at $1.12 per litre,  the

from  repeating  the  same mistake.   However,  it  has  been

observed  that  the  pregnant  girls  are  often  in  a  very

desperate situation and likely to resort to extreme measures.

If  parental consent is made compulsory, some may even resort

to  suicide.   There  is  also the possibility  of  going  to

unlicensed   practitioners  for  abortion   locally   or   in

neighbouring countries with its inherent dangers  of  botched

up  operations, severe infection and death.  Besides surgical

procedures  there  is  also  a  possibility  of  them  taking

"medicines" purported to cause abortions which may be harmful

to  health  or be dangerous.  On balance, we decided  not  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As income is not a criterion for seeking medical care at

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at December 1999, 51% of the patients seeking long-term care in MOH funded VWO nursing homes were on public

assistance, 39% were from households with monthly  income  of

less  than $2,000, and 10% from households earning more  than

$2,000 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new 3-tier subsidy scheme considers the household

size  and a higher quantum is given to larger households with

lower income.  Household with per capita income of less  than

$300  per  month  will receive 75% subsidy.  Those  with  per

capita income of between $301 and $500 per month will receive

50%  and  those with per capita income of $501 and  $700  per

month  will  receive  25% subsidy.  The  new  3-tier  subsidy

framework  will  result in higher subsidy  for  care  in  VWO

nursing homes.  Data on patients by per capita income is  not

available as yet as the 3-tier subsidy scheme was implemented

in July 2000.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health,  between  1995  and 1999, what  were  the  trends  on

abortion  in youths in the age cohorts of 13-14 years,  15-16

years and 18-21 years.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of abortions in the age groups 13-14 years

and  15-16  years  is  very small,  less  than  2%  of  total

abortions annually for the period 1995 to 1999 (Table below).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a decreasing number of abortions for the age

groups  13-14 years and 15-16 years from 1995 to  1999.   The

number  of  abortions for age group 17-21 years has  remained

relatively stable over the same period.

<div align="center"><b>ADOPTION OF BABIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community Development and Sports if he will indicate (i)  the

guidelines for the adoption of a baby from Singapore and from

overseas; (ii) the number of adoptions between 1985 and 1999;

and   (iii)  whether  there  is  a  need  to  relax  adoption

regulations to fulfil the dreams of infertile couples.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adoption of Children Act (1985) stipulates the

guidelines  for adoption in Singapore.  Prospective  adopters

petition to the Singapore Court for the adoption of the child

through a solicitor or in person. The Court then appoints the

Attorney-General (AG) who, as Guardian-ad-litem, will request

MCDS  to  investigate  and submit  a  social  report  on  the

suitability  of  the  adoption. If the  adoption  is  in  the

interest  of  the child, the Court then grants  the  Adoption

Order. The whole process takes up to 6 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospective parents who wish to adopt a baby from

overseas  apply  to the country concerned and seek  clearance

with  the relevant authority there before bringing the  child

to Singapore. In this respect, MCDS helps couples to expedite

the  process by providing a home study and suitability report

of the prospective parents to the foreign authorities.  Where

the  foreign  authorities request supervision  of  the  child

after  he  or  she is here and before adoption is  concluded,

MCDS  also provides the service and submits progress  reports

of the child to the foreign authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data on the number of legal adoptions investigated

by  MCDS over  the past 10 years show an increase.   In 1990,

there  were  595 adoptions completed and 721  in  1999.   The

number  of  foreign  babies  adopted  in  recent  years   has

stabilised  at  an average of 430 per year. The  adoption  of

foreign  babies often depends on the preferences  of  parents

and  the  ease  of  sourcing for babies from  the  respective

countries.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system of assessing suitability for adoption

is  a  comprehensive one which balances the interests of both

the  adopters  and  the child.  While  it  is  good  to  make

adoption a speedier or easier process for couples who want to

adopt,  it  is  necessary  to balance  this  with  sufficient

safeguards  to determine that the adoption is indeed  in  the

child's  best  long  term interest.  Adopters  need  time  to

prepare for and appreciate the enormous responsibilities that

they  plan to undertake in adopting a child. We will continue

to  facilitate the adoption process as far as possible  while

working  to  protect  the interests of children  put  up  for

adoption.
