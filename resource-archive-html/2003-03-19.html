<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head L -

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head L, Ministry of the Environment.

Amendment No. (1), Dr Teo Ho Pin.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I beg

to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans enjoy clean air, clean water and a

clean  living environment.  This is mainly attributed  to

the Government's efforts in environment management.  Over

the  last  30  years,  three  key  strategies  have  been

implemented  to  ensure that we have a  clean  and  green

environment, viz, planning, monitoring and enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the new approach towards a sustainable

environment is to involve all stakeholders in environment

management  efforts.  We need to adopt new strategies  to

champion  our sustainable development efforts for  future

generations  of  Singaporeans.   We  must  also  set  new

performance indicators for our environmental performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Can the Minister update the House on the

environmental performance in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What are the measures taken to ensure clean air

quality in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) What are the achievements in waste management

and recycling?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) What are the new measures taken to ensure better

public health?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have 160 minutes for this

amendment.  Prof. Low.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, I

am going to talk about the pollution from 2-stroke engine

motorcycles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registration of 2-stroke engine motorcycles was

stopped  many years ago.  After so many years of stoppage

of   new   registration,  there  are  still   many   such

motorcycles  running  on our roads.   The  poor  emission

control  of  such  vehicles is polluting the  environment

badly.  The amount of unburned hydrocarbons, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



bluish  smoke  from  the burning of lubricants,  and  the

odour have caused excessive pollution of our air, and are

actually  making  it unbearable to our  road  users.   It

affects  the  health of both pedestrians and  other  road

users.  The pollution generated is so bad that one should

avoid  trailing any such vehicle or to open up the window

immediately after you pass such vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For road users like us, who have invested so heavily

in anti-pollution equipment in our cars and new trucks  - I  guess we pay about $3,000-$6,000 per car, inclusive of

tax - is it not only fair for all the road users that  we

consider phasing out such air-polluting machines from the

road?   The  question I would like to ask is:  would  the

Ministry  agree that the 2-stroke motorcycle is a  poorly

fitted  and  air-polluting machine?  Should not  such  2-stroke  motocycles  be completely  phased  out  from  our

roads?   If not, what measures does the Ministry plan  to

take to improve the emission from such vehicles?

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I know

that pneumonia is now a concern.  The Minister for Health

has given us the necessary answers and assurances, but we

must  take care and take necessary precautions.   Now,  I

want  to raise with the Minister for the Environment  the

issue  of  dengue.   I  know that  there  is  no  vaccine

available  now  to treat dengue.  So,  the  only  way  to

prevent  dengue  is to have an effective  vector  control

programme  and  to  engage active  public  and  community

involvement in the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether the incidence of

dengue  is  now  under control, and what  are  the  other

preventive  measures that the Ministry of the Environment

is implementing to control the incidence of dengue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, while we

are  sitting  here  today, 150 government  ministers  and

Heads  of States are now attending the Third World  Water

Forum in Kyoto, Japan, calling for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



help  for  1.4  billion  people without  access  to  safe

drinking water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a lot to be grateful for. The

shortage  of our own source of water supply has  made  us

venture into new sources of water, including NEWater  and

desalination.   To me, NEWater represents the  spirit  of

Singapore.   We  have shown that, in times  of  need,  we

would  master  technology and, with our  strong  will  to

protect  our independence, we are willing to do  what  is

necessary.   The result is NEWater.  But, I  suppose  the

battle  is  not over, because there are Singaporeans  who

are still relatively uncomfortable with NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is: what more is the Ministry doing

to help Singaporeans to be more comfortable with NEWater,

and  what  are  the  plans  to use  NEWater  through  the

reservoirs?   In  fact, I was attending  a  meeting,  and

someone said, "Why is Singapore, which is very well-known

for  being  pragmatic,  not using  NEWater  directly  for

consumption, because it has been proven to be very  clean

and  safe?"   I  agree  with the approach  taken  by  the

Ministry of the Environment to take it step by step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what the plans are, in terms of

our  use of more NEWater in our reservoirs.  What are the

challenges  to  NEWater in terms of acceptance,  and  how

will  the Ministry of the Environment manage it?  I would

also like to ask whether the Ministry would look at other

technologies available, to make more new sources of water

available.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I welcome the

various  initiatives  that  the  Ministry  has  taken  to

diversify  and  sustain Singapore's future water  supply,

and  I  think this has been a source of great reassurance

to  all  Singaporeans.  The Minister has used  the  vivid

analogy  of  four  taps, primarily  the  catchment  water

supply, Johor water, desalinated water and NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I wish to raise here is that the

newer  taps, specifically desalinated water and  NEWater,

are more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



energy-intensive sources of water supply.  If we look  at

the new water process, in particular the aspects of ultra-filtration,  reverse osmosis and ultra-violet  treatment,

as  well  as  the  desalination process,  they  entail  a

greater  need for energy in order to generate the potable

water supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the question I have is whether we are

substituting our reliance on imported water  with  a  new

dependence  on imported oil or other sources  of  energy.

Does  this raise the question of a new vulnerability  for

Singapore,  in  the sense that our new  source  of  water

supply  is  now going to be dependent on the  global  oil

market  conditions?  This point is particularly pertinent

at  this stage where there is considerable volatility  in

the  global  energy  market.  I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister for his assessment of the new reliance on energy

for  our  water supply, and whether there is  a  need  to

diversify,  away  from  this vulnerability,  through  new

technologies and, perhaps, new sources of energy as well.

If  so, what measures are being taken by the Ministry for

that purpose?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, we are lucky to

be  able to take advantage of a new technology to produce

NEWater, to avoid being arm-twisted by our neighbour, who

proclaims  to  love our people's money.  I  am  confident

that,  with  the Government's multi-pronged  approach  on

water  provision, and with the many-taps-running concept,

Singapore would be self-sufficient in our water supply in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that being self-sufficient is not

sufficient.  To benefit the people, the effort  in  self-sufficiency  in water must also translate  into  economic

benefits  for  our  people, ie, can Singaporeans  benefit

from  lower water tariffs as a result of self-sufficiency

in  water supply?  The deep sewer tunnel project  is  one

that would provide the infrastructure for NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development, water-borne fees were raised

100%  some  years  ago.   This has  increased  the  total

utility bill size for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



households.  A water conservation tax of 30% was  imposed

on  the first 40 cubic metres of consumption, which means

that  every  household is subject to higher water  bills,

unless  we  do  not use water at all.  The rationale  for

this  tax then was to gradually increase the water price,

in   anticipation  of  higher  cost  of   water.    Water

consumption, at a higher quantity, is charged at a higher

rate and tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we take all the charges and taxes in total,

Singaporeans are paying a high water rate.  I would  like

to  know  whether the water tariffs could be lowered,  in

view  of the successful implementation of NEWater,  which

is  less  costly than expected.  With the advancement  in

membrane  technology,  seawater  desalination   is   also

expected to cost less.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the availability of

NEWater   and  desalinated  water  should  not  make   us

complacent.  I am happy to note that the Ministry of  the

Environment  has  launched a comprehensive  programme  to

educate  the public on how to prevent wastage of  potable

water.  What are the targets which the Ministry hopes  to

achieve in this water conservation programme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some domestic uses do not need potable water,

eg,  watering  of plants, washing of void  decks  of  HDB

blocks,  as well as the cleaning of commercial buildings.

Would  the Ministry consider a separate supply system  of

water  to households and commercial users for non-potable

usage?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam See Tong is not present.

Prof. Low Seow Chay.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, my cut is on the

price  of  water.   When  the 1961 Water  Agreement  with

Malaysia  lapses, the alternative water  supply  will  be

through  water recycling and desalination.  As  we  know,

the  cost of water recycling is higher than the raw water

supplied under the Water Agreement.  One may worry  about

the potential rise in the water price after the series of

NEWater plants are in operation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement of the desalination contract

awarded  to the private sector as a BOO project confirmed

the  cost of water from desalination.  The contract price

for desalination is about $0.80 per cubic metre, which is

still  lower  than the current domestic charge  of  water

even  before the water conservation tax is included.   In

my  view, the Government should be able to keep the price

of  water  for a long time, unless the basic  parameters,

eg, the energy cost, change substantially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man-in-the-street is worried about the rise in

the  water bill after the introduction of NEWater and the

water  from  desalination.  The question  is:  would  the

Ministry commit that the price of water for domestic  use

would be kept at status quo until the expiry of the  1961

Water Agreement?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, my topic is on waste

minimisation.   New water sources are one aspect  of  the

need to educate Singaporeans about the value of water  in

Singapore.  Minimisation of wastage is another.  What are

the  plans to bring the message across to a wider  cross-section  of  Singaporeans?  Who are the worst  wasters  - commercial  or  residential  users?   What  about  hawker

centres?

<br>11.15 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that plastic bags and thimbles are being

distributed  free and that is a good way.  But  does  ENV

check  whether  those paraphernalia that are  distributed

are  being  applied in the households?  If water  use  is

still relatively unchanged after this campaign, what more

will ENV do to minimise wastage?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, household

recycling participation increased from about one in seven

in 2001 when the Recycling Campaign was launched to about

one in three currently. The target rate for this year  is

one in two households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if he thinks

the target set for this year is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



achievable.  What are the initiatives the Ministry  would

be adopting to achieve this target?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environment Ministry should be commended for its

unstinting  efforts to promote recycling. Clearly,  there

is   heightened   awareness  among   Singaporeans   about

recycling.   Nonetheless, unlike the urge to  go  to  the

stall  with  the longest queue, recycling is  not  second

nature to most Singaporeans.  Much more needs to be,  and

can be, done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education efforts should be stepped up. Young and

old  must  be  educated  not  only  on  the  virtues   of

recycling,  but  also on the ABCs and best  practices  of

recycling.   They need to be taught what can be  recycled

and  what cannot be, so that trash does not end up in the

recycling  bins.  They should be encouraged  to  separate

their recyclables into different bags so that papers, for

instance, do not get damaged by wet cans.  My legislative

assistant, who lived in Germany for 16 years, shared with

me  that  she feels very uneasy each time she  mixes  her

trash,   as   in  Germany,  households  sort  trash   for

recycling.   In  Singapore, we often find  non-recyclable

trash in recycling bins.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should not only be taught the virtues of

recycling   and   brought   to   visit   landfills    and

incinerators. They should be given ample opportunities to

put  into  practice  what they learn.  I  would  like  to

suggest  to  the  Ministry that NEA organise  a  national

recycling  competition for schools to  promote  recycling

among our young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection points for recyclable materials could be

made even more accessible.  In fact, for every two public

trash bins, perhaps there should be one for recycling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, residents could be weaned from using

plastic  bags  which are environmentally  unfriendly  for

storing  recyclable items, with the provision of reusable

crates  such  as  those SembWaste  is  using  for  landed

housing estates.  In HDB estates, I support the idea that

the Government could also look into providing two

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



chutes,   one  for  recyclables  and  another  for   non-recyclables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, NEA has clearly made a very good headstart in

promoting  recycling.   But  more  needs  to   be   done.

Singaporeans must learn to treasure trash!

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I support Dr Amy

Khor  in  commending the Ministry of the Environment  for

the  efforts and progress that it has  made in  promoting

recycling in homes and the achievements made that one  in

three households now recycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concerns are: what is the cost of collection of

the  recycled materials from house-to-house per household

per  month?  What is the value of the recycled  materials

collected  per household per month?  What is the  average

volume  of  the  recycled materials  versus  the  average

volume  of  the refuse per household?  Would  the  refuse

collection companies be able to sustain this door-to-door

collection?  What other alternatives has ENV explored?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, more education programmes should be

emphasised in the following areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educate the people at home, the young and old, the

school  children,  especially  primary  school  children,

where enthusiasm can still be cultivated on recycling and

what can be recycled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most households are familiar with the recycling of

papers.  Many do not know what are the materials that can

be  recycled,  for  example, glass,  aluminium  cans  and

bottles and at what stage must these materials be cleaned

before they are thrown into the recycling bins.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have some education materials in Tagalog and Bahasa

Indonesia to enable our maids to recycle too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that ENV has introduced recycling

bins  in  some of the public places, for example, Orchard

Road,   hawker  centres  and  MRT  stations.   Are  these

suitable for homes to recycle?  These

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



would  be  suitable  for  small volumes  of  waste,  most

probably  as  a  by-product of the  activities  at  these

places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am suggesting that we designate some areas within

HDB  estates and private estates where recycling bins are

there all the time where the refuse collection contractor

collects  daily.  This  could  eventually  be  the   more

sustainable centres for collection of recycling materials

in  the  long run and are near to the homes where  larger

volumes of recycling materials are available.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, based on the Ministry's

projections on its current waste generation and recycling

rates,  a  new landfill is required once in  every  25-30

years. That would mean that our current landfill at Pulau

Semakau will probably last us till, say, 2030.  From that

point  of  view,  this is a deadline  that  is  far  more

imminent  than  our second Water Agreement with  Malaysia

which  expires in 2061.  It is more critical in the sense

that  land  is  not a renewable source  unless  we  count

reclamation. We really need to address this  issue  in  a

hurry,  it seems to me, to ensure that landfill  life  is

extended for as long as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise the question from both the

supply  and  demand side. From the supply side,  clearly,

this  is not sustainable but it seems to me that we would

need plans for at least one or two more landfills for the

foreseeable future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I have for the Minister is: what

are   the  plans  in  that  regard?   But  perhaps,  more

importantly,  on  the  demand side,  many  speakers  have

alluded  to the point on recycling.  It seems to me  that

land  is  a  strategic resource and providing  additional

landfill  sites  is  going  to be  extremely  costly  for

Singapore.  Should we not be involved in a very intensive

way  in educating Singaporeans on the need to recycle and

creating  the  right  incentives  and,  dare  I  say  it,

disincentives,  so  that the behaviour  adjusts  to  this

reality?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I was in China late last

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



year.  China right now is going through a very fast  pace

of  change - urbanisation and industrialisation.  Some of

the  officials  that I met told me that one  of  the  key

concerns  they face in China today is that,  as  they  go

through the fast pace of development, how do they  ensure

that  the  environment is protected so that, in  time  to

come,  the  environment will continue to be liveable.   I

asked  them,  "How do you know? What kind of  performance

indicators  would  you use so that you know  whether  the

environment is being protected?"  They replied to  me  in

Chinese.  They said, "This is our target.  Tian kong  shi

lan  de.  Yuan di shi lu de.  Liu shui shi qing de.  Kong

qi  shi tian de."  Loosely translated, what he meant  was

the  sky  hopefully will remain blue,  the  land  remains

green,  the water pure and clear, and the air will remain

fresh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier, various MPs, Dr Teo Ho Pin and others,

asked for an update of the environmental performance.  So

I  asked my officials at NEA the same questions.  I asked

my  officials, "Tell me, what is the colour of our  sky?"

And my colleagues in NEA told me, "Minister, we are okay.

The sky is still blue and the air is fresh."  I said, "On

what basis did you come to that conclusion?"  He said  if

we  were to look at the pollutant standards index  (PSI),

in  fact,  since 1993, on the average, about 70%  of  the

days  in Singapore, the PSI is less than 50, which is  in

the  good range.  But in the last two years, it has  gone

up  to more than 80%.  In other words, the number of days

in  Singapore with PSI within the good range has gone  up

and  that  includes those days where we were affected  by

the  regional haze.  If we were to exclude the period  of

the regional haze, in fact, last year, 98% of the days in

Singapore  were within the PSI.  If not for the  regional

haze,  almost every day, we do enjoy good air quality  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to emphasise that this clear air and

blue sky in Singapore did not happen by chance.  Over the

years, we have worked very closely with the industries to

control  emission from the industries.  In fact,  we  are

working very closely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



with the industries to promote the use of cleaner fuel as

well.   Take, for example, the generation of electricity.

In  the  year  2000,  about 19%  of  the  electricity  in

Singapore was generated using natural gas.  It  has  gone

up  to  47%  last year, which means almost  half  of  the

electricity we use today is generated using natural  gas,

which  is a source of cleaner energy.  At the same  time,

we  have  also  stepped up enforcement in monitoring,  in

terms of vehicle emissions.  In fact, over the years,  we

have progressively tightened up on the emission standards

and,  together with enforcement standards, I am happy  to

inform the House that the percentage of smoky vehicles in

Singapore  has declined from 5.8% 10 years  ago  to  0.8%

last  year.   So  this combination of  factors,  emission

control in the industries and vehicular emission, has led

to a better quality of air in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether two-stroke

motorcycles  are a problem and whether we can  phase  out

two-stroke motorcycles completely.  Sir, firstly, I  want

to   clarify   that   the  registration   of   two-stroke

motorcycles  has  not stopped.  Even today,  anybody  can

still  register a two-stroke motorcycle as  long  as  the

vehicle  satisfies our emission standards.  I agree  with

Prof. Low that the two-stroke motorcycles at times can be

a  problem because the design of the vehicle is such that

the  owner needs to mix the lubrication oil together with

the  petrol in the engine.  And at times, if you were  to

add  too much of the lubrication oil, the motorcycle will

end  up  emitting white smoke.  But I was told  that  the

newer two-stroke motorcycles now come with this automatic

pump  and  this pump will ensure that a correct  dose  of

lubrication  oil is being added.  I want to inform  Prof.

Low  that there is no plan at all for us to phase out the

two-stroke  motorcycles because we are not aware  of  any

country in this world that has done so.  As far as ENV is

concerned,  as long as any vehicle, whether  it  is  two-stroke  or four-stroke, satisfies our emission standards,

it should be allowed on the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the area of weather forecast.

None  of  the Members here asked me about the quality  of

our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



weather  forecast.  But I thought since  we  are  talking

about clean and fresh air, it is useful also to say a few

words about the work put in by my colleagues in the  area

of weather forecasting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember sometime ago, we, including myself,

often  make fun of our weather forecast.  Why?   Because,

without listening to the weather forecast, you and I know

that  the weather forecast will be "scattered showers  at

isolated places".  Obviously, many of us did not find  it

very  useful.   But let us be very fair  to  our  Weather

Department  because  it  is very  difficult  to  forecast

weather in a tropical island where the weather season  is

shorter and, therefore, it is very difficult for us to be

accurate.   But  what  the weather forecasting  officials

have done is that, since 1997, they have been fully aware

that  members of the public do expect a more useful  form

of weather forecasting. So, in 1997, we divided Singapore

into  various  regions.  In 1997, we  started  with  five

regions  and,  in the year 2000, it had  gone  up  to  19

regions  and,  at  this moment, they are  working  on  32

regions.   What this means is that you can  now  actually

ask  for  the  weather  forecast for  a  specific  region

because  the  whole of Singapore is now divided  into  32

regions.  Depending whether you are in Jurong or Tuas  or

wherever, you can ask for the weather forecast  which  is

specific to that particular location.

<br>11.30 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more useful is that, instead of giving

a  24-hour  forecast,  which is  quite  general  and  not

specific  enough,  we are increasingly moving  towards  a

three-hour  forecast, what we call "now-cast".   So  far,

based  on the reaction from the public, it is clear  that

most  of  the  public find this "now-cast" concept  quite

useful.  For example, businesses are coming to us to  ask

for  weather  forecasts for specific  areas  of  business

operations.   For  recreation, there are  times  you  may

organise outdoor functions at West Coast Park, East Coast

Park,  and so on.  In fact, we are getting more inquiries

regarding   the  weather  forecast  for  that  particular

location for the next three hours.  Schools,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



for example, are coming to us to ask for lightning watch,

and  so on.  In fact, last year, about 330,000 hits  were

recorded  on  our  Internet  homepage  and  2.1   million

Singaporeans actually accessed our hotline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing now is to work closely with the

media  to ensure that this improvement in the quality  of

forecast  will  lead to improvement  in  the  quality  of

broadcast.   There  is  no point having  all  these  good

forecasts  if  the information is not being broadcast  to

the public.  So if you were to pay attention to our TV  5

News,  for  example,  you will notice  that  the  weather

forecast  today - and it has been going on for  the  last

few  weeks  at  least  -  is  a graphical  representation

showing  the  weather forecast in the morning,  afternoon

and  evening.  So the forecast is now more specific.   If

you  look  at  today's Lianhe Zaobao, again  the  weather

forecast is represented in nice graphics, indicating  the

weather forecast for the different times of the day.   If

you  listen  to  our  radio, you will  also  notice  that

nowadays they will give you the weather forecast at about

16-17 times a day, and updated based on the latest 3-hour

forecast.   We  hope  that by working  closely  with  the

media,  we will be able to provide better and more useful

weather forecasts for members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the area of land. I asked my

colleagues what is the colour of our land and  they  told

me,  "Minister,  yes, it is still green and  clean."   In

fact, in year 2001, the STB conducted a survey among  the

visitors  to  Singapore and 99% of  them  actually  rated

Singapore  as a clean city.  PERC did a survey last  year

for  the  expatriates.  Again, they highlighted that  the

cleanliness  of  Singapore is one of the top  three  most

attractive features of Singapore.  Sir, the reason why we

are  able  to  continue to maintain a  high  standard  of

cleanliness in Singapore for public places is because ENV

and  NEA will never stop looking for new and better  ways

of keeping Singapore clean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years ago, we opened up public cleansing for

competition  by the private sector.  Today, we  have  two

companies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



cleaning  the highways and roads, and they  make  use  of

very  advanced equipment and machinery.  They train their

workers so that they can make use of this machinery in  a

most  effective and productive manner.  For example,  one

of  the two companies, Onix, actually makes use of GPS to

track  the movement of their road-sweepers.  At any point

in  time, the supervisor sitting in the control room will

be  able  to  look  at  the map and  indicate  the  exact

location  of these mechanical sweepers.  He is even  able

to  tell  whether  the  sweepers were  just  cruising  or

actually  sweeping because all the information  is  being

transmitted.  This is very important because  it  enables

them  to  make  sure that areas that are supposed  to  be

cleaned  at a certain time of the day are actually  being

done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of NEA, our officers likewise make use

of  IT.  In fact, we have this Mobile Investigation  Team

(MIT)  and  they are all equipped with PDAs.   Using  the

PDAs,  they  are  now able to download  any  comments  or

feedback from the public channelled from our call centre.

In  fact, right at this moment, every day, we are able to

respond  to  at least two out of three calls  within  the

same  day.   Sir, as a result, the number  of  complaints

regarding  the  cleanliness of Singapore has  dropped  by

about 30%.  Sir, my message here is that, on the part  of

NEA  and ENV, we will continue to work very closely  with

the  private  sector  to make sure  that  Singapore  will

remain clean and green.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what about water? Water, obviously is clean

and  clear  from  the  tap  that  you  have  and  in  the

reservoirs.   But,  more  importantly,  I  also  want  to

highlight that even the amount of "brown" water  that  we

have  in  Singapore  has declined.   I  am  referring  to

floods.   In 1992, about 10 years ago, we had  about  335

hectares  of  flood-prone areas in Singapore.   Over  the

last  ten  years, we have been able to reduce the  flood-prone areas by 50% to 172 hectares today.  And, over  the

next five years, we intend to further reduce the areas by

one  third to 110 hectares.  In fact, Members will notice

that, in the last three

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



years,  there was not a single case of a major  flood  in

Singapore.   There was no flood that was  more  than  0.5

metre deep with a duration of more than one hour and with

a  flooded area of one hectare, which is about 1.5  times

the  size of a football field.  Even minor floods,  which

are  less  than 0.3 metre and short duration,  have  also

come down from 10 in 2000 to 7 last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have talked about the colour of the sky, the

air,  land, and so on.  My officers then reminded me that

there  is one colour I have not asked.  I said, "What  is

that?"  They said, "You should ask us about the colour of

our  public health."  I said, "Very good.  So what is the

colour of our public health?"  They said, "The colour  is

pink."   I  asked  them, "How can you tell  me  that  the

colour of our public health is pink when I know for  sure

that  the number of dengue cases last year has gone  up?"

They told me that the number of dengue cases has gone  up

from 2,370 the year before to almost 4,000 last year,  an

increase  of 66%, and I said, "Look, with a 66%  increase

in  dengue  cases, I refuse to accept that the colour  of

our  public health is pink."  They asked me to listen  to

their explanation.  Having listened to their explanation,

I  agreed  with  them that they were  right.   Sir,  what

happened was this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, there was a world-wide resurgence of

dengue.  In fact, if you look at several countries in our

region,  for example, in Thailand, the number  of  dengue

cases  went up by 650%.  In Cambodia, it went up by 250%.

In  Laos,  131%.  In Malaysia, there were 54 deaths.   In

Thailand,  there were 171 cases of death.  In  fact,  the

NEA  anticipated this resurgence last year and in 2001  - they  did not wait till 2002 to take action - before  the

resurgence   took  place,  they  stepped  up   preventive

measures.  NEA worked with the pest control companies  to

intensify ground surveillance.  NEA officers visited more

than 48,000 landed properties to advise the homeowners to

take  measures to prevent mosquito breeding.  At the same

time,  they  conducted systematic checks  on  the  school

compounds.  We even conducted roving exhibitions for  the

various construction sites.  So, because of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



this  combination of efforts by the private  sector,  the

people  sector and NEA, even though we could  not  escape

the  world-wide increase in dengue, at least, we did well

in  minimising the impact and we were able  to  keep  the

situation under control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the whole, I would say that we have done well

in terms of the environmental performance.  We see a blue

sky,  green land, fresh air, clear water and pink health.

I guess the next set of questions asked by the Members of

Parliament,  is  how  long  can  the  current  state   of

environment continue.  In short, is our environment today

more  sustainable than before?  Sir, here I am  happy  to

say that our assessment is, yes.  Indeed, the environment

in  Singapore  has  become more sustainable.   Take,  for

example,  the  area of water supply, as mentioned  by  Mr

Zainul.   The  global  community is today  attending  the

World  Water Forum in Japan.  The concern of  the  global

community is that by the year 2025, which is not far from

now,  at least two-thirds of the world's population  will

be faced with water shortage.  So sustainability of water

supply is now a global concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, if you had watched BBC

World  yesterday, it was reported that Singapore  is  the

poorest  country in the Asia-Pacific in  terms  of  water

availability per capita, meaning that the availability of

water per capita, in terms of national resources, we  are

the  worst in the Asia-Pacific.  And, if you look at  the

global  picture, how can we solve this  problem?   If  we

were  to keep on looking for solutions to increase  water

supply world-wide by 20-30%, I do not think we are  going

to  go too far.  What this world needs is an approach  to

the solution that is able to increase water supply by 200-300%,  if  we  want  to  be able to overcome  this  water

challenge on a world-wide basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how can that be done? How can we create a

quantum  leap in the water capacity?  The answer is  very

simple.  Firstly, we must all look for new ways to add to

new sources of supply and, at the same time, find ways to

multiply every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



drop  so that every drop becomes two drops or even  more.

In  fact, this is exactly what we are doing in Singapore.

Over the years we have added new sources of supply to our

supply  system.   So the PUB has awarded  a  desalination

tender.    By   2005,  the  plant  would   be   producing

desalinated water.  PUB is expanding our local  catchment

areas to add to the supply locally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, last year, we have succeeded in

putting  in place a system to multiply the water  sources

in Singapore through the construction and installation of

NEWater  plants.  Right now, two NEWater  plants  are  in

operation at Bedok and Kranji.  The third plant is  under

construction  in  Seletar and the fourth  plant  will  be

built  at  Ulu Pandan.  So together they will produce  55

million  gallons  of NEWater per day.   At  this  moment,

every  day  we  supply  about 2 million  gallons  to  the

reservoirs  and, at the same time, we supply  NEWater  to

the  wafer  fab  park,  as well  as  to  some  commercial

buildings for the cooling of the air-conditioned  towers.

In fact, for every drop of water today that we channel to

the   reservoirs,  there  are  another  3.5  drops  being

supplied to the industry and commercial buildings for non-potable use.  So, we are actually making good use of  the

NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked whether we have any plans to make

more  use of NEWater.  Sir, the intention is that by  the

time  when  the Ulu Pandan plant is ready, we would  have

four NEWater plants at four different parts of Singapore.

Each  of  these plants will have a separate  reticulation

system,  bringing  the NEWater to the industrial  estates

and  commercial  heart within that area,  so  that,  over

time, as much of the non-potable use of water as possible

would  be  met through NEWater.  In this way we  will  be

able to free up more PUB water for domestic use.  Sir, by

the year 2005, as I mentioned, we will have four national

taps  - desalination, NEWater, local catchment and  water

from Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked whether we are working on other

sources  of  supply.  Obviously, PUB would  not  stop  at

these four sources.  We will continue to monitor advances

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



technology  and, at the right time, we will  set  up  new

demonstration  plants like what we  did  years  ago  with

NEWater and, at the right time, going into the fifth tap.

At  this moment, I am not able to give any indication  on

when  will it happen because, at the end of the  day,  we

want  to make sure that the technology is able to produce

the  quality of water that we need and, more importantly,

at a price that is cost competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various Members asked about the affordability

of  supply.   Mr  Low  Thia Khiang asked  whether  it  is

possible  for the PUB to lower the water tariff  so  that

the  benefits of these new sources can be shared with the

public.   Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether PUB  can  fix

the  price  of  water  at what it  is  today,  until  the

expiration of the 1961 Water Agreement in 2011.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain very clearly the situation.

Members  of the House are fully aware that NEWater  today

has  a  new home, the NEWater Visitor Centre.  There  are

about  2,000  visitors  every week visiting  the  NEWater

Visitor  Centre trying to learn more about NEWater.   The

other  day when I talked to Mr NEWater, he was not  in  a

very good mood.  In fact, he was a bit down.  I asked him

why.   I said, "Look, you should be in a very happy  mood

now  that you have so many visitors trying to learn  more

about  you at your new home."  He said, "Yes, I  am  very

happy,  but  from time to time I feel that  I  have  been

misunderstood."    I  said,  "In   what   way   are   you

misunderstood?"   He  said,  "I  think   about   90%   of

Singaporeans  are very happy with me.  They accepted  the

fact  that I am clean, I am pure and I am safe to  drink.

I  have  no problem with that.  But from time to time,  I

have problems with Members of Parliament like Mr Low Thia

Khiang  and  Prof.  Low Seow Chay, who  complained,  that

because  of me, the price of PUB water will go up.   That

gets me very upset."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "That is a very good point. I am going to

Parliament  today, what would you want me  to  convey  to

them on your behalf?"  He said, "Mr Lim, please

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>

tell them that if not for NEWater, Singaporeans will have

to  pay  even  more for the water that they are  drinking

today."   I said, "Why?  How do I convey that to Mr  Low,

for  example?"   He said, "You tell Mr Low,  if  not  for

NEWater, Singapore may have no choice but to find ways to

extend the 1961 Water Agreement because, without NEWater,

we   will  not  be  able  to  find  other  cost-effective

solutions  to reduce our dependency on Malaysia.   If  we

were to agree to the demands by the Malaysians - remember

they asked to increase the price of raw water to RM3  per

1,000  gallons  - please tell Mr Low that RM3  per  1,000

gallons would translate to 30 cents per cubic metre.   In

other  words,  if not for NEWater, if we  are  forced  to

agree to the demands by the Malaysian Government and sign

that  new  water agreement starting from 2011, and  start

paying  RM3  per 1,000 gallons starting from  today,  the

date  of  the  agreement, the cost of water in  Singapore

will  go up by 30 cents per cubic metre."  And Mr NEWater

said,  "That is not all, because the Malaysians  did  not

stop  at RM3 per 1,000 gallons.  Do not forget that their

demand  went up to RM6.25 per 1,000 gallons, and this  is

translated  to  62  1/2 cents per  cubic  metre.   Please

explain this very clearly to Mr Low Thia Khiang and Prof.

Low  Seow Chay that because of me, NEWater, you  are  now

able  to  avoid the need to pay another 62 1/2 cents  per

cubic metre, just for raw water coming from Malaysia."

<br>11.45 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think Mr NEWater has a very good point,

because the point is that the introduction of NEWater has

now  reduced  the need for the PUB and the Government  to

increase  the price of water.  As a result,  we  are  now

able  to stretch for as long as we can and keep the price

of water at the current level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether the PUB can assure

the  public  to keep the present tariff up  to  the  year

2011,  meaning no change in the water tariff up to  2011.

My response to Prof. Low Seow Chay is, yes, we can assure

the  public that there will be no increase in  the  water

tariff for the next 10 years if Prof. Low Seow Chay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



can  promise  us  that, over the next 10 years,  firstly,

there  will  be  no  increase in water demand;  secondly,

there will be no inflation; and, thirdly, post-2011,  the

water  demand  in Singapore will remain at  where  it  is

today.   And without asking Prof. Low Seow Chay,  I  know

that  his answers to my three questions will be,  no,  no

and  no.  Because water demand in Singapore continues  to

go  up.  It has to be.  The population continues to grow;

economic  activities continue to expand, so water  demand

will  continue  to  go up.  As long as  water  demand  in

Singapore  continues  to  increase,  the  PUB   and   the

Government  will  have  to  undertake  the  challenge  to

continue to source for additional supply, whether through

adding new supply or multiplying existing supply.  And it

does  not  matter where the additional sources of  supply

are  coming  from.  It does not matter  where  they  come

from.   One thing for sure is that all future sources  of

supply will be more expensive than the existing source of

supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very easy to understand. Just imagine that we

have  a  tree.  This tree bears fruits every day,  except

that the fruit is in the form of water, because this is a

water  tree.  And what has happened over the  last  30-40

years, we have been using all the low-lying fruits  every

day.   Every morning, we go to this tree.  We just  reach

out  to the tree, pluck the fruits and we drink the water

in the fruits.  We have been doing this every day, and we

will continue to do it for the next 30-50 years.  But the

problem  is  that  all  the low-lying  fruits  have  been

plucked  every  day,  and it is not enough  to  meet  our

increased  demand in the future.  So what do we  have  to

do?   We have to reach out for the fruits that are higher

up.   To  reach out for those fruits higher up,  we  need

more  effort.  We have got to take out the  ladder.   The

same  thing  applies  to  water supply.   For  the  local

catchment  water that we talk about - Marina Barrage  and

the  Lower Seletar Water Scheme - in fact, the filtration

method that will be deployed for this new scheme will  no

longer be the traditional approach, but membrane will  be

used, because we want to assure the quality.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware of the cost of desalinated water,

which  is  more expensive than what we have today.   Even

water from Malaysia.  Some Members have suggested why not

we  go  back  to Malaysia and talk about more water  from

Malaysia.   Again, please do not forget  the  last  offer

from Malaysia for treated water.  It worked out to RM10.5

per  1,000  gallons, which is $1.05 per cubic metre.   At

$1.05, the treated water from Malaysia in the future,  as

demanded by them, will be as expensive, if not more  than

desalinated water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that while I share the concerns of the

Members that we have to keep the cost of water affordable

to  Singaporeans, I suggest to Members of the House that,

let us not mislead the members of the public.  If we give

Singaporeans the impression that it is possible for us to

lower  the cost of water in the future, then I  think  we

are  being  irresponsible.  Because if  we  look  at  all

possible  avenues  in the future, there  is  no  way  any

country,  Singapore included, can find a  lower  cost  of

water  supply in the future.  Does it then mean  that  we

have  to  keep  on paying more and more for  water?   The

answer is no.  Sir, the answer is no because the real key

to  our  solution in keeping water prices  low  is  water

conservation.  We can try to use less water,  because  if

every one of us here can use less water, then we need  to

add  less  water  in the future, and thereby  reduce  the

overall cost of water supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, let me respond to the question from

Mr  Zainul  Abidin.  He wanted to know who are the  worst

water  wasters in Singapore today.  I am happy to  inform

Mr  Zainul that on a per capita basis, Singaporeans today

consume about 165 litres of water every day, and  it  has

stabilised  over the last five years.  In  fact,  at  165

litres per day, the water consumption in Singapore  on  a

per capita basis is one of the lowest among the cities of

comparable  density.  In fact, if we  look  at  household

consumption, among the households that consume more  than

40  cubic metres per month, the percentage has come  down

from  10% 10 years ago to about 6% today.  What  is  even

more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



encouraging  is  that among the households  that  consume

less  than  20  cubic metres per month, it has  increased

from 56% 10 years ago to 65%.  In other words, two out of

every  three  households in Singapore today consume  less

than  20 cubic metres of water every month.  I think this

is a very good sign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in the industries. In fact, many of our

companies  promote recycling.  Take, for  example,  wafer

fab  plants.   The recycling rate has now  exceeded  50%.

And  for  all  commercial premises, PUB does require  the

mandatory installation of water saving devices.   On  the

whole,  I  think we are conserving, and I  do  not  think

there is any major waster, so to speak, in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman asked what is our target in water

conservation.   Sir, the target of PUB  is  to  keep  the

water consumption per capita at 165 litres per person per

day, meaning that as we continue our economic growth  and

social upgrading, we hope that water consumption will not

increase on a per capita basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked whether the methods that we are

using  today - thimbles and so on - have been  effective.

I  am  happy  to  say  that the PUB  launched  the  water

efficient homes in February, just last month, at the Paya

Lebar  constituency.  About 3,000 households in 31 blocks

were  given bags and thimbles.  Later on, after a survey,

we  found that about one-third of them actually installed

those  water saving devices that were given to  them.   I

think this is a very good sign.  PUB's plan is that  over

the   next  15  months,  it  will  be  working  with   23

constituencies  to reach out to 100,000  homes  in  1,000

blocks,  and these are mainly the older HDB blocks.   Our

objective is to help the households, through these  water

saving  devices,  to  reduce their water  consumption  by

about  5-8% per month.  We think this is doable,  and  we

hope  that water conservation, over time, will  become  a

way of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman asked whether ENV will consider a separate

supply system for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



households  for  non-potable  use.   The  answer  is  no,

because we find that it is not cost effective to  do  so.

And  as I have mentioned earlier, most of the NEWater  is

channelled  to  the  industries  and  to  the  commercial

buildings  for  non-potable use.  There is  therefore  no

need  and  it is not cost effective to set up a  separate

system for the households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on water, let me conclude by saying that on the

supply side, we have succeeded in closing the water loop.

On  the  demand  side, our challenge  now  is  to  reduce

wastage  and to encourage more conservation.   I  believe

that  by  working  together, Singapore will  have  enough

water  at affordable prices for a long time to come,  and

we have to work together to make sure that Singapore will

forever be on the right side of the global water divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on quickly to the area of solid

waste  management.  Mr Iswaran asked whether the landfill

site  at  Pulau Semakau at this moment can  last  for  25

years.   He  also asked what will happen  post-2030.   Mr

Iswaran's concern is a valid one.  Because, in the  past,

our  plan was to build a new incineration plant every 5-7

years  and  find a new landfill site the  size  of  Pulau

Semakau,  which is as large as Sentosa island,  every  25

years.    Then we came to the conclusion that it  is  not

sustainable.  And that is the reason why, as mentioned by

Mdm   Cynthia  Phua,  we  are  now  moving  towards  zero

landfill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what were the achievements so

far.  Dr Amy Khor also asked whether the target we set in

the  national  recycling programmes is realistic.   I  am

happy  to  say that at the national level, in  fact,  the

levels  of  recycling is on the rise from 40% about  five

years  ago to 45% last year, and we are now on  track  to

achieve 60% by 2012.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key objectives under the recycling

programme is to promote recycling in the HDB estates  and

in  the  private estates.  So far, we have been  able  to

achieve the target of one in three households taking part

in recycling at the end of last year.  Our target, as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



mentioned  by Dr Amy Khor, for this year, is to  increase

the  participation rate to one out of  every  two.   What

this  means is that we have to move from the coverage  of

service  to the quality of service, ie, making sure  that

the  recycling  system will become more  effective,  more

convenient, to members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue in our programmes, one of our future

thrusts  would be the condominiums as well.   So far,  we

talk  about HDB estates and private estates.  Right  now,

in  Singapore, there are about 1,500 condominiums.  I  am

happy to say that from April last year, only one in 25 of

these  condominiums took part in recycling.  But  at  the

end of last year, it has gone up to one in seven, and our

target for this year is to go up to one in four.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are also increasing the setting

up  of recycling at public places.  Dr Amy Khor suggested

that  we should have one recycling bin to two trash  bags

at  public places.  I am not sure whether that is doable.

But  I am happy to share with Dr Amy Khor that the number

of  recycling  bins  at public places  has  been  on  the

increase.   In  fact, in the year 2001, we had  1,700  of

them.   Last  year, it went up to 3,800.  And our  target

this year is to go up to 4,500, ie, a three-fold increase

over  a  period of two years.  If need be, and if  it  is

viable,  we  will  try  to move  towards  the  target  as

proposed by Dr Amy Khor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my conclusion here is that because of these

various  recycling  programmes,  we  have  extended   the

lifespan of Pulau Semakau from 25 years to more  than  30

years  now.   In fact, our assessment at this  moment  is

that  Pulau Semakau can now last for 35 years because  of

the  reduction  in waste and the increase  in  recycling.

But  we are not going to stop here.  Even 35 years in our

view  is not good enough.  Our target is to increase  the

national recycling rate to 60%, so that Pulau Semakau, in

its  current  form, can be stretched to 50  years  rather

than  35  years.   What we have to  do  is  to,  firstly,

continue   to  reduce  the  amount  of  waste  going   to

incineration  plants; secondly, continue  to  reduce  the

amount  of  incineration bottom ash going  to  landfills;

and, lastly, divert away those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



wastes which are going directly into the landfill site.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether the system today is

cost  effective  and sustainable.  Dr Amy Khor  suggested

why do we not have separate chutes for the HDB blocks  so

that we do not have to do door-to-door collections and so

on.  I agree fully with the view expressed by Mdm Cynthia

Phua  and Dr Amy Khor.  The door-to-door collection  does

provide  a convenient service for members of the  public,

but  the cost of collection is high, because it is labour

intensive.   So, in the NEA, in fact, we  are  now  in  a

discussion  with  the HDB to explore the  possibility  of

having  a separate chute for recyclable wastes along  the

corridors  of some of the HDB flats.  When will  this  be

done?  Once we have sorted out the details, I am sure HDB

and NEA will provide more details when they are ready  to

do so.

12.00 noon

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, in conclusion, come back to the most

important question, which is asked by Mr Iswaran, ie,  at

the  rate we are going, whether we are going to have  one

or  two more landfill sites, and where are these landfill

sites.  Will Singapore run out of landfill sites by 2030?

Let  me  assure  him  that this will  not  be  the  case.

Firstly,  as I mentioned, we have now extended the  life-span  of  Pulau  Semakau,  through  recycling  and  waste

minimisation, to 35 years. And we intend to continue  our

efforts  so  that  its life-span can be  extended  to  50

years.   Secondly, Pulau Semakau still has got  room  for

further expansion.  In fact, Phase 2 of Pulau Semakau  is

as  big  as Phase 1 of Pulau Semakau.  If we are able  to

extend  the life-span of Phase 1 of Pulau Semakau  to  50

years,  then, together with Phase 2 of Pulau Semakau,  we

would have a landfill site available for Singapore's  use

for  the  next  100 years.  And if we succeed  in  moving

towards  zero  landfill, in fact, the day may  come  when

Pulau Semakau (Phase 2) will become unnecessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I have your permission to

seek a clarification from the Minister?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clarification, yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister whether he would clarify with Mr NEWater that it

is  not  Miss Raw Water whom we have to pay  a  dowry  to

marry.   That  is, would he tell us what is  exactly  the

cost  of  producing NEWater per cubic metre,  bearing  in

mind that you do not pay for the cost of raw water?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about

Mr NEWater and Miss Raw Water.  [Interruptions.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can we stop having this

"conversation" with water, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Can I just make it very clear that

any additional cost in raw water would add to the cost of

treated  water  because raw water is  an  input  for  the

production  of treated water.  What we said  earlier  was

that, if not for NEWater, we would have to pay another 30

cents  per  cubic  metre and another 62 cents  per  cubic

metre  for raw water.  All these would translate directly

into the cost of treated water.  So the comparison that I

mentioned earlier was a direct comparison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Low Thia Khiang said that, in the case

of NEWater, because we do not charge for the input water,

the secondary effluence, we are able to keep the cost  of

NEWater  low.  Sir, I am not too sure what  Mr  Low  Thia

Khiang  is  suggesting.  Is Mr Low Thia Khiang suggesting

that we should cost the secondary effluence, add them  to

the  cost of NEWater, jack up the cost of NEWater so that

we could increase the price of PUB water?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would he allow me to

clarify  my  point?  My point is that for treated  water,

right now, you have got to pay for the cost of raw water,

which is from Malaysia.  There is a treatment cost.   But

as  for NEWater, the water input is from the sewers.   So

you  do not pay for the additional cost of raw water  but

you pay only for the treatment cost of the water.  So you

minus away that part on the input cost of the raw water.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Low for his

clarification.  Mr Low should spend some time to  go  and

take  a  look at the NEWater Visitor Centre.  If  Mr  Low

were  to  visit the NEWater Visitor Centre, he would  see

that  next to it, the new water plant, there is  a  water

treatment  work,  what we call water  reclamation  plant.

The  sewer water that Mr Low talked about, which is free,

is  now  being processed by the water reclamation  plant.

So,  it  does cost money to treat the sewer  water  to  a

standard  of what we call the secondary effluence.   This

secondary effluence is then used as an input for NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we talk about the cost of NEWater today, Mr

Low  is correct that we have not included the cost of the

secondary  effluence, for a simple reason.   Today,  this

secondary effluence is also being produced.  We treat the

sewer  water into secondary effluence before we discharge

them  into  the open seas.  In other words,  we  are  not

turning  something which we throw away every day  to  the

sea into a useful product, which is NEWater.  And that is

the reason why we are able not to include the cost of the

secondary  effluence,  because it  is  already  happening

today, ie, it is already being wasted today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a bit complicated for me to try to

explain the whole water treatment process.  I think if Mr

Low  were to visit the NEWater Visitor Centre, I will  be

very  happy  to  give him a personal  conducted  tour  to

explain to him how the whole system works.  And if he  is

still  not convinced, he is most welcome to come back  to

Parliament to ask me more supplementary questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would you allow me to

clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. I would suggest that you visit

the Visitor Centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I have visited the NEWater

Visitor Centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Chiam, what is it that you

want?

missed it.

cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I ask one question of the

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. I am sorry, Mr Chiam. You have

already  passed  your cut.  By the  way,  please  let  me

remind  everyone in this House to switch your mobiles  to

silent mode when Parliament is sitting.  Dr Teo Ho Pin.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, there is a lack of legislation

to  regulate energy conservation in Singapore.   While  I

can  understand the Government's approach to adopt  self-regulation,  the poor energy efficiency of buildings  and

energy   consumption  appliances,  and  the   high-energy

wastage  experienced in Singapore clearly show  that  our

energy   conservation  efforts   are   not   making   any

significant progress.  In Japan, energy conservation laws

are  implemented  in three key areas, namely,  factories,

buildings  and equipment.  There are many laws, policies,

guidelines  and energy conservation measures  adopted  to

provide a holistic approach to energy conservation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, our commitment to energy

conservation  is  still  not very  high.   We  have  only

managed  to form an Energy Efficiency Committee  and  not

many  key programmes are implemented to conserve  energy.

We  need to develop an energy conservation culture  among

businesses,  consumers and the authorities in  Singapore.

As  energy prices are likely to continue to rise, we must

conserve and explore alternative sources of energy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the key policies and strategies to

encourage energy conservation in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Will the Ministry consider legislating an

energy conservation law?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How can we encourage developers, building

consultants    and   contractors   to    build    "energy

conservation" buildings?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What are the measures or incentives taken to

encourage   energy   conservation  by  building   owners,

businessmen and consumers?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, energy efficiency is a

difficult  term  to understand.  I will quote  some  more

other   terms  under  energy  conservation,  ie,   energy

management, energy audit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer, Sir, I would like the National

Environment Agency to look into defining the term "energy

efficiency"  in  the various electrical  appliances  with

quantifiable indicators, so that simple consumers like me

will understand and participate in energy conservation  - again, a very long word.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, many do not understand what "one green

tick" means in the energy labelling system.  I understand

from  MOS  Dr Balaji that, presently, they are  including

the  dollar  amount of electricity consumption  cost  per

month in the energy label for electrical appliances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does this one tick translate into savings

instead of cost (which is currently stated on the labels)

at  the end of the month?  In a normal situation, savings

would mean comparing the cost of electricity used for the

appliance  with that of the average industry  electricity

consumption  cost  for  that  type  of  appliance.   When

consumers know that they are going to save, they would be

better   convinced   to   buy  a  more   energy-efficient

appliance.  We could do more to educate our consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present energy labelling scheme has been

initiated  on  two electrical products, ie, refrigerators

and  air-conditioners.  We should extend this  scheme  to

other   electrical  appliances  quickly,  such  as  water

heaters,  electrical  cookers,  electrical  stoves  where

usage of electricity is very high, and even energy saving

lamps.  I will always buy lamps that state "energy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



saving"  on its cover, but I do not know how much savings

I actually save.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for building efficiency, we need more 3P

partnerships.   The National Energy Efficiency  Committee

(NEEC),  under the National Environment Agency, has  just

started  the voluntary energy audit schemes with industry

that has high usage of oil and gas to better manage their

energy  use.   The first initiative was targeted  at  the

petroleum companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Committee to establish the industry

standards  of measurable energy efficiency indicators  of

buildings  in  Singapore quickly and  encourage  building

owners  to  sign up for this energy audit to ensure  that

our buildings are efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend now is that everyone wants glass curtain

walling  in  offices and even in houses where  the  glass

window  is  like  a glass door with full ceiling  height.

This  feature gives maximum view to the outside but  also

has  a bigger area of heat transmission to the inside  of

the  building.  What are the measures taken by the Agency

to  ensure  that  such  commercial buildings  are  energy

efficient,  including the residential flats  and  houses?

Is  the  overall thermal transmission value that  governs

commercial  buildings  for glass  curtain  walling  still

valid?  If it is, should not our residential development,

especially  condominiums, be subject to this review  too?

To be more applicable, are there other more direct values

such as the amount of energy taken to cool a building?

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, with the war coming in

the  next  few  days, I think oil prices  will  increase.

Therefore,   I   think  it  is  useful  for   an   energy

conservation  habit.  As my colleague,  Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin,

said, we should have an energy conservation culture.  For

the  domestic sector, we should also have programmes like

what  Mdm Cynthia Phua said, to show how we can  save  on

the  usage  of  energy  when we use  air-conditioners  or

refrigerators with energy labelling information.  Will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



ENV  undertake  such a programme and  also  put  up  some

targets for energy saving?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, war or no war,

energy  is a strategic resource which we do not  actually

produce.  If we were to drive around at night, whether in

the city or in our housing estates, we realise that there

is room for energy conservation.  I would like to ask the

Minister  what  is the pattern of energy  utilisation  in

Singapore and what lessons can we draw from them in terms

of  energy  conservation.  What can the  Ministry  do  to

facilitate  better energy conservation and  optimisation,

both for the commercial and residential areas?  Does  the

recent awareness and need for greater safety and security

result in our using more energy for lighting up purposes?

And how does the Environment Ministry reconcile this need

for new use of energy and electricity with conservation?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Sir, on behalf of the Minister, I thank the

Members  for  their questions and concerns  about  energy

use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked what are the key policies

and  strategies  to  encourage  energy  conservation   in

Singapore.  We have good reasons to have a need for  such

policies.   We  are a society that runs  on  energy.   It

fuels  our  industries, drives our economy and allows  us

our  quality  of  life.  And all energy in  Singapore  is

derived from fossil fuels - oil or natural gas.   We  are

totally  dependent  on  imported supplies.   We  have  no

energy source of our own and no control over the price of

oil  or  natural gas.  And Members have pointed out  that

this is dependent on world events, like the coming war.

<br>12.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive strategy to deal with energy use is

therefore   needed.    The  National  Energy   Efficiency

Committee  (NEEC)  is a national multi-agency  committee,

with ENV as the lead agency, to formulate policies on our

use of energy.  NEEC has set out three objectives for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  One, to be energy efficient, that is, to  get

the  maximum output and ability to enjoy our  quality  of

life from each unit of energy use.  This will reduce  the

cost  of  our  quality of life and improve  our  economic

competitiveness.  Two, to be carbon efficient,  that  is,

to  get the maximum output and quality of life from  each

molecule  of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.

This will result in less green house gases and we will be

playing  our part in reducing the effects of green  house

gases on global warming.  Three, to be eco-efficient,  at

least  to have the minimum effect on our eco-system  from

the  emission  of  particulates and pollutants,  such  as

sulphur  dioxide and nitrate oxide, which can occur  when

fossil fuels are burned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with energy efficiency. What are our

strategies  to  enhance energy efficiency?   We  wish  to

enhance  the  efficiency  of energy  use  throughout  the

energy  cycle  and in all sectors of energy  use  without

affecting the life that we enjoy.  For example, on a  hot

and  humid day, after work, a Singaporean goes to  a  pub

and  enjoys a chilled glass of beer in the airconditioned

comfort  of the premises.  The enjoyment of this  quality

of  life is dependent on the consumption of energy.   Our

goal  is  not  to stop the Singaporean from enjoying  his

beer  in order to save energy.  We want him to enjoy  his

beer but with the minimum amount of fossil fuel burned to

provide  him  the pleasure of drinking his chilled  beer.

To do this, several efficiencies are needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brewery must use efficient machinery to brew the

beer.   The vehicle that brings the beer to the pub  must

be  fuel efficient.  The refrigerator in the pub must  be

energy  efficient.   The building in  which  the  pub  is

located must be designed so that it can have an efficient

airconditioning  system.   The airconditioning  equipment

must be efficient in the quantity of electricity it needs

to  provide  each unit of cooling that it produces.   The

power  plant  that generates electricity  that  runs  the

airconditioner  must also be efficient in the  conversion

of  energy in fossil fuels to electrical energy.  If  all

these are in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>



place,  the Singaporean will be drinking his beer  in  an

energy-efficient  manner.   We  must  therefore  aim  for

energy efficiency throughout the energy cycle and in  all

sectors  of energy use.  50% of fossil fuels in Singapore

are  used  for  the generation of electricity,  and  this

makes it the most important factor in the energy cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed asked if privatisation of

energy  supply  would  help to  make  the  industry  more

efficient.  Sir, at the beginning of this year,  the  new

electricity  market  came  into  effect  and  electricity

generators  are  required to sell electricity  through  a

competitive  bidding  process.  In anticipation  of  this

competition,  the  power companies  have  over  the  past

several  years  sought greater generation  efficiency  to

maintain their commercial viability.  Most have opted  to

switch  to  natural  gas  and combined  cycle  generation

technologies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the latest combined cycle plants at the

Seraya  power plant have achieved efficiency as  high  as

56%,  compared  to  about 39% for steam  turbine  plants.

This  translates to an efficiency of more than  40%.   In

the  future,  it may be possible to use cogen  generators

that  use  the  thermal  energy lost  during  electricity

generation to run central cooling systems.  Co-generation

plants  can  achieve efficiency of 70% and  higher.   But

they are constrained in terms of size and location.  A co-generation  facility  has already been  built  in  Jurong

Island   to  provide  both  electricity  and   steam   to

consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed asked

about the pattern of energy utilisation and energy audits

in  manufacturing and in the home.  Manufacturing is  the

second most important sector accounting for 47% of  total

energy  use.   28% is derived directly from fossil  fuels

and  19%  from electricity produced by power plants.   To

improve efficiency in this sector, we need better  energy

management.   An  energy audit scheme was  launched  last

year.  So far, three refineries and a petrochemical plant

have  participated in the scheme and they  have  reported

improvement in energy efficiency and reduction in  energy

use.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently working with industry associations

to  extend  energy audit schemes to more industries.   We

are   also  working  with  our  partners,  EDB,  NUS  and

industry, to set up a framework to train energy  managers

for the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport sector accounts for 20% of total

energy  consumption.  Public transport is more  efficient

than  passenger cars.  It requires about 0.9 mega  joules

to  move  a  passenger a kilometre by MRT, and about  0.9

mega joules by a bus.  A passenger car requires seven  to

10 times more energy than MRT, about 1.5 to 2 mega joules

to  move a passenger 1 kilometre.  There are already many

regulatory requirements that restrict car ownership,  and

we are not suggesting any new ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those who do buy cars, the NEEC will be

launching a scheme to help them make informed choices.  A

voluntary   fuel   economy  labelling  scheme   will   be

implemented  later this year.  The main objective  is  to

raise consumer awareness of the fuel economy of cars.  By

looking  at the fuel economy labels, consumers  would  be

able   to  make  better  informed  decisions  on   energy

efficiency  when they wish to purchase a  new  car.   The

National Environment Agency is also working with LTA  and

other agencies to review green vehicle rebates to promote

the  use  of more energy-efficient cars, such  as  hybrid

cars.   Through  these  measures, car  dealers  would  be

encouraged to bring in more energy-efficient vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building sector accounts for 17% of total energy

use  in  Singapore.  Minimum energy performance standards

for  buildings already exist in the form of design  codes

and  regulations.  While design codes and regulations are

useful to establish minimum energy performance standards,

the  subsequent operation and maintenance of  centralised

airconditioning   plants   in   buildings   are   equally

important.  One way of monitoring energy efficiency is to

audit  energy use.  NEA will work with the town  councils

and building owners to pro-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



mote  energy  audits.   NEEC  also  identifies  promising

technologies  that  promote energy  efficiency  and  will

disseminate this information to the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Othman Haron Eusofe also

asked  about  energy  labels  for  household  appliances.

Consumers and households account for 11% of total  energy

used  in  Singapore.   Airconditioning  and  refrigerator

account for 45% to 60% of a household's energy use.  This

is  the  reason why we have targeted these two appliances

for labelling.  A voluntary labelling scheme was launched

last  year  for  refrigerators and airconditioners.   Ten

major   brands  representing  33  refrigerator   and   20

airconditioner models have been labelled  over  the  last

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to guide consumer purchasing behaviour

towards  sustainability  in energy  use.   Education  and

awareness   on   energy  efficient   airconditioner   and

refrigerator  models, as well as energy saving  tips  are

included in the information kit for new HDB flat  owners.

We  have developed the simple tick system to identify the

energy efficiency of appliances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked how it works. It is quite

simple.   One  tick is good; two ticks are better;  three

ticks  are the best.  To find out how much you save,  you

look at the machine with one tick, you know how much  you

have  to  spend every month;  you look at the  equivalent

appliance  with  three ticks and you know  how  much  you

spend   per   month,  the  difference  is  your   saving.

Eventually,  distributors  will  respond  to   consumer's

choice and bring in mainly three-tick appliances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second goal, how can we be more carbon

efficient?   By switching to natural gas.   With  natural

gas,  for  each  unit  of  energy produced,  less  carbon

dioxide is released into the atmosphere.  CO2 is  one  of

the  green house gases associated with global warming and

using  natural  gas  is  therefore  more  environmentally

friendly.   Singapore  will soon be  getting  its  second

natural  gas  supply  and, together  with  the  gas  from

Natunas,  we expect to have a total of 475 million  cubic

feet per day of natural gas.  And this volume is expected

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



to increase to 675 million cubic feet per day by 2009.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can mitigate the effects of carbon emission by

fixing carbon in bio-mass.  Big countries have large land

masses   and  they  can  do  this  through  reforestation

programmes.   In  Singapore, we do not  have  large  land

masses and whatever land is green.  Our urban environment

is  planned  to provide greenery and green  spaces  which

promote carbon fixation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do to be more eco-efficient and reduce

the  level  of  pollutants  emitted  in  the  atmosphere?

Currently,  levels  of air pollutants,  such  as  sulphur

dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate materials in  our

ambient   air  are  within  US  EPA  standards  and   WHO

standards.  In the next five to 10 years, it is estimated

that fossil fuel consumption for energy would increase by

about 5% per year and so the emission of these pollutants

will  also  increase.  So we need to switch to a  cleaner

fuel.   Natural  gas  is a clean  fuel.   The  switch  to

natural gas by our power generation sector has led  to  a

substantial reduction in the emission of pollutants.   In

the  transport  sector, a shift from diesel  vehicles  to

compressed natural gas vehicles will reduce the  emission

of  pollutants.  Later this week, I will be flagging  off

eight  Toyota  CNG  taxis as part  of  our  programme  to

promote   green  vehicles.   NEA  is  working  with   gas

suppliers  and  fleet operators to  build  a  network  of

refilling  stations  across the  island  to  promote  the

switch from diesel to CNG.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there other ways of obtaining clean energy? We

have  NEWater  through the application of new  innovative

technology.   Perhaps, some time in the future,  we  will

have  new  energy.  We are in the tropics  with  lots  of

sunshine,  so naturally we are studying how solar  energy

can  be  harnessed  as a source of energy  in  Singapore.

There  are  several projects which are ongoing, including

projects like the car park lighting in the Sembawang Town

Council,  landscape lighting at Adam Road Hawker  Centre,

PV  in Changi Naval Base, and there is also a project  in

Marsiling Secondary School using PV equipment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed asked whether the recent

awareness  and need for greater safety have  resulted  in

more  energy for lighting up purposes.  Lighting up  will

consume  electricity.   The question  is  whether  it  is

excessive.   There should be a balance between sufficient

lighting  for  safety  and security purposes  and  energy

conservation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked whether we would consider an

energy  conservation law.  ENV does not have any plan  to

introduce   any  restrictive  energy  conservation   law.

Instead  of  using  legislation  to  force  change,   the

approach  that  we  are adopting is to create  awareness,

build   up  local  capacity  and  capability  in   energy

efficient practices and focus on programmes and  measures

that  are  effective  and, yet, financially  viable.   As

shown by experience with the power generation sector, the

introduction  of competition and market forces  leads  to

energy  efficiency.   Our approach  is  to  align  market

efficiency  and energy efficiency.  This way, the  market

drives energy efficiency and reduces cost to business and

consumers.  Restrictive legislation can easily  become  a

burden  on  our economy.  Our approach is  to  create  an

energy  policy that promotes the competitiveness  of  our

economy  by reducing cost and increasing output.   Energy

efficiency  is good for every one.  It is  good  for  our

environment.    It  is  good  for  business,   good   for

consumers.  And it is good for Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, in support of the UN Agenda 21

on  sustainable development, Singapore has developed  our

Green Plan 2012.  The three key thrusts in the Green Plan

are,  namely,  (a)  quality  living  environment  through

innovative and effective use of technology and  efficient

use   of  resources  to  minimise  the  impact  of  human

activities  on  the environment; (b) active participation

of  all sectors of population; and (c) doing our part for

the  global environment.  Despite the launch of the Green

Plan  2012, many Singaporeans are still not aware of  it.

Many  are  apathetic and do not know what roles they  can

play   in   the  Green  Plan.   In  addition,  not   many

Singaporeans   understand  the  concept  of   sustainable

development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



<br>12.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, environmental sustainability is not just about

keeping  the environment sustainable.  It has many  other

implications affecting the livelihood of our people.  The

environmental management industry is a growing  industry,

and  can create many jobs for Singaporeans.  It can  spin

off  many economic benefits and contributions to our GDP.

Thus,  I would urge the Government to place more emphasis

to seize the opportunities of this sunrise industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What is the progress of Singapore's efforts in

supporting the UN Agenda 21 on Sustainable Development?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What is the public education programme to

increase  awareness among Singaporeans on the concept  of

sustainable development?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Are there plans to expand the scope of our

environmental sustainability efforts?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, it was reported in

Green Plan 2012 that Singapore, together with other small

countries,  was  left  out  of the  second  Environmental

Sustainability  Index (ESI) report  commissioned  by  the

World Economic Forum because of its small size and unique

features.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether we

have   our   own   ESI  to  track  our   performance   in

environmental sustainability to compare against those  of

other  countries,  or do we have plans  to  develop  some

similar form of performance measures.  If we have one, or

are planning to have one, what are the factors taken into

account   for  the  purpose  of  tracking  and  comparing

performance, and what are the targets set?  If  not,  how

then  do  we  assess  our  performance  in  environmental

sustainability?   I would like to note at  this  juncture

that the Minister had answered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



part  of  these  questions in reference  to  the  various

colours of our earth and the sky.  But I feel that we may

want to have more tangible indicators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to ask the Minister how we have

fared   in  terms  of  noise  pollution,  especially   in

residential  areas.  Does the Ministry  work  with  other

Government  authorities, such as the MND,  regarding  the

siting of residential developments in areas which may  be

subject  to  noise pollution, eg, military airbases?   Is

any  environmental impact study done for  such  proposals

before they are approved?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last area I would like to touch on with regard

to  our  Green Plan is how we have fared in  keeping  our

city  clean,  green  and  litter-free.   The  litter-free

campaign  has  been  around for a  long  time.   However,

despite  fines,  work orders and constant  admonishments,

littering  still  remains a problem.   Every  night,  the

areas around the letter boxes in most HDB void decks  are

strewn  with mail junked by residents, even if there  are

bins  nearby.  Grounds used for functions,  such  as  the

year-end countdown, are also usually covered with  litter

at  the  end  of the function.  In fact, even in  private

condominiums, I have witnessed durian husks being  dumped

in  the  lift  after the fruit has been eaten!   However,

being  an  optimist, a positive aspect of  this  negative

behaviour  is that at least it creates jobs for  cleaners

and helps towards reducing unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on a more serious note, we must step up our

efforts to inculcate in Singaporeans a sense of ownership

and  responsibility for public places and  the  habit  of

throwing  rubbish in the right place.  May I  suggest  to

the  Minister  that  he should work with  all  grassroots

organisations  and  other event organisers,  as  well  as

Government authorities, to make every event a litter-free

day.   Singaporeans should learn, like  the  Koreans,  to

take   ownership  of  their  rubbish  and  discard   them

properly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo Ho Pin, please take both cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, 3P partnership. Many countries

have recognised the need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



involve  all stakeholders of the environment  to  achieve

better  success  in achieving a sustainable  environment.

But  this is easier said than done.  To achieve concerted

efforts  of the 3Ps, viz, the public, private and  people

sectors,  requires strong will-power from the Government,

the business community and our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to learn that the Ministry of the

Environment    has   implemented   the   Innovation    on

Environmental  Sustainability  Scheme.    I   hope   this

incentive  will  spur  both the Government  agencies  and

private   firms   to   exercise  more  corporate   social

responsibility towards the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What are the policies or incentives for

encouraging 3P partnership on sustainable development?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What is the take-up rate for the Innovation on

Environmental Sustainability Scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) How can we encourage corporate social

responsibility among firms in Singapore on  environmental

sustainability?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) What measures are taken to educate the 3Ps on

the 3P partnership scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to achieve environmental sustainability in

Singapore,  we must develop a green community  among  our

people.   Singaporeans  must feel  passionate  about  the

environment   and  take  initiatives   to   protect   our

environment.   Many sceptics have said that Singapore  is

able to maintain a clean and green environment because it

is  a  "fine" city, where people are fined for littering.

Based on my experience in managing the town council, this

is  not  true.   In  fact,  we  have  noticed  that  many

Singaporeans  are becoming more conscious  about  keeping

their living environment clean.  Some residents have even

taken  the  initiative to sweep and  clean  their  common

corridor outside their HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to encourage such efforts among

Singaporeans and let them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



take ownership of the environment.  In North West CDC, we

will be setting up a "Green Community" to support the key

thrusts of our Green Plan 2012.  Forty-four schools  have

agreed  to set up green clubs and work closely  with  the

CDC,   our  grassroots  organisations  and  the  business

community on environmental projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Are there plans to build green communities

within our living environment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) How can the Ministry support "Green Community"

groups  to take on more creative and innovative  projects

for the environment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Are there specific plans to help heartlanders to

be more environmentally friendly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, earlier on we heard a very

colourful speech by the Minister outlining the  state  of

the  environment  in Singapore, and also  his  Ministry's

broad objectives.  It was a very inspiring image of where

we are going with the Ministry of the Environment's work.

At  the same time, many Members have raised a whole range

of  questions  on some specific aspects,  whether  it  is

energy or water conservation, recycling, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is an avid promoter of the 3P concept,

ie,  people,  private and public sector collaboration  in

all  ventures.   That being the case, one  area  where  I

would  really seek greater clarification and  explanation

from  the  Minister is the aspect of public education  on

the Ministry's various initiatives and endeavours.  I say

this   because  perhaps  the  most  famous  and  enduring

campaigns  we  have had in Singapore on public  education

messages is keeping Singapore clean and green.   This  is

one   of  the  core  thrusts  of  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment.   Although we can argue about how  effective

it  is in modifying behaviour, the fact remains that, for

most,  if not all Singaporeans, this occupies a big  part

of  their  mind's space so that, even if they do  litter,

they do it guiltily.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, and given the variety of new

environmental  challenges that Singapore faces,  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister how intensive is  our  public

education  campaign going to be to get the people  sector

and  the  private sector to buy into this whole  slew  of

objectives  and environmental targets that  the  Ministry

has outlined.  What would be the indicators of success in

these campaigns, because the fact remains that there  may

be  an  element  of campaign fatigue among  Singaporeans?

So,  the  Ministry  will  have  to  choose  its  strategy

carefully  and  keep it focused.  It is  quite  essential

that  the  Ministry  formulate  a  cohesive  and  focused

strategy in getting the private and people sectors to buy

into its broad environmental roadmap.  I would appreciate

a clarification and explanation from the Minister on this

score.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, hawker centres play a

significant  part  in  the lives  of  many  Singaporeans.

Today, hawker centres continue to provide cheap and  good

food,  which helps to lower the cost of living  for  many

Singaporeans.  The concept of hawker centres has  been  a

great success.  Many Singaporeans, rich or poor, frequent

hawker  centres to enjoy a wide range of food.   Thus,  I

hope  the Government can place more emphasis and  support

on hawker centres in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should allocate more resources to upgrade

existing  hawker  centres that are easily  accessible  to

Singaporeans.   I hope that the Ministry will  develop  a

master  plan  for  the development of hawker  centres  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many advantages to have more hawker

centres.   Firstly, they provide cheap and good  food  to

Singaporeans  at  convenient locations.   Secondly,  they

provide   opportunities  for  Singaporeans  to   set   up

businesses   and,  thirdly,  they  attract  tourists   to

Singapore.  But we must not increase the cost of business

for hawkers, especially their rental and utility charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What is the status of merging the hawker

departments of HDB and ENV?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Is there a master plan to rationalise the

development and upgrading of hawker centres?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) What are the measures to keep rental of hawker

centres low, so as to reduce business costs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Can the Ministry consider a tenant mix policy

for hawker centres to provide more choices for consumers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, the Hawker Centres

Upgrading  Programme is yet another pro-active initiative

of  the  Ministry of the Environment that has  been  well

received by the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how many hawker

centres have been upgraded since the announcement of  the

programme in 2001.  What are the average take-up rates of

stalls at these upgraded centres?  How well received  are

these  upgraded centres by the hawkers?   How  many  more

hawker centres will be upgraded under the programme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that whilst the upgraded hawker centres

I  have  visited  are clearly much better  than  the  old

centres   in   terms  of  design,  ventilation,   seating

arrangement, etc, to ensure that the designs are not only

architecturally  pleasing but also user and  maintenance-friendly,  I suggest that a panel of advisers be  formed.

The  proposed  panel could comprise the adviser  for  the

area,  stakeholders,  eg,  the  grassroots  leaders   and

stallholders,   as  well  as  property   management   and

maintenance  professionals,  to  provide  inputs  on  the

design features of the proposed new hawker centres before

plans are finalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, whilst hawker centres are welcome by many

for   their   cheaper   food  and  convenience,   as   my

parliamentary colleague has earlier suggested, it may not

be  particularly  popular with the young,  who  generally

prefer air-conditioned food courts.  Some existing hawker

centres may also not be doing well due

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



to  poor  accessibility  as well  as  a  small  catchment

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I propose that a comprehensive study of all

existing hawker centres, which have not been upgraded, be

undertaken  to, among others, evaluate the  viability  of

retaining  and  rebuilding these hawker centres.   Hawker

centres  which are not viable should not be  rebuilt  and

should  perhaps even be demolished in the medium to  long

term.   The  Ministry could then consider  enlarging  the

more  popular hawker centres and relocating the  affected

stallholders  to these enlarged centres.  A comprehensive

plan  for  upgrading hawker centres would be economically

more efficient and useful than ad-hoc programmes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

during  the Budget debate last year, I asked the Minister

for   the  Environment  whether  his  Ministry  had   any

intention to take over the control of all hawker centres.

At  the moment, hawker centres come under the control  of

three  Government  agencies,  namely,  the  Ministry   of

National Development, the Ministry of the Environment and

the town councils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawker centres provide cheap and good food for our

people.   They  are very important to the  lives  of  our

people.   For  the Chinese, there is fried kway  teow  or

Hokkien mee; for the Malays, there is nasi lemak; and for

the  Indians, there is roti prata.  Apart from all  these

delicacies,  we  can have a mix of food  for  our  Malay,

Chinese  and  Indian Singaporeans, all  under  one  roof.

This is certainly good for the enhancement of  our racial

harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I understand that HDB is not going to build

any more hawker centres in its new housing estates. So, I

would  like to know whether there is any change in  plan.

Since  the hawker centre is such a good thing, we  should

preserve  it. For example, in the past, the  wet  markets

were  changed to dry markets.  Now, the trend  is  to  go

back  to  wet markets.  Hawker centres are very important

to  us.   The HDB should consider building hawker centres

again to serve the residents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, much has been said by

Members  on  hawker centre upgrading.  However,  I  would

like  to  take  this  opportunity to compliment  HDB  for

having a partial upgrading programme for upgrading of the

markets   as   early  as  1992  and  now,  the   National

Environment Agency for the full upgrading programme.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I have been involved directly in the

partial  upgrading of at least four hawker centres  under

the HDB programme when I was the former CEO of Bishan-Toa

Payoh Town Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to make some comments on the

design of the upgraded hawker centres.  Although the size

of  the  stalls  is  bigger, efforts should  be  made  to

understand  the needs of the different types of  hawkers,

in  terms  of  the ergonomics of the stall design  versus

their workflow. This is critical especially for vegetable

and  fruit  stallholders where they need to display  many

varieties  within the confined space of the stalls.   The

Australians  had  done well and SPRING  had  brought  the

specialists into Singapore to help our shopkeepers.   Our

architects/designers involved in this upgrading programme

should tap into this expert knowledge.  If not, our stall

designs   would  go  back  to  the  basics  again   after

upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to helping our stallholders to upgrade

their skills on the display of goods (lifelong learning),

the Agency may want to assist them in organising suitable

courses  and encourage them to upgrade their  skills  and

knowledge  on  display.  So when the hawker  centres  are

upgraded,  you have not only a new physical  environment,

but a new skill and a new way of doing business as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on designs, although the Agency has taken into

account  the  design of the upgraded  hawker  and  market

centres by having good natural ventilation, lighting  and

alfresco dining areas, it must not be sacrificed for  the

sufficiency of seats in the upgraded hawker centres.  Let

me explain.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a ratio of seats to stalls. If many of

these  seats  are  in  the  open,  there  would  not   be

sufficient seats under the cover, especially in  the  hot

afternoons  and  on rainy days. These are experienced  by

some of the customers in the upgraded hawker centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final question is: since ENV has plans to

consolidate  all  ENV and HDB hawker  centres  under  the

Agency   for  better  synergy  of  resources  and  better

coordination, will there be a re-look into the synergy of

all  the  hawker and market centres, where some are  very

close to each other? What will be the planning guidelines

of  new markets in the newer HDB estates if they are  now

under the management of the Agency?

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, I have the following

questions:   how  does the Ministry  of  the  Environment

monitor that the hawkers are preparing food in a hygienic

and  healthy  way?   I  know that the  stalls  are  given

various grades - A, B and C.  I think this is for keeping

the stalls clean. What is the difference between an A and

C grade?  Are there incentives for stallholders to aim to

achieve an A grade?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question is: hawker stalls are now

allocated  on a tender basis.  Will the Ministry  reserve

some   stalls   to  be  allocated  for  hardship   cases,

especially for older workers who are retrenched  and  may

have difficulty getting re-employment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, Members of this House

have,  over the past few days, brought up instances where

discrimination  against women remains,  such  as  medical

benefits  for civil servants and citizenship for children

of Singaporean women married to foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to bring a more fundamental and

pressing  area  where women are unwittingly discriminated

against  and,  that is, by the current  state  of  public

toilets in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain why I have made this observation.

Presently, most men and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



women's  toilets in public places are a mirror  image  of

one  another  in  terms of size, except for  the  urinal.

According  to the President of WTO - no, not World  Trade

Organisation but World Toilet Organisation - Mr Jack Sim,

studies  have shown that men take 30 seconds  to  urinate

but  women take about three times as long, to be precise,

92  seconds.   Furthermore,  women  being  more  sociable

creatures, socialise in the toilets as they powder.   Men

do not. They neither powder nor socialise. Yet, most male

and  female toilets in public areas usually have the same

number of cubicles and, on top of this, men have urinals.

To  me, this is clearly gender discrimination, hence, the

frequent long queues witnessed in women's toilets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insufficient toilet provision leads to high traffic

and  heavy usage for toilets. Therefore, women's  toilets

usually  become dirtier than men's.  Some women may  even

have to resort to doing kung-fu stance over the WC as the

seat  cover  is  dirty  beyond mere  wiping  with  tissue

papers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To redress this problem, highly scientific and

rigorous  studies have actually been done and have  shown

that  the right number of cubicles required in the ladies

should be based on a formula:  total number of cubicles +

urinals  in the gents x 2.  This is recommended  to  make

things  logical  again, as current toilet standards  were

set  a long time ago when most women stayed at home  and,

therefore,   the   provision   in   public   places   was

insufficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told that in Hong Kong, they are already

tabling  this  law in Parliament and Japan  and  UK  have

strong  lobby groups to make such a change as  well.   I,

therefore,  in  all  seriousness now, strongly  urge  the

Environment  Ministry  to  work  with  the  Ministry   of

National  Development on stipulating the  requirement  to

provide more cubicles in women's toilets as part  of  the

holistic approach to improve the standards of cleanliness

in  our public toilets.  This is the hardware aspect. The

soft  aspect  will be to continue to educate Singaporeans

on  good  toilet  habits  and responsibility  for  public

properties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ENV's sticker slogan goes "We aim to please,

could you aim too, please!"

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, since Dr Amy Khor has raised

all  the important points on public toilets, I would like

to  ask the Minister whether he would be going ahead with

the ranking of public toilets.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, we spoke on the change of

name  of the Singapore Zoological Gardens. However,  this

place  gives me a different nostalgia. I simply love  the

nature and open-air toilets there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the National Environment Agency, our

toilets  in  HDB  coffeshops will be upgraded  under  the

Toilet  Upgrading  Programme,  financed  partly  by   the

Agency.  This would not be the standard equal to that  of

the  Singapore Zoo but would be a comfortable toilet like

that in a 3- or 4-star hotel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are: since the introduction of this

programme in July 2002, what is the take-up rate of  this

scheme?  How much has the Government disbursed to finance

this   programme?   Would  the  Government  continue   to

subsidise this scheme?  The objective of toilet upgrading

is  that  it  will help improve the image of  the  public

toilets  in  Singapore.  Physical upgrading is  only  the

initial   stage.  The  long-sustaining  effort   in   the

maintenance  and cleanliness of the toilet is  even  more

important.  Are there any programmes to ensure  that  the

toilets would be maintained and kept clean to ensure that

the  objective  of  the  Toilet  Upgrading  Programme  is

achieved?  Is the Agency considering taking into  account

the  standard  of  the toilets as consideration  for  the

renewal of the licence of the coffeeshops?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, allow me again to share

the   recent   recycling  experience  of  my  legislative

assistant.  I quote,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I collected newspapers and plastic containers, the

latter  being placed in bags provided.  The  first  time,

only  the newspapers were collected.  Those who came  for

the  pick-up  did not seem to know that they should  also

pick  up  glass, plastics and cardboard, each in separate

bags.  We  were given a bag or two each time. The  second

time,  they  took only what were in the bags and  ignored

the newspapers, maybe because a Straits

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



Times reader complained that her plastics were not picked

up.   There  are no recycling bins in the area  I  lived.

When  I called to ask for it, I was told that they  would

look  into it. That was December 2002.  Still no  bin  in

March 2003."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not recounting this tale as an indictment

of the service of the public waste collector or recycling

company,  but  as  an  illustration  to  show  that   the

standards   of   our   waste  management   industry,   in

particular, the employees, leave much to be desired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the service standards by

the  National  Environment Agency  last  October,  it  is

reported  that  complaints  of  recyclables  being   left

uncollected or collection carried out on the wrong  dates

have fallen by two-thirds. Nonetheless, much more can and

must  be  done  to improve the service standards  of  our

waste  management  industry if we are to  transform  this

industry  into  a  regional  leader,  as  stated  by  the

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skills and image of workers in the waste

management and recycling industry need to be upgraded and

improved.   Like the cleaners, they could be  trained  to

know  what to collect, how to collect and when to collect

the  recyclables.  They could also be given  uniforms  so

that  the  residents can identify them as  the  appointed

people to take away the recyclables.  This may also  help

to deter the so-called "unauthorised" independent karang-guni  men from coming to collect the recyclables.   There

have been reported instances of arguments and even fights

over recyclables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of Waste Management and Recycling

Association of Singapore (WMRAS), through the support  of

the Environment Ministry to raise the standards and image

of  the industry and allow the players in the industry to

work  together  is clearly an excellent  and  far-sighted

initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what further

initiatives  would  be taken by NEA  to  help  the  waste

management  and  recycling  industry  become  a  regional

leader.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the world is

facing  the  problem of water shortage due to  population

growth,   environmental  change,  and  the  increase   in

pollution of the water sources.  The UN estimates that by

2015, at least 40% of the world's population will live in

countries  where it is either difficult or impossible  to

access clean water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one way, Singapore is unfortunate that the

natural  rainfall is just not enough to provide  adequate

water  to  meet  the  domestic and  expanding  industrial

demands  completely.   The fortunate  part  is  that  our

economic strength and technological know-how have enabled

us to obtain water from unconventional sources in meeting

our  water demand. This has created the third and  fourth

water taps in our policy on water sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While doing large scale production from

unconventional  ways,  we have first-hand  experience  in

dealing  with  and  scientific  innovation  in  resolving

difficulties associated with the production process.  The

knowledge gained from the empirical operational know-how,

process design and proprietary knowledge will not only be

an  asset  in  Singapore to produce  water  to  meet  our

demand, it is also an important industrial asset that  is

likely  to  receive significant world  demand  in  easing

water shortage in the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the best technology for this

unconventional way of water production is in the hands of

the  Americans  and the Europeans. This is  a  very  high

value-added industry. While we are looking for ideas  for

the  future  growth  of  our manufacturing  and  services

sectors,  to  further  develop  our  water  industry  and

position  Singapore as a new player in  the  world  water

market  could be viable.  In order to achieve all  these,

there  are  a  lot of things that we can  do,  from  R&D,

technological   innovation,  to  getting  local   company

participation, develop them, provide incentives and  help

them to compete in the international market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I would like to ask the Minister

is: would the Ministry support

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>



this  idea?  What  action  will the  Government  take  to

realise this vision?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, the previous Member touched

on  the  issue of SGP 2012.  Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what  is

the  overall  progress and whether we have any  plans  to

expand   the  scope  of  SGP  2012  beyond  environmental

sustainability.  Dr Amy Khor asked what is the  relevance

of  this SGP 2012 in the context of Singapore.  She  also

asked whether we have come out with our own Environmental

Sustainability Index.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Green Plan 2012 stands up on two

counts.   Firstly,  we  are  shifting  our  focus  beyond

performance towards sustainability, and secondly, we have

set quantifiable targets in SGP 2012.  In fact, there are

not  many  countries that I know of that  have  set  such

clear  targets towards sustainability.  For  example,  in

the  case of landfill, solid waste management, we  set  a

target  of  60% recycling.  We set a target of  extending

the landfill site life-span to 50 years.  In the case  of

supply of non-conventional water, we set a target of  25%

by  the  year  2012.  So, clearly, these are  performance

measures which are quantifiable and which will contribute

towards sustainability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to reassure Members of the House that

when we talk about sustainability, it is not a slogan for

ENV,  NEA or PUB.  It is for real and, in fact,  we  have

committed  ourselves  to achieving all  these.   However,

Sir,  I  want to emphasise that just setting  targets  is

only  half a step there.  What is important is for us  to

transmit this commitment on paper into real action on the

ground.   In that regard, I am happy to say that  we  are

now  going one step further by operationalising  the  SGP

2012.   We  have decided to form a SGP 2012  Coordinating

Committee.  This committee is chaired by the CEO of  NEA.

Under  this  coordinating committee, there  will  be  six

action programme committees, covering various areas  such

as  waste  management,  clean air,  public  health,  pink

water,     conserving    nature,    and     international

collaboration.  All these are key

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



areas towards sustainability.  At the same time, to  make

sure  that the Singapore Green Plan 2012 is not a  public

sector  driven  plan, we intend to  make  sure  that  the

implementation  will be driven by the 3P  partners.   So,

with that in mind, some 100 members would be appointed to

the  various action programme committees, and  more  than

60%  of  these members will come from the private sector.

To make sure that the Singapore Green Plan 2012 will be a

living document and programme that will stay relevant  to

the  changing environment, the coordinating committee and

the  action programme committees would take stock of  its

progress  once every year.  It will review the directions

to  make sure that they remain relevant once every  three

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what we really want to

achieve  out  of  the Singapore Green  Plan  2012.   Sir,

obviously, the first outcome we aim to achieve out of the

Singapore Green Plan 2012 is to enhance the environmental

sustainability of Singapore.  That is our primary target.

But,  we have to recognise there must be a change in  our

mindset   in   the   way  that  we  go  about   achieving

sustainability today versus the past.  Because, today, if

you  look  at  our  population,  our  people  are  better

educated and they are more aware of the environment, with

higher   expectations   and   higher   demands   on   the

environment.  But, yet at the same time, as a  result  of

the  slower growth that we are going through, on the part

of the Ministry and the statutory boards, we are going to

be  faced with a situation of having tighter budgets.  In

other words, as we pursue the targets set up in Singapore

Green  Plan  2012, we have to recognise that  we  can  no

longer  adopt the past mindset of doing more  with  more,

but, rather try to do more with less.  How can we do more

with  less?   Sir,  that reminded me of  a  story.   Four

persons  came together for a meeting.  These four persons

are Nobody, Somebody, Anybody and Everybody.  There is  a

job  to  be done.  Everybody expected Somebody to do  the

job.   Anybody could have got it done but, at the end  of

the  day,  Nobody did it.  Sir, at the  end,  we  have  a

situation where Everybody is upset that Nobody  did  what

should be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



done by Somebody and that could be done by Anybody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of the Singapore Green Plan 2012,

in  order to do more with less, we have to make sure that

everybody  does  not  expect somebody  else  to  get  the

Singapore  Green Plan 2012 done.  In fact,  I  hope  that

everybody would do his part.  And that is the reason  why

we  emphasise  a  lot  on, not just 3P  partnership  but,

rather,  3P  ownership, because ownership is  commitment.

And,  hopefully, with that commitment, it will turn  into

action and into alignment of efforts.  Sir, later  on  my

colleague,  Dr  Balaji  will  address  the  issue  of  3P

partnership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the various cuts by the Members

regarding hawker centres and toilet upgrading.   I  would

like to relate these two programmes to the concept of  3P

ownership.   Dr Teo Ho Pin, Dr Amy Khor, and others  have

spoken of the benefits and relevance of hawker centres in

the  context of Singapore.  Sir, I fully agree.   Mr  Ang

Mong  Seng  made  the observation that  we  have  stopped

building hawker centres.  He is exactly right.  In  fact,

we have stopped building hawker centres since 1985, about

17  years  ago.  In the last 10 years, 25 hawker  centres

were   closed   down  because  they  were   affected   by

redevelopment.   In fact, some of us may  wonder  whether

hawker centres will die a natural death at the way things

are going.  I want to assure the House that the answer is

no.   There  is no intention at all, on the part  of  the

Government, to allow the hawker centres to die a  natural

death.   In  fact, that is the reason why the  Government

has decided to set aside $420 million, a lot of money and

resources, to upgrade the various hawker centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor and other Members asked about the

progress  under  the Hawker Centres Upgrading  programme.

Sir,  so  far,  16  centres with 1,580 stalls  have  been

upgraded  at  the  total cost of more than  $40  million.

Another  30  more  are in progress.  In fact,  under  the

Phase I programme, altogether 29 centres would have  been

upgraded at a total cost of $120 million.  In addition to

that, another

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



15  centres had been identified under Phase II.  So, this

will bring the total number of centres to be upgraded  by

the  year  2005  to 44 centres at a total  cost  of  $190

million.   This  year,  we  are going  to  identify  more

centres to be upgraded under Phase III, so that over  the

next  three  years we would have upgraded  more  than  60

hawker centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have various suggestions and comments

on the quality of the upgrading, whether there are enough

seats,  whether too many seats are in the open area,  and

whether the design of the new hawker centres would really

serve  the needs and purpose of the stallholders and  the

members  of  public.  Sir, I take all these feedback  and

suggestions in a positive light because at NEA and ENV we

are doing whatever we can.  We are doing our very best in

working with architects to design the most suitable  form

of  hawker  centres, not just in terms of look  and  feel

but, more importantly, the user-friendliness, usefulness,

maintainability, and so on.  Therefore, I  welcome  these

feedback  and  comments from Members, and I  assure  this

House  that  NEA, as the agency spearheading  the  Hawker

Centres Upgrading programme, will continue to take inputs

from  the  grassroots  advisers,  the  stallholders   and

members  of the public and will make sure that every  new

centre  that is being upgraded, hopefully, will be better

than the previous one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin made a very important point that,

as  we  upgrade these hawker centres, we must  make  sure

that  the  rental remains affordable to the stallholders.

He is exactly right.  In fact, on the part of the NEA and

ENV,  we  are  very conscious of that.  So, that  is  the

reason  why  we  focus  a  lot of  functionality  in  our

upgrading, rather than spending on things which  are  not

necessary.  In fact, at this moment, we have about 17,000

stallholders  at the various hawker centres and  markets,

with  60%  of them enjoying subsidised rental.  So,  even

after  the  upgrading, all 60% of them will  continue  to

enjoy subsidised rental.  The remaining 40% are on market

rental.  By now,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



Members are already aware that we have introduced  a  20%

rebate  of rental to every stallholder.  For those  whose

rental is above the market assessed value, they can  have

a  further  20% rebate, which means up to 40%  of  rental

rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron Eusofe asked whether we can set

aside  some of these stalls for hardship cases.  Sir,  if

you look at our hawker stalls today, as far as the cooked

food  stalls are concerned, for most hawker centres, they

are  fully  taken up.  Today, we have about 1,000  vacant

stalls,  but  these are mainly in the wet markets,  where

the  demand  is not that strong.  But, I take  Mr  Othman

Haron's suggestion positively. In fact, I have asked  the

NEA  to  work  with the HDB, the Retail Promotion  Centre

(RPC), as well as the various CDCs, to see whether we can

do  something to reconfigure some of these vacant  stalls

in  the wet markets and turn them into a useful asset for

the unemployed workers to do some small business.  We are

just  starting this idea.  In fact, we are learning  from

the North East CDC Retail Incubator Programme and we hope

that  there would be something going on in the  next  few

months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various Members, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Ang Mong Seng,

Cynthia  Phua  and others, touched on the  need  for  the

Master  Plan  to  guide the future  upgrading  of  hawker

centres.   Sir,  again, I fully agree  with  the  Members

because,  as we upgrade the hawker centres,  it  is  very

important that we upgrade the centres at the right place.

There  is no point in upgrading a centre if there  is  no

market demand for that location.  Likewise, there  is  no

point  in  upgrading a hawker centre simply  because  the

piece  of  land  is  not affected by  redevelopment,  but

rather  we  should ask ourselves whether we should  start

building  new hawker centres again.  If so,  where,  when

and  why.  What NEA is doing is to relook into this whole

concept  of  long-term development of the hawker  centres

and we intend to answer all these questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important question we intend to answer, as

part  of  this overall planning, is the whole concept  of

whether the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



management of all hawker centres and cooked food  centres

should  come under one agency.  At this moment, one-third

of  the  hawker centres and cooked food centres is  under

the  NEA,  two-thirds under the HDB.  So, we are  looking

into  whether it makes sense to have one agency  to  take

care of all the centres, and discussions between NEA  and

HDB are on-going.  But, in the meantime, NEA and ENV will

proceed  with  the development of this long  term  master

plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron asked about the grading of the

cooked food stalls.  Yes, the programme started in  1997.

The  whole purpose is to enhance the cleanliness and  the

food  and personal hygiene in our cooked food centres.  I

must  say, so far, the response has been good and  we  do

see  a  general upgrading of the standard.  But the  most

important  thing, at the end of the day, 5-10 years  from

now,  is  whether  the upgraded centres  will  remain  an

attractive place for the public.  That, I think,  depends

on our 3P partnership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move quickly to the upgrading of the

public  toilets.  Again, I take the feedback from Dr  Amy

Khor in positive light.  I agree with her that the ladies

do take longer in using the toilets, and it is very often

that  at  such places we see a long queue for the ladies.

We  will  see  what  we can do.  But, as  far  as  toilet

upgrading is concerned, I want to point out that  we  are

not  upgrading  public toilets all over Singapore.   This

programme is basically focused on public toilets  at  the

coffeeshops.  And whether the coffeeshop owners will find

it  necessary to have more cubicles for the ladies versus

the  men,  I  think  we will have  to  leave  it  to  the

coffeeshop  owners to decide.  But what NEA and  ENV  are

doing is that we are sharing the cost of upgrading.   The

response  so far has been very good.  In fact,  about  50

toilets   have  been  upgraded  and  we  have   committed

$250,000.   80 more are in the course of being  upgraded.

With another 330 indicating their interest to upgrade, we

expect to see more than half of the 800 public toilets in

the coffeeshops to be upgraded by the end of this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the second part, which is

that beyond 3P ownership to achieve sustainability, there

is   something  else  we  hope  to  achieve  through  the

Singapore Green Plan 2012, which is the point brought  up

by  Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin.   Dr Teo mentioned  that  there  is

tremendous economic potential in terms of the environment

sector.  He is exactly right.  Because, at the end of the

day,  if  we  focus only on environmental sustainability,

but  without  sustaining economic  growth,  environmental

sustainability  does not really make sense.   Because  at

the end of the day we cannot just live on blue sky, fresh

air and green land.  So economic growth is something that

everyone  of  us  should play our  part  and  to  make  a

contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, ENV, as the lead agency of the

Singapore Green Plan 2012, intends to step up our efforts

in the area of industry development.  We are working very

closely  with the various economic agencies and  industry

to  speed up the development of new capabilities  in  our

environmental industry and, at the same time,  to  expand

the business capacity in the industry.  Our intention  is

to  make Singapore the early adopters in the exploitation

of   technology,  in  the  exportation  of  products  and

services.   Hopefully, this would  add  to  our  national

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Amy Khor asked what we are doing in helping

the waste recycling industry to become a regional leader.

Sir,  many  things  are happening.   Today,  due  to  the

shortage  of time, I will not go into details, except  to

say  that basically what we are trying to do is  to  help

our  environmental industry, the waste recycling industry

included,  to  cross two gates.  Firstly,  to  cross  the

technology gate, and secondly, to cross the market  gate.

The  reason  why  we  have  to help  them  to  cross  the

technology  gate  is  because the environment  sector  is

becoming  more and more technology driven.  At  the  same

time, we will help them to cross the market gate, because

the market today is expanding, not just in Singapore, not

just in South East Asia, but in the Asia Pacific.  But in

order  for  them  to cross the technology  gate  and  the

market gate, they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



must  also  be  able to bridge the gap  between  the  two

gates.   Because, today, if we look at the market,  there

is  a  time lag in the way the industry is able  to  take

full advantage of advances in technology.  So the way  to

bridge the gap between the technology and market gates is

what we call the "bridge of innovation".  And that is the

reason  why  two  years  ago, the ENV  launched  the  IES

programme.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked what is the response to the IES

programme.   I must say that the response has  been  most

encouraging.   Over the last 18 months  or  so,  we  have

received 40 applications, and 10 of them have been  at  a

cost  of  about  $2.6 million; another 12 are  now  under

evaluation   and  they  cover  a  very  wide   scope   of

activities.  And we hope that, over time, we will be able

to  continue  to  work closely with the  industry  or  3P

partners to strengthen this bridge of innovation, so that

our industry can cross the technology gate and the market

gate successfully and become a regional leader.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even though environmental sustainability is a

primary  focus of SGP 2012 and that economic growth  will

be one of the priorities of the ENV as the lead agency, I

want  to  say that we are not stopping at two, because  a

win-win  outcome  for  environmental  sustainability  and

economic growth through industry development is good  but

insufficient.   We want to go beyond that.   We  want  to

make  sure  that SGP 2012 will also contribute to  social

progress  in  Singapore.  What do we mean by  that?    We

believe that employment is the best way of sharing wealth

and  the  most  dignified  way of  sustaining  broadbased

social progress.  In that regard, I agree fully with what

Mdm Halimah mentioned two days ago in this House that  we

have to change our mindset.  And this changing of mindset

is not just for workers, but for the employers as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall Mdm Halimah mentioned in this House that

she hoped that more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



employers  would pay greater attention to job enhancement

and  job  redesign.   I think that is  a  very  important

statement that I hope everyone of us would take note  of.

Take  ENV, for example.  We are both an employer and  the

lead  agency in the SGP 2012.  As an employer, we have  a

programme whereby we allow our workers, who are more than

62   years  old,  to  continue  working  as  daily  rated

employees (DREs).  In fact, right now, more than  11%  of

our  DREs, or over 100 of them, are workers who are  more

than  62  years old.  What we do, basically, is  to  make

sure  that they remain healthy and productive.   In  that

way, they can live a life more meaningfully.  And yet, at

the  same  time,  we  believe,  as  the  lead  agency  in

Singapore for SGP 2012, that there is a lot that needs to

be done to redesign the jobs in the environmental sector,

so  that  more  Singaporeans  will  find  the  jobs  more

attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot promise Singaporeans that the

environmental sector will offer them easy jobs  and  good

pay.   But what we can promise them is that we are  doing

everything that we can to make sure that every  job  will

be  a  good job with good pay.  So, how to turn  an  easy

job,  lousy  pay, to a good job with good pay is  through

job  redesign, and that is what the ENV is doing.  Today,

we   set   up  various  skills  standard  committees   in

collaboration   with   the  industry.    Our   intention,

basically, is to redesign key jobs in the key sectors  in

the  environmental sector, so that, hopefully, over time,

as  we pursue the objective in Singapore Green Plan 2012,

we  would  not  only  be able to achieve  sustainability,

economic  growth  but, at the same time, social  progress

through employment creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end by saying briefly something that I

have gone through recently.  I am a very keen golfer and,

from  time to time, I play golf with friends and we  have

small  bets, at every hole, $1-$2.  There was one  day  I

played very well on hole No. 1.  I par that hole, and  my

flight  mates did not say anything.   One of  them  said,

"It  is all right.  MOT."  I looked at him and said, "MOT

- Ministry of Transport."  I said, "No, I am from ENV.  I

am not from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



MOT."   He  said, "No, I am referring to something  else.

It  does  not matter."  I went to hole No. 2.   I  played

well again.  This time I bogeyed and I played well again.

The  same  guy  said the same thing -  MOT.   And  I  was

wondering what he was talking about. Finally, I  came  to

hole  No. 7.  I was playing well in the first six  holes.

At every hole, he said "MOT".  When I came to hole No. 7,

I  fumbled.   I hit a triple bogey, and he  laughed.   He

said, "I told you so  -   MOT."  I said, "Please tell me,

what is MOT?"  He said, "Ah, it is a matter of time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think if we look at nation building, it is

the same thing.  When we were doing well, many people out

there  said,  "Look,  it is a matter  of  time  that  the

Singapore economy will run into problems."  When we  were

enjoying full employment, there were people out there who

said,  "Look,  the Singapore growth cannot be  sustained.

The  full employment cannot be sustained.  It is a matter

of time this will happen."  So, this has happened.  These

people out there will be smiling and saying, "I told  you

so  -  MOT."  So, what do we do?  At hole No. 7, when  my

partner  said,  "MOT", I had three  options.   The  first

option  is,  I  concede, give up the rest  of  the  game,

accept  that  I am a lousy golfer and play  triple  bogey

every hole.  Or I can try to be a good player, play safe,

do not take chances any more, go for double bogey, go for

bogey,  do not go for par, play safe so that I would  not

lose.   Or  I can try to play like Tiger Woods who  is  a

great  player, play to win, never mind the triple  bogey,

continue  to go for par, go for bogey, better  still  for

birdie, so that I can make up for that triple bogey.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say that as far as the implementation of

the  Singapore  Green  Plan 2012  is  concerned,  we  are

playing  to win.  We are not taking a defensive  approach

towards the implementation of this plan.  We are going on

the  offensive  to  make  sure that  the  environment  of

Singapore will be sustainable for the long term,  and  we

will  make  sure  that  our environmental  industry  will

become  a  regional  leader  to  contribute  to  economic

growth.   At the same time, we will make sure  that  this

industry will provide more good jobs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



with good pay, so that more Singaporeans can benefit from

the  social angle of the implementation of the  Singapore

Green Plan 2012.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, looking after the

environment is not solely the job of any one  party.   As

the  Singapore Green Plan 2012 has aptly put  it,  "close

partnership among the people, private and public  sectors

is  absolutely  crucial  to  forging  a  nation  that  is

environmentally aware and responsible."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what the Ministry can do to

support    green   community   groups.    To    encourage

environmental  partnership and  ownership  among  the  3P

sectors, the National Environment Agency (NEA) had set up

a  3P  partnership fund last year.  The fund is available

for  partnership efforts between NEA and its 3P partners.

NEA  is  committed to set aside $750,000  each  year  for

these projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our effort to forge partnership with the 3P

sector,  we are always looking for ways to get closer  to

them.  An example of our effort to get closer to them  is

the  restructuring of our NEA regional offices.   On  1st

March  this  year,  NEA  restructured  its  previous  six

Environmental Health District Offices into five  regional

offices  with boundaries that match the CDCs.  This  way,

we  can work closer with our public sector partners,  the

CDCs and the Town Councils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another effort towards building a green community

was  the  setting  up  of  the environmental  corner  for

children  at  the Woodlands Regional Library in  November

last year.  While the public sector has an important role

to play in building a green community, the private sector

has an equally important, if not more important, role  to

play.   We have several projects with the private  sector

that  I  want to mention.  One example is the responsible

care   programme  by  the  Singapore  Chemical   Industry

Council, which spells out the Council's commitment to the

public   to   continually   improve   its   environmental

operations.  Another example is a project

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



with  Bayer.   Bayer  has  a  Young  Environmental  Envoy

Programme.   Under this programme, selected students  are

sent  to Bayer's headquarters in Leverkusen, Germany,  to

learn  about  environmental  problems.   Another  private

sector  organisation I would like to mention is the  Hong

Kong  and  Shanghai Banking Corporation.  They have  been

working with students and youths on environmental  issues

for a long time under their Care for Nature Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having mentioned public and private sector

organisations  and  the  important  roles  they  play  in

building a green community, I would like now to  move  on

to  the  last, but definitely not the least, P,  ie,  the

people's sector.  People's sector organisations, be  they

NGOs   or   grassroots  organisations,   are   especially

important  in  getting heartlanders to be environmentally

friendly.   I  would  like to mention two  programmes  we

have.   One  is  the  Dengue Prevention  Volunteer  Group

Programme,  under  which grassroots organisation  members

are  trained on basic information on dengue fever and how

it  is  transmitted and how it can be  prevented.    They

check their neighbourhoods for our agencies.  An NGO that

has  offered  its volunteers to play an  active  role  in

environmental protection is the Waterways Watch  Society.

Its  members  undertake  weekly boat  patrols  along  the

Singapore  River and report any sighting of pollution  to

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another movement the NEA has started, in trying to

get heartlanders to be more environmentally friendly,  is

the  Litter Free Movement.  The Litter Free Movement  was

launched  last  year when those attending outdoor  events

were  asked  not to leave their litter behind  when  they

leave the place after the event is over.  It started with

a  pilot  project at the National Day Parade.  And  since

then,  this  Movement  has been taken  to  more  than  20

outdoor events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, in looking after the environment, we

have many parties involved.  Usually, when we think about

reaching out to environmentally active

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



committed people, we think about young people wearing  T-shirts  saying "Save the World".  In Singapore,  we  have

carried  the  message to all sectors.   Even  accountants

have  joined  the environment protection movement.   Last

week,  I  was  at  the  function of  the  Association  of

Chartered  Certified Accountants.  They were handing  out

Singapore  Environmental Reporting Awards  to  companies.

SIA  won  the  award at the function.  Today, accountants

are   auditing   more   than  300  companies   on   their

environmental performance.  All these bode well  for  the

environment  and we should continue to work  together  to

build   a   sustainable  environment  that  many  further

generations can live, work and play in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, there is a cut on

birds  and  crows,  and  they can talk  about  eagle  and

birdies!   My  cut is on global and regional cooperation.

So, I will go straight to MOT and save some time!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment, Sir, knows no boundaries. As the

Minister has said just now that there was still some haze

affecting our PSI, but my own observation is that we  had

less  last  year.   Was  it because  of  better  regional

cooperation  on  environmental  matters?   And  will  the

situation  last?   Now that Singapore has  drawn  a  very

impressive  experience in terms of urban development  and

environmental management, what are our plans to share the

experience  with  the region and the world?   Singapore's

strength  lies in the ability to deal with  the  host  of

environmental  sustainability  challenges  in  the   city

development context, be it water, waste management or air

quality.   So  the  expertise we have acquired  over  the

years would be relevant to other developing countries  in

their  efforts  to  address challenges brought  about  by

urbanisation  and  development. So, in  addressing  these

environmental   sustainability   challenges,   how   does

Singapore   see  the  process  of  sharing  with   fellow

developing  countries its own experience,  especially  in

the  field of urban environmental management?  How do  we

intend to do so and what would be our priority?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, while we share with others our experiences,

who do we learn from to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



meet our own needs?  Is it everybody, somebody, nobody or

anybody?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, you have 15 minutes left for

the whole Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Mr Zainul asked what is the

progress  in the area of regional haze.  Since  the  last

haze episode in 1997, the ASEAN nations have been working

very  closely.   In fact, last year, we decided  to  take

another  step  forward in a landmark  regional  agreement

known  as  the  ASEAN  Agreement  on  Transboundary  Haze

Pollution.  This Agreement will require six countries  to

ratify  before  it  can come into force.   So  far,  five

countries  have done so  -  Brunei, Malaysia,  Singapore,

Vietnam and Myanmar.  And we hope that at least one  more

country would ratify this agreement, so that we can bring

it into force before the end of this year.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked whether we are less affected by haze

this  year, is it because of this regional collaboration?

I  hope so, but I cannot be certain as yet.  I would  say

that the next time when we go through another El Nino,  I

will  be  able to see what happens.  If we  are  able  to

survive  the  next El Nino better than the one  in  1997,

then  I  would have the confidence to inform  the  Member

that, indeed, the regional collaboration is working.  But

until then, I would say that we do whatever we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul also asked what we can do to share our

expertise  and  experience with the  regional  countries.

Sir,  the ASEAN Environment Ministers met again late last

year  to  discuss  follow-ups  to  the  World  Summit  on

Sustainable Development.  We came to the conclusion  that

even  though  the ASEAN countries (10 member  countries),

with  very  different backgrounds and in  very  different

stages of development, there are certain areas and common

factors  that apply to all of us.  One common  factor  is

the  whole  process of urbanisation.  In fact,  the  UN's

projection for 2030, which is about 30 years from now, is

that in the Asia Pacific, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



population  in urban areas will double from 1.35  billion

in  the year 2000 to 2.6 billion by the year 2030.   This

will pose enormous burden on the city environment because

there  will  be  growing demands for  water,  energy  and

problems   with   sanitation   drainage,   solid    waste

management, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the ASEAN Environment Ministers decided

that  we  should jointly mount a regional  initiative  on

what we call "Sustainable Cities".  The idea is to create

a  platform  so that every one of us - no matter  whether

you  are  from Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia,  and  no

matter  whether  you are from a small or a  big  country,

because  small and big countries have cities too  -  come

together  to  promote sharing of ideas and  know-how,  so

that  we  can learn and work with each other.   In  fact,

this  partnership  will involve the participation  beyond

the  ASEAN cities.  In fact, our ASEAN+3 partners (Japan,

China  and Korea) have indicated their interest  to  take

part in this programme as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What NEA is doing is that we are now designated by

ASEAN  to  play a leading role in this Working  Group  on

Sustainable  Cities.   NEA  had,  in  fact,  submitted  a

concept  proposal,  and this was endorsed  by  the  ASEAN

Environment Ministers last month in Cambodia.  We are now

going into the process of implementation.  So I would say

that  this would really be a very useful platform for  us

to  share our experience with our fellow members of ASEAN

and beyond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we discuss on sustainable cities, one issue

that  often comes about is the issue of water.  In  fact,

some of these ASEAN Ministers asked us this question - as

we move towards NEWater and desalination water - would we

end  up overly dependent on energy, because all these are

very energy-intensive?  In fact, that was the point, if I

remember,  brought  up  by Mr  Iswaran  earlier.   And  I

apologise for not replying to him earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to respond to that point - yes, desalination

does   take   up  more  energy.   It  is  true,   because

desalination is more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



energy-intensive.  And precisely because of that, we have

decided to diversify our sources of supply.  That is  the

reason  why  we have four taps.  Within these four  taps,

desalination by the year 2005 will only account for  less

than  10% of our water supply system.  We are fully aware

that  we should not become overly dependent on energy  in

our water supply, and that is the reason why we are going

for NEWater, which is a lot less energy-intensive.  To be

precise,  the energy needed for NEWater is only one-fifth

that  of desalination.  Such experience in becoming  more

self-sufficient  in water supply without becoming  overly

dependent  on energy is something that we can share  with

our  fellow members as well under the sustainable  cities

programme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, it is a nuisance to attend to

bird nuisance in Singapore.  First, you must identify the

bird that is causing nuisance.  Then, you need to know at

which location is the bird causing nuisance.  If it is  a

crow, the Environment Ministry will attend to it.  If  it

is  not a crow, then it is under the jurisdiction of  the

National  Development  Ministry.   But  if  the  nuisance

happens  at a HDB common property, the town council  will

have to attend to it.  If it is along the ENV drains, ENV

will  solve  the  problem.  But if the bird  is  creating

nuisance  on  the  trees along the road divider,  LTA  is

responsible for the nuisance.  Of course, if the bird  is

causing  nuisance  in  your  house,  then  that  is  your

problem!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need a one-stop agency to resolve all the

bird  nuisance in Singapore.  May I ask the Minister what

is the Ministry doing to resolve this birdie problem?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, birds are a part of

nature  and a part of our eco-system.  We must  learn  to

live with nature and see it as a thing of beauty and  not

a  nuisance.   After  all, these things  of  nature  have

learned  to  live with us.  So, we should learn  to  live

with them.  It would be a sad day when we do not have any

more living creatures in our environment because we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>



go out to eliminate them because they are a nuisance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we should see this bird nuisance in its correct

perspective.   Is  there a threat to public  health?   If

there  is,  then I can assure the House that my  Ministry

will not hesitate to remove the threat.  And that is just

not  limited  to  birds; the same goes  for  any  animal,

mineral or vegetable.  In the case of crows, for example,

my Ministry mounted a major culling programme because the

crow  population  has grown to such overwhelming  numbers

which  make them a threat to public health.  Crows, being

large  birds, have a high capacity of carrying  pathogens

and  when there are so many of them around, they  pose  a

threat to public health.  We would not say the same about

mynahs  or  sparrows that we see around us  today.   They

pose no threat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the convenience of the public, all

feedback and enquiries about nuisance caused by birds can

be  directed to NEA, who will act as a single agency.  At

the  same  time, the public should refrain  from  feeding

birds  as  that  will  only attract them  to  return  and

congregate in large numbers at one location.   Those  who

believe  that  feeding the birds is an  act  of  kindness

should  take heart that these wild birds have the ability

to find their food themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, last year, I asked the Minister

how many crows were there in Singapore and he said it was

about  120,000,  to the astonishment of  everybody.   But

last  Sunday,  when  I  went to a hawker  centre  for  my

breakfast,  I  saw a lot of crows flying around.   So,  I

would like to ask the Minister how effective was his crow

culling campaign.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I understand that in

Chinese,  there are two types of crows.  But with  regard

to  flying crows, NEA has reduced the crow population  in

2002  through  culling  by  more  than  two-thirds.   The

estimated  population  is  now about  40,000,  down  from

120,000.  We will continue with our culling efforts.   An

expert  from  NUS has suggested that the crow  population

should  be  brought down to 10,000.  We will continue  to

consult  the experts and our culling effort to bring  the

crow population down to a manageable number.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many public places, eg, East Coast Park, are now

relatively  crow-free.   Crow nuisance  areas  have  also

dropped.  In Ang Mo Kio, they have dropped by about  80%,

from about 1,000 areas to 200 areas.  East Coast Park has

dropped  from  about 200 areas to 10  areas.   Complaints

have  also  dropped.  In 2000, there was  an  average  of

about 340 complaints per month.  Now, this has dropped to

about  200  complaints a month.  So we  are  winning  our

battle against crows.

Amendment No. (1), Dr Wang Kai Yuen.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of

the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC Report calls for greater

entrepreneurial  spirit  in our society.   The  Committee

realises that if Singapore were to scale greater  heights

in  future,  the future working population must  be  more

entrepreneurial  than the past generations.   Mr  Raymond

Lim,  Minister  of  State in charge of  entrepreneurship,

recognises  that  schools  are  the  cradles  of   future

entrepreneurs.  He also mentioned that some  schools  are

already  actively encouraging students to operate  stalls

in an attempt to promote this spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while running stalls teaches the basics of

business, I see entrepreneurship as being more than that.

To  me, being entrepreneurial means the ability to create

opportunities  when  none existed.   It  also  means  the

foresight to seize opportunities when these are  not  yet

recognised  by others.  Besides, we require the  tenacity

of  a bulldog to bring that opportunity to fruition.   To

try to turn out entrepreneurs by the busloads through our

schools will be unrealistic.  Nonetheless, I think it  is

important  that  we try to inculcate the habit  of  being

entrepreneurial  in  our young people.   Hopefully,  they

will become more creative and innovative when they become

adults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another desirable outcome, Sir, will be the

appreciation of the difficulties of striking out on one's

own.  If more of our people share this appreciation, then

we   will   be   more  likely  to  look   at   successful

entrepreneurs not with envy but with admiration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a big step has already been taken by MOE to

promote creativity through the JC curriculum reform aimed

at  inculcating  thinking skills  versus  rote  learning.

This  was  debated extensively in this House in  November

last  year.   The  new curriculum will be  introduced  in

2006.   As  this  is the most significant change  in  our

education policy in recent years, I suggest that we allow

these changes to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



work  their  way through the system before  embarking  on

more radical changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, MOE has implicitly adopted

the  strategy of introducing creativity in our  education

system  by  allowing  the effect  of  the  JC  curriculum

changes  to percolate itself through the system from  JCs

to  secondary schools to primary schools.   To  me,  Sir,

this is a passive approach and would take much longer.  I

would   urge  a  more  proactive  approach  to  introduce

creative  thinking in our schools.  I  suggest  that  MOE

carry out a review of the PSLE curriculum as well as  the

"O"  level curriculum concurrently with the JC curriculum

with  a  view to introducing thinking skills as early  as

possible.   At the primary level, one way is to  increase

the  attention  pupils received by the  teachers  through

reducing class size, a subject which I will come back  to

in my next cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should lay a strong foundation for creative

learning  as  early as possible so that the vision  of  a

more entrepreneurial Singapore could be realised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have a total of 365 minutes for

this amendment.  Mdm Halimah.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, we have a robust

education  system which is responsive to  changing  needs

and  continuously strive to prepare our students both for

the  labour  market  and  in their  role  as  responsible

citizens  in  our society.  There are, of  course,  areas

where we are concerned about when we hope that sufficient

resources  will  continue to be allocated  and  attention

continues to be focused.  This is the impression that our

education   system  is  elitist  and  the  concern   over

streaming  and  its impact on our children's  self-esteem

and self-confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the principles involved. Different

children  have  different  abilities,  and  the  existing

system  is meant to reduce wastage which was much greater

in the past.  Many of us have visited the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



ITE and are impressed with the changes there compared  to

the  old  VITB.  Examples like this will help to  enhance

people's  confidence in our school system and generate  a

better understanding of streaming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to the point which was

mentioned by Dr Wang Kai Yuen.  I support his views and I

also  want to say that the review that is done should  be

continued with regard to primary education as well.   And

I  also note, recently, that the Ministry has conducted a

review of pre-school education.  To me, such a review  of

primary education is not only timely but also logical, as

pre-school  education  is very  much  linked  to  primary

education and one of its aims must be to prepare children

for primary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us have also argued in this House that

there  is a need to better align primary school education

with the revised curriculum in the upper secondary school

with   its  new  focus  on  developing  better  thinking,

communication and other process skills.  If  the  primary

school  review is in the pipeline, I would like  to  make

two  specific suggestions which I hope can  be  taken  on

board  when  the Ministry makes its review.   Firstly,  I

would   like  to  request  that  the  Ministry   consider

introducing  a single session for primary schools.   This

has  already  been  done for secondary  schools  and  the

benefits  are  obvious.  Teachers and students  are  less

harried,  compared  to  a situation  where  students  and

teachers from both sessions have to hastily make way  for

each other.  With only one session, students and teachers

could  also  spend more time interacting with each  other

outside  school  hours  and can use  the  classrooms  and

facilities   for  enrichment  programmes  or   additional

classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to support Dr Wang Kai Yuen

that the Ministry should consider reducing the class size

for  primary  schools.  This is a matter which  has  been

raised  many  times before but which had not gained  much

support.   But  I  am aware that, in the review  of  pre-school  education,  one  suggestion  is  to  reduce   the

student/teacher ratio.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



This seems to indicate that the Ministry acknowledges the

importance  of smaller class sizes in enhancing  teaching

effectiveness  and delivery.  I am also reminded  of  the

benefits  of  a  small class size.  If you  look  at  the

gifted programme, the class sizes are smaller, which is a

further  testimony of the benefits of small class  sizes.

With this small class size, more students will benefit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mdm Halimah.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir,

Singapore has an excellent reputation for being a  centre

of  excellence  for education.  As Singapore  strives  to

grow  the education sector as an economic driver, we have

relaxed  our  education  policy to  enable  more  foreign

students  to  study  in Singapore.  By  allowing  foreign

students to study in Singapore, we will be able to tap on

a   larger  talent  pool.   However,  liberalisation   of

policies can also cause unintended problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the major issues that have arisen as a result

of  the relaxed entry of foreign students are as follows.

Firstly,  we  have  the  issue of  accompanying  mothers.

Certain students are allowed to have mothers accompanying

them  when  they  study in Singapore.   There  have  been

reports  that  these  mothers  have  deviated  from   the

intended  role to look after their children and care  for

them  while they study in Singapore.  Instead, many  have

taken  up  jobs  in health clubs, massage parlours,  etc.

Some  have also used the excuse of sending their children

here  for  study  to come to Singapore  when  their  real

intention was actually to find a job in Singapore.   This

may result in social problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have the issue of ensuring standards in

education.   There  have been Chinese students  who  have

studied  in private educational institutions in Singapore

and  when  they  went back to China, they  claimed  that,

despite  spending their time studying in Singapore,  they

have not learned to speak proper English and did not have

a good programme.  This

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



can  damage  our  reputation as a centre  of  educational

excellence.   However, I have had very positive  feedback

from   Chinese  students  who  have  studied  in   public

educational  institutions in  Singapore.   Many  of  them

speak fluent English and have won many prizes.  They  not

only    perform   well   academically,   but   are   also

entrepreneurial.  I had the chance to see business  plans

written  by  students from Shanghai, Dalian and  Qingdao.

And  I  was very impressed by their business plans  which

were written in impeccable English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we grow our educational services as an

economic  driver,  we  must  ensure  that  standards  are

maintained  and  our  reputation is  preserved.   We  can

perhaps   learn  from  one  of  the  public   educational

institutions  in  Singapore which  has  won  respect  and

praise  from students in Singapore.  In China,  they  say

that there are three universities in Singapore - NUS, NTU

and   Ngee   Ann  University.   What  they  are  actually

referring to is Ngee Ann Polytechnic.  The students  tell

me that Ngee Ann Polytechnic has established an extremely

good  reputation  as a tertiary educational  institution.

NAP  sets  very stringent entry requirements and students

have  to  sit for an entrance examination and  those  who

succeed  in  the entrance examination have to undergo  an

individual  interview  with  the  panel  from  Ngee   Ann

Polytechnic,  lasting  about 15  to  20  minutes.   As  a

result, only the very best get into Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

Students  are also known to have given up places  in  top

universities   in  China  for  a  place   in   Ngee   Ann

Polytechnic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to ask the Minister is whether the

Ministry   would  review  this  attempt  to  expand   the

educational sector by putting in place, perhaps,  a  more

stringent  standard, entrance examination,  or  streaming

test,  so  that we protect our reputation.  What measures

will  the Government take to try to balance the  need  to

grow  the  educational sector as an economic driver  and,

yet,  ensure that Singapore's reputation as a  centre  of

excellence will not be tarnished?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like

to touch on a few topics today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



First  of  all, is on class sizes which two Members  have

brought up.  While the availability of teachers may be  a

short-term issue, can we at least try to experiment  with

small  class sizes by applying a hybrid system?   We  can

have  average  class  sizes for some subjects,  and  then

break  up  some for bigger classes and some  for  smaller

classes.   We  can  do  all  of  this  within  the   same

curriculum  time.  With this approach, we will  not  need

many more teachers because these things will average out.

I  advocate small class sizes for slower children so that

they  will have a better chance of catching up with their

peers  as  they get closer attention.  And  we  can  have

bigger  class sizes than normal for faster children.   It

will  not be much loss for them because they do not  need

much attention anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I support the issue of single session

primary  schools.   I suggest that we start  with  a  few

pilot  schools and, if it is successful, we can implement

a  roadmap  for  expansion to all schools.   With  single

session schools, we will have the opportunity to  have  a

much  more  flexible curriculum and to spend  extra  time

with students who need more attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is on streaming. While I do

not fully agree with the streaming system, especially the

way  it  is  being implemented, I will not challenge  the

system this year because I know that I will get the  same

answer.   I would like to, instead, focus on what success

we  have had with the system.  If we really mean  and  do

what  we  advocate  in the system of  streaming  children

according to their learning abilities, then we should see

results  of  the  focused effort to let  slower  children

catch up with their peers.  I therefore would like to ask

the  Minister to share with the House the results of  the

system and, in particular, the following statistics.  How

many EM3 students are transferred to EM2 at the Primary 6

level?   How  many EM3 students finally  get  a  tertiary

qualification?  How many EM3 students make it to the  'O'

levels?   How  many Normal (Technical) students  make  it

back to the Express Stream?  And

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>



how  many Normal (Technical) students make it to tertiary

education?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I also support the drive for

entrepreneurship and the suggestions made by some of  the

Members.  In addition to what has been suggested, I would

like  to suggest that we have entrepreneurship as  a  CCA

activity   in   secondary  schools.   Can   we   set   up

entrepreneurship  clubs,  like we  have  debating  clubs,

gardening  clubs,  and so on?  The  NYAA  is  willing  to

spearhead this project but we need MOE to agree that this

will be a recognised CCA activity.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Education in Singapore is

undoubtedly  one of the cornerstones from which  we  have

built our economy and great strides have indeed been made

in  educating  our young.  The budget for  Education  has

consistently  remained  the  second  highest   Government

spending.   Last  year,  the system  saw  major  proposed

reforms  for  the  upper secondary/JC education  and  the

university sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes to be made to the upper

secondary/JC   education  to  inject   greater   breadth,

flexibility and diversity into the curriculum has largely

been welcomed by Singaporeans.  The proposed expansion of

the   university  sector  to  allow  among  others   more

Singaporeans to study at the local universities has  also

been  viewed  positively.   A new  pre-school  programme,

developed by MOE with expert help, which teaches students

to  play  activities, discovery and experiment  has  also

been launched.  Amidst all these changes, there seems  to

be  a missing link as the Ministry has been silent on any

impending changes to be made to primary school education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my parliamentary colleagues before me, I

would also like to ask the Minister if the Ministry  will

be  looking into revamping the primary school, as well as

the  lower  secondary education, so as to make  them  fit

into  pre-school  as well as the upper secondary  and  JC

education.  As I noted in the debate on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>



the   upper  secondary/JC  education  review,   the   new

education  roadmap  on greater breadth,  flexibility  and

diversity should also be made available to those  in  the

lower  secondary and primary schools so that all will  be

charting  a common course.  Many parents continue  to  be

anguished  at  the mere thought that their children  will

practically lose their childhood and the joy of childhood

once  they  enter  what  is generally  perceived  as  the

pressure-cooker Singapore education system  from  Primary

1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the lines of the new pre-school programme,

should  not the primary school teaching methods  be  also

changed to give more weight to learning through activity,

discovery  and  experiment  and  less  weight   on   rote

learning?   The  MOE  should also review  the  curriculum

content and workload of primary school students to see if

the  content  can be further trimmed without  sacrificing

quality  and  standard.   Again,  like  my  parliamentary

colleagues  before  me, I would  also  like  to  ask  the

Ministry  to  look  into the feasibility  of  introducing

single  session primary schools because I have noted  how

my  children have benefited when their school turned from

a two session school to a single session school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes made to the pre-school, JC and

university  curriculum  to  allow  for  more  broad-based

education  and  nurturing thinking  skills  are,  indeed,

first  steps  in  the right direction.   However,  change

should also be made equally upstream.  Hence, I urge  MOE

not  to  delay in looking at the equally needed  reforms,

especially for those in primary schools.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I sat last

year on the ERC Sub-committee on Enhancing Human Capital.

The  Workgroup  on Arts, Culture, Sports  and  Recreation

noted  that,  while our school system has  done  well  in

science,  technology and mathematics, there is an  urgent

need  to  pay  equal  attention to literature,  arts  and

sports  education.   Further,  school  teachers  need  to

understand  the  purpose of literature, arts  and  sports

education, less to help talented

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>



students  to  become artists or sportsmen,  but  more  to

build   character   and   skills  to   understand   human

relationship  and  appreciate aesthetics,  to  nurture  a

receptive mindset for both the arts and sports and to  be

creative  individually.  Thus, our literature,  arts  and

sports  education policy should be such that  every  one,

not  only  the talented few, is given the opportunity  to

experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose therefore that,

notwithstanding the plans, when the Arts School  and  the

Sports  School  are targeted at nurturing and  developing

those  youngsters with the talent to make it to the  apex

of  these  disciplines, we should place literature,  arts

and  sports  as an essential part of school education  in

general.   I expect that the Minister will say  that  our

children  do  currently have arts  and  sports  in  their

curriculum   and   give   us  examples   of   even   some

neighbourhood schools which have showcased  band,  drama,

sports, or other arts programmes and enumerate the number

of teachers in each school trained in physical education.

But what I am talking about is the uniform delivery of  a

quality curriculum in these two areas across all schools,

and  the  development  and  appreciation  for  aesthetics

through the learning of the arts and the love for sports,

rather  than  an aversion that develops as  a  result  of

being required to participate in some less than inspiring

physical  activity  programme, developing  the  love  for

sports,  to  build  character, team  spirit  and  healthy

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have referred in passing to the subject of

the Sports School, I cannot but make the observation here

as  well  that the announcement that the school will  not

accept  Normal Stream students is sadly at odds with  all

that   we  have  been,  in  recent  times,  saying  about

professing to value and to want to nurture diversity  and

to  value  youngsters with different skills and  talents.

This   inability  to  get  beyond,  first  and  foremost,

academic   abilities  above  all,  will  cost   us   many

youngsters  with  different talents to fall  through  the

cracks in our selection processes and criteria.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>



<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I wish to say something

about a subject which I am quite certain the Minister may

bristle  at.  Streaming has been the bane of many parents

and  students.   It  keeps popping  up  at  parliamentary

sittings in one guise or another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I come to my main point, I wish to state

categorically   that  I  support  the  principle   behind

streaming.  The principle is that different students  are

gifted  in  different ways.  A programme that  matches  a

student to his or her aptitude will extract the best from

him,  compared  to  one that treats all  students  alike.

There  is a risk that an egalitarian approach could  dump

down  instead  of  level up, as some  schools  in  Europe

tinged with socialist ideals have found.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like the stigma that attaches to streaming.

But  I  support  the notion that, on the whole,  students

should  gain from it, however Orwellian this may be.   My

problem is not that there should not be any streaming  at

all.  Instead, I think we need to have more streaming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the streaming we are familiar with has a

bias   towards   the  upper  10-20  percentile   of   the

population.    Indeed,   the   whole   issue   of   upper

secondary/JC  education  that  this  House  debated  last

November  seems  to  give heavy  emphasis  to  those  who

actually need less help, ie, the gifted and those in  the

through-train system and the elite private schools.   Our

scarce  manpower  resources make it imperative  that  the

precious  little we have be optimised so that,  from  the

mixture, the cream will rise to become the future leaders

of the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about the bottom 10-20 percentile? This

group  is  a far more needy group that would, of  course,

demand  proportionately more resources to help  than  the

average  student  group.   I  speak  especially  of   the

Learning   Support   Programme,   which   is   an   early

intervention programme designed to identify and help  the

weaker  students  in  Primary  1  and  2.   Perhaps,  the

resource issue is the key

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



reason  why the LSC programme does not continue into  the

middle and upper primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to look into how special

programmes can be designed to help them.  In doing so,  I

am  supporting  the notion of streaming.  However,  I  am

arguing not that it has gone too far but that it has  not

gone  far  enough to make a difference to those who  need

the most help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports School recently drew flak from parents

because  of  the  principal's insistence that  applicants

must  be  at  least in EM2 to qualify.  This  is  another

instance  of inadequate streaming.  Streaming should  not

be confined to academic outcomes, but also recognise that

talent  has many, many forms.  Few are the ones  who  are

gifted in multiple areas.  Since streaming is already  so

entrenched  in  Singapore, why not go the whole  hog  and

permit   the   Sports   School  or  similar   specialised

institutions  to admit students talented  in  sports  but

less gifted academically, but be more flexible about such

criteria?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, unlike Dr Amy Khor, I

think  we  should scrap the current streaming system  and

replace  it  with a subject-based system to maximise  the

potential of each student.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at last year's Budget debate, I asked the

Ministry  to  consider exploring the idea  of  organising

schools  based  on  subject,  by  replacing  the  current

streaming system, based on a cluster of subjects, to  one

based  on  individual subjects.  Students would  then  be

grouped  into different classes based on the marriage  of

the   individual  subjects.   This  would  allow  further

customisation   of  learning,  and  further   allow   the

development of individual student's potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note from news reports that ACS (Barker Road) has

introduced  the  concept of theme  classrooms  which  are

subject-focused.  Although this is only a  pilot  project

of  grouping  classes according to the subject,  I  think

this  is a positive first step forward.  Theme classrooms

could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>



perhaps  one day become a leading model for our  national

school  system.   I  believe  that  besides  the  benefit

mentioned  above,  this  system would  also  be  able  to

significantly reduce the social stigma of  streaming.   I

would  like  to  ask  the Minister  whether  he  has  any

intention  to expand this pilot project to include  other

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue, Sir, which is associated with the

streaming   system,  is  the  decision  of   the   newly-established Singapore Sports School to admit only Express

stream students.  I cannot understand the rationalisation

why  selection  should  be based on academic  performance

and,  in particular, only the Express stream.  Does  this

not  defeat the purpose of setting up a Sports School  in

the first place?  I request the Minister to clarify.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, on the subject

of  holistic education, the thought that comes to my mind

is  that  if  we  were to ask the school  principals  and

teachers  today  how many of them have  spoken  to  their

students about the impending war in 24 hours in  Iraq,  I

am  not  so  sure  many school students  will  have  some

foretaste of the story developing and shaping up  in  the

Middle East.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we spoke so much about the Economic Review

Committee  report.  A lot of effort has been put  in.   I

wonder  how many principals and teachers are equipped  to

discuss  the important subject that will affect  them  in

the  next 15 years, because the Economic Review Committee

report is framed for the next 15 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as we are already very strong in our education

system, I think the future really lies in how do we  make

it  stronger and better.  It is no longer the science  of

education but rather the art of it.  I share Dr  Jennifer

Lee's  point with regard to how much more rounded we  can

make  our students to be in not only in the sciences  but

also in the arts and the humanities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the global economy is with us today, we are

seeing  ourselves  getting involved  with  cross-cultural

contacts and issues.  I am not very sure that the way  in

which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



the  students are placed, the subjects that  they  learn,

and  the  inter-personal relationships that they  develop

with  one  another, prepares them for this cross-cultural

environment  that our young would have to face.   I  know

that  these  are more likely to be activity-based  rather

than  classroom subjects but, in preparing for the future

of  education, we cannot help that activities  become  as

important  as  classroom teaching.  So, I wonder  whether

the  Ministry  of Education can think about  how  we  can

prepare our students for the future in the cross-cultural

environment and the world in which they are going to work

and live in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we are seeing is that some of the

supposedly  successful people are getting  into  trouble,

and that has got to do with values and ethics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Loh Meng See, you have to start

winding up your speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I just want to stress that

value  education is very important, and I hope  that  the

Ministry will strengthen this area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

the Ministry's mission statement and the desired outcomes

demand that a holistic education system be adopted so  as

to bring out the best in our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is about creating opportunities for

the  young  to  acquire knowledge, both science  and  the

arts,  and knowledge about life and its skills.  It  must

therefore follow that the Ministry must provide  as  best

as  it can a balanced education and create a vibrant  and

enquiring  mind  in  the child.  As  he  grows,  he  must

specialise,  but only at the tertiary level and  not  too

early  in  life.  There must be variety in the  education

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Ministry tell us what are the indicators

used  to measure the value of a good education?  We  seem

to  score  well in mathematics and science subjects  with

our  top  students, but not in English or other subjects.

How much of what our children learn in schools serve them

later

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



in life?  Where are our inventors and risk-takers?  Would

the Ministry also allow private primary schools?  If not,

why  not?  This option will bring in creativity,  variety

and choice for our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system must adopt a holistic approach

and   let   the  child  mature  with  a  thinking   mind,

independent  enough but not too individualistic,  without

care for the community.  The system must be flexible  and

not be rigid.  There cannot be creativity, if there is so

much conformity in schools.  The child must be happy with

what  he  is learning, and there should not be  an  over-emphasis on anything that will create unbearable tensions

in  his learning process.  The nation must not treat  him

as  an  economic digit.  Education must pave the way  for

him  to  dream and be practical at the same time.   There

must  not  be  set ways, and there must be an  open  mind

about  the  values of education.  What has  the  Ministry

done to ensure this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being a multi-racial and multi-religious

society,  there must be fairness in the education  system

for  one  and  all.   There  must  not  be  any  form  of

discrimination,  real  or  perceived,  based   on   race,

religion or sex.  The Constitution of Singapore enshrines

these matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that SAP schools might favour the

Chinese  students.  Should there not be  similar  schools

for Malays and Indians, etc?  If SAP schools are good for

the  Chinese, why not for the others?  Why is it good for

the  Chinese?   Do  SAP schools create  in  the  students

studying  there  to be isolated from  other  races?   SAP

schools  may  not  foster racial  integration.    Is  the

Ministry looking into this matter and what is the  follow

up  on  this?   What are the benefits and advantages,  as

compared to the disadvantages of having the SAP schools?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, would the Ministry also look into the whole

issue  of second language?  There should be less emphasis

on  second  language as a compulsory subject to  progress

from O-levels to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>

A-levels   and   to  universities.   Many   families,   I

understand ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You are running out of time, Mr

Chandra Mohan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> --- have migrated because

of the second language rules in schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the topic is on the new JC

and  upper secondary school curriculum, and the issue  is

on  uniformity  and  education, and  the  inculcation  of

creativity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did not have the chance to speak during the

debate  on  the  White  Paper on the  new  JC  and  upper

secondary  curriculum.   I  fully  support  the  intended

outcome of the new system.  I believe we have always  had

this tension between producing responsible, obedient  and

disciplined  citizens on one side, and  on  developing  a

thinking and reflexive workforce on the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, therefore, at all levels of the education

system,  differentiate between education practices,  such

as  uniforms,  discipline, rituals, ECA and  others,  and

education content, such as curriculum, project  work  and

subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid mass production at content-related

education,  it  is  an  excellent  idea  to  create  some

unstructuredness within the structure of  the  curriculum

and  the  syllabus.   The flexible  nature  of  selecting

subjects at the Pre-U level, which has been suggested, is

an excellent way to develop the entrepreneurship drive in

Singapore.  What are the Minister's thoughts about moving

all  of  this  unstructuredness to the  secondary  school

level  as  well as to the primary school level,  as  some

Members have suggested?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister elaborate on how bright students

from neighbourhood schools will be able to take advantage

of  the  through-train  system of  skipping  the  O-level

examinations?   Will they be easily allowed  to  transfer

into schools with the new system?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is on the setting up of private

schools  in  Singapore.  Can we be flexible  in  allowing

Singaporean  children  to go into  international  schools

already  in  Singapore?  Given the restrictions  that  we

have  placed  in the new system, it is unlikely  that  we

will  see  new private schools being set up.   We  should

have  the confidence that our children will still be able

to imbibe local values despite going to such schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on private universities, we already have many

local  institutions that offer distance learning or  open

learning  programmes, and we should give them recognition

to  recognise them as full universities, not just for the

benefit  of  Singaporeans, but also students from  around

the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the issue of twinning of SAP schools and

neighbourhood schools - it is an issue that I should have

brought up earlier - can I ask the Minister what  is  the

progress on this suggestion to address the issues that Mr

Chandra Mohan has just brought up?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, primary education will

always be tugging at the heartstrings of our parents,  as

we  see  our young adjusting themselves to the discipline

and rigours expected of them in schools.  For those of us

whose  children adjust easily, it is a big  relief.   For

those  whose  children do not, it is a  source  of  great

anxiety and stress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one way to address this concern is to

look  at  the  ways and means to ease the  adaptation  of

children   to  primary  education.   The  attention   the

children  receive  in  class is important  and,  to  have

better attention, one possibility is to reduce the  class

size.   I  have reviewed the studies on class sizes  done

overseas  in  the US and Japan, and must confess  that  I

could  not  find  any  conclusive evidence  showing  that

smaller   class  size  would  necessarily   mean   better

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that it is more important to have

better   teachers  than  to  have  smaller  class   size,

everything being equal.  But, of course, we must bear  in

mind

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>



that, in Singapore, our class size is already larger than

those  of the developed countries which I have mentioned.

However,  I think the one-size-fits-all class size  might

not  be  the best option when it comes to Primary  1  and

Primary  2 classes.  We should realise that in  our  pre-school, childcare and kindergarten classes, including PCF

kindergartens, the class sizes are already  smaller  than

the standard size of 40.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably, Sir, this is in recognition of the fact

that  younger  children need better and  closer  personal

attention so that, when the children join Primary 1, they

will  endure  a quantum decrease in teachers'  attention.

Some adjust well and some do not.  Thus, for children  in

P1  and  P2,  I  believe that our children  will  benefit

significantly  from  greater personal  attention  in  the

class than they are today if they could have fewer pupils

in  a  class.   Rather  than calling an  across-the-board

reduction  in  class size, I would urge the  Minister  to

consider reducing the number of pupils in P1 and P2 only,

so   that  the  teachers  could  better  maintain   class

discipline,  while paying significant  attention  to  the

pupils  and,  at  the same time, meet the ever-increasing

demand of higher expectation.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think in some of the developed countries,

teacher  aides  are used to support the teachers  in  the

classrooms. We do not have to go that far but, I  believe

a smaller class size in the early years will work wonders

for our children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran is not here. Mr Gan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, some

of  my  parliamentary colleagues have  suggested  that  a

review be done on the primary school education system.  I

agree  and would suggest that this review should be  done

this  year  and it should cover a broad scope,  including

the following areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the curriculum. It would be timely for us

to revalidate the primary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



school  curriculum,  in  view of the  changing  education

landscape  in Singapore.  It may also be good for  us  to

take  this  opportunity to re-look  at  the  non-academic

subjects   such  as  national  education  and   character

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on single session schools. The main

constraint to implementing single session schools is  the

lack  of  physical  capacity and  the  lack  of  teaching

resources.   However,  the  benefit  of  single   session

schools is quite convincing from the arguments from  many

of   my  parliamentary  colleagues.   I  would  therefore

suggest that we could look at implementing single session

schools  for  the upper primary school levels.   I  would

like  to urge the Ministry to consider introducing  these

sessions  in primary five or primary six and in  selected

schools  as  a  pilot  project.  If  this  proves  to  be

successful and beneficial, we can then extend it to  more

schools and later, to lower primary classes as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, teacher training. We must ensure both the

quality and quantity of teachers, especially if we are to

move towards single session schools.  In this respect,  I

am  glad  that  the NIE provides ample opportunities  for

continuous  education and training for  our  teachers  to

upgrade  and update themselves.  Perhaps, more  could  be

done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, teacher workload. We must also pay some

attention to the workload of our teachers.  There must be

a   balance   between  both  teaching  and   non-teaching

workloads.  If too much non-teaching workload is  imposed

on  the  teachers,  the quality of  their  teaching  will

invariably suffer. The losers in the end will be our  own

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of the primary school system is important

and  I  hope that the Minister will consider carrying  it

out.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> In these first 35 minutes of the

debate  on  the Education budget, four Members before  me

have asked for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>



single  session primary schools.  I would like to add  my

voice to theirs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of single session schools have been

enumerated  in  this House by other Members  in  previous

Budget  debates  as  well.  And  to  quote  the  Minister

himself, they include the greater flexibility in the  use

of curriculum time and resources for the schools, a wider

range  of  enrichment programmes to cater to students  of

different  abilities  and family backgrounds  in  a  more

vibrant school culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the educational imperatives and benefits of

a  single  session  system, it will, in  addition,  allow

schools to push their starting time a little later,  from

the  current 7.00 am or so to, say, 8.30 am, so that  our

poor  children and their mums, who have to get them ready

for  school,  do  not have to get up at unearthly  hours,

which  they  do  currently, to be on  time.  Furthermore,

single  session  schools will be a boon  to  parents  who

currently  have to juggle getting their children  to  and

from  school  and supervising them after they  get  home.

This  is  particularly significant for families who  have

two, three or more children.  We wish there were more  of

these  families.  Somehow, it seems there  is  a  special

variance  of  the equivalent of Murphy's law for  schools

which determines that if you have two children, they will

invariably  always be in different sessions, morning  and

afternoon,  every year, throughout their  primary  school

days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister responded last to a question on

this  subject  in the debate of 2001, he  said  that  MOE

would  consider  whether to have single  session  primary

schools  when PRIME was closer to completion.  PRIME  was

launched  in  1999 and anticipated at that time  to  take

seven  years  to complete.  I believe that the  programme

must have been accelerated, as by the 2001 Budget debate,

which  was  just  two years later, the Minister  reported

that  46%  of schools had already undergone redevelopment

under PRIME.  It is now another two years since 2001,  so

I  am  sure  that  PRIME  would almost  certainly  be  at

completion or very close to now.  Therefore,  may  I  ask

the Minister to please

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>



reconsider  the implementation of single session  primary

schools  as  it  will be of significant  benefit  to  all

parties - the schools, teachers, parents and family life.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

thank you for allowing me to speak on this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I wish to focus on another group of students,

the  weaker students, the Normal (Academic) students  and

the Normal (Technical) students in secondary school.  Two

out  of  five  students today from an  annual  cohort  of

40,000 students end up in the Normal classes.  And out of

this,  each  year, 10,000 Normal (Academic) students  sit

for the Normal (Academic) examinations that take place in

October.  From  that cohort, about 80% or 7,500-8,000  of

them  go  on  to sit for the Secondary Five  Express  'O'

level examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from this group, I am told that a much

smaller proportion of them do go on to 'A' levels  or  to

polytechnics, the main reason being that they cannot cope

with   the  rigours  of  the  Secondary  Five  'O'  level

examination primarily because they have to cope with more

subjects in some cases.  Because they do five subjects at

Normal  (Academic) and now they want to do more subjects.

The  other reason is they have to bridge the content  gap

and be ready for the 'O' level examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the Ministry if it is possible to review

the curriculum for the Normal (Academic) stream students,

starting from Secondary Three to Secondary Five.  If  80%

of our students go on to sit for the 'O' levels, perhaps,

the end point should be the 'O' levels and not the Normal

(Academic)  examinations at Secondary  Four.   Therefore,

the  cramming of content, as well as revising  and  doing

test  questions, etc, in a space of nine months is a  bit

short  of  a  miracle  when they  are  Normal  (Academic)

students,  because the Secondary Three and Four  students

do it in April when they have finished their revision and

they are ready for their 'O' level examinations.  I think

we are putting an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>



undue demand in a way on our Normal (Academic) students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of students that I would like to

refer  to  are  the Normal (Technical) students.   In  my

opinion,  I feel that some of them, in spite of the  very

good LSP programme in the primary school, may have fallen

through  the  gap  and may have ended up  in  the  Normal

(Technical) stream without really good skills in  reading

and numeracy.  Is it possible perhaps for us to focus our

attention at Secondary One just to get them on board with

numeracy   and  literacy  skills  so  that  they   become

independent learners with the content as time goes on?  I

have  looked  at  the  Normal  (Technical)  content   for

Secondary  One and I still think it is a little  bit  too

heavy on content.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I also appeal to the Ministry to

persuade its principals to refrain from discussing school

'O'  level results both on speech days and annual reports

as these are results done by our Secondary Four (Express)

students.   These are results brought in by our Secondary

Five  (Express) students?  After all, the  students  have

sat for the same examinations, same rigour, and this kind

of  stigmatisation  runs counter to the  mission  of  the

school.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the

word "excellence" is synonymous with Singaporean culture.

It  exists in spirit, if not in form, in almost  all  our

institutions' vision and mission statement.  Our  schools

are  no exception. We strive for excellence in everything

we  do,  to  the  point that a newspaper report  recently

noted  that some schools have excelled so much  in  their

examination  results  that  there  is  little  room   for

improvement. We may have to create a grade Excellence* on

top of the A* for them to improve further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus not surprising that the other side of the

coin  for  excellence is stress. Sir, much has been  said

about the stress levels in our schools. We have heard the

Ministry's  response.  It is manageable as  our  students

are  indeed  excelling, and only  a  handful  are  having

difficulty managing the stress. The other thing is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



that it is the parents who are stressing out the children

with their unrealistic expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coping with stress requires a certain skills set and

resilience.  The extreme failure to cope with  stress  is

for  one  to  go  into  depression and  to  some,  become

suicidal.    Sir,   psychiatrists   and   other   helping

professionals have highlighted that stress  is  a  silent

killer.  In 2001, about 14,000 children were reported  to

have  seen psychiatrists for help.  About 2,000  or  more

are  new  cases. Studies have also shown  that  5-25%  of

children  have  some mental health issues.   If  we  take

about 10% of them, you will have 90,000 students who  may

need help, but only 14,000 are receiving help so far. Are

they  suffering in silence?  What is the Ministry's plans

to  ascertain the status of mental health of our children

to be able to detect them early?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the school system, students are not the only

ones  who  are stressed out. Many have heard how teachers

are  also stressed out.  One can argue that stress exists

in  any  profession  and so why should  teachers  be  the

exception?   I  heard  in a recent conference  on  mental

health  that  noted  that teachers are  the  most  highly

stressed group among the list of professionals.   Several

articles  in the New Paper dated 2nd March also  provided

some  case  examples of how teachers are  suffering  from

depression as a result of work-related stress.  We do not

know  the estimated number at this point in time,  but  I

think  it  is more critical for us to understand  whether

seeking  help  will  adversely affect  their  performance

appraisals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue of coping with stress is a complex

one  and, therefore, we need to ask ourselves how  do  we

actually  view  help-seeking behaviour.  Is  help-seeking

behaviour seen as a failure to cope or seen as  a  coping

mechanism?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we pride ourselves as having one of the best

education  systems and institutions in  the  world.   Our

students

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



excel  in  international competitions.  We  make  a  mark

despite our size.  As we celebrate this glory, let us  be

mindful of the silent killer that may be cancerous in our

institutions  and systems. Sir, STRESS, is  a  six-letter

word that can mean Students and Teachers, in Reaching for

Excellence,  may  be Suffering in Silence.   I  urge  the

Ministry to conduct regular "stress mammograms and scans"

to  ensure  that cases are detected early.  Like  cancer,

early  detection leads to the best chances of cure.   Our

children  have  a  whole lifetime  ahead  of  them.   The

teachers  are  responsible in caring and nurturing  their

students. Let us also begin to care for the caregivers.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, public education on educational reforms. With all

the  recent  changes  made to the  education  system  and

curriculum for pre-school, secondary, pre-university  and

university  levels, parents and the public are  generally

not  well  informed and clear about them.  Some of  these

changes  were  discussed  in  this  House  and  some,  my

parliamentary  colleagues and  I  had  the  privilege  of

visiting and seeing when the Minister kindly arranged for

these  visits, for instance, to ITE and NIE.  But,  as  I

said,  we  are the privileged lot.  What is the  Ministry

doing  in helping parents and the public understand these

changes  in  simple and clear language, and  how  is  the

public education to be carried out?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, it is

commendable that MOE states on its website, and I  quote,

"That  the  education system is flexible  and  caters  to

every  child's abilities, interests and aptitudes, so  as

to  help each to develop to his fullest potential."  Just

as  the industry moves from low value-add mass production

to   high  value-add  mass  customisation,  so  must  our

education   system  evolve  to  a  more   student-centred

approach to meet individual needs and talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, school principals have been

entrusted and empowered with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



task  of developing their school culture.  Unfortunately,

many  still use the same national benchmarks of  academic

and other rankings as measurements of their success.   As

such,   resources  are  channelled  to  raising  academic

grades, altering schedules and focusing narrowly on areas

which the school does well, for example, a very narrowly-focused  CCA.   As Dr Jennifer Lee and others  have  also

observed, some schools have too limited a range  of  CCAs

and  subjects and have designed limited capacity in  non-core  areas.   I  see  two problems in this  development.

One,  that schools become too narrowly-focused and  hence

cannot provide sufficient experience and exposure for the

growing child.  And, two, students who are interested  in

a  particular field of sports or arts not offered by  the

school  will  be  deprived of the opportunity  to  pursue

their  passion and this may have the long-term effect  of

moulding him or her into a dull Jane or John.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to survive in a rapidly changing world, other

than  the 3Rs, we need to help our young cultivate  their

interest, which can translate into a passion for life,  a

passion for success.  No matter how many As a person  can

score,  the  battle  is  lost if he  loses  his  survival

instinct.  Sir, it is passion, not rules, that can ensure

a  future  workforce that will deliver  their  work  with

quality  and  pride, equipped to deal with the  world  of

tomorrow.  I understand that resources are limited and we

cannot  cater  to every single child.  But,  as  we  move

towards mass customisation, I hope the emphasis would  be

on  cultivating  the  child, rather than  on  the  school

culture alone.  Perhaps the Minister can comment  on  the

Ministry's  stand on this, whether there is a  monitoring

system to ensure that schools are committed to provide at

least  a  more  generous basic tier of popular  CCAs  and

academic  subjects  to widen the experience  and  mix  of

talents within the school.  I concede that while this may

not  be  a problem for primary schools, this is a problem

for secondary schools upwards, as choice of and entry  to

schools  are  constrained  by  both  grades  and   travel

distance.  Three, the creative industry has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



been identified as a growth engine.  What steps would the

Ministry be taking to identify, encourage and nurture the

development of each child's latent talent?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, I would like to focus on

financial   literacy,  or  rather   the   lack   of   it.

Insufficient  emphasis  on  life-skills  like   financial

management  can wreak havoc in both the individual's  and

the  State's  finances.   It is  clear  from  debates  on

financial  literacy and credit that the majority  of  our

population  who  has  gone through a  vigorous  education

system,  is  not  equipped to handle basic  and  personal

financial management.  Sir, we have to ask our population

to  be  more  self-reliant but part of the responsibility

lies  with us equipping them with the necessary financial

skills.   Perhaps  the  Ministry can  consider  including

basic life-skills, particularly financial management,  as

part of the curriculum options.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I remind Members to keep your

speeches short, please?  Dr Tan Boon Wan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, during recent

meetings  with parents, many continued to voice  concerns

with  the  heavy  school bags that their  primary  school

children have to struggle with to school.  They are aware

that  the  Ministry has been reviewing the curricula  and

the  syllabi  of  the  various subjects  at  the  various

levels.   I  would,  therefore,  appreciate  it  if   the

Minister could give the House a progress report  of  this

effort  at all levels and, in particular, at the  primary

level.  Can the Ministry also look at other ways that can

reduce  the  amount  of  materials  that  primary  school

children have to carry in their heavy school bags?

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, at the recent visit

to  the  National Institute of Education, I saw something

that has increased my confidence in our education system.

A  lady  teacher, with decades of service and one  and  a

half  years  to go before retirement, was learning  about

cells and DNA, right along with colleagues who would have

been  her  daughter's age.  They were  learning  to  make

simple but effective and realistic models of cells

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>



and  doing  hands-on  experience on DNA  isolation,  gene

identification  and  gene  amplification.   Others   were

learning  about using computer graphics to teach students

concepts   about   molecular  chemistry  and   biological

compounds.   In short, our education system  is  teaching

our  students  how  to  make their living  in  tomorrow's

world,  by  first  empowering their existing  and  future

school teachers.  This is wonderful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe we should not put all our bets on

the  life sciences.  The life sciences are important, but

should  not overshadow the exposure of students to  other

scientific  disciplines.   The  petroleum  and   plastics

industry  is  based  on the once new  and  once  existing

chemistry   of  carbon  compounds.   The  computer   chip

industry is based on the physics of silicon and the semi-conducting  element.   Yesterday's frontiers  of  science

often will become the bases of today's industry, just  to

be put into consumer products built by factory operators.

And  DNA  experiments might one day be as quaint  as  our

memories  of  logarithm  tables  and  slide  rules.   The

education system, in my view, should not teach scientific

techniques  as  ends in themselves, but to  use  them  to

inspire  students to enter areas of the future,  such  as

nano-machines, nano-tubes, gena-rays, perfume and flavour

chemistry, industrial enzymes, drug design and industrial

design.   We should be able to prototype and produce  and

test everything from furniture to ships in Singapore.  We

will  also  need  the legal, financial, IT  and  services

sectors, while not being scientists themselves, are  able

to  understand  people in these fields and service  these

companies.    Exposure,   understanding   and   versatile

enquiring minds, familiar with the technology of tomorrow

-  this  is  what our children will need.  I am confident

that MOE will continue to rise to the challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head K (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have decided not to speak

on this topic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Not speaking. Dr Amy Khor is not

here.  Mr Ang Mong Seng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in every budget

debate,  there  are always some Members speaking  on  the

importance   of   the   Chinese  language.    Among   our

population, there are about 30-40% of our people who  use

only Chinese as their medium of communication.  When  the

Government  wants to implement or explain a  new  policy,

and  if  the Chinese language is not used in the process,

these people will not be able to understand this policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to give two examples to

illustrate the importance of the Chinese language in  our

society:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the NEWater Centre. Recently, the Prime

Minister  officiated  at  the  opening  ceremony  of  the

NEWater Centre.  The purpose of the NEWater Centre is  to

explain  to  the  people how NEWater is  generated.  But,

unfortunately, all the explanations in the Centre are  in

English only. So, those who do not know English will  not

understand how NEWater is generated even though they have

visited the Centre.  I encourage my grassroots leaders to

visit  the  NEWater Centre.  My grassroots leaders  went,

but later told me

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



that  it  was a waste of time as all the explanations  in

the Centre were in English, and they did not understand a

thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Total Defence Exhibition. The Chinese

newspapers carried a report about an exhibit at the Civil

Defence  stall.   The caption of the picture  was:  "Take

Cover  in the Open", in English only.  An old couple  who

could not read English looked up the meaning of the words

and  found  that   "take"  means "bring",  "cover"  means

"lid".  So, "bring the lid inside to open".  It makes  no

sense  at all.  Actually, the meaning is that in case  of

emergency you must take cover in the open and not hide in

a building or some shelter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are implementing or explaining a policy using

English  only,  some 60% of our people  will  understand.

But  if  we use Chinese as well, then maybe about 80%  of

our  people  will  understand.  If we want  everybody  to

understand,  then  you should use all the  four  official

languages.   In this respect, I hope that the  Government

would look into the matter seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Ministries may say that they do not have

people  who  are  good  in Chinese,  Malay  or  Tamil  to

translate  the  explanatory notes of the exhibits.  Maybe

the   Ministry  of  Education  can  engage  some  retired

Chinese,  Malay and Tamil teachers to do the  translation

work.  I am sure they can do it well.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I wish to

provide some feedback on the teaching of Chinese language

in  our schools.  Over the years, I have observed  a  few

things that happened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, many bright students, especially those from

English  speaking homes, have shown little or no interest

in the Chinese language.  Some of them may have done well

in  examinations and scored an 'A'.  But these  were  the

results of learning the subject mechanically.  In  actual

fact, they are not well versed in the language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also those who do not do well in the

subject and find learning the language a chore, if not  a

struggle.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



However,  they do much better in other subjects.   Do  we

know why?  Is it the home environment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prominent Singaporean businessman recently told me

his  experience.  His is a totally English speaking home.

Two  of his children struggled miserably in their Chinese

language in primary school.  After primary 6, the  father

decided  to give them a different environment.   One  was

sent  to  the UK and the other to the American School  in

Singapore.   He  told me that after a  year  in  the  new

environment, his children are not only scoring top marks,

but   also  showing  great  enthusiasm  in  the   Chinese

language.   Granted, the standards may be lower, but  the

psyche is now totally reversed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question is: why can our schools not make the

learning  of  Chinese language more  enjoyable?   Let  me

offer  one important reason.  Unlike English, the Chinese

language has, what we call ci (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) which is formed by

one,  two  or  more Chinese characters.  Each  ci  has  a

different  meaning  and there may be thousands  of  them,

because  of  the  combination of one or more  characters.

Even  among  a set of ci that shares one same  character,

each will have a different meaning and nuance.  Take, for

example, the ci in cheng gong (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), the related ci

are cheng jiu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), cheng shu ( ),

cheng wei (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), cheng zhang ( ), cheng fen

(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), etc. So, although students may be taught

the  ci  - cheng gong, they would not automatically  know

the meanings of all the other related ci.  Unfortunately,

there  is  no standard list of ci that students  will  be

taught  in  school and be tested on.  Some ci are  taught

and  some  are  not.   Different teachers  will  teach  a

different number of ci.  But in the examinations, ci that

has  not been taught can appear.  So, to prepare for  the

examinations and not to be caught offguard, students will

attempt  to  learn  all  related ci  by  referring  to  a

vocabulary handbook.  Believe you me, the amount of  time

and effort they need to learn the meanings of all related

ci  listed in the handbook on their own or with the  help

of  parents or tutor is just too much for them.  It is  a

struggle.   It  is, in fact, impossible  within  a  short

time.  So,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



when  students are tested on ci that they have  not  come

across, they will not have a clue on how to answer.   And

when they do not do well after spending so much time  and

effort,  they  become discouraged and,  eventually,  lose

interest in the language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would look into what I said

and  do  something to improve the teaching of the Chinese

language.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, my speech is a bit long.

Please bear with it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sorry. You have your time

limit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

bilingual  policy is the pillar of our education  policy.

However,  frankly  speaking,  this  bilingual  policy  in

Singapore  is a tilted one that gives too much prominence

to the English language and relegates mother tongue to  a

secondary position.  It is bilingualism not in  its  true

sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that I object to the learning of a

foreign  language or English, as it helps to broaden  our

horizon and create new opportunities.  However, there  is

one  question that keeps bothering me.  The question  is:

why  subject the same policy on the mother tongue to  the

various  ethnic groups when the standard of  our  Chinese

language is so low that we even have to resort to the use

of  the  English language to aid in the teaching  of  the

Chinese language today?  I have raised this issue of  the

low  standard  of  Chinese language in  the  last  Budget

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, as far as the Chinese language and even

the  preservation  and  inheritance  of  our  traditional

culture  are  concerned,  we are  at  a  crossroad.   The

prospect  of the Chinese language as well as  our  future

social landscape depends on the path that we are going to

take,   particularly  the  holistic   policy   that   the

Government is adopting.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my observation, the younger generation, who was

brought up under the bilingual system, has no problem  in

speaking Mandarin in general.  But because of their  lack

of  vocabulary, they need to mix with some English  terms

in  their  conversation in Mandarin.  They may  also  not

have  a  problem in listening generally,  but  only  find

themselves  in  an awkward position if  the  other  party

speaks  too  fast or uses too abstruse vocabularies.   In

reading,  they  do not have the habit of reading  Chinese

publications, some even detest doing so. When it comes to

writing, most of them have great difficulty in expressing

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the trend that more and more families are

communicating in English, our young people may lose their

ability  in  expressing themselves in Chinese within  the

next generation.  What kind of society will we have then?

I  think there is no necessity for me to portray  such  a

landscape to our leaders, who are full of imagination and

creativity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is: does the Government agree that

these  issues  that I have raised are  indeed  issues  to

them?   Should  we leave the issue to its natural  course

and  allow this deteriorating trend of lowering  standard

to  continue,  leading to the extinction of  the  Chinese

language and its culture, or should we not make an effort

in  reversing the trend, even when it is too late  to  do

so?  Let us wait and see.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that even if we do not emphasise the

role  of  mother  tongue in transmitting our  traditional

culture, its social, political and economic functions can

never  be  ignored.   Therefore, we  should  abandon  the

current principle of linguistic policy, which is based on

economic efficiency consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should correct the wrong attitude of

regarding English as the first language and mother tongue

as  the  second  language.  First of all, the  Government

should stop addressing English as the first language  and

mother tongue as the second language; instead, the mother

tongue should be addressed as Chinese, Malay or Tamil  as

it is.  This should help

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



to establish these languages as a mainstream language and

correct the mentality that they are of lower status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother tongue can never be reduced to a window

dressing  in  form in our "bilingual" educational  model.

If  we study Chinese just because we want to ride on  the

wave  of  the  thriving Chinese economy, and discard  the

complex  relationship between language  and  culture,  it

will  only  lead  to a situation where  the  language  is

emphasised in its utility and resisted in many minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementation, we have to create a conducive

environment  for  the learning of the  Chinese  language.

For the learning of language to be efficient, one has  to

use  the  language often.  Regretfully, there is  a  huge

deviation  in  our present environment.  By reducing  the

teaching of mother tongue to just a single subject in the

curriculum, it not only puts the learning of Chinese in a

disadvantaged position, it also belittles the  status  of

the mother tongue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, pre-school education is an important

link  in  establishing the correct attitude  towards  our

mother  tongue  among our children.  We should  start  to

inculcate in our children the sense of importance of  the

mother tongue and strengthen the emotional link from very

young. The Ministry of Education should pay attention  to

this while reviewing our pre-school education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that it is not easy to master two

languages.   However, if we recognise that  the  role  of

mother  tongue  is of fundamental importance  to  us,  we

should  stand by this recognition and undertake  decisive

and   bold   policy  measures  to  create   a   conducive

environment in our school and society for the learning of

the  mother tongue.  Only if this is done, can we  expect

our  future generation to be truly bilingual in using the

Chinese  language  effectively and preserve  the  Chinese

culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, your time is up. Dr Wang Kai

Yuen.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, recently, MOE arranged for

MPs  to  visit  NIE.   There, we got to  see  the  modern

facilities and met some of the trainee teachers  as  well

as  in-service teachers.  I must congratulate NIE for the

excellent programme it has put together for the  training

of  new teachers as well as the continual development  of

in-service  teachers.  I understand that NIE  is  already

developing  a  reputation for excellence amongst  teacher

training institutions worldwide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the NIE, I saw some very innovative tools for

teaching developed by the teachers themselves.   It  will

be  good  if  we could consistently identify  these  best

practices of our teachers as well as the effective  tools

and  aids  developed by the teachers.  These  are  indeed

intellectual properties of our teaching profession.  Just

like  the way we teach mathematics that has been  adopted

by  several other countries, we might want to disseminate

these  methodologies among teachers to  benefit  all  our

school children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to touch on is on the

recognition for teachers.  We all know that teachers play

important  roles in education.  They are the  pillars  of

our  system.  During the term of the last Parliament, MOE

had  revised teachers' salaries to bring the  pay  up  to

market, thereby addressing a major issue for the teaching

profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken steps to recognise teachers'

contribution  through  various  award  schemes.    I   am

particularly  impressed by the many outstanding  teachers

that  I  have the privilege of meeting in my capacity  as

Chairman  of the Selection Committee for the Presidential

Awards  for Teachers.  However, I feel that the  national

recognition  given  to these awardees  could  be  further

enhanced.   In this respect, perhaps we could learn  from

the   Miss  Universe  pageant  where  the  reigning  Miss

Universe  has  a  whole year programme planned  for  her,

cutting ribbons, guest of honour, talking to young ladies

and  so  on.   I  would suggest that MOE  work  with  the

People's  Association so that these  PAT  awardees  could

participate in various grassroots

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



activities  year  round, such as the Edusave  scholarship

and   bursary   presentation  to  better  profile   these

outstanding  teachers.   This way,  the  respect  of  our

population  for  the  sacrifice and contribution  of  the

teachers  could be a source of inspiration  for  aspiring

teachers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to speak in

support  of  teachers.  Recently, I read with  concern  a

newspaper report about teachers reporting sick for stress

related  illnesses.  Over the years, we have  added  many

responsibilities for teachers without taking away some of

the  old duties and, therefore, teachers have to do  more

and more given the limited time that they have.  What can

we  do  to  make  teaching  more effective  through  more

motivated teachers?  If stress is, in fact, affecting the

teachers,   it   will  affect  the   ability   to   teach

effectively.   One suggestion I can make is  to  separate

the   two  responsibilities  of  teaching  and  that   of

administration.  If the teachers can get more support  in

the  area of administration, then I believe they will  do

much better and will be more effective in their role as a

teacher, and not spending too much time in administrative

duties.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

today, I would like to speak on a topic which we are very

familiar  with, that is, the cultivation of  the  Chinese

practitioners in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, Prime Minister Goh mentioned at the

National  Day  Rally  that we should  have  some  Chinese

elites  among  us.  I would like to ask the Minister  for

Education whether his Ministry has any strategy, plan  or

target  for  the  cultivation  of  Chinese  teachers  and

Chinese practitioners, and whether or not it has attained

the set target.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, in order to cultivate these Chinese

practitioners,  we  have  already  introduced   the   SAP

schools.   But  students in the SAP schools are  normally

good in the other subjects too.  The number of SAP school

students  eventually end up as Chinese  practitioners  is

very small.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



Yet,  we  do need a pool of people who are very  good  in

Chinese  to  serve  in the fields of education,  culture,

journalism,  translation  and  business.   The   economic

reform  and opening up of China and its accession to  WTO

have  now  made the economic value of Chinese  very  much

enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not intentionally forced and encouraged our

students to read Higher Chinese. But, we should allow the

parents of those students who are good in Chinese but who

managed  only  a minimum pass in English  the  choice  to

decide  whether  they would like their children  to  read

Higher Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, students in the neighbourhood schools who

qualify  and  wish to read Higher Chinese  will  have  to

travel  to  another school which offers  the  subject  to

attend  classes. This is very inconvenient  and  students

tend to fade away after some time as it costs more money,

time  and  energy,  and  a lot of efforts  to  stick  on.

Perhaps,  the Ministry of Education could look  into  the

possibility  of  allowing more schools, particularly  the

neighbourhood schools, to offer Higher Chinese, if  there

is demand for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the scholarship plan, I understand the

Ministry of Education has been very successful in sending

some  students  to Taiwan and Beijing to  study  Chinese.

Are  these  students  enough to cater  to  our  need  for

Chinese   teachers?   Some  enterprises  in  the  private

sector,  such as the Singapore Press Holdings,  are  also

offering  scholarships to students to  study  Chinese  in

China.   Can  some  form of incentive be  given  to  more

private   enterprises  to  offer  more  scholarships   or

bursaries for students of the Chinese language?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learning of Chinese does not necessarily mean

that  you  will end up being a Chinese teacher.   It  can

also be extended to cover the arts, music and other forms

of  visual arts, so that the learning of Chinese  is  not

confined to the language alone, but could include Chinese

culture, history, arts and philosophy, etc.  I understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



that  the LaSalle School has been very successful in  its

branch in China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to balance the ratio between the foreign

Chinese   teachers   and  the  local  Chinese   teachers.

Sometimes, when we are shorthanded, we may have to engage

teachers  from  outside  Singapore.   They  may  not   be

familiar  with  the  situation  in  Singapore.  Are  they

competent  in  the sacred duty of imparting  the  correct

values  to our younger generation of Singaporeans?  I  am

not   against  the  idea  of  employing  foreign  Chinese

teachers,  but  there  should be a  balance  between  the

foreign teachers and the local teachers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, MPs were recently

invited  to  visit  the  NIE.  I  was  impressed  by  the

teaching  facilities and resources available.  There  was

even  a  jukebox used as CD loan dispenser.  I  was  told

that  that was the only one in Singapore.  Together  with

this  state  of  the art infrastucture and  resource  for

training  teachers, teacher salary scale  has  also  been

increased   to   attract   new  recruits.    Nonetheless,

anecdotal evidence still suggests that many teachers  are

leaving  the profession, citing heavy workload  and  long

hours as major push factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the last one or two years, there has

been an increase in the number of applicants who join the

teaching profession.  This is likely to be due in part to

the  economic downturn.  I would like to ask the Minister

what  percentage of teachers have left the profession  in

the  last few years.  What are the main reasons for their

resignation?   How  does the workload  of  our  teachers,

including time spent after school on CCA, etc, compare to

international standards?  With the many changes  made  to

the  education system over the years and, in  particular,

the   recent  revamp  of  the  upper  secondary  and   JC

education,  how  would  present and  future  teachers  be

prepared  to  facilitate  and  promote  independent   and

creative learning since many would have been schooled  in

the era where emphasis was on knowledge acquisition?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers themselves must be motivated and passionate

learners  in order to instill in our young a passion  for

learning,  and  not be mere recipients of  knowledge.   I

would  like to suggest that perhaps Singaporean  teachers

who  have  won  awards  for being  progressive  in  their

teaching  and well-known foreign educators and our  local

entrepreneurs  could be invited to share their  expertise

and  help  our teachers adopt new assessment and teaching

methods.    Teachers  could  also  be  sent  on  overseas

attachment  to well-known schools in countries,  such  as

the  US and Sweden, to experience first hand how students

are taught in these schools.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, the structure of our

education  system depends a great deal  on  the  quality,

dedication and commitment of our teachers.  They are  the

life-blood  of  the  system  and  will  make  a  critical

difference  to  the  quality of  education  that  schools

provide to our children.  Not many of us can remember our

school  buildings or our school classrooms.   But  almost

all  of  us  can remember the teachers whom we  hate  and

those  whom we like.  The teachers who have inspired  us,

given  us a nudge, a pat on the back, or simply held  our

hands  during  our bleakest moments when we were  growing

up, have made a difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as teachers are our most important resource, I

would  like to find out what initiatives are in place  to

upgrade  our teachers and to take care of their  welfare.

Specifically,  Sir, I would like to ask the  Ministry  of

Education the following questions.  Firstly, I would like

to  know how we are preparing our teachers for all  these

changes  that are sweeping through our education  system,

beginning with the revamp of the upper secondary  and  JC

curriculum.   Are they given sufficient time  to  acquire

the new skills and knowledge to effect the changes?  What

continuing  education  programmes  are  there   for   our

teachers?  Are there mechanisms where they can seek  help

if they have difficulties in coping or where they can get

professional counselling?  Are there periodic reviews  to

ensure that they are able to cope with their workload?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I would like to touch on is

about teachers' nodule.  In case, you are wondering  what

this means, these are not modules.  They are not teaching

modules.   But teachers' nodule actually affects teachers

and it is a form of illness which affects the vocal chord

because it is over strained or over used.  I notice  that

this  problem of teachers' nodule is affecting  more  and

more teachers.  I have no statistics, or figures, on this

except  for those teachers that I came across,  and  this

has   given  me  the  impression  that  the  problem   is

increasing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent case which I had come across was a young

teacher  who is my resident and who, soon after  starting

her  teaching  career, has suffered  from  the  teachers'

nodule  problem  and  has  to leave  the  service.   What

puzzles me is why do we still have this problem in  these

days and age where there are so many devices available to

project the human voice without teachers having to  shout

across  the class.  So the question is whether there  are

microphones  provided for teachers in  the  class.   What

steps  have  been  taken  to  educate  teachers  on   the

importance  of not straining their voice and  maintaining

their  health?  What assistance is provided to those  who

develop the teacher nodule problem?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in a recent

visit  to NIE, I noted that, amongst the information  and

materials shared by MOE, was the ASK model, which  stands

for   Attitude,  Skills  and  Knowledge.    My   personal

experience with this model dates all the way back to 1990

when  I  was  involved in the Service  Bureau  of  Changi

International  Airport  Services  and  the  training   of

service  providers.   I can lay claim  that  the  service

excellence  in  Changi  Airport  is  attributed  to  this

powerful model where service providers are trained on the

need  to  internalise the three important  components  in

order  to do an excellent service job.  There is no doubt

that such a model has helped Changi Airport to clinch its

number one position as the best airport by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



business travellers in the last 13 years, or so.  Such  a

powerful  model should similarly be embraced by  schools,

and  students should be taught to internalise the  model.

This  model  is powerful because it provides  a  holistic

education of the individual.  Yet, we do not seem to know

much  about this model that is currently adopted  by  the

school.  Talking to school educationists subsequently,  I

was told that the model is just a framework and there  is

not  really  a dedicated effort to use it as a foundation

where  the  three  components  of  attitude,  skills  and

knowledge are given equal emphasis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two issues with regard to

the  holistic education of our students.  MOE has done  a

very  good job in imbuing our students with knowledge  of

subject  talks.  But two such areas where they  could  do

better   are  in  equipping  students  with  skills   and

inculcating  values  by  nurturing  their  attitude   and

behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is generally known that knowledge can be

taught,  skills can be acquired, but attitude has  to  be

nurtured.  Whilst we cannot equip learners with attitude,

we  can, however, create the awareness in learners of the

importance of values which translate into one's  attitude

and behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOE has the right formula to model our future

leadership.   SM's recent address at NTU  has  led  to  a

barrage  of  views about the Singapore  youths.   Labels,

such  as apathy towards politics and examination and  CCA

leave  no  time  for current affairs began springing  up.

The  fact  that  SM  was faced with a  relatively  silent

majority  had  raised concern about  this  generation  of

youngsters, whom we know will, one day, have  to  make  a

choice  and  assume  the leadership to govern  Singapore.

Did they keep silent because they were not interested, or

were  they  overwhelmed and awed by  a  great  statesman?

Their behaviour could be a result of both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I understand, a programme, such as the

teaching of values in the attitude component of  the  ASK

model, is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>



taught  through  infusing this element  in  the  teaching

subjects.   My  question is: is it enough and  effective?

If it is value that makes us amend, then why is value not

taught  as  a  core curriculum subject to  emphasise  its

importance, if not for anything else?  We know  that,  in

nurturing   a  student,  a  tripartite  relationship   of

parents,  schools and children (PSC) is crucial  as  both

parents  and schools would act as reinforcing  agents  in

nurturing  the children.  I am inclined to  propose  that

the schools ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time is running out, Mdm Ho.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> --- may want to share the essence

and  philosophy  of such a model with parents  so  as  to

emphasise to parents that knowledge alone is not  enough.

In   the  home,  attitude  and  skills  have  got  to  be

emphasised  as well.  In view of the need  to  nurture  a

holistic individual, would MOE consider incorporating the

ASK  model, and therefore the programmes premised on  the

ASK  model,  such as inculcation of values  and  speaking

skills, as a compulsory enrichment programme if the model

cannot  be  subsumed under the curriculum of  the  school

syllabus?

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, our

education system has attained a very high standard.   But

still  many are of the view that our education system  is

still  too  structured.  It becomes, what  is  called,  a

paper   chase  learning,  where  what  is  important   is

achieving high grades.  There is nothing wrong with that.

But  I  think  more  than that needs  to  be  done.   And

students are depending on rote learning and model answers

to questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic environment is rapidly changing

and  the  employability of our future workers depends  on

the  adaptability  of the individual job  seekers.   This

demands  agility,  creativity,  innovation  and  an  open

mindset  to  continuous learning and multi-tasking.   How

well  is our education system preparing our students  for

such an environment?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, it is also crucial that our training strategy

for  the  workers  be  modified to meet  this  increasing

demand.   We  could  improvise  the  curriculum  of   our

vocational institutions that could help to bring out  the

creativity  and potential of the workers who attend  such

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would appreciate it if the Minister could

enlighten on the following.  Is the Ministry relooking at

the school curriculum at all levels to encourage students

to  be  more  creative, rather than conforming  to  model

answers?   Are schools given the flexibility to introduce

creative  learning at a pace that suits  their  students'

intellect?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, first of all, I would like to thank Members who have

spoken  so  far for their comments and suggestions  which

span  remarkably wide areas.  I am also happy  to  see  a

good  number of principals and teachers in the  House  to

hear  directly from the Members the views that have  been

expressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past week, there has been extensive

debate  in  the  House  on  the  recommendations  of  the

Economic  Review  Committee which Dr  Wang  referred  to.

Education has been cited as one of the factors central to

the remaking of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry agrees with this. Indeed, in the recent

few   years,  we  have  been  making  major  changes   to

reposition  our education system to do just that  -  help

our  young meet the challenges of a more competitive  and

uncertain  future. A future which is not  just  based  on

creating  value through high skills and high productivity

and  reaping the rewards through high wages, but one that

creates   value   through  high   creativity   and   high

innovation, and reaps the rewards for risk taking through

profits and profit sharing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have started from a strong base. Today, our

education  system is well recognised for the high  levels

of  achievement  of  our  students  and  the  quality  of

education that they receive.  Our students

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



do  well by most international comparisons.  We have made

much  progress over the years, but we also  do  recognise

that  further  improvements can be made to  provide  even

more  opportunities for our students  to  maximise  their

potential and make the most of their abilities - students

with  flexible and inquiring minds, who have the  ability

to  develop and articulate their ideas, who can thrive on

uncertainty and risk.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education's budget for the coming

financial  year  is  smaller than the  FY  2002  approved

budget  by  3.7%.  However, the Minister for Finance  has

continued   to  recognise  the  critical  importance   of

investments in education by allocating the second largest

budget  to the Ministry of Education, amounting  to  $6.5

billion,   or   22%  of  the  total  Government   Budget,

equivalent to 4% of the GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Ministry of Education will continue to

move  the  education system forward and provide the  best

education  possible for our students, by  optimising  the

use of these resources placed in our charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the initiatives introduced in the last two

years,  which  we will continue to pursue,  are  the  new

framework for kindergarten education, more flexibility in

the Normal Stream in our Secondary schools - some Members

have  spoken  about  that already - and  the  changes  to

Junior  College  and  Upper Secondary  Education  debated

extensively  and  strongly supported  by  this  House  in

November last year.  In the post-secondary sector, we are

pushing   ahead  with  the  fifth  Polytechnic,  Republic

Polytechnic, building our first regional ITE campus,  and

have  carried  out a review that provides a  roadmap  for

developing the university sector in the coming years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is now time to turn our attention to the

primary schools.  Dr Wang, Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr Khor, Dr

Jennifer Lee, Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mr Gan Kim

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



Yong  spoke  on  the  need to improve primary  education.

During  the debate on Junior College and Upper  Secondary

education in this House last November, I indicated  that,

after  putting in place these changes, we would  look  at

primary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary education in Singapore today provides a

strong  foundation  in literacy and numeracy.   The  main

focus in the academic curriculum, especially in the lower

primary,  is  on English, Mother Tongue and  Mathematics.

There is a good reason for this.  These are key enablers.

English  and  Mathematics are the foundation  for  future

learning  in  the humanities and sciences,  while  Mother

Tongue provides us with a link to our roots, culture  and

values.  By international standards, our students do very

well  in  English, even though English is  not  the  home

language  for  the  majority of our  students.   And  for

Mathematics,  our  students are among  the  best  in  the

world.  While practically every other country in Asia  is

now struggling to develop a language education policy  to

meet  the  challenges  of  globalisation,  our  bilingual

education  model of English and Mother Tongue confers  on

our  students the key advantage of global literacy  while

anchoring them in their local roots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped around this core of subjects, our primary

schools   do   provide  a  holistic   and   well-balanced

programme,   which   includes   sports,   arts,   values,

citizenship education and life skills, that develops  our

students  morally,  intellectually, physically,  socially

and  aesthetically,  to achieve the desired  outcomes  of

primary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary education sector offers different

programmes  to  suit the abilities and aptitudes  of  our

students.   At  the  lower primary  level,  we  have  the

Learning Support Programme (LSP) to help those pupils who

are  weak  in  English to strengthen their foundation  in

English.  At upper primary, there is the Gifted Education

Programme;  students can take also the mother  tongue  at

higher level in the EM1 stream; and students who find the

standard  subject curriculum too demanding,  can  take  a

basic curriculum which is better suited for them in EM3.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has asked about introducing creativity

throughout  our  education system.   A  number  of  other

Members,  including Mr Nithiah Nandan, have  also  spoken

about  that.   In  the last five years,  we  have  indeed

introduced  creativity, as well as information technology

and  national education, and reduced curriculum  content,

in  order  to  provide  more time  and  opportunities  to

develop thinking and problem solving skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to review and make improvements to

our  primary school curriculum, as necessary.  But  I  do

not propose to change the structure of the programme,  as

it is basically sound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have carefully studied the resources

that  we can make available in the medium term, and  have

decided  that  we  can put more resources  into  selected

areas,  which will have a significant impact on improving

the delivery of the primary school programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming years, we will strengthen the

foundation  we  provide for our students in  the  primary

schools  through two initiatives: firstly,  putting  more

teacher  resources into the lower primary, ie, Primary  1

and  Primary  2;  and, secondly, enabling  Primary  3  to

Primary   6   pupils   to  study  in   a   single-session

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical resource in the education system

is our teachers - more specifically, the quantity as well

as  the quality of our teachers.  Allow me to share  with

Members  of  this House the challenge that we  have  been

facing.   In  the last few years, primary school  student

numbers   were  peaking,  and  the  teaching  force   was

experiencing  a  large  outflow, as  many  of  our  older

teachers began to reach retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I call the attention of Members to Chart 1

(Cols.  1641-1642),  which  I  requested  the  Clerk   of

Parliament to distribute?  Chart 1 shows that from  1995,

when  the  large  1988 dragon birth-year  cohort  entered

Primary



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030319/20030319-HA-0761641.pdf"">Chart 1: Primary School Intake and Enrolment (1994-2006)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



1,  primary  school  enrolments have been  rising.   They

reached a peak and stabilised in the last few years at  a

level  roughly 20% higher than prior to 1995.  That meant

that we needed 20% more teachers as well over this period

to maintain our teacher/student ratio in the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we were facing a big challenge,

because  we  were  looking at a much  larger  outflow  of

experienced teachers, as they reached retirement age.  If

Members  could  look  at Charts 2 (Cols.  1643-4)  and  3

(Cols.  1645-6), in Chart 2, the dotted blue  line  shows

the  profile of our teaching force in the primary schools

in  1996, with a very large group of teachers aged 45-55.

In  fact,  they  accounted for something  like  half  our

teachers.   In  1996, one third, or some  3,600,  of  our

primary school teachers were aged 50 and above and due to

retire within 10 years.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030319/20030319-HA-0761643.pdf"">Chart 2: Age Profile of Trained Education Officers in Primary Schools in 1996 & 2002</a><br>



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030319/20030319-HA-0761643.pdf"">Chart 3: Retirement Numbers and Stock of Trained Education Officers in Primary Schools</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, primary school student numbers have

passed  their  peak, and retirements  of  primary  school

teachers  have  crested.  We have also introduced  EduPac

(Education  Service Professional Development  and  Career

Plan),  which has made teaching a more attractive career,

by  offering  clearly articulated career paths  and  more

competitive    salaries   which   reward   loyalty    and

performance.  We are therefore reasonably confident  that

we  will have enough good teachers, which we will  deploy

to  enable schools to reduce class sizes at Primary 1 and

Primary  2, from 40 to 30 students per class.  This  will

be  implemented  starting with the Primary  1  cohort  in

2005.   Smaller Primary 1 and Primary 2 class sizes  will

require considerable resources.  We will require 700 more

teachers than we would otherwise need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sound reasons to focus precious teacher

resources to reduce class sizes at Primary 1 and  Primary

2.   Given the finite teacher resources available, if  we

spread  them across all levels from Primary 1 to  Primary

6, we would be able

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



to  reduce  class sizes to about 37 per class,  which  is

unlikely to make a significant difference to the delivery

of the programme in our primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, focusing on Primary 1 and Primary

2  would allow us to use these resources where they  will

have  the  most effect and make a significant difference.

Firstly,  Primary 1 and Primary 2 classes  are  of  mixed

ability, and teachers therefore have to cater to  a  wide

range of pupil needs in each class.  Secondly, Primary  1

and  Primary  2  are  the foundational  years  of  formal

schooling, where more individualised attention  can  help

ground  pupils  strongly  in literacy  and  numeracy  for

access   to   more   complex  topics  in   later   years.

Furthermore, it will help to ease the transition from pre-school, where class size is usually less than 30.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We deliberated on this measure very carefully, and

arrived  at  a  decision  only  after  long  and  serious

consideration.   We have to be sure that we  can  sustain

this  increased requirement of 700 more teachers  in  our

teaching force in the coming years while maintaining  the

quality of our teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size is neither as straightforward nor simple

an  issue  as  it has often been made out to  be.   Every

year, during the Committee of Supply debate on Education,

Members  invariably call upon MOE to reduce  class  size.

Mr  Chiam See Tong particularly, has been a long-standing

proponent of this, and I am a little disappointed that he

is  not in the House to hear my speech.  Shrinking  class

sizes has an intuitive appeal, and it is an easy argument

to  make.   I do appreciate the well-motivated intentions

behind these suggestions, and I commend Members, who have

raised  this  matter over a number of  years,  for  their

perseverance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But making sure that these calls translate into

better educational outcomes is another matter altogether.

As Dr Wang Kai Yuen has pointed out, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



reality is much more complex.  Empirical evidence on  the

benefits  of  cutting  class sizes  is  still  mixed  and

inconclusive.   This  is  not  surprising,  because   the

factors which influence the quality of education are  not

limited to class size but also include factors like  home

support,  pupil  motivation and,  more  importantly,  the

quality of school curriculum and programmes, and perhaps,

most important of all, the quality of teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaller classes may in fact be counter-productive,

if  the  teachers teaching them are poorly qualified  and

the  lessons  delivered  are  unsound,  as  a  result  of

expanding teacher numbers indiscriminately.  The  key  is

to  strike that right balance between teacher quality and

the increase in teacher quantity that smaller class sizes

entail, which will provide the best educational outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also not difficult to reduce class size in an

individual  school  and  still maintain  teacher  quality

within  that school.  So, if we try a pilot programme,  I

am  sure  it  will work.  There is no problem with  that,

because we basically cherry pick good teachers from other

schools.   But  the real issue is, when we  reduce  class

sizes on a national scale, then it is not obvious we  can

find  all  the good teachers we need.   In our case,  for

Primary 1 and Primary 2, already we need 700 more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, our target is to recruit our teachers from

the  top-third of each cohort, so there is a limit to how

far  we  can  reduce class size without  compromising  on

quality.    Within the top third, only a  proportion  has

the  right aptitude and interest and, within that smaller

group,  there  are  only  so many  we  can  realistically

attract to teach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charts 1 to 3 illustrate vividly why it would not

have been wise to make such a move until now.  There  was

no  assurance that we could maintain teacher numbers, let

alone   increase   them  on  a  sustained   basis   while

maintaining  quality.   Even  now,  we  need  to  proceed

prudently.   It is not assured that we will  be  able  to

maintain  teacher quality and teacher numbers,  including

these 700 teachers that are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



required  to  implement  this initiative,  especially  in

better  economic  times  which  we  all  hope  for,  when

attracting and retaining good teachers will be more of  a

challenge than it is today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our expectations of our ability to recruit

and  retain teachers in the coming years and the pipeline

of  teachers  coming  through the National  Institute  of

Education, we should have sufficient teachers  to  deploy

to  schools  to  reduce class sizes in Primary  1  to  30

students,  starting from 2005, and enough to  do  so  for

both  Primary 1 and Primary 2, starting from 2006.   From

now  till 2005, the Ministry will also need to work  with

the  schools to adjust intakes, and make sure that  other

resources,  such  as  sufficient  classrooms,  are   also

available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will also implement

partial  single  sessions in our primary  schools.   This

will be for Primary 3 to Primary 6.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our primary schools are designed to operate

as  double sessions, with three levels in the morning and

three  levels in the afternoon - 3 plus 3.  We intend  to

implement  partial single session by having  our  primary

schools  operate  four  levels in the  morning,  and  two

levels in the afternoon - 4 plus 2.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the ability to cut class size is contingent

on  the  availability  of  good teachers,  the  means  to

introduce single session is dependent on the availability

of physical resources, as pointed out by Dr Jennifer Lee.

Our  ability  to introduce partial single session  arises

from the investments we have made in PRIME (Programme for

Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools) over the  last

few  years.  To date, the Government has spent  about  $1

billion  on  PRIME. Since it started in 1999, 72  primary

schools have been upgraded to latest specifications.   35

are  currently being upgraded, and the remaining  schools

will  be  upgraded in future phases of PRIME.  Over  this

period, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



also had another 23 newly-built primary schools.  I refer

Members   to  Chart  4  (Cols.  1647-8)  that  has   been

distributed.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030319/20030319-HA-0761647.pdf"">Chart 4: Number of Primary Schools by Building Specifications</a><br>



It shows the extent of physical improvement taking place.

Today,  over half of our primary schools have been  built

or  upgraded  to  the  latest specifications.   You  will

notice that in 1998, there are only four bars because the

bar  for the latest specifications is zero.  In 2003,  it

is  95.   Under PRIME, schools have been fitted with  new

facilities,   including  computer   laboratories,   media

resource  libraries,  IT  learning  resource  rooms,  and

pastoral care rooms.  We have also increased the stock of

classrooms  in  our school system.  Each upgraded  school

has  more classrooms, which they can use to conduct extra

activities outside curriculum time, and we have done this

in  anticipation  of  making a move towards  implementing

single session in our primary school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue to redevelop the remaining schools in

the  coming years under PRIME, we will have the  physical

resources  and  facilities to accommodate single  session

for P3 to P6 in our primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single session opens up possibilities for better

teaching  and  learning by making  more  space  and  time

available.   Because of wider availability of  facilities

under  single  session, schools can  organise  a  greater

range of CCAs and enrichment activities, especially those

that cut across different levels in the school, on school

days.    This  provides  the  school  with  much  greater

flexibility  to develop meaningful programmes  that  will

help  enhance  a  child's development in  the  affective,

social, and physical spheres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, single session does not benefit all

students  to the same extent.  The benefits are clear  at

secondary  level, where all our schools  are  now  single

session.  Secondary students are typically engaged  in  a

broad  range  of curricular and co-curricular  activities

after  normal school hours.  Upper primary students,  who

require  a  higher level of hand-holding  than  secondary

school students, are involved in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>



after-school  activities as well, but to a lesser  degree

and are unlikely to be engaged in after-school activities

every  day of the week.  Lower primary pupils in  Primary

One and Two may not be ready for longer school hours.  In

fact,  they  tire more easily, and are likely to  require

more  home care and supervision or, if not the  home,  in

before-or-after-school   care   centres.   To    optimise

resources,  it  is best to implement single  session  for

those levels that will benefit more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we will introduce single session for P3 to

P6.    This means, for instance, a school can run its  P3

to  P6  classes in the morning, with access to facilities

in  the afternoon for after-school activities on selected

days,  while P1 and P2 classes operate in the  afternoon.

This  4  plus  2  system makes good use of  the  enhanced

physical  facilities that are being provided under  PRIME

to  improve the learning environment of pupils  according

to their needs and readiness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single session for P3 to P6 will be rolled out

progressively.  It will take us 10 years to complete. The

reason  is  this.  With single session for P3 to  P6  and

smaller  class sizes of 30 pupils in P1 and  P2,  schools

will  have  a smaller capacity.  I call the attention  of

Members  to the addendum that I have asked the  Clerk  to

distribute  for  details  of  how  a  school   might   be

organised.   Schools  that  currently  operate  close  to

capacity  will therefore have to adjust their P1  intakes

and gradually, the P1 intakes will work their way through

to  P6  over a period of 6-10 years to bring their  total

enrolment  to  single session levels.   In this  way,  we

will  not  displace  current pupils  from  their  present

primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing 700 more teachers to enable P1 and P2

class  sizes to be reduced to 30, and single session  for

P3  to P6 will strengthen the foundation that our primary

school pupils currently receive.  It will give principals

and   teachers  more  resources,  more  time,  and   more

flexibility to design the most appropriate strategies and

programmes to provide our primary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



school students a more stimulating learning experience in

our  schools, to bring out their creativity  and  develop

their communication and problem solving skills. This will

help  them blossom and grow, and prepare them better  for

the  more  diverse  and challenging secondary  and  post-secondary programmes that are being introduced which will

in  turn prepare them for a more challenging and exciting

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, this House gave its strong

endorsement  to the structural changes proposed  for  the

Upper   Secondary  and  JC  education   by   the   Junior

College/Upper  Secondary Education Review Committee.  The

next  step  is implementation. Over the next  few  years,

greater  diversity,  in  terms  of  programmes,  mix   of

schools,  and  curricula, will be introduced.  This  will

provide  more  opportunities for  the  very  talented  in

different fields to pursue their passions and groom  more

outstanding  Singaporeans in research,  the  professions,

sports  and  other areas of life.  Integrated  programmes

offering a seamless upper secondary and JC education will

provide  more  room  for our top students  to  engage  in

broader learning experiences and excel in their areas  of

interest.   Specialised schools will  cater  to  children

with  exceptional talents in fields like Mathematics  and

Science,  Sports  and possibly the Arts,  and  help  them

realise  their full potential.  Enlarging the  space  for

diversity  will allow our best schools to achieve  levels

of educational excellence not possible in a one-size-fits-all environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed improvements to JC/upper secondary

education  will be complemented by corresponding  changes

in   the   university  sector.   We  will  provide   more

opportunities and options to our students at the tertiary

level.   University cohort participation rates will  grow

from  21%  to  25%.   More places  will  have  been  made

available  for  polytechnic  graduates.  To  enhance  the

quality of university education, even as it expands,  NUS

will  become a multi-campus university, and NTU  a  full-fledged  comprehensive university.   I  look  forward  to

hearing Members' views and suggestions on this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also pressing ahead with important

initiatives  to make our polytechnics and  Institutes  of

Technical Education, which are already probably  best-of-class  in the world, even better.  I would also  like  to

thank  Members  of this House who have shown  their  keen

interest in developments in this important sector of  our

education  system when 34 Members took up  my  invitation

and  visited  the  Institute of  Technical  Education  in

August and September last year. I am indeed heartened  by

the   positive  feedback  and  encouragement  that  these

Members have given to the lecturers and students  of  the

ITE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, the initiatives to improve the

primary  sector  and  the changes  to  introduce  greater

diversity  and opportunities in the secondary  and  upper

secondary sector and those in the post-secondary  sector,

will  bring out more from every child.  They will  expand

educational opportunities for all our students,  do  more

to  cater to their different aptitudes and abilities, and

better prepare them for tomorrow's challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me now to deal with two issues that

Members have brought up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mdm

Halimah  Yacob and Mr Inderjit Singh, have  spoken  about

streaming.  I  am glad to hear that most Members  support

streaming  and,  in  fact, several  have  advocated  more

streaming.  We have been able to achieve high  levels  of

participation  and  achievement  because  our   education

system  provides,  through streaming,  opportunities  for

advancement to all students according to their  aptitudes

and  abilities.  Our streaming system does allow a better

match  between  curriculum and the  pace  and  method  of

learning  with  the  aptitudes  and  abilities   of   our

children,   and   provide  pathways   and   opportunities

according to different needs and interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have suggested different ways of

implementing  streaming or, as some  prefer  to  call  it

"clustering".  Two years ago, we introduced  a  programme

where  students in the Normal (Academic) stream can  take

their  'O'  levels  in  two subjects  at  Secondary  Four

provided

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



they  have the aptitude for it.  Schools do arrange their

classrooms stigmatically, several schools do it  and  the

schools  are  free to try this out if they wish  to.   In

fact,  after today's session, I am going to St.  Joseph's

Convent  where they have decided to organise their  rooms

stigmatically.  Whether  that  will  provide   a   better

education  and  better  educational  outcomes  is   still

unclear,  but  schools are allowed to try  and  they  are

encouraged to try if they wish to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked for a number of statistics

on the results of streaming.  The indicators he asked for

are  based  on a narrow definition of success.   It  pre-supposes  that you are a success only if you  go  through

EM1  or  2,  enter the Express course,  and  make  it  to

university.  Such a line of thinking, in fact, reinforces

the  bad  effects of streaming.  Success should  be  more

broadly defined.  Indeed, our education system strives to

help  our  students find success in their own way,  where

their  talents and strengths lie. There are other equally

valid routes to success and I am sure that Mr Singh  will

celebrate   them  too.   Polytechnic  and  ITE  education

represent  pathways to success in their  own  right,  and

this has been affirmed by employment and pay statistics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good indicator of the success of streaming is how

well   it  has  served  our  less  academically  inclined

students.   In 1994, we introduced the Normal (Technical)

course in secondary schools for pupils who do better in a

practical  rather than academic setting.   The  VITB  was

also restructured to become a post-secondary institution,

the  ITE.  These students now have a chance to shoot  for

post-secondary education.  In 1994, only 10% of a  cohort

went to ITE.  By 2002, this had doubled to 20% of the  P1

cohort.  They achieve high employment rates and good pay,

even in difficult economic times. Some have started their

own  businesses.   Perhaps  they  will  compete  with  Mr

Inderjit  Singh  one  day.  More  than  1,000  go  on  to

polytechnic each year. I believe that the 34  Members  of

this House who visited the ITE last year found it an  eye

opening  experience, and can attest to what I  have  just

said.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members brought up the subject of mother

tongue,   in  particular,  Chinese  language.   Mr   Low,

particularly,  brought  up some  important  issues  about

English and mother tongue in our society.  Sometimes, the

Ministry  is told that standards are too low  for  mother

tongue  and sometimes the Ministry is told that standards

are  too high for mother tongue.  This reflects the  very

complex  language environment in our society,  and  hence

carried  through into our schools.  This struggle,  which

each  parent faces, if you are a parent who speaks mother

tongue  you have difficulties for your child in  English.

If  you  are  an  English-speaking home, you  often  have

problems for your child in mother tongue.  Sometimes,  we

have  problems with both.  And those of us who  are  more

fortunate have problems with neither.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in a sense, this is part of a struggle of

defining  ourselves as Singaporeans.  We are  neither  an

Eastern  society,  not Chinese, not  Malay,  not  Indian,

where  we  can just remain in our own cocoon and  develop

the  culture,  language to the full,  without  regard  to

others.   We  cannot  do  that.  We  are  a  multi-racial

society.  At the same time, we want to be connected  with

the  West,  America, Europe and the rest  of  the  world.

And,  hence,  we  have  English.  To  some  extent,  this

struggle  is  a  struggle  to  define  what  we  are   as

Singaporeans.  This is a struggle that will  go  on,  and

continue for a long time to come.  But the Government  is

committed  to its bilingual policy, and for  the  reasons

that I expressed earlier.  English is the common language

for  us  and  for  us to reach out to the  world,  mother

tongue  is  for  us to be rooted in our  values  and  our

culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, with globalisation, regionalisation, the

imperatives  for learning the language for  business  and

political reasons have also become stronger.  Mr  Low  is

right, and I certainly welcome that.  Because it makes it

easier for us to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



continue with our bilingual policy and for students to be

motivated  to  learn  their mother  tongue.   So  in  our

schools we try to cater to this diversity of students and

requirements.   We  have  mother  tongue,  higher  mother

tongue,   and  language  elective  programmes  -  Chinese

Language,  Malay Language - and we also have  Syllabus  B

for  those  who  require a little  more  help.   So  each

student can take mother tongue to as high a level  as  he

can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang suggested that we tap on retired Chinese or

other  mother tongue language teachers to do  translation

work.   I think that is an excellent idea.  I agree  that

retired   Chinese   Language  teachers,   mother   tongue

teachers, are an excellent resource to tap.  Perhaps,  Mr

Ang  might  want to take his suggestion one step  further

and  work  with the Singapore Chinese Teachers  Union  to

help  them  provide such a service to organisations  that

wish to engage their expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I will now ask Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam to

elaborate on the implementation work being undertaken  on

the  JC  and  upper  secondary  education  landscape  and

several of the other issues that Members have raised, and

Mr Hawazi will respond on holistic education, CCA, values

and so forth, a little later in the debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Madam, let me first provide an

update on the implementation of the changes to our JC and

upper secondary school system, which Members had approved

last  year  after debate, and which several Members  have

spoken on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the shift to a broader and more flexible JC

curriculum.  MOE has set up a steering committee  chaired

by  the  Director-General  of Education  to  oversee  the

implementation of this exercise.  It is a major education

undertaking, requiring careful design, planning and roll-out.   There is no foreign system that we can  borrow  or

import,  no  easy  fix.   This  is  because  the  new  JC

curriculum  seeks to provide not just greater flexibility

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



choice  -  more subjects, different levels of subjects  - but  also  wants to retain the trademark rigour and  high

standards of the Singapore system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor and Mdm Halimah have asked about

preparing teachers for the changes.  This is key  to  the

successful  implementation of  the  educational  reforms.

Specific  training will be provided to teachers  who  are

involved in the new curriculum, either in the teaching of

new  subjects,  like Knowledge and Inquiry,  or  the  new

levels  of  subjects that we are going to introduce.   We

will  spare  no efforts on this.  Our teachers  are  not,

however,  starting from scratch.  While MOE will continue

to train and update existing teachers and new teachers on

the  new  curricula, I would like to emphasise  that  our

teachers are already trained with a core of knowledge and

skills that enables them to respond to changes in subject

design and to adopt new modes of teaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members who have joined in the visits that we

have  organised  for MPs recently to the NIE  would  have

seen  for themselves and got a good sense of the  quality

of  education  and training the NIE now provides.   I  am

glad that Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Gan Kim Yong and Dr Warren

Lee have referred to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has asked if we should extend the

flexibility or unstructuredness of the new JC  curriculum

to  the secondary level.  This is an important issue that

was studied carefully in last year's review by the JC and

Upper  Secondary  Education Review  Committee.   The  key

issue  at  the  JC  level was over-specialisation.   This

problem does not exist at the secondary level.  The lower

secondary  curriculum  is already  broad-based.   At  the

upper secondary level, all express students must take  at

least  one  science, one humanities subject, mathematics,

and  two  languages.  In practice, among science students

who  take 8 `O'-level subjects, 62% of them take at least

two   humanities  subjects  and  two  languages,  besides

mathematics  and science subjects.  It is  therefore  not

necessary  to  make significant changes to the  secondary

curriculum.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think the spirit of Mr Inderjit Singh's

question  is  right.  We are indeed seeking to  introduce

more  flexibility  and  choice in  the  secondary  school

system.   That  is why we are creating new and  different

pathways  for our students by introducing the  integrated

programmes,  allowing  the establishment  of  specialised

independent  schools  in sports, arts  and  science,  and

allowing  for  a few privately funded secondary  schools.

These schools will be free to structure a curriculum that

suits their objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also opened the door to mainstream schools

that   wish  to  adopt  an  alternative,  internationally

recognised   curriculum.   Further,  we  have  introduced

flexibility in the Normal (Academic) stream, as  Minister

Teo  has  just  mentioned.   And  all  schools  have  the

autonomy to develop niches of excellence in their  chosen

areas.  So the array of choices in the school system  has

widened  considerably.  It is better  that  we  focus  on

implementing  these changes well and allow them  to  work

through  the  system  and  be  digested  by  parents  and

students  before considering if we should  introduce  any

further fluidity in the school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the integrated programmes. At last year's

debate on the JC and upper secondary review, Members will

recall that MOE has said that we expect to have up to 6-8

integrated programmes eventually, catering to the top 10%

of   each  cohort.   We  do  not  expect  to  get   there

immediately.   Schools that are ready  and  confident  of

delivering an integrated programme of quality, that  adds

value to the system, will go first.  The four families of

schools  which  have already received approval  to  offer

integrated  programmes, plan to start enrolling  students

for these programmes next year, 2004.  They are currently

developing  their programmes and will be  releasing  more

information  in July or August, in time for  this  year's

Primary  6  students and their parents to  make  informed

decisions about whether to apply for the programmes.  MOE

has  also recently received two additional proposals from

schools  which  are keen to offer integrated  programmes,

and is evaluating them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, specialist independent schools. We are making

progress on the proposed specialist schools.  The  Sports

School  which is overseen by MCDS will open its doors  in

2004.   Several  Members have asked about  the  admission

policies of the Sports School and I will leave it to  the

Minister for Community Development and Sports to  address

the questions, because MCDS is the parent Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS has set up a steering committee, chaired by its

Provost, to implement the Mathematics and Science  School

that will provide a 6-year education from Secondary 1  to

JC  2.  On the question of a specialist arts school, MITA

Minister,  David Lim, will be updating Members  later  in

the COS debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private schools. MOE is also working out the

detailed  criteria  for approving  up  to  2-3  reputable

privately  funded  schools that could add  value  to  our

education  system.  We expect to invite proposals  around

the  middle of this year.  In the meantime, a few parties

have expressed interest in setting up such schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan had asked if we should not extend

the  concept  of  private schools to the  primary  level.

This  is something we studied carefully last year as part

of  the  JC  and upper secondary review, and  we  decided

against  recommending in favour of primary schools  being

opened  to the private sector.  Our schools are the  most

important  route  in Singapore for cultivating  a  common

sense  of  identity  amongst the  young.   We  have  just

introduced  compulsory education, implemented  this  year

for  the first time, for the very reason of ensuring that

all  our young go through an essentially common shape  of

experience  in  their  primary  school  years,  and  form

similar instincts regardless of social background.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree fully with Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang on the

importance of educating the public on the recent  changes

to  the  educational landscape.  They may  have  appeared

complex  at first glance, but they can be simplified  and

explained

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>



quite clearly to the public.  Information on the proposed

changes  has  already been communicated  via  the  media,

which has been doing a good job, I think, on the subject,

as  well  as  MOE's  Internet website.   The  IP  schools

themselves  have  announced  various  features  of  their

respective   programmes  and  started  discussions   with

parents  of  their  students.   MOE  intends  to  produce

information  kits  to reach out to more  parents  on  the

changes  to  the education system.  We have also  briefed

our  schools  on  the  changes so that  they  can  advise

parents  who  approach them on the choices  available  to

their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have rightly raised the subject of

teachers, since they are critical to everything we do  in

education.   Dr Wang and Dr Amy Khor asked about  sharing

of best practices amongst teachers.  Professional sharing

is  a key aspect of teacher development and has gained  a

fair  bit of sway in recent years.  The Teachers  Network

was  set  up precisely for this purpose.  Each  year,  it

organises workshops for some 4,000 teachers to learn  and

share innovative strategies and practices.  We also  have

an  annual  teachers  conference which  showcases  action

research,   experimentation   and   successful   teaching

practices.  When we launched the second phase of  our  IT

Master Plan last year, more than 7,000 teachers took part

in  activities over a few days, which showcased the  best

practices in the use of IT in education.  At the zone and

cluster  levels,  there  are now numerous  platforms  for

discussion  and  sharing  best practices,  including  the

centres of excellence that had been set up.  To give just

one  example at the zonal level, Science Exploria in East

Spring  Primary  School.   More than  500  teachers  have

attended  learning sessions at Science Exploria since  it

started 14 months ago.  The Centre intends to publish the

lessons that have been developed by the teachers so  that

they  can  be shared more widely with teachers  of  other

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang also suggested that we enhance the profile

of  our  outstanding  teachers, eg,  those  who  win  the

Presidential awards each year.  I think this is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



good idea.  Our teachers are not show-biz stars, they are

very  modest  people,  but  I think  a  greater  profile,

through the course of the year, will enhance awareness of

the real value of the teaching profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah and Dr Maliki have asked how MOE was

helping  teachers cope with stress.  It is not a  trivial

matter.  MOE conducts many courses to enable teachers  to

handle  stress.  Some are specific to stress  management,

while  others are on general well-being that  help  equip

teachers  with  skills  to handle  stressful  situations.

Through   the   Teachers  Network,  MOE   also   provides

counselling for teachers who experience stress,  although

it  has  to  be  said that not all stress encountered  by

teachers is work-related.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah also asked about teachers' nodules. It

is an issue, and we have been addressing it.  MOE in fact

provides  10  courses on voice care each  year,  each  20

hours long.  MOE is also collaborating this year with Tan

Tock  Seng  Hospital  to organise a voice  symposium  for

teachers.  Some teachers do indeed use microphones.  If I

keep  going  on  about everything we are  doing  to  help

teachers  keep their voices, I think I will  talk  myself

hoarse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon raised the issue of training

for  Chinese  language  teachers.  Our  Chinese  language

teachers   have  a  wide  complement  of   training   and

development opportunities open to them.  First, there are

currently 25 in-service training courses each year and 13

workshops for Chinese language teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Chinese language teachers can apply for MOE-sponsored Diploma courses and post-graduate studies in

relevant courses in local and overseas universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we provide overseas training opportunities

for our Chinese language teachers to learn best practices

which  can be adapted to suit our own requirements.   MOE

also  brings  in  outstanding teachers from  the  PRC  to

provide  demonstration  lessons  and  sessions   to   our

teachers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, MOE has also been sending outstanding

students on undergraduate teaching scholarships aimed  at

breeding  future  Chinese language  teachers.   22  local

scholarships  and  20 foreign scholarships  were  awarded

over the last five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, MOE is supportive of our Chinese language

teachers as they pursue other tertiary opportunities that

are  available to enhance their knowledge of the subject.

Examples  of  available courses include the undergraduate

programme  with Wuhan University, which was initiated  by

the  Singapore  Chinese Teachers Union  (SCTU),  and  the

Beijing  Normal  University Bachelor of Arts  in  Chinese

Language and Literature programme which is offered at the

Singapore Institute of Management.  Many Chinese teachers

are  taking  advantage  of  these  new  opportunities  to

upgrade themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Nithiah Nandan, Miss Penny Low, Mr Inderjit

Singh,  Dr  Wang and Mr Chandra Mohan asked what  we  are

doing   to  promote  creativity  and  an  entrepreneurial

spirit.   MOE completed a review of the school curriculum

at  all  levels not long ago, in year 2001.  Content  has

been reduced to free up more time for learning activities

that  foster  critical and creative thinking.   There  is

greater emphasis across the subject curriculum on process

and thinking skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aligning our assessment modes with these

learning  objectives.   Last year,  MOE  assumed  greater

control  over  the  Singapore-Cambridge  GCE  'A'   level

Examination.   We  changed the syllabus  and  examination

format for the `A' levels to reward students who are able

to  apply the principles they have learnt and to think on

their feet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, MOE will likewise be taking greater control

over  the  `O'  levels.  This will help ensure  that  the

secondary school curriculum meets our educational  goals.

It  allows  us to place greater emphasis on thinking  and

process   skills,   while  retaining   Singapore's   high

standards.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE agrees fully with Dr Wang and the other MPs on

the need to develop an entrepreneurial spirit amongst our

young.   There  are  basically two  sets  of  skills  and

instincts that matter here, and that are reflected in our

approach  to  developing this spirit among our  students.

The  first  comprises practical business-related  skills.

Our schools have been actively promoting this through co-curricular  activities  (CCAs), such  as  entrepreneurial

clubs  and business clubs of one form or another.   There

are  many examples of schools whose students have started

business  ventures  such  as co-operatives  or  part-time

businesses in schools.  Last week, South West CDC and NTU

organised a camp for 120 students from the JCs and ITE in

the  CDC  and  the Singapore Polytechnic.   The  students

interacted with  prominent local entrepreneurs and  CEOs,

visited  several SMEs, and developed their own  ideas  on

how to enhance the marketing efforts of the companies.  I

spent  the afternoon with them with Mdm Yu-Foo  and  must

say  I was impressed by the freshness of their ideas  and

the  gusto  with  which they went about presenting  them.

They were serious about what they were doing - so serious

that  they worked till 4 o'clock in the morning.  I asked

them  how many would seriously contemplate setting  up  a

business at some point in the future or doing so  with  a

few  friends.  About  one-third raised their hands.  That

is not bad.  I think it is much higher than it would have

been  2-3  years  ago. So the flame is  lit,  and  it  is

glowing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our primary school students are being infected,

in their own fashion.  There are many examples.  Students

in  Rulang  Primary School have grown a spice garden  and

have successfully sold their produce to school staff  and

parents.  I am assured that they donated all proceeds  to

the SPCA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But developing an entrepreneurial spirit goes beyond

teaching  students  the  skills and  technical  knowledge

involved  in starting or running a business.  The  second

and a key part of MOE's approach is to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



focus  on  key  traits  that  underlie  entrepreneurship:

resourcefulness,  persistence in the face  of  difficulty

and  the habit of innovation.  These are traits that  are

useful  for  all our students, not just those  who  might

eventually go on to run a business.  We want our students

to  be  willing  to work out new perspectives,  have  the

boldness and self-conviction to try another way,  take  a

different  road  and,  occasionally,  break  the   mould.

Efforts  to  develop  these traits will  be  manifest  in

various facets of our school programmes, starting even in

our primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has already made major changes in this

direction,  but  agrees that more can be  done.   We  are

currently undertaking a comprehensive study to see how we

can   better   nurture  the  spirit  of  enterprise   and

innovation in our students. We should not aim  for  quick

results  and  we will not, as Dr Wang says, produce  bus-loads  of  entrepreneurs.  But we can  and  will  produce

generations  of  Singaporeans who are able  to  face  the

future  with confidence, try more diverse paths,  persist

against the odds and thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has suggested introducing entrepreneurship

as  a  CCA.   Cooperative societies, which are recognised

CCAs,  have  been  formed  in  some  schools  to  develop

business  acumen in pupils.  Other schools  have  started

Young  Enterprise  Clubs  as core  CCAs  to  develop  and

nurture future entrepreneurs.  The NYAA is free to assist

schools in setting up entrepreneur clubs, which are  also

recognised CCAs.  MOE will continue, of course,  to  give

schools the autonomy to decide on the setting up of  such

clubs as part of their overall school programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan raised the perennial problem of

heavy  school bags.  I would like to assure him that  MOE

and  the schools have been working at this.  We have made

textbooks  thinner  by  dividing them  up  into  separate

volumes  for  each  module.   Schools  have  lockers  for

children to keep their belongings.  Teachers look out for

young  pupils who seem to have heavy bags, and  sometimes

even check their bags.  Schools will continue to work  at

this problem but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



parents  must  also supervise their children  in  packing

their bags.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low commented that we should nurture

students'  passions  for particular  subject  areas.   We

quite agree.  There is a whole host of programmes, in our

schools  and within school clusters, to cater to students

with  special talents and interests, in the  arts,  music

and  the  sciences.  At the JC level, the new  curriculum

will  provide more space for this. In other words, within

the  formal curriculum, we want to provide more space for

this.  Students with a special interest and ability in  a

subject  will be able to take it further as an H3 subject

-  if Members recall the terminology.  They can do it  by

either taking research under the mentorship of university

professors or researchers or in some other forms which we

are  working out.  There are several examples of students

who   are   already  doing  this,  outside   the   formal

curriculum.   For example, Tan Chun Ghee,  who  graduated

from RJC last year.  While in JC1, he spent six weeks  at

the  Centre for Excellence in Education at MIT in the US,

under an attachment programme arranged by the MOE.   Chun

Ghee's project, while he was at MIT, won him three awards

at  the  Intel Science and Engineering Fair in  Kentucky,

US, that year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee raised the matter of the teaching of

life  sciences.  We agree with his observations.  MOE  is

taking  the life sciences seriously, not because  we  are

bedazzled  by recent discoveries, but because this  is  a

revolution  in  knowledge, one that will  transform  many

disciplines, and will change how we live.  It  is  a  new

language  of  science that all students will find  useful

even if they do not plan to pursue the life sciences as a

career.   Topics and approaches that enhance the learning

of  the  life  sciences have therefore been  incorporated

into    the   primary,   secondary   and   pre-university

syllabuses, not only in the science subjects, but also in

other subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not putting all our eggs in the life sciences

basket.   We  agree  with  Dr Lee  that  other  areas  of

knowledge remain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



quite essential.  While the number of students opting for

"A" level Biology has increased to 20% last year compared

to  13%  in  the  year  2000, it is not  disproportionate

compared  to, say, the candidature for Physics, which  is

66%.   And with the review of the JC curriculum,  science

students  will  also be required to  take  at  least  one

humanities  subject.  So we are broadening our  students,

broadening the curriculum, as we inject the life sciences

into the curriculum, not narrowing them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema had asked about what MOE was doing to help

our  Secondary 4N (Academic) students make the transition

to  Secondary  5  where they take the  'O'  levels.   The

Normal (Academic) syllabuses are generally subsets of the

`O' level syllabuses.  They are designed such that Normal

(Academic) students who are capable of going on to  offer

the  `O' levels are able to progress smoothly to the  `O'

levels in three years from Secondary 3.  A review of  the

curriculum was conducted in 1999 which helped  to  reduce

the  assessment gap between the 'N' levels  and  the  'O'

levels  in  various subjects.   For example, the  History

paper  now  focuses more on questions requiring  thinking

skills and the application of concepts instead of content

knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, even among the Normal (Academic)

students,  there will be differences in the abilities  of

the  students  in  our schools.  The  teachers  recognise

this, and adjust their teaching methods and pace to  suit

the  needs of different groups of students.  Teachers may

decide  how  much to teach based on the  ability  of  the

students.  This difference in the scope of coverage means

that  the  weaker students will be prepared  sufficiently

well to pass the 'O' levels, while the more able students

will probably perform better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Secondary 5 students are, by and large, coping

quite  well  with  the  `O' levels.   About  66%  of  the

students  progress  on to our post-secondary  educational

institutions.  Of that 66%, 45% do well enough to qualify

for either the polytechnics or 'A' levels.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked about stress and the incidence

of  psychiatric  illness or psychological problems  among

our  students.   According to statistics from  the  Child

Guidance  Clinic, the total number of new cases  seen  in

2002  was  about  2,000.  Of these,  about  4%  concerned

mental  health  problems or psychiatric illnesses.    The

incidence of cases referred to the Child Guidance  Clinic

has  increased, but it remains low, certainly lower  than

that of most of the advanced societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All societies have children who face stress-related

problems of one form or another.  What matters is that we

have  the  mechanisms  in place  to  help  the  children.

Members  have previously been informed of the counselling

and referral system that we have in place in all schools,

supported   by   trained  Teacher   Counsellors,   School

Counsellors,   and   specialist   support   from    MOE's

educational psychologists and guidance specialists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out too that an increase in referrals

need  not  always be seen as a negative development.   It

also  means  that more students are being counselled  and

helped where they might not have been helped before.   It

would   also  reflect  greater  awareness  of   potential

problems amongst parents and teachers, and more resources

becoming available for counselling in schools.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Singh. Make it quick, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Madam, I want to make a

clarification  on the issue of definition  of  "success".

In  fact, I think the Minister may have misled Members to

think  about  my narrow definition of "success".   I  may

have a wider definition than him, in fact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue that I was trying to pursue was not so

much  of how we define success by way of how our students

progress  from one stream to another, but one of  leakage

of  having  a  system of early streaming.  That  was  the

reason why

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



I  asked  many  questions.  It is not because  I  have  a

narrow definition of "success".  I, in fact, have  a  lot

of  respect for ITE graduates. I have come across many of

them.  Many of them are also successful.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Singh, can you come to your

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> My clarification is that I do not

want Members to feel that I have a narrow definition.   I

have  a  much  wider  definition than what  the  Minister

thinks.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> I agree with the

Senior  Minister  of  State  that  increased  numbers  of

detection  do  not mean that it is necessarily  bad.   It

means  that it is good.  But could he comment on  what  I

mentioned  earlier that psychiatrists are saying  that  a

lot more of our students may need early detection but are

not  receiving early detection?  I wonder what mechanisms

are  there  to identify them early enough to be  able  to

give  them  the kind of help that they need at  an  early

stage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Briefly, the mechanisms

are  there in the schools.  Our teachers go through  some

basic  training on how to identify these  problems.   And

the  teacher  counsellors and specialist counsellors  are

quite well trained to handle this.  I am not sure that we

are  finding  every  student who has a problem,  probably

not.  But we are doing a reasonable job.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr John Chen, one last clarification.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Madam, the Minister has not

answered  my question.  I do not know whether  he  agrees

with  my observation and whether he will do something  to

make   learning  the  Chinese  language  more   fun   and

enjoyable.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Madam, first, my apologies for

calling  you  "Sir",  an  appellation  that  you  do  not

deserve!   But  I  will be glad to take  Dr  John  Chen's

suggestion and I will ask my language specialists to have

a look at it, and see

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



how many different combinations they can make and see how

they  can make language learning more interesting.  I  am

happy  to  receive suggestions from any  Member  of  this

House  who  thinks  he  can make language  learning  more

enjoyable.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang, can you go on to your next

cut?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Madam, MOE recently released a

paper  on  university  sector  review.   I  have  several

concerns   about  its  recommendations.    Firstly,   the

Government  is targeting to enrol 25% of the cohort  into

university  when  the implementation is  in  full  swing.

This  is  a  numerical target. Once  the  facilities  and

manpower  have been built up to take in this number,  the

institutions  will enrol that target number of  students.

However,  in terms of calibre, we might not be  enrolling

the top 25%.  We know that significant numbers of our  JC

students go overseas for their education. Thus, we  could

be  enrolling students down to the top 30% of  a  cohort.

If  that  is  the  case, would there be  a  concern  that

standards  in our universities could be maintained?   And

how does this tie in with our aspiration to build a world-class university in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the current graduate unemployment rate

has  illustrated that our economy might  not  absorb  the

number  of graduates already as it is.  If we expand  the

enrolment  further, would we be creating an  even  bigger

problem in the future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, former Minister of State, Mr Peter

Chen, championed the concept of a fourth university.  One

of  the objectives of the fourth university was to  cater

to  the  aspiration  of  the large  pool  of  polytechnic

graduates in the workforce looking for an opportunity  to

upgrade.   As  we know, 60% of the 'O' level students  in

our  cohort proceed to polytechnic.  And, at the  moment,

only  the  top 10% of polytechnic graduates get to  enrol

into  the  local  universities.  Yet, of those  who  have

gained  admission  into foreign universities,  they  have

performed very well.  Now that the fourth university

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



is  no longer on the table, do we cater to this niche  in

the  new vision of university education landscape in  the

future?

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, would the Minister explain the trade-off between the cluster university concept versus

starting  the  fourth university as originally  proposed?

The  market had actually responded to the vacuum with SIM

publicly declaring its interest to evolve into the fourth

university.   Does  this proclamation  by  SIM  have  the

Ministry's support?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, let me say, at the

outset,  that  I  support  the University  Sector  Review

Committee's  recommendation to  increase  the  number  of

places  at  our local universities and to allow  a  small

number of private universities to be set up in Singapore,

thus providing more diversity and choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to raise two issues relating to the

University Sector Review Committee's Report.  The  target

cohort  participation rate by 2010 is 25%,  up  from  the

current  21%.  Each year, thousands of private candidates

take  the  'A'  courses from a wide range  of  programmes

offered  by  many  different schools,  some  of  doubtful

quality.  Some of our polytechnic graduates seek a second

chance  to  pursue a degree.  Others completed their  'A'

levels  but could not gain admission into either  NUS  or

NTU.   Those who can afford to go overseas do.  There  is

clearly  a  demand for university education from  a  wide

pool of potential candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, the CPR of some western countries is

as  much as 40% to 50%.  I am not advocating that target.

But  I understand and accept the Ministry's concern about

not  diluting  standards  from  too  high  a  number   of

students.    However,  I  differ  from  my  parliamentary

colleague, Dr Wang Kai Yuen's view.  I feel that there is

certainly room to raise the CPR to 30%, or so, in  future

without  diluting  standards because of the  increasingly

high quality of students.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue concerns the question of staffing at

the universities.  I understand that quality teaching and

research  staff  in some disciplines are sorely  lacking,

and  recruitment is often done overseas.  Foreign talents

often  fill  many  of  the posts.  While  some  of  these

foreign  talents  eventually make  their  home  here  and

thereby  contribute to Singapore's manpower  development,

many  more  choose to leave at the end of their contract.

Are  there mechanisms in place to ensure that the  skills

and expertise of these talents are somehow transferred to

the  local staff?  What is the ratio of local to  foreign

staff  at  NUS  and NTU currently?  What is the  turnover

rate  for local and foreign university lecturers in  each

of these two universities in the last two years?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, as

Singapore  faces  the  21st century  with  its  many  new

challenges  and rapid global developments, we envision  a

nation of responsible citizens and creative thinkers  who

are  determined  to learn throughout  their  lives.   The

emphasis  is  on  continuous upgrading and  the  thinking

should  be  "Am  I a knowledge worker?   And  if  I  have

succeeded  in  becoming a knowledge worker today,  I  may

need  to  acquire new skills tomorrow so that  I  am  not

obsolete in my dynamic environment."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Madam, the university sector review is

timely.   And  I fully support the major initiatives  and

plans.  Our institutes of higher learning are intricately

linked  to  our  chief engines of growth.   However,  are

concrete steps being made to open up university places to

the  thousands of diploma holders and working adults  who

dream  of a tertiary education and experience?  Are there

still university courses that are not open to the diploma

graduates?  If so, why is this so?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with the plan to turn NTU to a full-fledged

university  offering a comprehensive  range  of  courses,

what  are  the Ministry's plans or check and  balance  to

ensure  that  NTU  continues to gain  more  momentum  and

become more reputable,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



instead  of falling back to its past reputation?   May  I

suggest  that it may be worthwhile for NTU to consider  a

new  name  to  reflect its renewed identity, mission  and

vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Madam, may I also propose that our

universities   exercise  flexibility  in   allowing   the

students  to take breaks and sabbatical leave to  explore

and  try  new  experiences, maybe start up a business  or

travel the world in between their course period.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, the current content

and  pedagogy of university education at NUS show a  bias

towards research and development largely by design  given

the  emphasis  of  the  current administration  on  staff

publications.  This might be appropriate for the Science,

Arts and Technology disciplines, but perhaps less so  for

other  more  professional disciplines.  Consequently,  it

appears  that  applied research and  practice  orientated

curriculum currently do not feature highly in the overall

institutional ethos.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers often tell me that, compared to graduates

from  the  polytechnics, NUS and NTU graduates,  although

more  mature  when  they leave the universities,  have  a

poorer   grasp   of  the  practical  aspects   of   their

disciplines.    It  is  of  course  possible   to   argue

philosophically  that  the  purpose  of   an   university

education  is not to make artisans or technicians.   That

is  the polytechnic's job.  But I suspect that, if a poll

of  employers were taken, many would say that  they  wish

the university graduates put combined thinking skills and

a  better mastery of the technical skills required of the

job.  Some graduates have little bent for R&D, preferring

instead to, so to speak, soil their hands in our quest to

move  up the value chain.  Have we neglected these  other

aspirations  for  industry  oriented  degree  programmes,

especially for the professional disciplines?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the recent debate about the respective

marriage  of  the three universities and whether  or  not

Marina is really different, as the advertisement says,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



marks  a  growing awareness that university education  is

more  than just the impartation of knowledge and  skills.

No doubt this debate will spur all the three universities

to  closely examine their pedagogical methods  to  ensure

that  graduates  of whichever university they  come  from

have the requisite technical, professional as well as the

life skills needed to thrive in the New Economy.  I would

like to ask the Minister how the universities will ensure

that  there is a balance between the quest to be a world-class  research  university and producing graduates  that

meet the needs of the industry.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Madam, currently, only

about  17%  of  our  workforce are graduates.   With  the

intention to increase the cohort to 25%, we are  now  one

step  closer  to  a system of mass education  where  more

students, regardless of background, have a chance to do a

tertiary   course.   But  this  ignores  the  fact   that

increased  participation does not always lead  to  higher

standards.   In fact, according to a report in  Australia

on  the  changes  in academic work, the opposite  is  the

case.  We also need to be conscious of the fact that  the

drop-out rate does not increase after the student  intake

is enlarged in our universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, no one denies the importance of a tertiary

education.  Graduates not only have a greater  chance  of

gaining  employment and earning more, but also  have  the

privilege  of  fulfilling their intellectual  curiosities

and academic ambitions.  However, there is multi evidence

in  many  countries  that, as the  tertiary  institutions

enlarge  their intake of students, many of these colleges

just  fail  the  standard tests.  Instead  of  developing

academic excellence and high quality education,  many  of

these  tertiary  courses  promote  a  mediocre  level  of

abilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, if our rhetoric about a knowledge nation and

our  intent  to  be  an education  hub  is  to  be  taken

seriously,  how  would  the  Ministry  ensure  that   our

universities  are  indeed  the  world's  best  and  their

standards would not be compromised by a bigger cohort?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note with concern that this year's budget

allocation to the Ministry of Education has decreased  by

about  10%.  Can the Minister assure this House that  the

standard   of   our  tertiary  education  will   not   be

compromised?  And can the Minister also assure this House

that the tuition fees will not be increased to cover  the

budget cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Madam, I have two points to raise on

the  matter of university education.  The first  pertains

to  the recently announced decision to go in favour of  a

multi-campus  model  through the National  University  of

Singapore,   as   opposed   to   the   introduction   and

establishment  of a fourth university.  I appreciate  the

model of a multi-campus university and I think there  are

some  excellent examples around the world.  For  example,

the  University of California where this has  been  quite

successful in offering a high standard of education to  a

broad spectrum of students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is a little lamentable that we

appear  to  have lost an opportunity to establish  a  new

institution  of  higher learning with its own  character,

culture,  mission,  perhaps, even pedagogic  methods  and

subjects  focus.  And the question is whether within  the

model  of a multi-campus institution, such diversity  can

be  achieved.  This is particularly the case because when

we  discussed the fourth university idea some time  back,

one  of  the  motivations  was to  try  and  broaden  the

offering  at  the tertiary level to all students.   So  I

would  appreciate a clarification as to why the  Ministry

has   chosen  this  path  and  how  NUS  and  the   other

institutions  we  have at the higher  learning  level  in

Singapore  will  offer the variety that  we  are  talking

about and we see diversity at the tertiary level for  our

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is a matter of most specific

operational detail.  Recently, the National University of

Singapore  has announced various trends to  redefine  the

terms  of employment for the lecturers at the university.

And  there has been a range of consultation sessions that

have occurred.  I have received feedback from numerous

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



sources on this matter.  And my sense of it is that there

is  an  element of uncertainty and disquiet  amongst  the

faculty  staff.   I think the key issues that  they  have

expressed are that, first, they are not really  clear  of

the  rationale behind this move.  Is there a cost cutting

exercise,  or are there other more fundamental objectives

in  play?   And,  secondly, whether this  is  actually  a

decision that has been taken and has been communicated to

them  at this point, or is this a feedback exercise which

would  then be factored into the final decision.  I would

appreciate it if a clarification from the Minister as  to

the intent and the rationale behind this exercise, and to

also  let  us  know when a decision, if it has  not  been

taken  already, will be taken and implemented.   I  think

this  would  go  a  long way in at least  dispelling  the

uncertainty in the minds of many of the university staff.

I  think that, in turn, it will have a positive effect on

the learning environment in the university.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, the Report of the

University   Sector   enunciates   the   principles    of

robustness, diversity and health competition.  These  are

principles  I  fully endorse.  The Report concludes  from

these three principles that there is no need for a fourth

university,  an idea first broached by another  committee

headed by the former Senior Minister of State Peter  Chen

in  early  2002.   So with due respect, one  Minister  of

State  says  to start a fourth university, while  another

says, no, - all within a matter of nine months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the university sector in its latest

incarnation  is that of a multi-autonomous  campus,  NUS,

and an enlarged NTU, rather than a fourth university.   I

understand  that this is in order to derive economies  of

scale from operations, branding, other start-up costs and

minimise staff poaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we saw very high profile defections of former

TCS  stars,  actors  and  actresses  shortly  before  SPH

MediaWorks was set up two to three years ago.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



two  stations  - MediaCorp and MediaWorks -  now  compete

head to head in the TV ratings, forcing huge improvements

to  the  quality  of programming and promoting  the  film

industry.   The  chief beneficiary from this  competition

has,  without a question, been the consumer.  In economic

terms,  society's welfare has improved, even if producers

find their monopoly cut down.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, poaching, in itself, is not necessarily a bad

thing.   Existing  senior NUS staff can quite  easily  be

seconded  permanently to start the fourth university,  as

was  the  case with the migration of some teaching  staff

from  the NUS Business School and other faculties to SMU.

I  fear  that the enhanced competition element is missing

from this latest proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I must also confess I have trouble

deciphering what these terms "autonomous" and  a  "multi-campus  university"  really mean.   Will  the  respective

Presidents of the three campuses have the independence to

make  decisions  on  admissions,  examination  standards,

expenditure,   etc?   Presumably,  the  NUS  multi-campus

system  takes  its inspiration from the California  State

University   system.   But  the  various  University   of

California campuses are generally so geographically apart

and distinct that they operate almost as totally separate

entities,  whereas the NUS system seems more like  branch

campuses  of  the  mother campus.   In  this  sense,  the

competitive  landscape  has not  changed  much  from  the

present,  because  the new campuses at  Buona  Vista  and

Outram are offering somewhat differentiated courses  from

what the three existing universities are offering.  Also,

NUS  (Buona Vista) seems to be positioned as the  premier

research university above its lesser brethren in the  NUS

system,  as  well as NTU and SMU.  Is this  streaming  at

work  at the tertiary level?  If so, then we should  also

accept  that  not  all  public universities  are  created

equal, and we are merely reflecting the spectrum of human

ability   by   having   both  top-tier   and   lower-tier

universities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be an incongruence here. At the

polytechnic  level,  there are no  misgivings  about  the

third, fourth or even a fifth polytechnic.  But we reject

the  need for a fourth university.  Is it because we  are

enforcing quality, by deliberately reducing the supply of

university places?  What about SIM?  It was touted to  be

the  seat of the fourth university at one time.   Perhaps

the   Minister  could  review  the  idea  of  the  fourth

university as an institution for industry and practice.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, the lack of professional

recognition of the NUS Building degree, and the  adoption

of  the  modular system in NUS have made the Bachelor  of

Science (Building) course redundant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS must not confuse the public by stating in its

prospectus that the Bachelor of Science (Building) course

has  "National  and  International  Accreditation".   The

qualification is not recognised as a professional  degree

in Singapore.  For example, the Building and Construction

Authority  (BCA) has refused to include the qualification

under  its approved contractor registration system.   The

Ministry of Manpower does not recognise the degree to  be

a  qualified  site safety officer.  There is  no  Act  in

Singapore to govern the professional conduct of  building

graduates.   Thus,  we  should not conduct  the  Building

degree  course and waste our limited resources.  Instead,

I  would  propose that we convert the Bachelor of Science

(Building)   course   into  an  engineering   course   in

facilities management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, as buildings become more complex, we need

professionals who are trained in facilities management to

manage  our building development and management.  In  the

US,  facilities management is a growing industry and  has

indeed  added much value in the development of  buildings

and facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Ministry whether it will consider

converting the Bachelor of Science (Building) course into

a Bachelor of Engineering (Facilities Management) course?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Madam, I spoke quoting my personal experience last year

concerning  the  admission  criteria  for  the  NUS   MBA

programme,  not for my own interest but for that  of  the

public in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government encourages training, retraining

and  lifelong learning and going for higher qualification

to  become  more skilled and professional, I am surprised

that  the  NUS'  admission  criteria  for  higher  degree

courses  restrict  the  number of  Singaporeans  who  are

allowed  to  participate in each course.  When  I,  as  a

graduate  of the university and a former students'  union

President and now an NCMP, was rejected for admission  to

the  NUS  MBA  programme, I was told that it was  because

there were too many qualified student applicants from the

region with higher GMAT scores.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the university seems to favour foreign students

over  our  local citizens, where does it place our  local

citizen  population  with regard to self-improvement  and

upgrading of their professional qualification in the name

of lifelong learning?  Do they need to go overseas to get

such  preferential treatment and admission?  I  hope  the

Minister can clarify on this issue.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong Seh Hong, you can take your

two cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Madam, we have a good standard of

medical  healthcare in Singapore.  This is  in  no  small

part   due   to   the   hard  work  of   our   healthcare

professionals,  who have a reputation for  excellence  in

the  region.   However, in order to continue  to  be  the

regional hub for medical excellence, and in our push  for

the  life  sciences,  we must have a  long-term  plan  to

develop the human capital needed for this sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While training to be doctors, medical students are

exposed  to  new developments in clinical  education  and

medical  research.  I am sure everyone here  would  agree

that  future medical doctors armed with knowledge of  the

latest developments in their field of study would  be  of

great benefit to their patients.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I note that the report on the university

sector  recommended  the setting up of  Graduate  Medical

Programme (GMP) leading to the MD degree, and the  School

of  Health Sciences (SHS) at the Outram campus, while the

Medical School training MBBS doctors would remain at  NUS

Kent Ridge.  May I ask the Minister what is the rationale

of separating the Medical School from GMP and SHS?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the Ministry ensure that institutions that

primarily  train  doctors,  nurses  and  therapists   for

clinical  care, and institutions that focus primarily  on

research,  are  working together in  close  synergy?   By

working   together  closely,  there   would   be   cross-fertilisation  of ideas.  Clinicians are exposed  to  the

latest development in research, while the researchers are

exposed to the clinical challenges and problems faced  by

their   counterparts.   They  could  then  work   closely

together  to  apply research findings on the patients  or

conduct  clinical  trials  or  research  together.   Some

clinicians may also be enticed to become researchers, and

vice versa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to know the Ministry's long-term

plan  to  meet the manpower requirements for our  medical

and  life sciences sector.  I would also like to know  if

the  Ministry  would  consider the proposal  to  put  the

Medical  School, the Graduate Medical Programme  and  the

School of Health Sciences together for them to enjoy  the

benefits of synergies and close collaborations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to take my next cut in Mandarin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Madam, the universities and

polytechnics  are  institutes  of  higher  learning  that

nurture the elite of our country and they are the pillars

for   the  future  economic  growth  of  Singapore.   The

emergence of China is an undeniable reality, and it  will

soon  become  the  driving force for the  growth  of  the

global economy. Therefore, we should equip our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



young people so that they can jump on the bandwagon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of mine who is doing his MBA in the London

Business  School sent me an email from London, expressing

his  worries. He said that we are beginning to  lose  our

advantages in China.  The Chinese people look down on our

less-than-satisfactory standard of Chinese,  and they are

catching up on English.  We lack knowledge of the culture

and  the  national situation of China, even the Americans

are doing better than we do in this aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would urge the three universities in

Singapore  to strengthen their teaching and  research  in

China's  social,  business and cultural environment,  and

launch  a  series of courses and subjects to  attain  the

following objects:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) To enhance the university students' proficiency

in  written  and spoken Chinese so that, in future,  when

there are exchanges with our counterparts in China,  they

would be able to write, read and communicate effectively;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) To enhance exchanges with the Chinese

universities and their business community,  and  to  help

our  students  understand China's  social,  cultural  and

business  environment  and the thinking  of  the  Chinese

people; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) To help our students to have a better

understanding of the foreign students from China here, so

that  they  would  not  discriminate  against  them.   In

future,  if our students have the opportunity  to  go  to

China,  they  would  be able to adapt themselves  to  the

environment in China better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Chinese students in Singapore. We

should  take advantage of their presence here to interact

and learn from them, so that they can become a bridge for

our understanding of China.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> The graduate employment outlook

for  this year is bleak.  A recent NUS survey showed that

only 70% of last year's graduates were employed, compared

with  80%  for the same period last year.  NTU  graduates

did

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



better.   78% of NTU's graduates last year were employed,

compared  with  82%  for  the  2001  cohort.   Also,  NTU

graduates  managed to secure better starting salaries,  a

7.3%  difference, compared to NUS graduates.   The  worst

hit   are  the  computer  engineering  graduates.   Their

starting  pay  was less by 15%, compared  to  last  year.

Employment   for  computer  graduates  was   also   badly

affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the situation is not promising for our

graduates,  particularly the NUS graduates  with  general

degrees.   With the MOM's assessment that the job  market

will  continue to remain soft until the end of this year,

we  will  have a lot of frustrated and unhappy  graduates

who  have  no  jobs.   I  hope that  the  Minister  could

enlighten   this   House  whether  this   poor   graduate

employment  situation  is just a  temporary  problem,  or

whether there are more fundamental issues concerning  the

effectiveness of our universities' manpower planning that

needs  to be addressed.  Granted that in most cases,  the

universities  have to plan at least three to  four  years

ahead,  nevertheless, we should not take this as a reason

for  not  ensuring that there is a better  match  between

supply   and   demand  for  graduate  manpower   in   all

disciplines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would also like to know whether the

universities work closely with agencies, such as the EDB,

TDB, IE Singapore, MOM and key industrial players in  its

manpower  planning and in determining  intakes  into  the

universities.   I would also like to seek a clarification

as  to  whether NUS is producing too many general  degree

holders without much reference to the needs of the labour

market as their graduates appear to be worse hit compared

to NTU graduates who hold more professional degrees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in view of the limited opportunities for

securing salaried employment, some of these graduates may

want to look at other means of earning an income, such as

starting  their  own  businesses or being  self-employed.

But having no capital, expertise or much knowledge of the

market  or business that they may be interested in,  they

may need some help

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



and  guidance.  In this regard, I would like  to  suggest

that  the  universities, together with  the  Ministry  of

Education, and perhaps industry players, look into how to

assist  graduates who want to start their own businesses.

They  could  be  channelled to the  appropriate  agencies

linked  up  to  the relevant bodies with  access  to  the

necessary  information,  so  that  they  could  be  self-employed  or start their own small businesses,  and  this

should certainly help to ease up the employment situation

among our graduates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, Nanyang

University  was  established in 1955 in response  to  the

needs of the Chinese speaking community and the awakening

for higher Chinese education. It was a Chinese university

founded  entirely  on funding by the Chinese  people  all

over Southeast Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan donated the

land  for the university site, and every brick and mortar

of the campus was contributed by people from all walks of

life, including trishaw riders, coolies, dance hostesses,

barbers,  merchants, etc, many of them  giving  up  their

life  savings.  I  am  sure all  these  people  who  have

contributed  to  the founding of Nanyang University  will

have a special feeling for the university because it  was

actually  the accumulation of all the blood and sweat  of

the  people and their aspiration.   The establishment  of

Nanyang University shall have an indelible place  in  the

history of education in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of Nanyang University to Singapore

is  not only confined to the academic aspect, but it also

brings about the so-called "Nantah spirit".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its 21 years of existence, Nanyang University has

produced   countless   talents   who   have   contributed

significantly  to  the  fields of economic  construction,

education and politics. In the field of academia, it  has

also enjoyed great reputation all over the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, the Government restructured Nanyang

University  and  the then University  of  Singapore.  The

Nantah campus

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



was  converted  to  the  Nanyang Technological  Institute

(NTI),   which  was  subsequently  upgraded  to   Nanyang

Technological University (NTU).  At present, to cater  to

the  needs  of the time, NTU now offers courses  in  life

sciences,     business    studies,    education,     mass

communications, and not just purely technical courses. It

will   soon  start  an  Arts  Faculty,  to  make   it   a

comprehensive university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is no longer a university that conducts

purely  technological studies, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether he would consider taking out  the  word

"Technological" from the name of the University, and  let

this   comprehensive  university  be  known  as  "Nanyang

University".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the old Nanyang and the new Nanyang are

different  but  since   this new  Nanyang  University  is

standing  on the site of the old Nanyang University,  let

it  inherit  the  Nantah blood and spirit,  so  that  the

Nantah  spirit  of "constantly striving to  be  stronger,

vigorously  contending  to  improve,  and  self-reliance"

continues  to be manifested.  At the same time,  it  will

continue  to groom and nurture the Chinese elites.  Apart

from  preserving the good Chinese culture and traditions,

the  spirit  could  also be used to respect  our   multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural beliefs and to

promote greater social cohesion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Madam, allow me to make some general comments regarding

higher  education before replying to some specific points

raised by Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, currently, a strong and diverse post-secondary sector comprising ITE, Nanyang Academy of Fine

Arts,  LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts, polytechnics  and

universities.  I thank Dr Michael Lim for sharing with us

the   wonderful  feedback  he  has  got   on   Ngee   Ann

Polytechnic.   Indeed,  we  do  get  very  good  feedback

regarding our polytechnics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our institutions of higher learning offer an array

of academic and technical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



options to students.  Despite this economic downturn, the

fears  which  have been highlighted by Mdm  Halimah,  our

institutes of higher learning continue to be relevant and

responsive to our long-term economic and social goals for

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked whether MOE consults other

agencies and, indeed, we do.  We do it in the context  of

the  National Manpower Council, and a number of agencies,

including MTI, MOE, EDB, and other agencies sit together.

Our manpower projections indicate that in 2010, the types

of  jobs  required will require 65% of our  workforce  to

have  post-secondary  qualifications.  The  corresponding

figure  at  present  is only 39%.  We  must  continue  to

educate  our  population. We should  not  be  myopic  and

wrongly   conclude  from  this  current   slowdown   that

education  will count less in the future.   I  understand

Mdm Halimah's concern which was also expressed by Dr Wang

Kai  Yuen  about the employability of tertiary graduates.

But  an educational cache will outlast this recession and

pay   dividends   later.   Therefore,   to   meet   these

challenges,  the  post-secondary  sector  will  need   to

sustain its quality, achieve greater diversity and expand

educational opportunities.  My Ministry will press on and

improve  on  all  sectors related to  the  post-secondary

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, many Members took up the Minister's

invitation to visit ITE and many of you had expressed the

admiration  following  that visit.   You  have  seen  for

yourselves    the   quality   of   the    training    and

infrastructure.  But  ITE will  not  be  resting  on  its

laurels.   For  its next phase of development,  ITE  will

regroup  its  current  10 campuses  into  three  regional

campuses over the next 15 years. The larger campuses will

be  able  to  offer a full range of courses  and  provide

cross-disciplinary training.  The Government will  invest

a  total of $800 million, excluding land cost, to develop

three  regional campuses. As the Minister has  said,  our

fifth  polytechnic, the Republic Polytechnic,  will  open

its  doors  this year. Besides increasing capacity,  this

institution will offer more choices

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



to those who wish to pursue a polytechnic education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, the Government has provided funding to

Nanyang  Academy of Fine Arts and LaSalle-SIA College  of

the  Arts  to develop their strengths in the western  and

contemporary  visual  arts and traditional  eastern  arts

respectively.   Both  institutions  are  currently  being

redeveloped  and  are  expected to move  into  their  new

campuses in 2004 and 2006 respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arts institutions - the recommendations for

NTU  to  have a school of design, media and arts  -  will

train the creative and artistic manpower to fuel and fill

the  growth  of the creative industry, as recommended  by

the  ERC.  Similarly, the university sector will continue

in its efforts to improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the comments and queries raised

by   several  Members  on  my  Committee's  proposal   to

restructure our university sector.  Members will  have  a

sense  of the contrasting views expressed by Dr Amy  Khor

on  one side, and Dr Ong Seh Hong and Dr Wang Kai Yuen on

the  other  side, that there is a delicate  balance,  and

indeed, a tension, that exists between quality, expansion

and quantity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor has asked whether the targeted

university  cohort participation of 25%  is  the  correct

number.  Our dictum and premium on this, which perhaps is

apt for her coming from the property sector, continue  to

be quality, quality, quality.  We begin with this premise

that  any  expansion to the university  sector  must  not

dilute  present standards in Singapore.  Indeed, wherever

possible,  quality  should  be  enhanced.  The  proximate

indicators,  such  as  entry  scores  at  'A'  level   or

polytechnic students' results and their 'O' level  grades

indicate  that  we  can still maintain  standards  as  we

expand to 25%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us make no mistake, as was assumed by Dr

Wang  Kai  Yuen,  we would not be reluctant  to  decrease

cohort  participation rate if standards fall.   MOE  will

continue to monitor the attri-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>

tion  rate  that  Dr Ong spoke about,  grades  and  other

outcome   indicators,  even  as  we  expand  the   cohort

participation rate.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Dr Ong Seh  Ong

are,  therefore, rightly concerned with the standards  of

our graduates, and how competitive they will be, even  as

we  expand  our university intake to 25%, and  what  that

does to the overall quality of our university sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall the Committee, and they have

alluded  to it, chaired by Senior Minister of  State,  Mr

Peter  Chen,  to  review upgrading opportunities  at  the

degree level.  It was an important and useful study which

highlighted that there exists a sufficiently  large  pool

of  good  quality  students  to  sustain  a  high-quality

university education at the 25% cohort participation rate

(CPR).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my University Sector Review Committee concurs

with  this recommendation.  From 1995-2000, there  was  a

steady  rise  in  the  'A' level performance  of  our  JC

students. At the same time, our polytechnic students,  as

highlighted  by  Mr  Zainudin Nordin,  also  improved  in

academic quality.  The number of 'O' level students,  who

are  eligible for admission into the Junior Colleges  but

opted  to  go to the polytechnics, increased  from  about

3,600 to 3,900.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen's Committee then recommended that

proportionately, more polytechnic good students could  be

admitted to our universities.  In terms of basic academic

quality,  the group of 3,900 students who could enter  JC

but  chose polytechnic education would be similar to  our

typical JC cohort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin Nordin has asked how far our proposed

expansion  addresses  these  aspirations  of  polytechnic

graduates.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen has also similarly expressed

this view. Arising from Mr Chen's Committee proposal,  we

anticipate  that the proportion of polytechnic  graduates

admitted  into our universities will increase  three-fold

after  the  restructuring of the university sector.    As

for  working  adults, our universities will  continue  to

offer degree upgrading

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



opportunities  through continuing education  as  well  as

full-time study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concerns about our

proposed  restructuring  of this  present  Committee,  as

recommended by the present Committee. Dr Amy  Khor  asked

about   the  pros  and  cons  of  setting  up  a   fourth

university, as contrasted to our present proposal.  These

questions  were  also asked by Dr Wang Kai  Yuen  and  Mr

Iswaran.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth university was a mode suggested by Mr

Chen's Committee to accommodate that expansion.  Perhaps,

the  two  different Committees were bred under  different

circumstances   and,   therefore,   presented   different

options.   In  particular,  my  Committee  conducted  its

review  in lean times, and we were also concerned  as  to

how  stakeholders  would  accept the  fourth  university.

This  new  entity  would be without  the  benefit  of  an

established  name  or  track  record.   Even   when   the

students,  by  all  indicators,  will  be  of  equivalent

standard  to  those  entering existing  universities,  my

Committee feared that it will take a long time to achieve

equal  acceptance compared to existing universities among

students,  parents,  the  academic  community  and,  more

importantly, the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not also forget that unlike and indeed

perhaps similar to broadcast channels, the new university

not  only competes with our public universities but  also

with  foreign universities that have already  established

their   presence  here  or  in  their  parent   campuses.

Substantial  resources  will  be  required  to   overcome

prejudices inherently against fledgling institutions.  We

felt  that those resources will yield greater results  if

we  leverage  on  the  excellent reputation  of  existing

universities.   It was not, as Dr Amy Khor  implied,  for

cost-cutting  reasons that we propose this structure.  We

therefore  propose that NTU expand into  a  comprehensive

university with greater complement of disciplines to take

in more students. This will extend NTU's capabilities and

provide a broader and more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



comprehensive undergraduate education to its students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS will expand into a multi-campus university, with

two additional national institutions specialising in Life

Sciences,   and  a  second  in  Science  and  Technology.

Members, including Mr Iswaran and Dr Wang Kai Yuen,  have

expressed  concerns  whether  this  multi-campus  concept

would  lead  to  diversity. They  have  asked  about  the

governance structures and what it means to be autonomous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these institutions will allow for greater

diversity, because of the way we will position  both  the

expertise,  the complement of students and  the  type  of

faculty   we   will  admit.  We  will  create  governance

structures  so  that they will have a certain  degree  of

autonomy to be able to meet this objective.  But I  agree

with Members that implementation details are important to

allow us to reach that objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We presented these views to both the academia and

the  industries, and to certain focus groups of students.

These  proposals were warmly endorsed by  the  Presidents

and  the  academics  of  NUS and NTU.   Many  polytechnic

students  also  welcome this proposal as  they  too  have

concerns regarding the image and acceptance of the fourth

university concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin Nordin has asked whether NTU will gain

momentum from the proposed changes or slide back.  I must

say  that  since  the proposals were  released,  NTU  has

responded to these proposals with a relish and enthusiasm

of  a  dolphin  thrown into a bigger lake.   How  far  it

succeeds,  of course, will ultimately depend on  how  NTU

can  exploit  the  new possibilities as it  broadens  its

educational provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin Nordin has also proposed that NTU find a

new  name to reflect its identity, and this view was also

shared  by  Mr  Ang Mong Seng.  I thank Mr  Ang  for  the

description  of  the  Nantah spirit  and  the  historical

evolution.  I could feel the resonance when he retold the

story.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



Indeed,  the  Nantah spirit lives in many people  and  in

many forms as we see it today.  I also thank him that  he

agrees that NTU today, because of its transformation, has

changed  dramatically,  and is very  different  from  the

previous Nantah, and it has served it well.  However, the

issue  of  naming  is  really  linked  to  what  kind  of

university the NTU aspires to be.  This is something that

should  be  decided  by  NTU,  the  NTU  community,   the

students, the Alumni, and the faculty as a whole.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong has asked why we are separating the existing

medical  school  from the new provisions of  Medical  and

Allied  Health Science Education at NUS (Outram).   There

are  several reasons.  First, the current medical  school

is  quite large by international standards, and any scope

of   future  expansion  will  be  limited.   Second,  the

proposed   graduate  medical  programme   will   have   a

curriculum   distinct  from  the  present   undergraduate

medical  course.  A distinctive GMP teaching  methodology

will  inject  greater diversity into  our  local  medical

training  and,  in  the longer term,  the  local  medical

profession.   This,  we felt, was best  achieved  by  the

setting up of an institution separate and independent  of

the MBBS programme currently offered by NUS (Kent Ridge).

Third,  as  he  rightly alluded to, the  involvement  and

close proximity of the Singapore General Hospital to  NUS

(Outram)  will allow the programme to leverage  on  SGH's

considerable clinical expertise for teaching, as well  as

for the School of Health Sciences.  This would foster and

spur  more  translational  and patient-oriented  research

that  is  essential  for both healthcare  needs  and  the

nation's  biomedical  science  initiatives.   This   will

complement and synergise with the parallel development of

the Biopolis.  I also want to point out that they will be

offering  diversity  and there will  be  the  element  of

competition  with one another.  The GMP and the  existing

NUS  undergraduate programmes could still complement  and

enhance  each other even if they are housed  in  separate

places.  There must

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



be  inter-campus connectivity for students and  faculties

within the multi-campus university structure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have raised queries regarding university

admission system and other aspects relating to design and

staffing.   Mr  Zainudin has recommended  that  staff  be

allowed to take breaks and other appointments which  will

gear  them better to teach.  Mr Iswaran has commented  on

what  the  proposals for the new tenure and  compensation

schemes would be.  Dr Amy Khor has commented on the ratio

of local and foreign staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, NUS has formed a task force to examine the

issues   relating   to  possible  enhancements   to   the

university's policies on tenure and compensation.  One of

the  primary issues the task force is looking at  is  how

best  to  provide  for more options for  faculty,  as  Mr

Zainudin  has suggested, to exercise greater  flexibility

and   freedom  to  faculty  members  to  pursue   various

activities during the off-season months, after they  have

fulfilled  their  teaching and research responsibilities.

The  task  force  is  due to submit  its  report  to  NUS

management  only  by  July  2003.   At  this   point,   I

understand  the issues are being floated for  exploration

and discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of local and foreign staff, in both

universities, NUS and NTU combined, there are about 1,600

Singapore  citizens and PR staff and about 1,000  foreign

staff members.  We are quite neutral in terms of both the

weightage  and spread.  I think what is important  is  to

have a mixture so that the students can benefit from  the

diversity of faculty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether NTU and NUS have adequate applied

research  and  practical  aspects  and  nexus  with   the

industry,  the  Ministry broadly is  now  moving  towards

establishing  systems for output and outcome  indicators,

as  well  as not only measuring input levels.   In  other

words,  we  want to move the universities to  measure  by

themselves  and to engage the stakeholders, whether  they

are  graduates, industry or employers, for themselves  to

get a sense of how they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



doing,  vis-a-vis the stakeholders, and  thereby  respond

adequately to the signals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I thank Dr Ong for moving the cut to add to

our  budget.   I  would endorse his cut  and  relay  that

sentiment  to the Ministry and the Minister for  Finance.

I  am  heartened  that  a number of Members  have  voiced

support  for  the  findings  of  my  Committee.   If  the

Government accepts the recommendations, it would  be  the

start  of another exciting phase of development  for  our

universities.  If we succeed, and I believe we shall, our

universities will truly be Singapore's strategic  assets,

fulfilling  the  objective of human  capital  development

through  education,  ideas and  wealth  creation  through

research  and  international  branding  to  entrench  our

repute as a keynote in the global education landscape.  I

will address other issues on university education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong has asked how our universities are preparing

our  graduates  to ride on China's economic  growth.   We

agree that this is an important development that we  must

address.  A number of initiatives are already underway at

the  tertiary level to strengthen the awareness of  young

Singaporeans about China and China-related issues.  These

include  an exchange programme for outstanding university

students  between PRC and Singapore, which would commence

this year.  Each year, 50 outstanding university students

from  each  country would be selected to  participate  in

that  programme.  During their two weeks  in  China,  our

students  would have the opportunities to  interact  with

Chinese  leaders, officials, academics and students  from

top Chinese universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS is also developing a China initiative to enhance

our  students' appreciation and understanding  of  China.

This initiative includes dual degree programmes with  top

institutions   like   Beijing   University   and   Xinhua

University,   student  exchanges  with  leading   Chinese

universities,  a satellite campus in China and  extensive

research collaborations.  NTU is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



also  moving  in  that same direction.  It  has  recently

entered  into  partnership with the  Shanghai  Qiao  Dong

University  to  offer MBA programmes.   To  complete  the

picture, the polytechnics are also getting into the game.

On  their  part,  they will conduct  basic  and  business

Mandarin  classes, as well as modules on Chinese history,

culture  and  development in Mandarin.  They  also  offer

overseas   industrial  training  programmes  in   various

Chinese  universities and companies  and  staff  exchange

programmes.   And,  if you heard Dr  Michael  Lim,  these

efforts  have  already been paying dividends.   ITE  gets

into  the  act as well.  It conducts overseas attachments

for  its  students and staff and will be  introducing  an

elective Business Mandarin from this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also spoke on the role of our universities in

training  our  Chinese professionals.   Our  universities

would  continue  to  take  on this  role.   In  NUS,  the

Department  of  Chinese  Studies  offers  more  than   50

undergraduate  courses  in five  major  areas  of  study,

namely,  Chinese Linguistics, Chinese Literature, Chinese

History,   Chinese  Philosophy  and  Translation.    This

department  also  offers PhDs and Masters  programmes  in

Chinese  studies.  NTU - Mr Ang Mong Seng has touched  on

that  -  has  a Centre for Chinese Language and  Culture,

which  conducts general courses in Chinese  language  and

culture,  plans  the implementation of minor  degree  and

post-graduate degree programmes in Chinese, and  conducts

research.   In  addition, since July 2001, NIE  has  been

offering  the  Bachelor  of Arts  Education  for  Chinese

Language  and Literature specialisation.  The  course  is

established specifically to train the teaching of Chinese

Language  at  the  primary school  level.   The  proposed

School  of  Humanities and Social Sciences for  NTU  will

complement this initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Chia for his altruistic call because he

said that from his personal experience, he felt that  NUS

favours  or  admits non-Singaporeans to the MBA  courses.

He  has brought up this point so that others like him, in

his words, "former

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



union  President and NCMP will not suffer"  -  a  similar

fate,  I  presume.  Madam, entry to the NUS MBA programme

is highly competitive.  It is rated as one of the top MBA

programmes   in  Asia.   The  general  requirements   for

admission are a good undergraduate degree with  a  strong

academic record, relevant working experience and,  as  he

has  rightly  pointed  out,  a  good  General  Management

Admission Test (GMAT).  All entrants, I presume, have  to

meet these standards.  Last year, when he applied, it was

not  quite  a  lot of foreigners.  It was about  28  non-Singaporeans,  to  be exact, that were admitted  to  this

course,  and  that formed about 30% of  the  intake.   In

other words, the majority of 70% were Singaporeans.  This

figure  of  30%  is quite normal for MBA programmes  and,

indeed, many hundreds of Singaporeans who themselves  are

foreign  students attending MBA courses  in  UK  and  USA

yearly  will  tell you that business schools have  higher

rates  of  foreign  participation  to  achieve  a  strong

international  flavour and to allow  networking.   It  is

this  very  diversity of talented people that  makes  MBA

programmes attractive and successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am puzzled by one aspect, because I do not

understand why Mr Chia is upset with the foreign students

who  got into the MBA course.  I can understand him,  and

empathise,  if he is upset that his undergraduate  degree

did   not  meet  admission  requirements.   I  can   also

understand  if  he  is upset that being  a  former  union

President  and  NCMP  did not count  enough  as  relevant

working  experience,  even though it  clearly  shows  his

leadership qualities.  He did not tell us if he  met  the

GMAT  standards.   But,  even  if  he  did  not,  I   can

understand why he would be upset, as this may  not  be  a

singular measure of MBA material.  But, Madam, why should

he  be upset with foreigners?  Members will remember that

Mr  Chia had also spoken against Contact Singapore trying

to  recruit  foreign talents to Singapore to improve  our

competitiveness.  Madam, Mr Chia's xenophobia,  like  all

phobias, is irrational, misplaced and unjustified.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants for this MBA course are selected by

merit.  So, even if the class had no foreigners, in other

words,   they   were  all  Singaporeans,  the   admission

standards would still have to be fulfilled.  I hope  that

he   is  not  implying  that  an  NCMP  should  be  given

preference over others.  Indeed, Mr Chia did not get into

the  course  not  because of foreigners, but  because  of

Singaporeans  with better qualifications.   But  Mr  Chia

should not be upset with these Singaporeans who got  into

the  MBA  class and displaced him.  To be fair  to  them,

they  could  not have prior knowledge that he,  a  former

union   President  and  NCMP,  was  also  applying   that

particular year.  If they did, I am sure they would  have

deferred.   But as the Ministry that encourages  lifelong

learning,  I  would encourage Mr Chia not to lose  heart.

There are many other MBA courses in Singapore that he can

apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note Dr Teo Ho Pin's suggestion to convert NUS'

Bachelor   of   Science  (Building)  to  a  Bachelor   of

Engineering  (Facilities  Management)  course.   We  will

relay the suggestion to the appropriate faculty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to address Mr Inderjit's earlier

suggestion to encourage local distance learning providers

to become full universities.  We agree.  My Committee did

agree  that private universities in Singapore be  allowed

to complement the 25% CPR provided by our three publicly-funded  universities.  So if SIM feels  that  they  would

like to expand their cohort, they are free to do so.   We

agree  with him and Dr Amy Khor's point that the  private

universities'  presence  can enhance  the  diversity  and

competition within this sector.  However, to maintain our

reputation  as  a  premium educational hub,  any  private

university wishing to establish itself in Singapore  must

be one of high quality and high international standing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Madam, point of

clarification.  First of all, I am expressing  a  concern

about admission and not that I am upset.  So I would very

much  appreciate the Minister for not putting words  into

my mouth and saying that I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



am  upset.  The other point is I am not xenophobic  about

foreigners coming to study in Singapore, but rather  when

I called up and asked about the criteria for admission, I

was  told  over the phone that it was because there  were

many foreigners who applied and there was no space for us

-  it is not so much that I applied - and so Singaporeans

do not get to go in for that matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Madam, I am quite heartened to hear

that  Mr  Chia is not upset.  That makes my  job  in  the

Ministry that encourages lifelong learning easier.  As to

the  comment  that  he  was  told  that  many  foreigners

applied, that is a generic point.  But, really the  point

is that he did not get into it because other Singaporeans

with adequate qualifications did.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Madam, what shapes society? I

believe it is ultimately the underlying value system that

determines the shape and future of our society.  Hence, I

ask, what then is the value system embraced by our future

leaders today?  Answer: the onslaught of popular culture,

more  than any single force in the form of music, movies,

television,  reality  shows,  etc,  predominates  as   an

influential agent that moulds the character,  values  and

beliefs  of  the  audience, particularly  the  young  and

impressionable   minds.    With   technology   and   keen

competition,  production  becomes  an  extension  of  the

creator's  pontifications  of  truths  and  values   that

stretches  beyond  the  imaginable but,  through  skilful

juxtaposition,  portrays  them  in  realistic  light   to

impress  and  make  believe.   Over  a  period  of  time,

impressionable minds do believe.  Shows like  "Temptation

Island"  and  "Bachelor", songs  like,  "Cleaning  Up  My

Closet" by Eminent or "Biscuits, Chocolate, Starfish" all

have the effect of transcending matters of importance  to

a  point of desacralising almost everything.  Other shows

teach  selfishness and to each his own.  In  short,  over

time,  the  influence  of  popular  culture  may  corrode

society's  sense of morality and values, if  it  has  not

already done so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this modern age of cable channels and the

Internet,  we cannot stop the onslaught of the media  and

popular  culture.  We can, however, imbue in our young  a

strong  foundation of value system through our  education

system,  so  that they will be able to make  sound  value

judgments.   Values  like  care  and  share,  values   of

morality and filial piety, values like frugality and hard

work,  values like respect for the elderly and  authority

-   they are all pillars of our society.  Obviously, this

responsibility  falls on all shoulders  of  society,  but

schools do have a big role to play, as our children spend

a  big  part of their time in school.  I am heartened  to

know  that  schools do have school mottoes  that  expound

certain  values,  but I am mindful that the  emphasis  on

academic  excellence does not overwhelm  these  important

pillars of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, our young today will be the driving force of

tomorrow.   Given  the  more than 100  cases  of  teenage

abortions  per month, young drug offenders and  spotlight

on  juvenile  delinquency, I am  afraid  that  unless  we

quickly immunise, not insulate, our young, we will have a

society of questionable values and behaviour.  May I  ask

the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the state of our moral and value education

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How much emphasis is given to moral and value

education in terms of hours in the time table and  method

of teaching?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is the Ministry's stand on using moral

education hours for revisions and catch-ups of examinable

or academic subjects when the need arises?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Has MOE any plans to step up on values and moral

education?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am anxious about the shape of our future to

come.   In the light of the pending war, let me quote  Dr

Viktor  Frankl,  a  renowned psychologist,  who  survived

Auschwitz:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am convinced that the gas chambers of Auschwitz,

Treblinka  and Maidanek were ultimately prepared  not  in

some ministry or other in Berlin, but rather at the desks

and  in  the  lecture halls of nihilistic scientists  and

philosophers.'



In  other words, if Dr Viktor Frankl was right,  then  it

might  be worthwhile to remind ourselves that the impetus

for  the  Holocaust did not come from a military strategy

as  much as it did from the educated elite, unblushing in

their philosophies, on mankind.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, I would

like  to  speak  on   character development.   Under  our

educational  system, every effort has been  made  through

our   co-curricular  activities  (CCAs)  to  develop  the

character of our students.  But what worries me  is  that

co-curricular activities are not compulsory.    How  does

the MOE ensure that a character development programme  is

implemented  in  the  schools?  We  should  attach  equal

weightage  to academic and character development.   Equal

emphasis  should  be  given  to  these  two  aspects   of

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is character development so important? At this

time  of economic downturn, and with the world in such  a

state  of instability and uncertainty, we should  develop

the  character  of our students so that they  would  have

enough courage and perseverance to face adversity.   This

kind  of courage and perseverance cannot be learned  from

the  textbooks.  It has to be cultivated through  various

team activities, physical education and some of the CCAs.

We   need   to  enhance  the  students'  self-discipline,

constantly striving to improve themselves and to be self-reliant.   They should learn to sacrifice their  personal

interests  for  larger objectives, to put  nation  before

self, to build up team spirit and to nurture the love for

labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our homes today, we have domestic maids to take

care  of  all the household chores, and we have  imported

hundreds   of   thousands  of  foreign   workers.    Many

Singaporeans  feel that we should not be  doing  all  the

manual  work.   This type of attitude is wrong.  We  must

cultivate the right attitude for labour in our students.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



We  must also cultivate our students to be curious, to be

inquisitive  and  to  be  eager  to  learn.   All   these

attributes  can be cultivated through mass  participation

in various team activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be a joint effort among the

Government,  society, schools and the families.   In  our

South  West CDC, our Youth and Sports Committee  and  the

Family  and  Children Committee have  been  working  very

closely   with   the   schools  and   voluntary   welfare

organisations in our area.  We want to share our  limited

resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also consider using mother tongue to teach

moral education.  When I was in secondary school, I  read

the  Zhengqi  Ge (Song of Righteousness) written  by  the

great  patriotic  poet, Wen Tianxiang.  It  left  a  very

profound impression in my mind. At that time, I asked  my

father  if  I  had  to  face a situation  like  what  Wen

Tianxiang was facing, should I die or should I surrender?

My  father  said  that  I should choose  to  die.   These

touching  stories of great people in history  are  deeply

rooted  in  our minds, even decades later.  If our  young

people  could be exposed to all these classics, it  would

help   them  to  make  sound  judgement  and  well-guided

decisions in critical times.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Madam, as we strive for academic

excellence, we must not lose sight of the need  to  mould

the  character of our children, especially  during  their

formative  years.  I would like to ask  the  Minister  to

elaborate  on  the  Ministry's  effort  in  building  and

strengthening  the character of our students.   What  are

the  Ministry's  programmes?  How are  the  progress  and

achievement  of these programmes monitored and  measured?

And  how are our teachers prepared and trained to deliver

the subject?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, three aspects of character development are of

great   importance   -  the  right  value   system,   the

leadership quality and the strive for excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on right value system. We must impart the

right value system to the next

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



generation.  We must teach them to know right from wrong,

to   be  responsible,  to  be  accountable  and,  equally

important,  to be caring.  These are basic  qualities  of

humanity.  Without them, our children will grow up to  be

a liability rather than an asset to our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, leadership quality. Some day, we will hand

over  to  our  children  the future  of  our  nation  and

ourselves.  It is therefore crucial that we must  develop

the leadership quality in our children. We must inculcate

in  them the adventure and pioneering spirit, so that  we

can  produce great leaders in politics, in business,  the

academia and in the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, strive for excellence. We must develop in

our  children the desire to learn, the desire to  improve

and  the  desire  to  excel.  They  must  not  be  easily

contented  with  themselves.  They  must  adopt  lifelong

learning as part of their lifestyle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate

how  these subjects are taught in the schools.   I  would

also  like  to  urge  the Ministry  to  explore  ways  to

encourage     greater    participation    of    community

organisations and voluntary welfare organisations in  the

programme, as it will inject greater professionalism  and

realism.   We should also develop programmes  that  would

involve  parents, as character building is not a job  for

the  school  alone.  Parents must also feel  a  sense  of

ownership  of  the  challenge.   We  must  place  greater

emphasis on character building as part of the curriculum.

It is a need to have subject, not a good to have subject.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Madam, the Ministry's

mission statement states, amongst other things:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'to bring out the best in our young by developing

them   into   useful  and  responsible  individuals   and

citizens.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character development among students is the

responsibility  of  (a)  the  student  himself;  (b)  the

parents  and family members of the student; (c) his  peer

groups;  and (d) the teachers of the student.  Could  the

Minister  tell us what are the programmes, if any,  being

conducted   for   character  development   of   students,

qualities   such   as   honesty,   integrity,   kindness,

graciousness,  loyalty  and  generosity?   Do   we   have

programmes  to  groom our children to  be  gentlemen  and

ladies, eg, on social graces like table manners,  how  to

conduct  decent conversation between students and adults,

boys  and girls, for higher secondary and junior  college

or  polytechnic students, and also issues on romance  and

sexual  matters?   Should our students be  encouraged  to

sing,  dance, try out public speaking and participate  in

drama  and  debates?   How  about  encouragement  in  the

learning  of languages to create the Singapore  character

of  our  students,  like  learning  Malay,  Mandarin  and

dialects,  Indian languages, including  Tamil  and  other

dialects?   How  about languages of ASEAN countries  like

Thai,  Vietnamese,  Tagalog, etc, to get  to  know  ASEAN

languages  and  cultures, so that we have  a  variety  of

options?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there programmes in place for character

development  dealing  with ethical and  moral  values  on

criminal laws, so that they would know what our standards

of behaviour should be in life, and of right and wrong on

financial matters, including value of money, respect  for

acquisition of wealth honestly and through hard work?  Do

we  have  classes  for character development  which  will

improve their responsibility and duties at home to  carry

out  household  work  and responsibilities,  cooking  and

cleaning  of  homes, gardening, etc, duties, respect  and

care  for  the  elderly, their parents  and  grandparents

especially,  duty  to  care for the less  privileged  and

sick,  and duty to protect and care for animals?  If  all

the  above  programmes are available  or,  in  some  way,

enhanced,  our children would be good citizens with  good

character,  and  that will be good for Singapore  in  the

long term.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Madam, the National Education

Programme  (NEP)  is  also  an  important  part  of   our

curriculum. Through the NEP, we endeavour to inculcate  a

sense  of belonging, a sense of ownership and a sense  of

responsibility towards the nation.  Through the  NEP,  we

cultivate  a  desire for peace and harmony  in  a  multi-racial  and multi-religious society.  The NEP  is  a  key

instrument  through which we create a  national  identity

among the young Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would like to ask the Minister

to  elaborate on the NEP programme.  How is  the  subject

delivered  in  the schools?  Has our method  of  delivery

been  effective?  It is good to have a comprehensive  NEP

programme.   But if the delivery process is  ineffective,

the  efforts  would  be in vain.  How  are  the  teachers

trained  to  deliver  the subject?  The  NIE  would  have

included  this  in the teachers' training.   But  is  the

training appropriate and adequate?  How do we measure the

effectiveness and achievements of the NEP?   The  success

of  the  programme must be measured against  the  desired

outcomes.   Are  there benchmarks and how  well  have  we

achieved our objective?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also be grateful if the Minister would let

us know whether there are plans to revise the NEP to take

into  account recent events and issues, such as terrorism

and  international relations.  While NEP is not  part  of

the  core subjects, we must not take the subject lightly.

The  effectiveness of the NEP will determine  whether  we

will succeed in developing a strong and cohesive people.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Madam, in the dialogue sessions

conducted  by  the Feedback Unit on social cohesion,  the

issue  of  racial  interaction among our  children  is  a

recurrent theme. Participants are concerned with  how  to

inculcate  tolerance and understanding  of  each  other's

cultures and habits in our young.  In fact, some of  them

do  not  like  the word "tolerance".  Tolerance  connotes

something that it cannot be helped with.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>



prefer  the word "acceptance".  Acceptance is  a  two-way

street.   It  is not just for the majority to  understand

the  culture and the values of the minority, but also for

the  minority  to appreciate the need to give  and  take.

Living in a multi-racial society, we must learn to accept

the  culture and habits of our neighbours which could  be

very different from our own.  To achieve this, most of us

will  agree that interaction among our young is the  best

approach.   Ideally,  all our children  should  have  the

opportunity  to intermingle with children  of  the  other

races while growing up - play together, eat together from

young.   In  that  way, there is little  opportunity  for

extremist views to take root.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, currently, the racial composition in many of

our  schools  does not reflect the racial composition  of

our  population.  Thus, there is a need to find  ways  to

force   a  greater  interaction  among  our  pupils   and

students.   I  believe  one of  the  best  approaches  is

through  sports,  such as soccer  and  hockey.   I  would

suggest that MOE explore organising regular sports meets,

perhaps with the Community Development Councils, so  that

children have greater opportunity to interact.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Madam, I am concerned,

like Dr Gan and Dr Wang, with how students relate to each

other  in schools.  I am aware that the Ministry has  got

its   National  Education  Programme,  civic  and   moral

education  programme, social studies, etc,  in  place  to

ensure  that  there  is some kind of discussion  on  this

topic.   The  Ministry has also proactively  set  up  the

Committee on Strengthening Racial Harmony and with  that,

we   have   initiatives  like  Racial  Harmony  Day   and

International Friendship Day; and research,  exhibitions,

performances  of  a  high standard.  They  are  all  good

measures that have been put in place.  However, today,  I

would  like  to  raise  this question  of  whether  these

measures  are adequate enough, the same concern expressed

by  Mr Gan.  How does the Ministry ensure that these  are

not   just  cosmetic  endeavours  and  that  we  are  not

scrapping the surface, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



going  deeper into the psyche of the students  to  ensure

that  there is some kind of realistic acceptance of  each

other's cultural differences?  Like Mr Gan, I would  also

like  to ask the Ministry how are teachers sensitised  to

these  ethnic differences that we have, and what are  the

coping  strategies that they can employ in  dealing  with

parents or children who display such behaviours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instilling values takes a long time, and I think

principals   play  the  primary  role  in  this   aspect.

However,  I  do wonder whether the Ministry's  policy  of

rotating  principals  every five years  runs  counter  to

giving  it  enough time to instill a good  value  system,

especially  in this area.  Perhaps, this is something  to

think about, again, over here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask whether it is time to introduce

within  the  National Education Programme a component  on

multiculturism, bearing in mind that one in four students

here is a foreigner and moving overseas will also be part

of  the  entrepreneurship drive.  I think it is important

for  Singaporeans to know that there are  other  cultural

differences beyond our shores.  Lest you think that I  am

exaggerating  on this aspect of discontent  -  to  use  a

milder  term  perhaps  - let me  cite  the  work  of  two

academics which was posted on the IPS website ---

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Braema, you would have to wrap up.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> I am winding up. The

academics,  both  NIE  lecturers,  have  done   work   on

secondary  and  primary school social inter-relationship.

I appeal to the Ministry that if they do not already have

this  document, to look at the document.  I  end  off  by

just citing this example.  A Malay student says that  the

form  teacher  in  teaching  him  Mathematics  does   the

explanation in Chinese.  This is anecdotal.   But  if  we

have  come to this stage, I think it is beyond skin  deep

and we have to look deeper into it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the Ministry's

Desired Outcomes include,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



amongst  other things that our young would be  respectful

of  family,  community and country; and be  citizens  who

believe   in   our  principles  of  multi-racialism   and

meritocracy.  Does the Ministry have programmes to  bring

about an ideal environment for social cohesion, including

racial  and  religious integration?   To  appreciate  the

different  ways  of major races, namely, Malay,  Chinese,

Indian,  Eurasian, and also other races in Singapore  and

to respect their different cultures, social and religious

habits and practices, could the Ministry consider greater

social cohesion in primary, secondary, post-secondary and

tertiary institutions by having the following programmes:

(1) from Primary 1 to Primary 6, perhaps, have simple and

basic  classes  on  origins  of  different  races,  their

respective countries, interaction between these countries

with  Singapore,  etc;  (2) visit each other's  homes  to

learn  and  appreciate each other's ways  of  living  and

growing.   Even  better, let them stay  with  each  other

during  weekends  or  during school holidays.   Secondary

schools, junior colleges and polytechnics should  conduct

multi-racial   and  multi-religious  classes   and   have

spiritual and religious-based courses.  This will improve

the  knowledge  and basics of the holy  books,  like  the

Bible,  the  Koran,  Bhaagavad  Gita  and  Ramayana,  and

teachings  of  Buddha,  Taoism and many  other  religious

teachings.   They  should visit religious  and  spiritual

institutions to educate themselves and, perhaps, also the

New Year celebrations of as many races as possible should

be  encouraged amongst the different races and religions,

eg,  Hari  Raya Puasa, Hari Raya Haji, Chinese New  Year,

Deepavali, Christmas, etc.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Madam, earlier I spoke

about stress, and I would now like to talk about sex.   I

know for sure sex is a three letter word.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, the Ministry introduced a new sex education

curriculum  with  the  objective  of  providing  accurate

knowledge  as  well as interpersonal relationship  skills

and  positive attitudes towards sexuality.   One  of  the

issues   of   sex  education  is  whether  the  increased

knowledge will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>



actually  increase  the curiosity  and  sexual  urges  of

teenagers such that they begin to get involved in  sexual

activities.    The  plain  question:  are  more  of   our

teenagers having sex?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we saw figures from MOH on teenage

abortions  and from MCDS on teenage births.   There  were

about 1,500 teenage abortions and 850 teen births a year.

Thus, you have about 2,300-odd cases of teenagers getting

pregnant.  It, however, does not show the extent to which

our  teenagers  are sexually active.  But  these  figures

show  a  slight increasing trend.  This may be  small  by

international standards, but I am sure this is  one  area

that Singapore does not want to be number one in.  Madam,

if  not checked, these young people may not realise  that

they  are jeopardising their future.  Teenage pregnancies

and  births not only affect them medically, but  it  also

affects  them socially and psychologically.  I have  seen

many  cases of teenagers being parents at the age of  16.

They  are still dependent on their parents who are living

and now they have dependants of their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, there is another issue that I am concerned

about.   While the current sexuality education curriculum

covers the nuts and bolts of responsible sexual behaviour

and its related interpersonal relationships, I wonder  to

what extent it addresses the legal implications of sexual

activity amongst teenagers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A social worker of mine had just recently related to

me  a case of a 15-year old boy who was charged with more

than  10 counts of carnal connection.  This means he  was

having  sex with girls whose age was between  14  and  16

years.   He  was not even aware that he was breaking  the

law.   Some do not even know that having sex with a  girl

under  14  is  considered as statutory rape.   So,  often

times,  the effects are tremendous for the youngsters  as

they   not  only  have  to  deal  with  pregnancies   and

abortions,  the boys will have to deal with the  law.   I

would  like  to  urge the Ministry to include  the  legal

aspects of sexual relationship in the sexuality education

curriculum for students in our schools.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister if there have

been   any  studies  looking  at  the  profile  of  these

students.   I know it is hard to detect them because  you

cannot  identify them, but what we can  do  is  to  study

those  who have gotten pregnant and gone for abortion  or

have  given birth.  This will also be a good entry  point

to study the profile of the boys who are sexually active.

If  such  a  study has not been done, I  would  urge  the

Ministry  to  conduct a study for us to really  tailor  a

more targeted preventive education programme for students

who fit such a profile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another related issue is how is sexual education

actually taught in our schools today.  I am very  curious

because  I have got young children.  I want to  know  how

they are taught.  Yes, I know there are VCD, CD-ROM and a

Teacher's Resource in this regard.  But I wonder how does

the  Ministry  ensure  its effectiveness.   What  is  the

desired outcome?  Is it more responsible sexual behaviour

or  preventing  sexual activity amongst teenagers?   What

kind of training do the teachers need to go through to be

prepared to teach such a curriculum?  What proportion  of

the  curriculum time is given to sexual education?   What

has  been the feedback received from students and parents

with  regard to this programme at this time?  I urge  the

Minister  to pay particular attention to sexual education

as our teenagers are actually exposed to a lot more wider

resources on the matter.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Madam, in my MPS cases, I have

often  come  across parents and students with  regard  to

disciplinary measures imposed on them by schools.  Whilst

I  am  very  heartened by the positive response  of  some

schools  in the treatment of disciplinary cases,  I  have

also  come  across several others where the treatment  of

disciplinary cases can be further improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the notification by principals of schools

that  students are suspended or expelled because of their

recalcitrant behaviour may not be the solution to many of

these  problem cases.  Very often, these cases come  from

dysfunctional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



family  where  there is a lack of parental  control,  ie,

parents are lowly educated and family is poor and  cannot

make ends meet.  Some of these problem case students also

have  history of medical problems.  I have no doubt  that

the  schools would have gone through an array of measures

to  counsel  and discipline and, as a last  resort,  have

taken the approach of suspension or expulsion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a case of a student who has just been

suspended and he was informed that he can only return  to

school  in  May  this year to sit for  his  examinations.

What  is  the  purpose of suspension  in  this  instance?

Without  any  proper guidance and follow-up,  I  doubt  a

dysfunctional family would be able to transform the child

from  now till May for him to go back to school  to  take

his examinations.  Also, what would be the outcome of the

examination  results if he is going to miss  his  lessons

during this period of suspension?  I have written to  the

school  to  appeal  to  the principal  to  reinstate  the

student  after  having counselled  the  student  and  the

mother myself.  The student has agreed to improve on  his

behaviour  and indicated a strong desire to  go  back  to

school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides on the desire of the school to want the

student to go back to school, I have pointed out  to  the

principal  that  the  student's lethargy  during  the  PE

lesson  could be due to the fact that his right  hand  is

slightly handicapped and he may need follow-up on medical

treatment.  My appeal was to no avail.  Very often, these

cases  may not be so bad as to warrant a referral to  the

Social  Service Unit of MCDS.  Nonetheless, they need  to

be professionally managed with time and dedication given.

We  know  that it will be a drain on the school resources

and  the  case  may  have a negative influence  on  other

students.  Despite this point, we should still follow  up

with a dedicated service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose the setting up of a

dedicated follow-up service for principals to refer their

difficult cases

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



for  attention.   This  would ensure  that  students  can

continue  to go back to schools whilst at the  same  time

benefiting  from  the care of the follow-up  service.   I

also  urge  that measures like suspension  and  expulsion

should not be used so readily.  Is there a guideline  for

schools  on  when  they  can  resort  to  measures   like

expulsion  and  suspension?  Are  these  guidelines  made

known  to parents and students?  Since a certain standard

of expectation is required, it is only correct that these

standards  are made clear and known to the  students  and

parents.   In  other words, is there a  due  disciplinary

process that leads to the final decision of suspension or

expulsion?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According to media

reports, during the one-hour Question and Answer session,

following  the Senior Minister's address to the  students

of  the three universities held at NTU, more than half of

those  who  posed questions to the Senior  Minister  were

foreign  students.  The questions asked  by  the  foreign

students  were mainly concerning world or social affairs.

On   the  other  hand,  our  local  students  were   only

interested  in  asking  questions  that  involved   their

personal interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another report, it was stated that the result of

a  survey  revealed  that some 10%  of  the  students  in

Singapore do not know who our Prime Minister was.  As the

future  masters  of the nation, these  young  people  are

seriously lacking in sensitivity and the sense of  crisis

towards matters and the environment around them. This  is

a great cause for concern to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many young people are simply disinterested in

knowing  the  history of our nation building, indifferent

to  politics, and are not concerned at all with the major

world  and national affairs.  This is perhaps due to  the

comfortable and stable social environment that  they  are

living  in  all this while. As it is said, "If everything

is  calm  and peaceful, the people will not be  concerned

with the affairs of the nation."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our situation in the past where survival

was at the top of our mind,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>



we  had  placed too much emphasis on skills training  and

economic  development.  We  have  perhaps  neglected  the

inculcation  of  a  sense of national  consciousness  and

values  in  our  people. If we want our young  people  to

venture  into other countries while remaining emotionally

attached to our country, we should also inculcate in them

the  political  and  national consciousness,  values  and

loyalty  to the nation.  We should enhance our  education

in  these  aspects  so that they can  identify  with  the

nation and be patriotic towards it.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Madam, we all

know  the importance of an all-rounded education and  the

importance   of   physical  education  in   the   overall

development of a child.  Neuroscience research has  shown

that  sports enhance cognition, increase self-esteem  and

confidence, and improve social skills.  The mental  skill

in sports participation teaches a person how to reach his

personal best, regardless of skills in competition level,

and that translates into real life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Mohamad Maliki has mentioned the 6-letter word

"stress".   Sports  also  help  to  reduce  stress.   One

develops fitness and mental toughness through sports, and

learns  about  leadership,  teamwork,  perseverance   and

dedication.   As  we  are  promoting  and  developing  an

entrepreneurial  society, I think  it  is  not  too  far-fetched to say that these are attributes and qualities of

an  entrepreneur that we would like to inculcate  in  our

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I understand that there are three periods of

PE  from  Primary  1 to Primary 3, and two  periods  from

Primary 4 upwards.  Although each period consists  of  30

minutes, after taking away time for changing into PE gear

and  moving from classroom to field, probably the  actual

PE  time left would be less.  We have also often heard of

complaints from students and parents about PE being given

the lowest priority in schools.  Very often, PE is either

given up for remedial classes or for a host of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>



other  reasons.  One example was given in a report today,

in  the 1st and 2nd March 2003 weekend edition, where  it

was  reported  that  PE  was  cancelled  as  a  form   of

punishment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to know how do we compare to

other  developed nations in terms of PE.  Do we  allocate

sufficient  time  and  attention to  PE  in  schools?   I

believe  that  we  should  reaffirm  the  importance  and

priority of PE in schools.  Children should learn to play

a  wide variety of sports in PE, and perhaps fall in love

with  one  or two.  I am in sports!  And they will  enjoy

and  play  for  lifelong enjoyment.  PE should  be  taken

seriously  by schools.  But, at the same time, it  should

be fun for the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related issue, I would like to ask if we have

enough  qualified  PE  teachers to meet  the  demands  of

schools,  and what the intake of PE students is  like  at

NIE.   NIE  has  outstanding facilities and  faculty.   I

would  also like to know whether it has excess  capacity,

so  that others interested in a sports career could  also

learn at NIE.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, by any measure, the Ministry

of  Education's Trim and Fit Programme (TAF) has  been  a

success.  It has resulted in both a reduction of  obesity

among  school  children from 14% in  1992  to  below  10%

today.  It has also increased the level of fitness of pre-enlistees  in the schools.  I have also myself  seen  how

MINDEF's  very effective programme to slim down fat  pre-enlistees  before they begin their BMT  proper  has  also

resulted in much weight loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, as a paediatrician who sees children

referred  for  obesity, I keep hearing from children  who

say  that  they  do not have an outlet for exercise,  and

that  they  have  not  been  selected  for  the  school's

training  programme.   These  children  are  often  obese

because they do not exercise very much.  They do not  get

to compete because, being fat, they cannot run as fast as

their  friends, and so may not even get chosen to  be  on

the  team  for  games, and during recess  time  -  always

pasang during catching!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>



To  drown their sorrows, many of these children eat more!

Others  tell  of  PE  lessons converted  into  additional

lessons - as has also been brought up by other Members  - because   of   the  pressure  to  fulfill  the   academic

curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the parents? Research tells us that 40-80% of obese children will have at least one obese

parent.   It  would be nice for the parents  to  exercise

with the child.  But my long clinical experience tells me

otherwise.  Unfortunately, fat families tend to stay  fat

together!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a happy situation, if we are trying to

achieve   healthy  lifestyles  for  all  and  a  sporting

Singapore.   I  hope  that  the  Minister  will  persuade

schools  to teach children how to play sports  and  games

that  they  have  never tried.  Try  to  allow  for  more

beginners  to  take  up sports and  join  the  Beginners'

League, and not only to focus on the star performers  who

can  bring honour to the school.  Perhaps, Parent-Teacher

Associations can also help schools by running  Beginners'

Leagues, like the Little League in America, and maybe  do

so  by  weight categories - small, bigger,  fattest!   Or

have  beginner, intermediate and advanced  levels  for  a

variety  of  games.   NIE can perhaps  help  by  actually

training  and upgrading parent volunteers to run  leagues

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think schools need to support the Sporting

Singapore vision by not only betting on the sure winners,

but  also  to water and fertilise the hidden and  budding

talents of all our children, thin or fat, short or  tall.

Late bloomers can sometimes really do our garden proud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another short point is that some of these children

would  have medical problems as a result of their  weight

problem.    I   hope   that  these   children   will   be

appropriately channelled to the relevant medical channels

for investigation and treatment.  Our own research in  KK

Hospital  suggests that at least a third,  if  not  more,

would  have significant medical treatable problems.   For

some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>



of  them,  the  TAF club programme has not been  able  to

help, for some reason or other.  I hope that the Minister

will  support a more targeted approach to these children,

in  view  of  the  serious  health  risks  they  pose  to

themselves and potential future burden to the nation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang:</b> Madam, at the 44th AGM of the

good potential in sports are identified and given special

training  to  groom them into sports  talents.   At  each

primary  level, the sports talents are grouped  into  two

special classes and given specialised sports training and

coaching.   They are also given enrichment  and  remedial

support.  The school provides all other students with PE,

Trim  and Fit Programme, and inter-class activities  that

keep  them active and challenged throughout the year.   I

would  like to congratulate the school for its innovative

way  of providing effective sports education for all  its

pupils and for her sports talents to develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, at the Singapore Schools Sports Council

conference  in  1999, I also urged  MOE  and  schools  to

introduce gifted sports programme, so that students  with

sports  talent can be nurtured and achieve  success.   In

Singapore,  we  are  giving our children  with  different

talents   opportunities  to  develop  to  their   fullest

potential,  not  just in academic pursuits  but  also  in

other areas, eg, arts, music and sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gifted sports classes, like the one introduced by

Park  View Primary School, would give a chance  to  those

with sporting talent to be nurtured and to flourish,  and

to  achieve success in life according to his or  her  own

ability  and inclination.  This concept of gifted classes

can be introduced at the primary and secondary levels, in

Normal  and Express streams, and I hope Park View Primary

School  will  be a shining example for other  schools  to

follow.  I also urge the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  to  encourage more schools to consider  similar

innovative programmes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Madam, I would like to

thank  Members who have given us a lot of suggestions  on

how to improve the various programmes run by our schools.

I  may not be able to respond to all the suggestions, but

I will try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, MOE agrees with Members on the importance of

holistic development of our students.  MOE's approach  is

to  give  due  importance to the total education  of  our

students,  encompassing  both academic  and  non-academic

aspects, so that our students grow up to be good  persons

and useful citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Ms Penny

Low   asked  about  schools'  character  development  and

National Education programmes and wondered how we  assess

their successes and whether schools collaborate with  the

community  on  these programmes.  Dr Ong  Seh  Hong  also

asked  what schools do to teach current affairs,  and  Mr

Loh  Meng  See  proposed that MOE should  strengthen  our

values education.  Our curriculum instils in our students

sound values, builds their character and equips them with

knowledge of National Education and current affairs.  For

example,  students learn about key historical  facts  and

local  current affairs through their Social  Studies  and

General  Paper  lessons.  They are also  taught  to  make

decisions  based on moral principles in their civics  and

moral  education lessons.  Through Learning  Journeys  to

places  like PSA, JTC and Parliament House, which include

observing  parliamentary sessions from the gallery,  they

learn the critical issues and challenges facing Singapore

and what makes Singapore tick.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we believe that it is not enough to just teach

students  these values in classroom lessons or take  part

in Learning Journeys.  We must also provide opportunities

for  students to practise these values to learn  what  it

means to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



have integrity, loyalty and understand why discipline and

perseverance are important for success, and allow them to

experience the joy of giving to the community.   That  is

why  MOE  introduced the Co-curricular  Activities  (CCA)

Programme  Framework  in  2001, comprising  CCA  and  the

Character  Development  Programme  (CDP),  of  which  the

Community Involvement Programme (CIP) is one component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Character Development Programme comprises a

range  of enrichment activities organised into the  three

domains  of  enterprise, citizenship,  and  personal  and

social development.  There are specific activities  under

each  domain.  For example, schools organise  creativity,

innovation and problem-solving workshops for students  to

nurture enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the values we nurture in our students is

service  to the community.  This is achieved through  the

Community  Involvement  Programme  (CIP).   For  example,

students from Nanyang Girls High have adopted Block  151,

Mei  Ling Street in Queenstown, to serve the elderly  who

attend  activities  organised by  the  Lion  Befrienders.

Students  are  scheduled to visit and interact  with  the

elderly  in  two-hourly sessions and  learn  the  art  of

flower-making  from the senior citizens.   These  flowers

are  later  sold by the students to raise funds  for  the

centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we assess the effectiveness of the CDP and

National  Education?   Values, such as  perseverance  and

loyalty,   are  intangible  and  difficult   to   measure

quantitatively.   Nevertheless, we have  developed  proxy

measures  to  review  our National Education  programmes,

activities  and  CDP, and assess if they  are  effective.

One  of  these  is  the CIP survey.  Based  on  the  2002

survey, 91% of all our schools had at least 90% of  their

students completing six hours of CIP participation.  This

is  an  indirect  measure of our students'  readiness  to

contribute to the community in a small way.  In  the  new

JC curriculum to be introduced in 2006, JC students would

need  to  meet  minimum  requirements  in  CCA  and   CDP

participation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong and Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon also asked

whether  our  teachers are trained  to  deliver  National

Education and character development programmes, while  Ms

Braema  Mathiaparanam asked if teachers  are  trained  to

deal  with  racial discriminatory attitudes.  The  answer

is,  yes,  through formal and informal  settings.   NIE's

National  Education  training and  character  development

programmes   prepare  teachers  for   practice   in   the

profession.   To  create awareness of National  Education

among  trainee  teachers, NIE infuses National  Education

issues into the respective course modules.  It also holds

a three-day National Education seminar annually, which is

attended   by  all  trainee  teachers.   Furthermore,   a

compulsory  Singapore Studies module will  be  introduced

for teachers in the NIE degree programme in July 2003.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training in character development is delivered

through  formal  lessons in core  and  elective  modules,

where  the values of care, integrity and being good  role

models  are  emphasised.  Through these various  training

schemes,  our  young  teachers are exposed  to  different

modes of conducting lessons in character development  and

National  Education.   Incumbent  teachers  too  are  not

neglected.  They  receive  in-service  training   through

workshops, seminars, sharing sessions and talks to  equip

them  with the attitude, skills and knowledge to  conduct

character development and National Education lessons  and

activities.  In addition, our teachers are sensitized  to

racial   issues  in  schools,  through   talks   by   the

principals,  National  Education  seminars  and   sharing

sessions.   In  school context, they are called  "contact

times".   At  regular  school staff  meetings,  education

officers  also  have the opportunity to  discuss  how  to

manage  difficulties  that  might  arise  in  their  work

environment, including discriminatory attitude should  it

occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on racial integration, Dr Wang Kai Yuen and

Mr Chandra Mohan asked how we could better promote racial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



integration  in  schools  by inculcating   tolerance  and

understanding  of each other's culture and  habits.   Our

national  schools play an important role in teaching  our

students  the  importance of racial  harmony  and  social

cohesion.  They have continued to organise multi-cultural

celebrations  of  ethnic  festivals,  set   up   National

Education or Heritage Corners, and work with parents  and

the  Community  Development Councils  to  broaden  inter-racial  mixing  through  the  home-stay  and  home  visit

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the curriculum, classroom activities and

CCAs,  our  students  have  the opportunities  to  learn,

understand and appreciate the cultures and traditions  of

their  friends.   I  would say that  the  foundation  for

racial integration and harmony is laid very early in  our

schools. The Committee on Strengthening Racial Harmony in

Schools   introduced  a  framework  for  broadening   and

deepening  racial harmony in schools last  year.  Earlier

this year, a racial harmony website was launched to share

best practices in promoting racial harmony in schools  as

well  as  to  engage students to discuss  and  understand

racial   harmony  issues  better.   The  Committee   also

recommended  the introduction of a set of racial  harmony

indicators to be included in the school excellence  model

(SEM), a self-appraisal tool for all schools.  The racial

harmony indicators are designed to assist schools in  the

management  and  evaluation of their own  racial  harmony

programmes within the framework of the SEM.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See spoke about the importance of giving

our   students   earlier   exposure   to   cross-cultural

environment.    Madam,  our  racial  harmony   activities

provide  that exposure to our students. On top  of  that,

our  schools  also organise International Friendship  Day

annually  and  some even work with foreign schools  based

here  in  Singapore in exchange programmes, so  that  our

students  and  their  students  can  mingle  confidently,

including during their home-stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having said all these, I would like to

stress that the child's experiences in school form only a

part of his education.  The family, the community and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



society  play  no  less a critical role  in  shaping  the

values of our young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools,

Mr  Chandra Mohan and Mr Inderjit Singh asked  how  these

schools   promote   racial  harmony,  considering   their

exclusive nature.  I wish to assure Members that our  SAP

schools  are aware of their responsibility for  educating

students  who  are steeped in our national  values  in  a

multi-cultural and multi-racial Singapore.  They  promote

racial  harmony and social cohesion as actively as  other

schools through the CIP, CDP, inter-school, cluster-based

and   community-based  activities.   Mindful  that  their

school environment has limitations, they work with  other

schools  to  create opportunities for their  students  to

interact with students of other races from other schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is River Valley High where students

celebrated   the  International  Friendship  and   Racial

Harmony  Day  with students from other schools  in  their

cluster.  Another  example is  Chung  Cheng  High  School

(Main),  which has an exchange programme with Springfield

Secondary,   a   school   in  Tampines,   that   provides

opportunities  for Chung Cheng students to interact  with

students of other races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAP schools were set up to preserve the best of

the  values  and  traditions found in the former  Chinese

schools.  These  traditions and  values  have  created  a

richer  environment  and played  a  significant  part  in

Singapore's development.  Our SAP schools understand that

they  are  an integral part of Singapore and  accept  the

multi-racial nature of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also suggested the setting up of

SAP schools for Malays and Indians.  We must bear in mind

that  the  circumstances of each community are  different

and,  therefore,  may  require  different  approaches  to

preserve  their  traditions.  MOE set up two  committees,

involving  representatives  from  the  Indian  and  Malay

communities, to review the teaching and learning  of  the

Tamil and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



Malay  languages  in  1998 and  1999  respectively.   The

recommendations of the review to strengthen the  teaching

of Malay and Tamil languages were announced in year 2000.

These  included, among other things, the introduction  of

an  Enrichment Programme in Malay Language for  Secondary

Schools,  (in  short, EMAS), Language Elective  Programme

(Malay Language) in Tampines JC and the upgrading of  the

Umar  Pulavar  Tamil Language Centre to a national  Tamil

Language  Centre.   It is heartening  to  note  that  the

majority  of  the  MLEP and EMAS students,  both  at  the

Tampines  JC  and  Bukit  Panjang Government  High,  have

performed  well in the 'A' and 'O' level examinations  in

Higher Malay Language examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the specific issues raised by

Members.  First, sexuality education.  Dr Maliki referred

to  sex education, but we do not teach sex education  per

se.  What we do is to introduce sexuality education.   Dr

Maliki  asked  about the effectiveness of  our  sexuality

education,  and how the programme is being received.  The

aim  of sexuality education is to equip students with the

knowledge  and  skills to make responsible  decisions  on

sexuality  matters,  based on values  in  line  with  the

national  value  of  the family  as  the  basic  unit  of

society.   Sexuality education is implemented in  schools

through  a cross-curricular approach in subjects such  as

Health   Education,  Science,  and   Civics   and   Moral

Education.   It  is also carried out as  a  co-curricular

programme based on the Growing Years series.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Dr Maliki's information, six to eight hours of

sexuality  education  is  taught  every  year.    It   is

conducted  outside  curriculum  hours  as  an  enrichment

programme.    Teachers  are  also  trained   by   medical

practitioners, the police (in the case of legal  matters,

the legal aspect of sexuality issues), social workers  as

well as by psychologists.  Pupils have responded well  to

the  programme, showing a significant increase  in  their

knowledge and understanding of sexuality matters.  It is,

however,  too early to assess the impact of the programme

on pupil's sexual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>



values and attitudes, bearing in mind that the influences

on them are so varied and very strong from many different

sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked why teenage pregnancy has

increased.  The causes for teenage pregnancy  are  multi-faceted.   They  include  a lack of  family  support  and

cohesiveness,  history of sexual abuse  and  low  esteem.

Schools alone cannot address all these issues and causes.

What we can do, through sexuality education for students,

is  to  inculcate the right values, raise their awareness

of  the options and the consequences, and equip them with

the  skills  to make informed decisions.  The family  and

the  community must also play their part to  support  the

school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On school discipline, Mdm Ho Geok Choo said that

principals  should  temper  discipline  with   a   heart.

Indeed, we agree with Mdm Ho.  Our schools have a  multi-tier  discipline system, complemented by a pastoral  care

and  guidance  programme. When a  pupil  shows  signs  of

misconduct, he will be counselled first by teachers  and,

if  necessary, by a professional MOE counsellor.  Schools

also  work  closely with parents to help the child.   For

recalcitrant  pupils,  schools  will  turn  to   external

agencies  like  the  MCDS,  the  Juvenile  Court,  Family

Service Centres and self-help groups to help such pupils.

Disciplinary actions, like expulsion and suspension,  are

only meted out as a last resort.  Even then, schools will

re-admit  these  pupils if they change their  undesirable

behaviour  and commit to improve their conduct. Similarly

here,  schools  cannot  work  alone.   It  requires   the

cooperation  of  parents  and  the  community,  and  will

continue to work with them to help these children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on physical education, Mr Ng Ser Miang said

that  physical education (PE) should be serious, yet fun,

and  teach  sports  and games.  He  wondered  if  we  had

sufficient time for PE compared to other countries.   Our

PE  programmes do teach students to play different sports

and games, and it is fun-filled and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



yet  achieving  its  objectives of  developing  students'

motor and games skills.  Students also learn to keep  fit

and  appreciate  teamwork, fair  play  and  sportsmanship

through  PE.  Madam, we compare well with other developed

countries,  like the USA, in the time allocated  for  PE.

For  example,  for Primary One to Primary Four,  we  have

between  90-120 minutes of PE per week, compared  to  100

minutes  for  the USA.  I wish to assure  Mr  Ng  and  Dr

Warren  Lee  that MOE does not encourage the  use  of  PE

periods  for remedial lessons.  All remedial lessons  are

supposed to take place outside curriculum hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng also asked if we have a sufficient number of

PE teachers and whether NIE opens its PE programme to fee-paying  students who are interested in a  career  in  the

sports   industry.   We  have  sufficient  qualified   PE

teachers  to meet our demands and we are able to  recruit

sufficient number of PE trainees every year.  As NIE's PE

training programme prepares our teachers to teach  PE  in

our  schools,  it  is  not suitable for  someone  who  is

looking for training in preparation for a career  in  the

sports industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Trim and Fit Programme, I am very pleased to

note  that  none other than Dr Warren Lee has brought  up

the  issue of the importance of trim and fit.  I say this

because he is a paediatrician.  I would like to thank  Dr

Warren  Lee  for calling the Trim and Fit  Programme  (or

TAF)  a  success and wish to assure Mr Ng Ser Miang  that

all  TAF  activities  are  conducted  outside  curriculum

hours.   Dr Lee also asked our schools to encourage  mass

participation in sports, including obese students to play

sports  and games.  We agree fully with Dr Lee.  In  line

with  our  national policy of Sports for All,  there  are

many avenues for our students, including obese pupils, to

participate in sports today. They range from PE  lessons,

recreational CCAs, to games and competitions  at  various

levels  -  the school level, cluster level, and at  class

level too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, schools have been encouraged to adopt

the  house system for their CCAs to further promote  mass

participation in sports. Some schools have even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



made  special  efforts to entice overweight  students  to

exercise by introducing roller-blading, boxercise,  games

and  ethnic  dances,  to  make  exercising  fun.   Others

conduct  their TAF activities in the form of a CCA,  such

as  the  Health and Fitness Club or the Fun  and  Fitness

Club.   Some  schools  also conduct seminars,  talks  and

sharing  sessions  on wellness to educate  and  encourage

parents  to  support and promote a healthy lifestyle  for

them  and  their children.  I am very glad to  report  to

Members that parents, through the parents support groups,

do  help our teachers to conduct these activities for the

obese pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to overcome the manpower and physical

resources  limitations, some schools are tapping  on  the

Singapore  Sports  Council's Learn to Play  Sports  Basic

Programme  to increase sports opportunities for students.

This  year,  a total of 75 primary and secondary  schools

joined  the  programme.  As suggested  by  Dr  Lee,  some

schools  do tap on their parent-teacher associations  for

support.   For example, St. Michael's Primary School  has

the beginners' soccer programme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>



known  as  Twinkle Toes, which is open to all  interested

pupils and run by two PTA members of the school.
