<div align="center"><b>BUS LANES IN CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for abolition)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Communications if he will consider abolishing the

existing "Yellow Bus :Lanes" within the Central Business District as well as along all the City's

main  roads when the Park and Ride  Scheme  is

introduced, as the existence of the bus  lanes

tends to obstruct shoppers boarding and alighting

from cars or taxis in front of shops.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of Reserved Bus

Lanes  during  traffic peak hours in  the  Central

Business  District is to give priority  to  public

bus  transport. Observations made by  officers  of

the  Registry  of Vehicles and the Road  Transport

Working  Group, since its introduction in February

1974,  have  shown  that  this  measure  has  been

successful.  The  Reserved Bus  Lane  scheme  will

therefore    be   maintained.   Another    traffic

management scheme, the Park and Ride Scheme, to be

introduced   in  May  this  year,   will   further

facilitate traffic flow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoppers who experience some inconvenience in

boarding  and  alighting from cars  and  taxis  in

front  of  shops  because of the bus  lanes  could

avoid   inconvenience  by  doing  their   shopping

outside  the peak periods when bus lanes  are  not

operative.

<div align="center"><b>USE OF COMMUNITY CENTRE'S GROUNDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Culture

the  reasons  why the People's Association  cannot

allow  the  use of a Community Centre's playground

for  the  holding  of a dinner party  by  a  civic

organisation  to  commemorate the  birthday  of  a

certain Chinese deity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, community centres are meant to serve

the  interests of the community as a whole and not

religious  or  sectional interests.  The  People's

Association,  therefore, does  not  as  a  general

policy grant permission to a civic organisation to

stage  any  functions or activities  of  a  purely

religious   nature   inside   community   centre's

grounds.

teachers? Why did it not recruit trained teachers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

steps are being taken by the Ministry of Education

to  train teachers, and this is being carried  out

by the Institute of Education. In the meantime, we

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question

[3rd  March, 1975], `That Parliament approves  the

financial  policy  of  the  Government   for   the

financial year 1st April,

1975   to   31st   March,  1976.".-[Minister   for

Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the

Minister for his Budget statement. It was short; I

dare  not  say it was short and sweet.  It  was  a

brief,    businesslike   presentation,   reviewing

economic  policy  against  the  scenario  of   the

economic   survey  of  Singapore  1974   and   the

Memorandum  on the Main and Development Estimates,

as  well as the detailed estimates themselves. Not

long  before the Budget statement, of course,  the

President's  Speech at the opening  of  Parliament

outlined the general policy of the Government. All

these  should  make up the total backdrop  to  the

presentation of Members' views today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has, of course, to be praised for

having guided us through 1974 adroitly, managing a

relatively   good  growth  rate,  encouraging   or

contriving  diversification in  the  manufacturing

sector  in terms of manufacturing activities,  and

in  the  trade  sector, in terms  of  markets.  In

respect of trade, while vigorous marketing  is  of

course important, emphasis must be laid on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



the  quality of goods supplied, but very important

also, on the integrity of our traders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is no doubt that the great majority

of  our traders are reliable, there have been  one

or  two  black  sheep. For instance,  a  very  bad

example  has  been set by one or two exporters  of

sawn timber who have indulged in such malpractices

as  to bring upon themselves, and unfortunately on

others  too,  the  distrust  of  buyers.   It   is

significant also that ungraded timber  is  shipped

mostly  to  west  Asian  countries  and  this   is

particularly  one area in which,  as  the  Finance

Minister's Budget statement states, we are seeking

new  markets.  Our merchants know  that  the  best

advertisement  is the quality of their  goods  and

service. We should make it very clear that we will

not  allow  a  few to spoil the good name  of  the

majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite early in his Budget speech, the Minister

referred  to  the  importance of  tourism  in  the

services  sector  of  our economy.  Even  you,  Mr

Speaker, in those days, when as a Backbencher  you

could  speak,  you did touch on the importance  of

protecting our tourists from dishonest dealing.  I

think  this matter has been taken care of, and  is

continually being looked after. But more  recently

on  another  aspect the Finance Minister  remarked

publicly  that there is no reason why the  tourist

industry   should   help  to   import   the   more

undesirable manifestations of Western life-styles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also every reason indeed, Mr Speaker,

why  the  tourist  industry  should  help  in  the

promotion  of  our  cultural  development  through

greater encouragement of the arts, and propagation

of life-styles that will result in tourists having

a  good  opinion of us not only for  our  material

achievements,  but  also  for  our  pleasing   and

respectable cultural attainments. I think this  is

a more correct picture for them to take away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to expansion of tourism, I myself do

not have it very clear in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



my  mind  as to whether it is owing to the efforts

of  the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board that  we

are getting more tourists, or whether people would

come in any case on the basis of promotion by  our

national airlines, our missions abroad and by  the

natural   advantages  of  Singapore's   convenient

location,  as  well as by other features,  as  for

example  the fact that Singapore is a  clean  city

with green and pleasant surroundings, and has also

a  reputation for being well-run. What stands  out

as  a  particular  achievement  of  the  Singapore

Tourist  Promotion  Board is the  discovery  of  a

rather  controversial location  for  Sir  Stamford

Raffles' landing. Other contributions to tradition

and  cultural development do not seem  to  prevail

very  much.  It is interesting to note  that  more

tourists   from  ASEAN  countries   are   visiting

Singapore. Let us show them that we are  conscious

of  our own history and commendable past and  that

we appreciate the finer forms of expression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help in this, I would like to bring up the

view  held by many that some part of the  proceeds

from the cess levied on tourist establishments  he

given  over  for  the patronage  of  artistic  and

cultural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget statement sounded a note of firm

confidence in the face of continued uncertainty in

world  economic conditions. We show confidence  in

ourselves and we know that others are confident in

us.  And this I say to our people: let us  not  do

anything to affect this confidence in any way. The

Member  for Changi has, during the debate  on  the

President's  Address, expressed his  concern  over

the  possibility  of  Communist  exploitation   of

economic  uncertainties as well  as  of  come-back

attempts by right-wing political opportunists. The

Member   for  Boon  Teck  has  also  referred   to

unwelcome  interference by "ugly  adventurers"  in

our internal political affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago we witnessed at the University

of   Singapore  some  manifestations  of   student

unrest.  In  respect of students  experiencing  an

awakening within their souls to the realities of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



conditions in the adult world they find themselves

in,  the  members of our society should look  upon

this  with some gratification. We should not  feel

too perturbed or surprised even over our discovery

of   evidence  of  intellectual  activity  at  the

University  of Singapore. We should be happy  that

our   undergraduates  are  studiously   exercising

themselves  over moral issues as to  the  kind  of

society  we  should have and the  right  relations

between man and man in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we should also remember that the

student movement is the easiest thing in the world

for those with unwholesome intentions to penetrate

silently  and  surreptitiously. In the  spring  of

1967,   Ramparts   magazine   published   a   most

significantly revealing report. The report claimed

that  the  (American) National Student Association

(NSA),  to which was affiliated student unions  on

more than 300 campuses all over the United States,

had  been  subsidised for 15  years  past  by  the

Central Intelligence Agency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This support from the CIA had been to counter

Soviet  influence  in  the  international  student

movement, which had been evident since as far back

as 1946, when Communist delegations gained control

of  the first World Student Congress, which met in

Prague. More recently, there is also a fair amount

of  evidence  of  Communist  penetrations  of  the

Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). In an odd

way  our  own  students show  they  realise  their

vulnerability   to   penetration   by   constantly

expressing  their  fear  of  subversion   by   our

Internal Security Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, our students, especially those just

entering  university,  should  be  warned  against

being pawns of shadowy individuals lurking in  the

background.  These  individuals,  while  espousing

humanistic aims and individual freedom,  cynically

exploit the difficulties our idealistic youths are

facing in their struggle to relate the first flush

of   new  ideas  and  exciting  thoughts  to   the

realities    of   their   social   and   political

environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the university recent attempts at expressing

dissent  have followed a well-beaten path, trodden

over and over again by student dissenters all over

the  world.  Sing-along sessions, the pretence  of

humanism  hiding the incitement to hate, making  a

comrade  of  Christ, and Messiahs out  of  student

officials,  the  manufacturing  of  martyrs,   the

desanctification of authority and the  attempt  to

pour  scorn on social institutions, including  the

judiciary    directly,   and    even    Parliament

indirectly, attempts at disruption and willingness

to  drop out: the pattern is very clear. Our young

men  and women entering into university should  be

warned  against being made use of by those who  do

not wish us any good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the more pedestrian domain of

our  school  system. Of course, the  Minister  for

Finance has made reference to some sectors of  our

education  system which are directly  relevant  to

manpower  training and are in this way immediately

related   to  economic  progress.  He   has   thus

expressed  his  concern over the  relationship  of

education  to work and certainly this is  a  right

concern. But there are other aspects of the formal

educational  system not immediately  and  patently

seen  as  having economic significance which  will

have in the long run very important effects on our

economic   and  social  well-being.  This   should

concern  us  especially in view of our President's

injunction  not  too long ago that  we  should  be

guided  by  the  long-term interests  of  all  our

people. I feel certain there are features  in  our

education  establishment  and  implementation   of

education policy, which may in the long  run  tend

to  result in diseconomies than in efficiency  and

optimum  output. I refer to the way  measures  are

introduced and dropped and new measures thought of

and  introduced  in  bewildering  succession.   In

November  1974  an  official  statement   on   the

restructure  of the education system averred  that

our  Republic's  education  system  had  been   in

operation  for the past 15 years with  only  minor

changes. This statement has resulted in my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



wondering  whether I have rightly  understood  the

meaning  of `major' and `minor'. But even  if  the

changes  have not been major and have indeed  been

minor as alleged, then there have been so many  of

them  introduced, and in a patchwork way, that  it

was  right for the Member for Ulu Pandan  to  call

out for a moratorium on these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us sit down to think carefully of what we

want to do and let us do it together, teachers and

administrators -not the bureaucrats alone. Let not

policy  be decided in some obscure bureau and  the

views  of  teachers  and their  unions  and  other

professional  bodies be sought  merely  to  ensure

smooth implementation of a new system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1968 a point was made in this House

in    respect    of   decision-making    regarding

educational  policy. It was said that  when  plans

were  made not enough of the opinion of  the  rank

and file of the teachers had been solicited and it

was  pointed  out  that without  discussion  there

could not be that full and wholehearted commitment

to implementation. I myself appealed in this House

seven  years ago, that whenever decisions were  to

be made, whenever plans were to be laid, we needed

more   than  a  resigned  acquiescence  to   these

decisions  and  plans. We needed the participation

of  our  teachers  in  the  thinking  out  of  our

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Mr Speaker, Sir, this response of resigned

acquiescence  to  decisions is still  there.  What

other  response  can there be when  decisions  are

still  made  and policies thrust on  teachers  for

them  to  implement and their views are  canvassed

only in respect of smooth implementation. Where is

the  optimum  productivity  possible  under  these

conditions?  How  is  the  best  economic   effort

achieved in the education sector?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another matter which is related to

what  I  would  like to think of as  the  economic

disposition of educational resources.  Why  is  it

that  we try to contrive an input of all sorts  of

knowledge,    possible   and   impossible,    into

schooling? The reason for this is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



we  visualise the formal school as the only place

where  learning should occur. That is why we  tend

to ask: Why has history been dropped? There is not

enough   second-language  time.  Why  not  include

consumer    education,   even   family    planning

education,  safety  first education  perhaps,  and

other  things?  If we could only  realise  clearly

that  education is for life, then  we  could  take

more  positive  steps to integrate  a  humane  and

civic education into the working and adult life of

our citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, in the out-of-school sector, we have

done  very  well  indeed in the  establishment  of

institutions  devoted to the improvement  of  work

skills.   But  where  education  for   living   is

concerned  the time that we have at our  disposal,

if  we  think only of school, is quite inadequate.

We  have  to  think of other structures  to  bring

about  with effect and impact what is incorporated

in the Chinese saying - Huo tao lao, hsueh tao lao

- Live till old, learn till old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that let me turn to the way priorities seem

to  be ordered in the minds of those who decide on

the   Budget  for  items  that  are  not   related

immediately to economic returns, but which are all

the same important and have a long-term effect  on

the  way  our people live, learn, train, work  and

earn,   and   hence   on  the  way   we   progress

economically  and  otherwise. Let  us  take.,  for

instance,  the example of neglect of the  National

Museum.  It  is  depressing  to  contemplate  this

aspect  and  I  intend to say a  little  bit  more

during Committee of Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the National Library. There has

been  a spate of resignations recently of officers

in   the   library  service.  Further  alarm   and

despondency  has been spread among senior  library

officers  by  certain proposals  relating  to  so-called  economy and efficiency measures  that,  if

implemented  without  careful  consideration,  may

well  result  in hampering the optimum development

of our library services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even where the traffic police are concerned,

suggestions have been made to them to  reduce  the

strength of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



mobile squad. This has been done apparently in the

naive  belief that the introduction of the  points

demerit system, restricted entry into the CBD, and

other  new traffic regulations, will enable  fewer

men  to do more work. By such crude economies,  is

it  hoped  that  the traffic police  will  achieve

what,  up  to the present, has patently  not  been

achieved, namely, adequate volume of enforcement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite evident that when our budget

authorities   (wherever  they  are)   budget   for

enterprises  that are not immediately economically

productive,  they tend to think  of  manpower  and

other  operating  factors in  terms  of  reducible

digits.  In  the Memorandum to the  Estimates,  we

learn   that  half  the  rationale  behind  latest

improvements to the Estimates format is to  enable

classification of Government expenditure according

to  the economic impact of an expenditure. My  own

observation inclines me to believe that, in  cases

of  expenditure where there is not  an  immediate,

patent, quantifiable economic impact, then this is

seized   upon   as  justification  for   automatic

pruning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There does not seem to be much readiness to think

in  terms of dimensions of a problem, or the  aims

of  a project - what it is hoped to attain by  it.

Productivity is demanded in a simple way:  greater

output  with fewer digits. This is like the father

in  a  family  economising by giving his  children

less  to  eat.  Whether they  will  do  more  work

because  they are lean, or much less because  they

are  starving  - this may well be  a  less  simple

judgment to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a look is taken at productivity, it may be

all   too   easy  to  come  to  facile,   unctuous

conclusion  about the necessity for  pruning.  One

has to guard against this mistake. For example,  I

had  occasion,  only  a few  days  ago,  to  visit

Fullerton Building. There I passed a department of

the  Ministry of Finance. While waiting, I  saw  a

few  of  the  staff of this department, sauntering

between  desks,  lounging, and  talking  with  one

another, full of smiles. But I said to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



myself: "My, these workers are indeed happy.  They

must surely be owing this happiness to the efforts

of the Management Services Department."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Minister will

allow, I would like to comment on the bland way in

which the Minister presented his Budget statement.

There was no break in this bland quality even when

he   came  to  the  part  where  he  talked  about

additional  revenue having to come from  increased

taxes  on  items, 1 quote, "not basic to life  for

the average family". This imposition was, I think,

greeted  with  mixed  feelings  on  the  part   of

Singaporeans  - a little irritation mixed  with  a

little relief: relief that the imposition had  not

been  heavier because there were rumours that  the

tax  on  cars, for example, would be high  indeed.

And  a  little irritation because at least one  of

these items, namely the car, is not considered  so

much  a  luxury,  under present circumstances,  as

almost  a  necessity to large numbers  of  people,

judging  by the perennial parking problem even  in

HDB  precincts and other places where the  average

citizen  dwells. The principal way to make  people

less  attached to their cars is to make travelling

in public transport so much less deterring than it

is  today,  that people will not mind  sacrificing

the use of private vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that one aim of the imposition

of   additional  road  tax  is  to  add   to   the

discouragement  of individual car ownership.  Most

people  feel, however, that this measure will  not

succeed  -  and  the people who feel  so  are  the

people who own the cars. I appreciate that  it  is

necessary,  in  order to make public  transport  a

success,  to  ensure  a high volume  of  users  of

public  transport,  who will later  patronise  the

mass rapid transit system. Thus it is necessary to

discourage   individual  car  ownership   wherever

possible. And I support all encouragement given to

the use of public transport. But apart from quasi-punitive  measures, it is a positive  and  radical

transformation of the public transport system that

will eventually turn people to its use.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should not forget the revenue-collecting purpose behind the imposition of the

additional  car tax. A respectable $26 million  is

anticipated. But the burden will be chiefly  borne

by  those who own small and medium-sized cars.  It

would  be  interesting to know how many  of  these

owners also run small and medium-sized businesses.

It  is  hoped that, in such cases, the taxes  will

not  be  passed  on  to the consumer,  in  another

little boost to inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially as the Government has, by its own

measures,  done its part, otherwise, in  arresting

the  rate of inflation. Comparing 1974 with  1973,

the  rate  of increase in the cost of  living  has

slowed    down   significantly.   However,    food

contributes  nearly  60%  to  increases   in   the

Consumer  Price Index. There is reason, therefore,

for  us  to welcome the coming Government campaign

to  drive home the message that good food need not

necessarily  mean the higher priced food.  Success

in  the  campaign will not only help the housewife

in  her domestic bud-getting but will perhaps also

contribute  towards  pegging  down  general   food

prices  somewhat. I wonder, though, if  we  should

not  give thought to the possibility that  success

in   increasing   the  demand   for   lower-priced

foodstuffs   might  send  the  prices   of   these

foodstuffs up a bit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, there is very

little doubt that the Government has done well for

the citizens who gave it their mandate. And it  is

geared  under present recessionary conditions,  to

maintain a fair rate of development. The Estimates

show  nearly a 50% increase, in FY 75 over FY  74,

in  Government's direct expenditure on development

(excluding  expenditure  on  the  Armed   Forces).

Significantly  a sum representing about  one-tenth

the  amount  of  this direct expenditure  will  be

spent   on  public  works,  especially  roadworks,

necessitated  by  development of  housing.  Nearly

$850  million  has  gone into loans  for  housing.

There  is  nearly a 40% increase in the amount  of

loans to Statutory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



Boards  and Companies, including over $700 million

in the Ministry of Finance's

Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the catalogue goes on, Mr Speaker, Sir.

The  Budget papers indeed make fascinating reading

and  I  would recommend them to anybody who is  in

need  of  a  morale booster, for they  detail  our

achievement  and they show our faith in  ourselves

and our hope for the future.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

1974,  as  we know, was a year of economic  crisis

for  non-oil  producers among  the  industrialised

countries  and  the developing  countries  of  the

world.  The  energy  crisis,  exacerbated  by  the

sudden  quadrupling of oil prices, had a crippling

effect on the economies of the industrialised bloc

and  the  third  world. The oil consuming  nations

suddenly  had  to  grapple with a  grave  economic

crisis.  Forecasts of zero, and even minus  growth

rates of GNPs of industrialised nations were made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst this grim scenario of economic crisis, the

Hon.   Finance  Minister,  in  his  annual  Budget

statement on 3rd March, 1975, announced  that  our

real  rate  of  growth in 1974 was 6.8%.  This  is

certainly  a  satisfactory  economic  performance,

particularly, when our economy, which is a trading

and  export-orientated economy, is very much  more

susceptible  and  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the

pattern   of   global  economic  activities   than

practically  every other country.  Even  the  most

vocal  critics of Government could not grudge  the

Government  the  compliments for the  satisfactory

performance  of our economy in 1974. Only  prudent

management  and sound planning coupled with  able,

determined political leadership and courage  could

have  made  possible such an achievement.  Let  me

join   in   with  the  many  voices   that   offer

congratulations to the Hon. Finance  Minister  and

his   Cabinet  colleagues  on  their  past  year's

performance  and express confidence of  witnessing

our   country's  continued  success  under   their

stewardship.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me hasten to add that I am

not   without   any   criticisms   regarding   the

Government   policies  and   the   annual   Budget

statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Finance Minister would have been given

more  accolades if he had made some  announcements

of  further  incentives for people who support  or

contribute  towards  the  support  of  their  aged

parents and grandparents. After all, there was  so

much  fanfare  in the President's Address  at  the

opening  of  the present Session of Parliament  of

Government's intention to encourage people to look

after  their aged parents and grandparents. Or  is

the  Hon.  Finance  Minister waiting  for  a  more

propitious moment to make such announcements?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to his not-so-very generous offer of

tax  concession  for  people  capable  of  working

beyond  55 years of age by increasing their earned

income  relief from the present $1,000  to  $2,000

for  those between 55 years and 60 years  of  age,

and to $3,000 for those more than 60 years of age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to him, from our experience of the

various aspects of economic development during the

past few years, it has become apparent that it  is

extremely desirable from every point of view  that

our  skilled  and  experienced  people  should  be

encouraged to carry on working beyond their normal

retirement age. Then he went on to say  that  such

people  will need to spend more money  on  medical

attention  to  stay healthy and fit  for  working.

Hence,  the  tax concession is proposed  for  such

people  to  make it worth their while to  continue

working after the age of retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine his tax relief proposal to see

whether  such  tax  concession  would  in   effect

achieve  what the Hon. Finance Minister  hopes  to

achieve,   namely,   getting   our   skilled   and

experienced  people to go on working beyond  their

retirement  age.  In  my  opinion,  and  with  due

respect  to the Minister, if there is any  problem

about  working  after retirement, it  is  not  the

problem of persuading retired persons to work. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



Minister  has  got hold of the wrong  end  of  the

stick.  For many workers, particularly  those  who

are  organised into trade unions, the  problem  is

that  of  getting work rather than being persuaded

to  work  after  the age of retirement.  Singapore

workers  generally want to continue working  after

reaching   the  age  of  retirement  because   the

retirement age at 55 years is ridiculously low  in

the  present  context. With  better  standards  of

health and of living, people at that age are still

hale and hearty, and feel fit to continue working,

not  just only to maintain their economic  status,

but  also  to avoid the boredom of doing  nothing.

But  they  are  prevented by their employers  from

continuing to work after attaining the  fixed  age

of retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, the reason is plain

economics  for the employer. In fact, an  employer

may  not even wait for the employee to retire  but

retrench him before he has reached the top of  his

salary scale. The employer retires an old employee

at  the  top  of his salary scale. With  the  same

amount of money he can employ three or four  young

inexperienced employees at the bottom rung of  the

salary  scale.  This  is  sometimes  done  without

consideration  of  the  value  of  the  skill  and

experience  of  the old employee.  The  reason  is

simple. The personnel manager of a firm who is  in

charge of hiring and firing of the staff wants  to

show  his  general manager how much money  he  can

save  for  his company if he retires or retrenches

off an old employee and recruits a young employee.

As  the  personnel  manager is not  in  charge  of

production  and  is not concerned with  production

efficiency and schedules which depend so  much  on

skilled and experienced employees, the problem  he

creates has to be solved by others. The production

manager  and supervisor, who apparently  have  not

much  say  in the hiring and firing of  employees,

are  the  ones who have to solve the problem.  But

since they probably depend on the goodwill of  the

personnel  manager for their own job security  and

promotions, they also prefer to keep their  wisdom

to themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public sector, the prospect for an

employee  on  reaching retiring  age  to  continue

working is just as grim. The civil service  ruling

on  retirement age has to be strictly adhered  to.

True, in some cases, extension of service has been

allowed,  but  on  a temporary basis  subject,  of

course,   to   the   ritual  of   annual   medical

examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the end, who are the people beyond 55 years

of age likely to benefit from this tax concession?

Only the Lien Ying Chows, the Tan Chin Tuans,  the

Runme Shaws, the tycoons, the big towkays and  the

not-so-big towkays are likely to benefit from  the

tax  concession because, as bosses  of  their  own

concerns, they can continue to work beyond the age

of  55  years until they literally drop dead.  And

the irony is that such people do not need such tax

concession  as  an incentive to continue  working.

There is no better incentive than that of personal

profits. I am quite sure the Government has  never

intended to devise tax concessions to benefit such

people.  If they do benefit from it, it is  purely

incidental and not deliberately intended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then, may I ask, is the Government going to

achieve  the objective of getting our skilled  and

experienced  people to go on working beyond  their

normal  retirement age just by  offering  the  tax

concession to such people as announced by the Hon.

Finance  Minister? Will it not be  more  desirable

and effective to raise the official retirement age

of   55  to  60  for  a  start?  Should  not   the

Government,  as  a  model  employer,  remove   the

existing  ridiculous  ruling  on  retirement  that

Government employees who joined service before 1st

July,  1956, should retire at the age of  55?  Why

should they retire at 55 when those who join after

that date can retire at the age of 60? Surely what

is  sauce  for  the goose is also  sauce  for  the

gander.  When you remove that ruling, you will  be

able,  by  a  stroke  of the pen,  to  retain  the

services  of old public employees whose skill  and

experience  are  most  valuable  at  a  time  when

everything is done not only to attract but also to

prevent the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



brain and brawn drain into the private sector.  It

is possible that a few may still want to retire at

55 years of age. Give them an option to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the private sector the Government may

achieve  the  same  result,  as  intended  by  the

proposed  tax concession, by ensuring that  short-sighted or antisocial employers do not get rid  of

experienced, skilled workers at the top  of  their

respective wage scales before or on attaining  the

age  of  55  years  simply for the  sake  of  some

monetary savings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Finance Minister, in his Budget

statement, referred to the marked slow-down in the

rates  of  growth of revenue since financial  year

1973.   In   the  coming  fiscal  year,  recurrent

expenditure  is  expected to increase  by  6j%  as

against  a  growth  of  only  5%  in  revenue.  He

proposed to collect an additional revenue of $41.5

million  by  way  of increased taxes  on  tobacco,

liquor  and  cars, as he considered them  as  "not

basic  to  life for the average family". Basic  or

not  basic, the consumers of such items would have

to  foot  the  bill for the increased  taxes  from

their  hard-earned money. Many such consumers  are

no  more than just ordinary wage earners who  work

hard  and pay their taxes dutifully. They  do  not

evade paying taxes, like so many hawkers and  some

crooked  businessmen  who  know  how  to  cook  up

figures to avoid paying their full taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not taking issue with the Hon. Finance Minister over the increased taxes. What I venture to do is to propose to him that next time if he wants more money, he should look into the Stock Market. I am not suggesting to him that he should use Government funds to speculate on the Stock Market and increase the State's revenue through profits derived from speculation. What I am proposing is that he should consider introducing a form of capital gains tax for business transactions of shares in the Stock Market. Look at the huge fortunes some of the speculators have amassed for themselves in the last two months. All they do is to pick up the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



telephone  and dial the number of their  favourite

remisiers and speculate. What possible harm  could

a capital gains tax do to the Stock Market?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible argument against it is that it will

dampen  the activities of the Stock Market.  I  am

quite  conscious of the fact that the Stock Market

has  a vital role to play in the economic life  of

our  State. It provides opportunities for  genuine

investors  both  big  and small  to  invest  their

savings,  which  in turn helps  to  stimulate  the

economic    growth   of   our    industrial    and

manufacturing sector of our economy. But  what  we

have  seen in our Stock Market activities  in  the

past two months, for example, and on some previous

occasions, was not anything like that, it was just

sheer  speculation and gambling. A  tax  on  their

"winnings" as an additional source of revenue  may

curb  speculation  but  not  investment.  If   the

proposed capital gains tax is imposed on stock and

shares  transactions  which are  resold  within  a

period of, say, six months or a year, it will  not

affect  the  genuine investors.  In  that  way,  a

capital  gains  tax  should not  be  objectionable

except to the professional speculators.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to congratulate the Finance Minister

for  his  usual  informative and  detailed  Budget

address  and  for having presented  such  a  vivid

picture of our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the House was debating the Presidential

Address,  I touched on the implementation  process

within the Government machinery and on the need to

examine  the  existing  administrative  system  to

determine  where  changes are  urgently  required.

Members  of  this  House  also  commented  on  the

professional services, like the medical and health

services, the need for better coordination between

Government  departments, and the need for  a  more

effective and courteous civil service among  other

things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our civil service is, by and large, one that we

can be proud of - non-corrupt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



and  in  comparison  with  many  others  a  fairly

efficient  one. Nevertheless, there is still  room

for  improvement. Although Singapore has  been  an

independent country for 10 years now,  it  appears

that  the  tradition of Whitehall still  permeates

the civil service. Some officers, even very senior

ones, still carry out instructions and regulations

to  the  letter without question or understanding.

They seldom exercise discretion and work more like

a  robot.  This  is  one of  the  main  causes  of

frustration  within the civil service  itself.  In

dealing  with  the public, such an  impersonalised

system  when  carried  too far  can  breed  public

discontent   and  misunderstanding  -   not   with

Whitehall   now,   but  with   our   own   elected

Government. I will cite instances of such dealings

under the appropriate Ministries during the debate

on   the   Main   and  Development  Estimates   of

Expenditure.   Today,   I  will   concentrate   on

highlighting some of the problems within the civil

service,  particularly involving the  professional

services  (the medical, scientific, technical  and

educational  services), and I would like  to  make

general  recommendations on some of these problems

and how they can be solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that rapid development has created a

manpower shortage, particularly in the engineering

and  technical fields. Many vacancies still  exist

in  the service for these personnel, but I find it

difficult to accept the explanation that  shortage

in  the public sector of professional staff is due

to  pay alone. Not only few professionals join the

civil  service, many also resign from  it.  Surely

not  all  the doctors, engineers, technocrats  and

teachers  who  resigned have done  so  because  of

financial reason alone. I have no doubt that  many

of these professionals who have left are dedicated

people  and  who, if given the proper opportunity,

would  also like to participate and contribute  to

the  exciting  challenge of nation  building.  The

large number of volunteers who are now serving  on

the  various Government Boards and committees bear

testimony to this. Yet many professionals who have

joined the civil service have left. Some left



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



because  they  have  been  totally  disillusioned.

Others  left because they were frustrated  by  the

administrative system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that among certain sections of the

service,  as mentioned by previous Members  before

me,  money is all that matters. There is a  phobia

to make money for the Government. There is also an

over-emphasis on the control of public  funds,  so

much   so   that   effective   implementation   of

Government  policies  and  achieving  departmental

objectives   take  second  place  at  best.   This

practice, if not checked, can be abused or misused

resulting  very  frequently in  relatively  junior

officers   in   the   Budget   and   in   Ministry

headquarters over-riding even Heads of  Department

or   very   senior  professional  officers.   Non-professionals    begin   to   dictate    to    the

professionals    through   the   budget    system,

completely  forgetting that the other parties  too

have responsibilities for the performance of their

respective  organisations. People usually  respect

authority  provided the authority is exercised  by

someone  they  can respect, and not one  who  rams

authority down the throats of others by virtue  of

the position he holds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cite a classical example. A request was

made  for a re-vote for a 50-cycle generator.  The

reply was "Re-vote for generator approved. Explain

why  the  additional  50 bicycles  are  required".

Another  example. A department needed an equipment

to  generate  hot  air  for drying  purposes.  The

request for a hair-dryer was disapproved. However,

a hot air blower was later supported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can cite many instances, but I feel they are

quite  unnecessary. They can only cause irritation

and frustration. Let the professionals get down to

their  job and let us devise a system to  minimise

these incidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of frustration is the delegation

of  authority  relating to funds. I agree  that  a

department's  allocation  should  depend  on   the

national budget, but surely the details of what is

required after that should be left to the  man  in

charge and not to a complete layman



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Finance  Ministry. The irony  is  that  a

doctor  is  entrusted with people's lives  and  an

engineer to design or supervise projects involving

millions of dollars; yet these same people are not

trusted with even small sums of money. They cannot

vire  even  a  few hundred dollars  without  prior

approval  from  the Treasury. This practice  often

takes  a  long time to be approved as  it  is  not

normally  encouraged. Surely, this is  unnecessary

unless someone is trying to preserve his authority

or  protect  his  job. Proposals for  budgets  are

usually made months in advance. No one can predict

accurately what exactly will be required.  Changes

are  inevitable,  but  they are  difficult  to  be

effected  under  the  present  system.  It  is  an

established fact that very often things are bought

and  money spent merely because they appear on the

budget,  even though the items may not be required

any more. Departments that leave money unspent run

the  risk  of their following year's budget  being

reduced.  This is a well known fact. No credit  is

given  to officers for saving money. On the  other

hand,  the  officer may even be considered  a  bad

planner who cannot even estimate accurately. There

must be tremendous wastage of public funds in this

way  because  of  the  negative  approach  of  the

present system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Development Estimates, large sums of money

are left unspent each year. It will be interesting

to  know from the Finance Minister how much  money

and  what  percentage of the development fund  are

left  unspent  each  year.  Besides  shortage   of

manpower  in certain areas, what other causes  are

responsible for these hold-ups? Valuable  time  is

also  lost in this process. Projects are  delayed.

Can the system be improved to reduce this? What is

being done to remedy this situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the implementation of Government policies and

programmes  is badly handled by just a  few  civil

servants   because  of  the  system,  a   lot   of

frustration can result within the service and with

the  public. We need a good civil service, we need

to  rapidly  build up the vital second echelon  in

the  civil  service.  I would  therefore  like  to

propose that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



this House either directs the Estimates Committee,

or  forms a high powered commission, to look  into

the   present  budgetting  and  financial  control

system and:--



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To recommend measures to improve the existing

system  and  reduce friction and  dissatisfaction;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To determine which departments should be made

autonomous  to  take them out of the  bureaucratic

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we read in the newspapers of the

recommendation to set up the Department  of  Civil

Aviation as a statutory board. I believe that  the

development of this very important Department  and

our   Air  Terminal  could  have  been  very  much

accelerated, if not for the bureaucracy involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating that we dismantle the entire

system  which  has  worked  so  far.  What  I   am

suggesting is that we must not be blinded  by  our

success  and ignore the weaknesses and  faults  in

the  system which, in the long run, can stifle its

growth. I salute the dedicated civil servants  who

had  stuck  to  the service through the  difficult

times  we  had gone through the last 15 years.  At

the  same time we must recognise the problems  and

make the necessary changes to continuously improve

the service. As we enter the technological age and

under rapid changes, new priorities and programmes

would require a civil service that is dynamic  and

responsive  to  the needs of the times,  ready  to

meet and surmount new challenges. As a responsible

Government,   we   must  govern  firmly,   wisely,

efficiently,  but  also  politely.  We   need   an

effective civil service at all times to do this.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to join my colleagues in congratulating

the  Government for guiding the nation  through  a

very   difficult  year.  Although  we  have   been

affected by worldwide inflation and a slowing down

in    economic   activities,   our   economy   has

nevertheless  emerged with an impressive  gain  of

6.8% in GDP and we are still able to show a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



surplus   of  $708  million  in  our  balance   of

payments.  This is impressive by any standard  and

has been due largely to the far-sightedness of our

political   leadership  in  embarking   upon   the

restructuring and diversification of  our  economy

over  the  past decade so as to give it a  broader

base.  It is this broad base that has provided  us

with the cushion to withstand the series of shocks

generated by external forces. The tough-mindedness

and resourcefulness of our business community with

their  traditional "do or die" attitude have  also

contributed in no small measure to our success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In going through the economic survey one cannot

help   but  feel  that,  in  out  enthusiasm   for

industrialisation and in developing Singapore into

a  financial  centre over the past few  years,  we

might  not  have  given sufficient  attention  and

credit   to  some  of  our  traditional   economic

activities. It takes a difficult year such as  the

one  just  passed to impress on us  the  important

role  played by some of these traditional  sectors

of  our  economy.  I  have  in  mind  particularly

tourism  and  entrepot trade.  In  both  areas,  I

submit, Sir, encouragement and incentives have not

been  adequately  provided  in  recent  years.  If

anything,  the  combined effect of the  series  of

unilateral  government  departmental  actions  has

resulted in drastic increase in day-to-day running

expenses, much to the dismay and distress  of  the

people  concerned. For example,  in  the  case  of

hotel   trade,  the  increase  in  PUB  and  other

government  charges has imposed quite considerable

financial  strains  on the management,  especially

bearing  in mind the already substantial increases

in  wages in recent years. From enquiries  made  I

have  been told that there are altogether some  20

items  of  licences  and  other  fees  payable  to

approximately  nine  to ten Government  and  quasi

government departments by a hotel in the course of

any  one year. Some of these fees and charges  are

payable yearly whereas a number of them are  on  a

monthly basis and require personal visits  to  the

departments  concerned. You can well  imagine  the

inconvenience and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



time  involved in attending to all these payments.

And  what is the Tourist Promotion Board doing  in

living  up to its name? According to the Minister,

a  sum of $3 million has been collected from hotel

cess.  I do like to know how this amount is  being

spent in promoting tourism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, according to the Tourist Promotion

Board's  report for the year 1971/1972, the  total

cess collection for that year was estimated to  be

in  the region of $5.9 million. What has accounted

for  the substantial drop some three years later'?

Frankly  I  have my doubts as to the effectiveness

of  the  Board.  The increase  in  the  number  of

visitors  to Singapore - I agree with  the  Member

for  Katong  ~ has perhaps been due  more  to  the

promotion   efforts  of  SIA  and  other   private

organisations than to the efforts of  the  Tourist

Promotion Board. If this is the case, then what is

the    justification    for    the    cess?    The

ineffectiveness of the Board is amply demonstrated

by the fact that the most up-to-date report of the

Board  is  for  the  year 1971/1972,  three  years

behind time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an organisation whose primary function is

public  relations, I would have thought  that  the

publication  of annual reports is a matter  to  be

taken seriously and not just perfunctorily. A well

prepared  and  up-to-date report I should  imagine

can be used most effectively for publicity purpose

abroad   and  may  save  us  some  money  on   the

production of other promotion brochures. There  is

I  feel an urgent need to re-examine the role  and

function  of the Tourist Promotion Board.  In  the

area   of   entrepot  trade,  traders  have   also

experienced much higher running expenses: just  to

mention a few - higher storage charges both at PSA

and private godowns, higher transportation charges

and  much  higher bank interest rates  during  the

year caused by tight credit squeeze. The last item

has  squeezed the life out of many traders and the

high  cost  of money has affected all and  sundry,

whatever  their activities. Surely it is possible,

and in my opinion necessary, for the Govern-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



ment  in   introducing  any  fiscal  or  monetary

measures  to differentiate those making a positive

contribution from those making a negative  one  to

our economy. Any hasty decision aiming at internal

administrative  convenience  without  an  in-depth

study  of  the  possible adverse  consequences  is

likely  in  the long run to result in disincentive

and to cause loss of confidence on the part of the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has touched on the setting up of the

Economic  Activation Committee. In welcoming  this

move,  may  I  suggest that apart from  any  other

purposes contemplated the Committee be directed to

review Government policies or the lack of policies

towards some of our traditional activities, with a

view  to  ensuring  that they do receive  adequate

support  and incentives if need be and  that  such

activities  are not unduly disturbed or  disrupted

on  account of thoughtless action on the  part  of

any   particular  Government  or  quasi-government

departments.  May I also suggest that  any  future

increases  in  Government charges or any  official

measures  likely  to result in  heavier  financial

burdens to the public be referred to the Committee

so  that the question of justification as well  as

their  wider  implications may be more  thoroughly

and  objectively assessed. In this way perhaps  we

can look forward to a better co-ordinated approach

on  the  part  of  the Government in  all  matters

affecting the growth of our economy and  the  cost

of  living of our people. I should clarify that in

putting  forward my views I have no  intention  of

seeking subsidies for our business community.  Our

businessmen  are  hard-headed  and  certainly  not

without  backbone, initiative or drive. What  they

ask  for  is  fairness, better  understanding  and

greater appreciation on the part of the Government

of   the  mounting  problems  encountered  in   an

increasingly more difficult and competitive world.

Some of these problems are beyond them and do call

for Government support and attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite our global concept in economic

development it is evident that the ASEAN community

of nations will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



remain   our  most  important  partners   in   our

continued  endeavours for greater economic  growth

in  the  years ahead. With improved relations  and

the  general  realisation  of  the  need  and  the

importance   of  interdependence  throughout   the

region,  we can look forward and should  work  for

the   closest  cooperation.  We  should  join  our

friends  in identifying areas that are capable  of

coordinated   developments.   In   the   area   of

industrialisation  there  is  a   growing   public

sentiment that in recent years the Government does

not  appear to have done enough in promoting local

participation. Whatever incentives that have  been

formulated with the foreign investors in  mind,  I

feel it is important to ensure that a fair balance

is  struck between foreign investments on the  one

hand  and local on the other. The setting up of  a

bureau  for  joint  ventures is  therefore  to  be

welcomed,  but  in  all joint ventures  we  should

ensure   that   the   arrangements   between   the

interested parties are such that our own nationals

will  have an opportunity to participate  actively

in the day-to-day affairs of the companies so that

over a period of time they will be able to acquire

the  necessary expertise and the managerial skills

which are so essential to our further growth. Past

years' experience has shown that over-reliance  on

multi-nationals  tied to only  one  or  two  major

markets  abroad does not do us much  good  from  a

long  term point of view but it is likely to cause

social and economic instability from time to time.

In  our  continued endeavours to  attract  foreign

investment,  we should therefore aim  for  greater

diversification not only in terms of the types  of

operations   but  also  market  dependencies.   At

present we seem to be concentrating our investment

promotion efforts rather too heavily in the United

States. This is reflected by the fact that out  of

a  total of nine centres three or four are in  the

United States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at our international trading position

it  is disturbing to note the widening trade  gaps

with  our  three  major partners,  namely,  Japan,

America  and  the EEC countries. The  gap  between

Singapore and Japan is parti



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



cularly alarming, amounting to some $2,000 million

in Japan's favour, followed by EEC's $900 million,

and  thirdly USA's $757 million. We do not ask for

the  so-called "most favoured nation" status.  All

that   we  want  is  equity  and  reciprocity   in

international  trade. I do like to know  what  the

Minister proposes to do to narrow the trade gap in

each case, especially in the case of Japan. Surely

they cannot take us for granted just because we do

not  show our dissatisfaction in a violent  manner

as  some  people  do. The fact that  part  of  the

imbalance may be due to our increased spending  on

capital  goods does not in my opinion  lessen  the

obligation on the part of our trading partners  to

try to correct the unsatisfactory position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning now to the proposed tax increases, I

think  you  will agree that the Budget  this  year

cannot be described as a painless one. What little

concession offered has limited appeal, and appears

to  contradict the announced intention to make  it

more  attractive for young couples to  have  their

parents  stay with them. On the one  hand  we  say

that  it  would be good for the younger generation

to have their old folks live with them so that the

parents   can  help  look  after  the   children's

children,  and  towards this end we  are  offering

incentives.  Yet,  on  the  other  hand,  we   are

enticing  the old folks to stay on in  their  jobs

beyond  60  years  of  age. Basically,  I  am  not

against  extending retirement age well  beyond  55

years of age which, I think, is a good move, but I

am  somewhat puzzled by the apparent contradiction

in our policies. I also find it difficult to agree

with  the  Minister's  statement  that  all  items

affected  by higher taxes are "not basic  to  life

for the average family". What is our definition of

an   average  family?  Take  the  item,  cars  for

example.  In our efforts to discourage  ownership,

it appears to me that we do wield the big stick of

taxation   rather   too  often,   too   soon   and

indiscriminately,  without  carefully  considering

and  offering  the carrot of suitable alternative.

The  livelihood of many families depends on  their

ability  to  get  around quickly  but  our  public

transport system at best is still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



inadequate to satisfy this need. It is, therefore,

in  my opinion unfair to raise road tax further at

this  juncture, particularly on the less expensive

small capacity cars which are more functional than

prestigious.  The cubic capacity of a  car  should

not  be the sole criterion in determining the rate

of  road tax payable. If our intention is also  to

tax  more heavily on those who are better able  to

pay,  then, it is only logical that we should also

have regard to the value of a car.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxing more heavily on hard liquors, such as

whisky  and brandy, is fair enough as quite  apart

from  their harmful effect on health they are also

entirely  imported. The same cannot  be  said  for

beer.  This is fast gaining popularity even  among

our working class, it is wrong to deprive them  of

one of the very few legitimate poor pleasures left

in  life, which is comparatively inexpensive up to

now.  The proposed increases are therefore  to  my

mind  rather  harsh and will put this item  beyond

the  means of many. Perhaps the Minister does  not

enjoy beer!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally Sir, it is reassuring to note the

Minister's  reluctance  to increase  taxation,  to

quote  his words "Lest it should raise the  prices

of  essential goods and services". I do hope  that

this  wisdom on his part will be shared and  borne

in  mind by all his Cabinet colleagues as well  as

our  civil  servants in the months ahead  so  that

hopefully we can look forward to a really painless

year.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Minister for Finance  has  made

his  Budget statement in this House on the 3rd  of

this  month.  Although this  Budget  is  not  like

previous  budgets  which  could  he  described  as

painless,  it  is  still not a  budget  that  will

increase  the burden of the people.  In  order  to

meet  our  stop-gap  needs  in  development,   the

Minister for Finance has announced an increase  of

taxes only on liquor, tobacco and cars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



He  has also announced certain tax relief measures

for  employees who continue to work after reaching

55  or  60  years  of age. For them  their  earned

income  relief  will be increased  from  $1000  to

$2000 for those over 55 years old and to $3000 for

those  over  60  years old. These relief  measures

will  reduce  our  revenue by $4 million.  Setting

additional revenue against additional reliefs,  we

will  still be left with some residue. This  shows

that our new financial policy is one that aims  to

reduce  economic recession and to  promote  future

development,  so  that our economy  will  be  more

stable  and  sound.  This is what  we  all  should

support wholeheartedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, on the question of income tax I

have  some  criticisms as well as  suggestions  to

make here, Regarding earned income tax relief  for

those  who are over 55 years old, this measure  is

not  to  be  criticised unfavourably. However,  it

seems that the Finance Minister has neglected  the

fact that while the aged employees need more money

to   keep  themselves  healthy,  he  should   also

remember  that the younger wage-earners need  even

more  money  for maintenance of their  health  and

house-keeping. The aged employees normally already

have  grown up children, some of whom are  working

and  can  afford  to help the family  financially.

However,   with  the  younger  employees   it   is

different.  They  have  children  in  primary   or

secondary schools or even in the universities.  So

expenditure in this respect is a very great burden

to  the younger parents generally. Although  there

is  a tax relief of $750 for the first child, with

the  present  cost of living this  relief  is  not

enough  even to feed the child for one year,  much

less   the   amount  necessary  for  the   child's

education.  Moreover, the aged  employees  usually

get higher salaries through annual increments over

the  years  as compared with the younger employees

who  are  lower paid. So I hope that the  salaried

class  should  have  their  tax  relief  increased

accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Income Tax Act, I 947, the

personal relief for the taxpayer was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



$3,000  and  $2,000  for his wife.  But  with  the

amendment  in 1961 the taxpayer's personal  relief

was  reduced  to $2,000 but he was also  given  an

earned  income relief of 20% up to  a  maximum  of

$1,000.  Tax relief for the wife was also  reduced

to  $1,000. So the total amount of tax relief  for

both husband and wife had been reduced by at least

$1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a great difference in the standard

of  living  some  years ago as compared  with  the

present,  when we are faced with inflation  and  a

rising  cost  of  living.  As  we  all  know,  the

ordinary  people generally find it very  difficult

to  earn a living. Therefore, it is reasonable  to

assume  that  there  is a pressing  need  to  make

adjustments  to  the  income  tax  policy  and  to

increase personal tax reliefs in particular.  Sir,

taxpayers  in  the  salaried class  are  the  most

honest in the submission of tax returns. They  pay

their  taxes without trying to evade tax, as there

is   no   additional  income.  In  the   case   of

businessmen,  however, we know that some  of  them

are not honest. They expose themselves to the risk

of  being investigated into or fined. They  always

try some means to evade tax or to reduce their tax

dues.  This is an open secret. Therefore,  Sir,  I

would  like to express my hope that the Government

would step up the tax investigations and curb  tax

evasion  activities in order to plug the loopholes

and increase our tax revenue. The present taxation

policy  should not just aim at increasing revenue.

It should be a means to reduce the gap between the

rich  and the poor. So I would like to suggest  to

the  Government that the tax rate of 50%  for  the

rich  people who have an income of half a  million

dollars or more a year should be increased to 60%.

The Government should also consider increasing the

tax  levied on companies from 40% to 50%. Sir,  if

the   Government  can  consider  and   accept   my

suggestions,  then  our  financial  revenue   will

surely  not  be  in any difficulty.  Therefore,  I

sincerely  hope  that  our Minister  for  Finance,

after  cool, calm and careful consideration,  will

be  able to find that there is a pressing need  to

increase  the rate of personal tax relief  in  the

near future.

<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  under the double impact  of  world

economic  recession  and  inflation,  our   actual

economic growth last year had achieved the rate of

6.8%.  It was really a rare and commendable  feat.

It  was  due to the unity of our people and  their

effort  in  production. We have a good  Government

administration  and our society has  been  stable.

These  are  the basic prerequisites  for  economic

development. When there is economic growth, we  do

not have to spend our foreign reserves to meet our

increasing  expenditure. This is very  commendable

and  something to be congratulated for. As for the

coming financial year, other than the increase  in

tax for those who drive, drink or smoke, there are

no   other   important  or  unfavourable  taxation

measures  to  affect the daily livelihood  of  the

ordinary people to any appreciable extent. Besides

this,  the Minister for Finance has also  proposed

several   measures  to  stimulate   our   economic

activities to ensure that our economic growth will

recover as quickly as possible. Therefore, it is a

Budget that is to be welcomed by all the people in

all walks of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I regret to say is that in his Budget

speech,  as in the past, he has again omitted  any

mention  of our agricultural development  and  its

related  matters.  This shows  that  in  spite  of

several   surveys   conducted   by   the   Primary

Production Department on the agricultural  sector,

the  Government still does not have any  clear-cut

policy  in  respect  of agricultural  development.

According to statistics, in our country there  are

nearly   20,000  people  engaged  in  agricultural

activities.  To  add  it  up  to  people  who  are

directly or indirectly connected with agricultural

activities,  the  total number is  not  less  than

200,000.In  other words, about 10%  of  our  total

population  are  dependent on  agriculture  for  a

living.  All  along, our agricultural  sector  has

been  left alone to sink or swim by itself.  Under

the   pre-requisites  of  industrialisation,   the

agricultural  sector  has  to  give  way  and  the

farmers have to make sacrifices for the sake of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



the   future  of  our  country.  They  have   made

sacrifices  and  incurred certain  inconveniences.

However, it is not justifiable to call on only one

section of the population to make great sacrifices

for the development of the country. However, those

farmers  who  are  affected  should  at  least  be

granted  reasonable compensation to match  current

prices.  Otherwise,  the  meager  sum  of  a   few

thousands  of  dollars as compensation  would  not

help   them   rebuild   their   household   in   a

resettlement.  So  the authority concerned  should

adjust its resettlement compensation rates now and

then, just as the Public Utilities Board has  been

readjusting its rates on consumption now and then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a small country with a small population.

Therefore,   the   domestic   market    for    our

agricultural products is limited. In  addition  to

this,  the agricultural sector has not been  given

any   proper  planning.  Therefore,  whether   the

harvest  is rich or poor, the farmers do  not  get

much in the end. Whenever there is a rich harvest,

there  is  a  glut in the market  and  prices  are

reduced; and so the farmers have to sell at  lower

prices to avoid incurring greater losses. If there

is  a poor harvest, then the supply is reduced and

prices  increase.  However, although  the  farmers

would  hate  to produce less, their production  is

limited   and  therefore  their  profit  is   also

limited.  Then  there is also the exploitation  by

the  middleman.  In fact, with the  middleman  the

income  of  the  farmers is reduced  even  further

because the difference between the wholesale price

and the retail price is usually four or five-fold.

A  clear  example  is when the price  of  eggs  is

reduced,  consumers still pay the  same  price  as

before. Agricultural produce cannot be sent direct

to  the  consumers. This is a shortcoming  in  the

trade cycle. Trading without going through a third

party  is beneficial both to the producer and  the

consumer. Sir, the Finance Ministry has done  well

in  curbing inflation and I hope it can  also  pay

more  attention  to  this matter  of  facilitating

direct trade in agricultural produce.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land is a necessary factor of production of

the  farmer. Most farmers lack sufficient land for

cultivation. Therefore, many of them are occupying

land  on  Temporary Occupation Licences  from  the

Land  Office.  Only a few farmers have  their  own

private land. The TOLs do not stipulate the number

of  years that the land can be occupied and  since

the  rental  is uncertain, whenever  the  land  is

acquired by Government, the farmers have  to  move

out.  Therefore  they dare not  put  in  too  much

capital  to  develop their land. Although  genuine

farmers  may be allotted alternative  land  it  is

usually  much  less than before. I feel  that  the

Government should give genuine farmers  some  form

of  land  title  for a definite number  of  years,

instead of TOLs in order to enable them to realize

the  concept of the tillers owning their own land.

In  this way they will safeguard their land.  This

will  strengthen  their love for their  homes  and

their  land,  and  they  will  strive  harder   to

increase production and further development.  This

in  any way is to the good of our national economy

as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although land is limited -- there is not

much  for  agriculture  - we  can  still  allot  a

certain part of land for agricultural purposes. In

the     course     of    our    development     in

industrialisation, urbanisation and in the pursuit

of   antipollution  measures,   arable   land   is

constantly being reduced. To make the agricultural

sector  viable  and to ensure  a  profit  for  the

farmers  so  that  they can carry  on  with  their

activities,  then new techniques and  new  farming

implements must be adopted, and farming should  he

intensified.  There should also be  anti-pollution

facilities. This involves a large capital  and  it

is   not  what  the  farmers  can  bear  or   help

themselves.  So  I  feel  that  the  Ministry   of

Finance,  in the same spirit that has  been  given

for  industrial  development, should  provide  the

necessary  and convenient means of  loans  at  low

interest   to   the   farmers   for   agricultural

development  which  has  a  long  history  in  our

country.  The Ministry of Finance can  assess  the

needs of the farmers from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



the  survey  and  recommendation  of  the  Primary

Production  Department and give the  farmers  some

economic help. At the moment the farmers have been

obtaining their loans through tontines, middlemen,

or  credit  accounts with the feedstuff merchants.

The   farmers   repay   their   debts   by   their

agricultural produce. Very often the middlemen and

feedstuff merchants use the produce of the farmers

to  set off their credit accounts. The prices  are

therefore usually determined by the creditors  and

the profit of the farmers, as we can see, will  be

even  lower. If the prices of agricultural produce

are  low, the diligent and frugal efforts  of  the

farmers  are  all "gone with the wind".  Sometimes

even  their "sweat capital" is entirely  lost.  In

order  to  recover, the farmers have to  get  some

capital. If some financial assistance can be given

by  the  Ministry of Finance to help them  recover

quickly,  it  will  help develop  agriculture  and

improve the livelihood of the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum to the Presidential Address

in  this  House  sometime ago, it is  stated  that

"Singapore  continues  to  be  self-sufficient  in

fresh  pork, eggs and poultry". This is a  correct

objective.  The authorities concerned should  give

priority  to  the question of giving the  producer

reasonable profit and the consumer a fair price in

order  to  achieve this objective. At  the  moment

thousands  of  pig  farmers  are  faced  with   an

important question: whether to keep the number  of

pigs  within  100 heads, or to exceed that  number

and  face  resettlement  for  the  sake  of  anti-pollution measures. This is something that affects

the  farmers  greatly. Some of them  have  already

been  resettled more than once before, and because

they  are not certain of their future and  of  the

rate  of  compensation for resettlement  clean-cut

answers are required to help them decide. In order

to  be self-sufficient in water supply, there will

be stringent anti-pollution measures in the catch-meat  areas. Of course, nobody can find fault with

this objective. As citizens, the farmers will also

give   their   fullest   support.   However,    as

constituents of the population of our country, the

farmers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



are  entitled  to  a basic livelihood,  and  their

basic  means  of  livelihood should  also  not  be

neglected. The younger generation may find it  not

too  much of a problem to change their career, but

with  these  aged farmers it is very difficult  to

get alternative employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been self-sufficient in the supply

of  pork,  chicken and eggs, and  the  prices  are

quite  reasonable.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the

contribution of the big and small time farmers. If

all  the small time farmers are eliminated in  the

course  of national development leaving  only  the

big time farmers to continue, this will result  in

a  scarcity of supplies and prices will be  easily

manipulated by the few big time farmers,  This  is

what  the consumers do not like to happen. I  feel

that  the  authorities concerned should  pay  more

attention  and care for the small time farmers  to

help  them to develop. The authorities should  not

just pay attention to the big time farmers alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up, our agricultural sector is on the

decline with ever greater speed, and this  is  the

time to save the declining agricultural sector.  I

hope  that the Minister for Finance can spend some

time to seriously look into the question of how to

promote  our  agricultural industry  so  that  our

people  can  be fortunate in the supply  of  food,

which is something good for our country too.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to join my colleagues

in  paying tribute to the Finance Minister  for  a

very  circumspect Budget statement.  The  Economic

Survey of Singapore, 1974, earlier distributed  by

him  was  a commendable effort by his Ministry  to

furnish us with updated statistical information on

our overall economic activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at our economic situation against

the  backdrop  of a world economy,  stricken  with

paralvsing stagflation, to which we are invariably

vulnerable, we realise only too well that  it  was

an  uphill  task  for a non-oil producing  country

like Singapore to come out unscathed. The economic

problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



faced by the world has shifted in our favour as  a

result of a number of factors attributable to  our

correct  analysis  of  the problem  -  intelligent

anticipation and the alternative measures  adopted

to overcome the difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to be told that we have in 1974

achieved  a  growth  rate  of  6.8%.  During   the

corresponding period some of the richest and  most

progressive countries in the world have registered

nil  economic  growth. Our economic  strategy  has

paid   us   dividends.  Diversification   of   our

industrial activities resulting in an even  spread

of  our earnings without having to depend too much

on  any  one  particular manufacturing  group  has

helped us to pull through the crucial period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When certain sectors such as electronics,

textiles/garments and wood-based industries took a

beating,  resulting  in about  20,000  jobs  being

declared  redundant, wholesale  and  retail  trade

including  restaurants and hotels  contributed  to

49%  of our 6.8% growth. We are told that the  GDP

at  current  factor cost in 1974 was estimated  at

$12,145 million, an increase of $2,524 million  or

26.2%, over that of 1973. Very remarkable indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport, storage and communication sector

provided  14%  of  our overall  growth.  Next  was

finance,   insurance,  real  estate  and  business

services  sector  9%.  The  same  9%  growth   was

recorded   by   community,  social  and   personal

services sector. Manufacturing 7%; construction 5%

and ownership of dwellings 5%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this overall picture of our real growth

in  1974, we were also informed of the widening of

the   base   of   our  manufacturing   sector   by

introducing new skills and products in  metal  and

precision engineering, chemicals, e1ectronics  and

transport  equipment. This  has  resulted  in  the

advent  of  new  industries to  augment  our  main

manufacturing activities, such as shipbuilding and

ship-repairing  (14.8%  of  total  value   added),

refining   of  petroleum  (20.3%)  and  electrical

machinery (21.6%). No



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



single industrial group accounts for more than 22%

of  our  total earnings. In other words,  we  were

prudent  enough  to  put  our  eggs  in  different

baskets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that the major elements

of  our  economic policy would be  guided  by  our

objective   of   maintaining  high  growth   rate,

notwithstanding  the present recession,  and  that

industrialization would continue to accentuate our

growth.  Singapore  will  continue  to  serve  the

region  as  a services centre for technical  know-how, tourism and finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While taking all necessary measures to counter

and  minimise the effects of recession,  we  would

also  put the present slack period to full use  by

giving  priority  to the training  of  workers  to

raise the level of skills to meet the needs of the

resurgent   generation  of   skill-intensive   and

technology-oriented enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Capital Assistance Scheme to assist skill

intensive  industries, the reorganisation  of  the

Economic Development Board to make greater efforts

to  promote  investments and the establishment  of

two   more   promotion  centres  in  Houston   and

Copenhagen  in  addition to the  nine  centres  in

existence,  tax incentives for pioneer industries,

joint  venture projects, strengthening  of  export

promotion   efforts  and  the   stepping   up   of

construction  activity  by increasing  the  Public

Sector  Development expenditure to $3,080 million,

the manpower development policy to increase skills

in  our  work  force  by  expanding  training  and

retraining programmes undertaken by the Industrial

Training   Board  and  Joint  Industrial  Training

Centres  all  these are steps taken in  the  right

direction,  which in perspective deserve  adequate

recognition and approbation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the standards of technological skills

improve  and when our workers exert themselves  to

achieve  better  results, better wage  rates  will

have  to  be  paid by industries. As  the  Finance

Minister   has  stated,  "Productivity   increases

depend  as  much  on  workers  as  on  employers."

Mention must he made at this juncture that  it  is

still the practice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



of  some employers to flog the horse with outdated

machinery, bad supervision, old methods of working

and  colonial  type of personnel  managements  who

deprecate   the  workers  joining  unions.   These

managements enjoy a field day in hiring and firing

workers  at  the  slightest whims and  fancies  of

officialdom. Only recently the Labour Minister had

to order the reinstatement of five salesmen sacked

by  a  firm,  by  the blessing  of  the  Singapore

Employers Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of unions, let me touch on

another subject which is very pertinent in view of

the  predicament in which we find ourselves today.

In  the absence of any definite indication  as  to

the  period by which the sick economy of the world

will  recover, the inflationary trend that we have

been  experiencing in the past  will  continue  to

hurt us, especially the wage earners. Although the

National  Wages Council prevents the  wage  claims

situation   from  going  haywire  by  its   annual

stocktaking  of  the overall economic  performance

before giving its recommendations, for the sake of

collective  agreements, a process  which  goes  on

continuously  upon the lapse of old agreements,  I

should  have  thought the Finance  Minister  could

have  given the Government's guidelines  of  wages

policy  to  be  pursued  by  the  managements  and

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the more unpalatable part of the

budget, let me take a look at the taxation policy.

Of  course  it  is  the primary  function  of  the

Government  to  give priority to  economic  growth

which  would  in turn bring increased  revenue  to

finance  public expenditure. This needs money  and

the public has to pay for it in the form of taxes,

either directly or indirectly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to upset the apple cart of prices of

essential  goods and services, there  will  be  no

increases  to  existing  taxes,  which  is  to  be

appreciated.  Additional revenue, therefore,  will

have  to  come  from increased taxes  on  tobacco,

liquor  and cars. The reason is that to quote  the

Minister these are "not basic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



to  life  for the average family". In the case  of

tobacco  and  liquor, I have no quarrel  with  the

Minister.  He who smokes pays. Measures introduced

by  the Government to discourage smoking over  the

last few years have been quite successful. If  the

additional tax would further reduce the number  of

smokers, it is all for the good. The same goes for

liquor. Those who want to drink will have to pay a

little more. Fair enough. But I cannot see eye  to

eye  with the Minister on his contention that cars

are "not basic to life for the average family". In

fact,  we  have  reached a stage of sophistication

that  a  motor  car has become a necessity  rather

than  a  luxury  for a very large number  of  wage

earners,  professional people and businessmen.  We

have to take cognizance of the fact that we do not

yet  have an efficient transport service which can

take  a busy man to his destination as quickly  as

he  wants.  Let  me  hasten  to  add  that  public

transport has improved compared to this time  last

year. Our efforts to reorganise the Singapore  Bus

Service  and  to bring some order into  its  inept

management   have  not  completely  produced   the

desired results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the large crowds of commuters at bus

stops have thinned down, the situation is far from

completely  satisfactory.  This  means  that  many

people have to depend on the family motor car  for

quick  transportation from place to place in their

everyday  working  life.  This  is  additional  to

taking  their children to and from school. On  the

one  hand  the Government wants our people  to  be

hardworking,  innovative and  forceful  in  taking

initiatives to make Singapore tick as a centre  of

manifold  activities in this region. On the  other

hand our energetic people are rendered immobile by

Government action, such as higher road taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming in the wake of quadrupling of oil prices

and the resultant inflationary spiral in prices of

essential  commodities  from  which  many  of  our

citizens  have not fully recovered, this  hike  in

higher  road tax will deliver the knock-out  punch

on the middle income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



group.  Owners of cars in the 1000 cc to  1600  cc

class  fall  within the heaviest taxed group,  and

they are the middle income people who have to take

the main brunt on their shoulders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If higher taxes is the means to curb vehicular

traffic, here again there is a dangerous loophole.

The  rich people who own 2000 cc and 3000 cc  cars

and  those  with  large families owning  only  one

large car for the whole family would now prefer to

own  two  small cars instead of one  large,  cheap

white  elephant. This means two cars on  the  road

instead of one. Who wins? The rich man can  afford

to  pay  the  hike and he will take  this  in  his

stride.  What about the not-so-rich man  who  owns

one family car?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing the motorists and penalising them is not

the  enlightened way of finding a solution to  our

traffic problems. While the vehicular traffic  has

increased,   our  roads  have  not  been   widened

commensurately.  We have not introduced  the  mass

rapid  transit system to cater for  the  needs  of

increasing numbers of commuters. As long  as  this

problem  remains  unsolved,  it  would  serve   no

purpose whatsoever to put an increasing burden  on

car  owners,  most of whom are industrious  people

struggling diligently to increase our economy  and

improve  the  quality of our people. We  are  only

applying  a  brake  on  our economic  progress  by

putting obstacles in their path.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister's announcement of a tax

concession  for people over 50 and  60  years  old

from  1976  at  a cost of some $4 million  adds  a

merciful  touch to his Budget. Singapore can  well

afford this concession. By the same token, for the

benefit  of the lower and middle income groups  of

wage earners, on whom the burden of inflation  has

fallen very heavily, there is a strong case for  a

concession in earned income relief to be increased

from  the  present  $1,000 to $2,000.  I  wish  to

conclude   my  speech  on  this  happy   note   of

anticipation, and I thank the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  sure  that  I  am voicing the concern  of  the

general  public in making reference today  to  the

startling  increase in the existing  road  tax,  a

measure   which   is   being   introduced   almost

simultaneously  with the restrictions  on  traffic

entering  the Central Business District. It  would

appear that the large increase in road tax is  not

meant  to  raise revenue or meet part of recurrent

expenditure. If it was just a matter of increasing

revenue,  then surely there are other areas  which

could   yield   revenue  without   causing   undue

hardship. Its main objective would seem to be  the

drastic  reduction of the number of  cars  on  the

road.  This  being the case, I would suggest  that

the  massive  increase  in  road  tax  is  both  a

negative approach and inequitable: it will,  among

other things, only serve to increase the burden of

the middle and lower income groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be noted that the largest increase is for

motor  cars between 1000 cc and 2000 cc.  Cars  in

this  range are generally owned by the middle  and

lower income groups who, in the past, used to  pay

approximately 17 cents per cc. But  now  with  the

increased road tax, they have to pay 25 cents  per

cc this is almost 50% more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must repeat my contention that

the  increase  in  road tax constitutes  a  wholly

negative approach because our Government,  founded

on  the  principles of socialism, is dedicated  to

raising  the living standards of the lower  income

group. From the time we came to power we have been

concentrating on introducing measure after measure

to  narrow the gap between the "haves" and  "have-nots".   I   submit  that  the  growing  affluence

engendered  by this process of social equalisation

has   made   the   motor  car,  as   a   form   of

transportation, more of a necessity than a luxury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mr Speaker, Sir, a measure is being

introduced  to  penalise those who,  through  hard

work and diligence, have increased their income to

the point where they are able to afford a car of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



their own. If the Government's objective is merely

to  reduce the number of new cars on the roads, it

would  not  be  too  difficult  to  arrive  at   a

solution.  For  example, the Ministry  of  Finance

could  increase the import duty so  that  existing

car  owners  will not be unfairly penalised  -  it

will  be  the  potential car owners  who  have  to

decide  on  the  possible alternatives.  In  other

words,  if  they decide to have a motor car,  they

will  have  to sacrifice something else.  In  this

way, the choice will be left to them -a motor  car

at  the expense of some other luxury or necessity.

The point of this approach is that the choice will

quite  fairly  be left to the individual.  No  man

need  thus  be penalised for events  of  the  past

which  have created a situation over which he  has

no control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another way to reduce effectively

the number of new cars -by requiring all those who

wish  to  purchase new cars to apply for  permits.

This   is   a   procedure  that  is  being   quite

successfully  adopted in several other  countries.

This  approach  will  also  be  more  satisfactory

because  it  should  be fairly easy  to  ascertain

whether   an  applicant  for  a  new  car   merits

consideration  by the simple method  of  obtaining

clearance  from the Comptroller of Income  Tax  to

determine whether or not he is paying income  tax.

If he is not, how then can he afford a new car? It

would  certainly  prove a more  equitable  way  of

reducing the number of cars on the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present increase in road tax will not

effectively reduce the number of cars on the  road

as  envisaged by the Government. This  is  because

owners of cars have, by this gross increase in car

tax,  either to pay the increased tax  and  retain

the  car or sell the car to some other person  who

can afford the tax. We will therefore have exactly

the  same  number of cars on the road!  This  will

clearly defeat the Government's objective. In this

context, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me refer to the park

and  ride scheme and the Central Business District

entry restrictions. Should we not wait to see  the

effect  of  the  new  travel  restrictions  before

imposing taxes on motor cars?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



It  seems  to  me  that this two-prong  attack  on

motorists   is  tantamount  to  anticipating   the

failure of the Central Business District scheme. I

would  suggest therefore that the car tax increase

be deferred until the Government is able to assess

the  effect  of  the  park and  ride  and  Central

Business  District schemes. Only  if  these  prove

unsuccessful in restricting the number of cars  in

the   Central  Business  District   to   a   level

considered  desirable  by the  Government,  should

other measures be considered. May I add also  that

the  present scheme seems calculated to drive cars

off  the  road  even in areas where  there  is  no

traffic problem at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would urge the Government to

seriously   reconsider  this  car  tax   increase,

especially because there is no adequate  transport

for  commuters as yet. Our bus services are  still

inadequate  for  they are clearly unable  to  cope

with  the  demand.  Until  the  bus  services  are

considerably  improved and able to meet  with  the

requirements  of the public, there  should  be  no

further  increase  in car tax. Otherwise  we  will

only  be  crippling the members of the public  who

own  motor cars without being able to provide them

with  a  reasonable alternative method of  getting

around and coping with the problems of living  and

working in a busy, populated city such as ours is.

The point really is: have we the right to increase

the burden on the shoulders of the average working

class  Singaporean? His car may seem a  symbol  of

undue  affluence but it could in reality be merely

his most prized and dearly bought possession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly urge that this

increase in road tax be seriously reconsidered, in

the context of what I have noted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to the income tax

concession granted by the Finance Minister for old

people  capable of working beyond  55  years,  the

former  retiring age, or even 60, the new retiring

age.  It is observed that this concession has been

made because of our rapid economic development  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



last few years, which has highlighted the need for

our  skilled  and  experienced  people  to  go  on

working beyond the normal retirement age.  It  has

apparently  been recognised that such people  will

need  to  spend  more  money staying  healthy  and

getting to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a step in the right direction and

is  a  most  welcome concession. I would  like  to

suggest,  however, that the care and concern  made

evident  in this gesture be extended also  to  the

younger, struggling members of our nation. We know

that  the  consumer price index has risen  sharply

recently, but income tax relief in general remains

pegged  to the rate fixed more than 20 years  ago.

It  is high time a thorough re-assessment was made

and more tax relief accorded to lighten the burden

of the beleaguered working classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the indulgence of the

House, I would like to refer to my representations

to   the  House  in  March  last  year,  when  the

Honourable  Minister  for  Finance  presented  his

previous  budget. I pointed out that the  personal

relief on income was fixed more than 20 years  ago

and  called  for this to be increased  to  a  more

realistic  and  pragmatic level, in  keeping  with

inflationary  trends which had been  mentioned  by

the Finance Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister had indicated that consumer prices

had risen to an average of 22.0% over the previous

year alone, that is to say, 1973 to 1974. How much

more then must consumer prices have risen over the

last  20 years? And yet there had been practically

no  increase  in  personal relief except  for  the

$1,000  allowed as earned income. I added that  if

the  consumer price index had risen by an  average

of  25% during the last year, surely it must  have

gone  up  many times since the rate of $2,000  was

fixed more than 20 years ago. The final result was

that  the poor were becoming poorer and were being

weighed down, especially by the income tax burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also stressed that unless personal relief was

increased, there would be little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



incentive for the tax-paying wage earner  to  work

harder, because they would only be able to  retain

a  fraction  of the fruits of their labour  -  the

bulk  of  their  increased earning being  siphoned

away  by  income tax on the one hand and inflation

on the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was dismayed to observe the

reactions of the Honourable Minister for  Finance.

Despite   all   the  facts  and  figures   clearly

indicating  the inequity of the position,  in  his

reply  the Honourable Minister for Finance  warned

that  the  Government might consider reducing  the

rate  of personal income tax relief next year,  to

make people pay more tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, left me flabbergasted. It

suggested  retaliation on bringing  out  the  true

facts  in Parliament and seeking equitable remedy.

He  has dismissed most unconcernedly the hard fact

that the personal relief on earned incomes had not

been  increased over the last 20 years, except  by

$1,000,  despite the fact that the consumer  price

index  had  gone up several times and by  his  own

admission, the consumer price index for  the  year

1973-74 had gone up by nearly 25%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is noted that this year there

has  been  no increase in tax relief for the  wage

earner,  and I presume that it may be argued  that

any  imaginary  relief lies in the fact  that  the

rate of personal income tax has not been reduced!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this context may I draw the

attention  of the House to a report by an  advisor

of  the  NTUC that an income of $250  a  month  is

needed  for  a  Singapore  family  to  maintain  a

minimum living standard. The NTUC arrived at  this

figure  from  a study by the Defence Minister,  Dr

Goh Keng Swee, on household incomes in the fifties

when  he  was Assistant Director of Social Welfare

(Social    Research)   in   the   Social   Welfare

Department. The minimum income then, according  to

Dr Goh's study, was $109.95 to support a family of

four.  The NTUC, which updated this report  for  a

minimum living wage index,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



estimated  in  March 1974 that the minimum  earned

was  $250  and that the sum of $250 was  only  for

bare  necessities. Since then,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

during the last year we have been hit by inflation

and a tremendous increase in the price of consumer

goods including basic necessities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that there has been no increase in tax

concessions   would  suggest  that   the   average

taxpayer   is  now  paying  tax  on   incomes   at

subsistence  level.  A  government  dedicated   to

socialist  principles should  not  tax  income  at

subsistence  level. Otherwise, we will  be  taking

away  the  bare  necessities  of  life  from   our

citizens.  This  matter,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   is

becoming  more  and more urgent in  the  light  of

inflation, which is making the purchasing power of

the  dollar less and less. We have only to  go  to

the  shops  today to see how little our dollar  is

worth.  I  would therefore urge the  Minister  for

Finance  to  give serious and urgent consideration

to increase the personal relief for taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in rejecting our call for a reduction

in the income tax relief, the Minister for Finance

stated  that  the  international  view  was   that

Singapore's  income tax relief was  very  generous

and  that  Singapore could do well to broaden  its

tax  base. International views are many and,  like

statistics, can be used to prove or obscure many a

point even though it may not, in actual fact, have

any  relevance  at all. As regards broadening  the

base,  I  am sure nobody can quarrel with  that  - everyone  should  pay  his  fair  share,  but  the

minimum income for tax exemption must be realistic

and  based on actual cost of living conditions  in

any particular country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with regard to broadening the base, may

I  refer to the recent correspondence in the press

concerning the liability of hawkers to pay  income

tax.  In  answering a query from a member  of  the

public,  the Income Tax Department mentioned  some

very  interesting facts. In the last  five  years,

from  1969  to  1974, income tax collections  were

$251  million,  $318 million, $404  million,  $563

million and $845 million respectively. Adminis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



trative  costs during the same period were  1.08%,

1.01%,   0.97%,   0.75%  and  0.62%  respectively.

Broadening the base of taxpayers would be one  way

to  offset the loss of revenue even though it  may

not  be a hundred per cent successful, because  it

is  the responsibility, as I mentioned earlier, of

every resident to pay his tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was, therefore, a bit surprised to read the

views of the Income Tax Department, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`that thus while it is a truism that everyone

should  bear  his  dutiful  burden,  it  is   also

important, in the revenue field, to keep  also  in

sight, costs and yields.'



<br><br>This  statement,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  was  made  in

reference  to the problem of collection  of  taxes

from  hawkers.  The  Income  Tax  Department   had

earlier mentioned that, and I quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`cost of collection from hawkers, if compliance

was  to  be as full as possible, was estimated  at

more than a hundred per cent.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is tantamount to saying

that  all of us are not equal before the law,  and

cannot  be  given  the  same treatment.  In  other

words,  because  it is going to  be  difficult  to

collect  tax from hawkers and others who are  able

to avoid, they are being allowed the concession of

not paying their share of income tax. But the poor

wage earner, the employee, whose salary is on  the

payroll and cannot escape has, on the other  hand,

to  pay tax because it is easy to collect tax from

him.  This,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is most  inequitable

and  a  very unjust way of looking at the problem.

In  other  words, those who are clever in  getting

away  with it are allowed to do so, whereas  those

who   perforce  have  to  be  law-abiding  through

circumstances beyond their control are  penalised.

Mr   Speaker,   Sir,   if  this   philosophy   was

implemented  in other Government departments,  and

criminals  who are difficult to catch are  allowed

to go their own way whereas the amateur crook, who

does  not  know  his  way around,  is  caught  and

penalised, then Singapore will be in a sorry state

of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, total Government revenue seems

quite adequate for the administration of the State

and there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



appears to be every reason why some relief  should

be given to income taxpayers at the lowest levels.

It is true that such concessions may mean the loss

of  a  few  million  dollars  to  the  Income  Tax

Department,  but surely that is a  sacrifice  that

the  Government can afford, since there are  other

ready and available sources of revenue. But it  is

observed that the Minister for Finance has decided

against  introducing any new taxes  for  the  time

being. It is not clear why taxes cannot be imposed

on luxury goods, so as to avoid taxing citizens at

subsistence level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would therefore most humbly and

respectfully  urge that serious  consideration  be

given  to  the question of income tax relief,  for

indeed  there  is  need for such relief  and  such

relief is even better late than never.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to the subject of

the  total  estimated revenue which  is  given  as

$2,647.5  million, representing a mere 5% increase

over  the  revised estimate for 1974. The Minister

for   Finance  has  drawn  our  attention  to  the

appreciable  slowdown in the  rate  of  growth  of

revenue  as  compared with previous years.  It  is

inevitable  that  the slowdown in economic  growth

should  be reflected in Government revenue, unless

the  Government takes drastic measures and imposes

new taxes to increase revenue. This, of course, is

undesirable at the present time. Our taxation rate

is  already  high and any increase in  income  tax

rates  will  serve merely to act as a disincentive

to businessmen and investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is inevitable that

Government      expenditure      should       rise

disproportionately  with  economic  growth  for  a

number of reasons. I would like to suggest to  the

Hon.  Minister for Finance that there is one  area

which  has not as yet been fully exploited,  which

can  not only yield revenue, but also be a  social

service  to  the community. I refer to  Government

being an entrepreneur and participating in certain

areas  in  the private sector which would  provide

use-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



ful  services to the public and at the  same  time

safeguard the national interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically there are firm grounds for the

Government  to  play  the  role  of  entrepreneur.

Government  and  government-sponsored  enterprises

can  ensure that prices be kept to the minimum and

that  profits do not flow out of the  country  but

are   re-invested  or  distributed  locally.  This

participation could also assist the Government  in

its  efforts to re-structure our economy from that

of  an  entrepot centre to an industrial  economy,

that  derives  its  well-being from  services  and

other  fields.  In  addition,  local  and  foreign

capital  can  also be tied up with commercial  and

entrepot  trade activities and can thus be  geared

to  a  greater  extent  to new  projects  formerly

rejected by entrepreneurs because of the risks and

capital involved. Developments in the economy  can

thus  be  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  the

national plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated that Government has already

ventured  into wholly-owned trading  companies  or

joint  venture'  with foreign and local  investors

and   the   Government  bodies  also   run   along

commercial lines. I need mention only a few,  such

as  the  Telecommunication Authority of Singapore,

Commercial  and  Industrial Security  corporation,

and Jurong and Sembawang Shipyards, as examples of

this  project. All these undertakings have  proved

to be highly successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to suggest that having regard to

Singapore's small size and her vulnerable position

in international trade and commerce, which make us

susceptible  to external factors and international

cartels, including the growing influence of multi-national corporations, more should be done in this

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen, whether local or foreign, are profit-oriented and trade is determined by the dictates

of  economics. Supplies and commodities are always

made  available  to  the  highest  bidder  to  the

detriment  of  those who cannot pay.  These  harsh

facts  were brought home to all of us very clearly

during the last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



few  years.  The price of rice, for  example,  our

staple  food,  went up sky-high  until  Government

intervention  brought  prices  down  to   a   more

reasonable  level.  I  would  therefore  like   to

suggest that Government explore the possibility of

venturing  into  new  areas  -  those  dealing  in

essential  commodities - because these  are  areas

which  are  basic  to our survival  and  could  be

regarded  as  "public utilities" in  the  broadest

sense of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the very concept of public

utilities  is  that  certain requirements  of  the

public have to be state-managed so that they  will

not  be run entirely on a commercial basis and  on

the  dictates  of profit-making. It  is  generally

accepted that public utilities should not  be  run

by  the  private sector; hence we have the  Public

Utilities  Board providing water, electricity  and

gas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more recent times, our Government, recognising

the  need  for  the  State to own  some  of  these

utilities,  has  taken  over trading  corporations

which  provide  the  telephone  services  and  the

external  telegraph services. Hence, we  now  have

the   Telecommunication   Authority,   which   has

absorbed  the former Singapore Cable and Wireless,

the  Singapore Telephone Board and so forth. These

are essential services for the community and it is

generally  accepted  that  Government  should  run

these organisations and provide the services.  And

all  these  utilities, if I may use the word,  are

profit-making and thus Government earns revenue in

an indirect way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that with the rising cost of living,

inflation  and  so  forth, the  Government  should

branch  out even more into what has, in the  past,

been regarded as private sector areas, even though

critics  may  say  that  if Government  goes  into

business  in  a  big  way, there  will  be  unfair

competition. But I say unfair competition  against

whom?  Not  against the citizens,  certainly,  but

against   the  firms  which  are  making   massive

profits.  Government participation in these  areas

will  help  keep down the cost of living  and  the

profit will go back to Government, and this can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



ploughed    back   into   social   and    economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be a good case for Government to

move  into business and commerce in a bigger  way,

to  ensure  that the basic needs of life  for  our

people  are  not  dependent  upon  the  whims  and

fancies  of businessmen who can jack up prices  at

will.  The recent rise in the price of rice  is  a

fine example. Until Government intervened and made

direct   purchases  and  rice  was  sold   through

cooperative  societies  and  consumer  clubs,  the

price  was unduly high and the profits went  to  a

few  merchants  who,  in total  disregard  of  our

people's  want,  were bent only on making  massive

profits for themselves. This was a totally  unfair

and unjust case of events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, some businessmen might say

that  if  the  Government also enters the  trading

arena,  it  would  cripple  business  activity.  I

cannot agree to that argument. Singapore is a fine

example   of  a  socialist-capitalist   mix,   and

Government  participation  in  private  enterprise

will only be on a limited scale to ensure that, at

any  point of time, there will still be a flow  of

essential  commodities at minimum  prices  to  the

public.  This will prevent price manipulation  and

hoarding by big businesses. We all have to  accept

that  for big business the sole object is  profit-making,  and if our people are left to the  tender

mercies  of big business, the latter will  extract

the  maximum  price they can, thus creating  undue

hardship as has already been proved. Therefore, if

the  Government also moves into these areas  which

are the life-lines of the community, we can ensure

that  at  any given point of time the public  will

not be held to ransom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC supermarkets and our consumer clubs have

shown how much cheaper prices can be, and the  few

dollars  that the working class can save in  their

purchases  from these places are a great  boon  to

them.  How much greater a boon will it be if there

are   similar   state-owned,  government-sponsored

organisations   providing   supplies   of    basic

commodities at minimum prices. On



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



top  of all this, the added advantage will be that

the  profit will go to Government, as I  mentioned

earlier.  Mr Speaker, Sir, may I suggest that  the

Minister for Finance give this proposition serious

thought  as this will help keep down the  cost  of

living  and ensure a continued supply of essential

commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

congratulate  the  Minister for  Finance  for  his

industrial  development  policy  which  has  given

adequate attention to investment needs in times of

recession.  It  is  this type of forward  planning

which has seen our young Republic through the many

crises  which  we  have faced and  survived  since

1959.   The   measures  taken  under  the   export

promotion  policy  are  also  a  fine  example  of

looking ahead so that we would be well equipped to

grapple  with  problems  before  they  arise.  The

proposed   establishment  of  an   export   credit

insurance guarantee scheme in conjunction with the

banking  and insurance companies is most certainly

welcome and, in fact, I would say even overdue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note this year the Government will be releasing

large  sums of money for development purposes  and

that  this  is also meant to be a step to  counter

recession.  I was glad to observe in this  context

that he has pointed out that our anti-recessionary

measures  will probably have inflationary effects.

I  would, therefore, urge that a very tight  watch

he  kept on these two interacting factors; further

inflation  will only bring greater hardship  to  a

large  number of our citizens who at  present  are

only  just able to cope with the increased  prices

of  foodstuffs and other basic commodities brought

about by imported inflation last year. I say this,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in the full knowledge  that  the

Government  has  set  up  an  Economic  Activation

Committee  to speed up the implementation  of  any

anti-recessionary    measures,    because    over-enthusiasm  on  any  front  cannot  but  have  ill

effects and negate our main objectives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed

very  delightful and heartening to  note  that  we

have  yet  another painless budget. This has  been

the case in the past few years and it is certainly

a  very  satisfying reflection.  At  a  time  when

nations  around  the  world  are  trying  to  free

themselves  from the strangling grip of inflation,

retrenchment and recession, it is miraculous  that

our  young nation could present a painless Budget.

Credit  for  this  remarkable  economic  stability

should  go to our responsible Government and  also

to the wisdom of our Finance Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchment in Singapore has reached a figure of

only  17,000, a very small number compared to  the

alarming numbers frequently mentioned even in  the

most  advanced nations. Most of the employees  who

lost  their jobs are not the bread-winners of  the

family  and, as such, no notable cases of hardship

have  resulted from retrenchment in  our  country.

Even  the  increases  in taxes  seem  to  be  well

designed for they affect only those who can afford

them.  The proposed increases only affect luxuries

and not our daily necessities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now, there had been wide-spread

fear  of  a terrible increase in road taxes.  This

fear proved unfounded, and many people are greatly

relieved. The increase mentioned in the Budget  is

reasonable  and  justified.  However,  there   are

considerable  discrepancies in the proposed  taxes

for  motor  cars. Why must there be any difference

at all? Are we aiming to swell our revenue by this

tax  increase?  Are  we trying to  discourage  and

deter our car



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>





owners  from  using their cars and  ultimately  to

sell  them off? I know our Singaporeans too  well.

Before  they do this, we must convince  them  that

our public transport system is adequate, efficient

and  dependable.  At  any given  time,  breakdowns

outnumber  the new buses added to each  route.  It

appears  as  though there are four breakdowns  for

every  two  buses added. The scheme B  buses  have

helped  a little, but the problem is still  acute.

When  one  takes a look at the crowd at bus  stops

during peak hours, it is not difficult for one  to

notice the severe shortage of buses on the roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the needs of the present number of bus

commuters  cannot  be met, are  we  going  to  add

further  to the incredible number of commuters  at

each  bus  stop?  As a responsible  and  dedicated

Government,  let  us  not  spare  any  efforts  to

provide  adequate number of buses  and  reasonably

comfortable  services. Once this is achieved,  car

owners   will  review  their  position  and   will

certainly  consider whether it  is  worthwhile  to

incur  all  these  expenses  rather  than  take  a

comfortable  ride  for only 40  cents.  This  will

automatically   eradicate   traffic    congestions

everywhere. Increases, on the other hand, will not

deter them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to bring to the attention of this

House  another problem which affects  the  general

public. At one time the emphasis was to centralise

the  various  Government offices. The fashion  now

seems  to be to decentralise the departments.  And

they  are very far apart too. The ordinary citizen

has to travel long distances to fill a common form

or   even   to   pay   an   ordinary   fee.   This

decentralisation    is    causing     considerable

inconvenience  to the general public,  and  it  is

causing immense administrative difficulties  also.

The  distance  between the various departments  is

also generating an unhealthy competition, which in

turn   results   in  selfishness   and   lack   of

cooperation.  Some departments are even  reluctant

to  release information for the benefit of others.

To improve the situation, I suggest periodical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



meetings of Heads of Departments in order to bring

about     deeper    understanding    and    better

coordination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the move to retrain rather than retrench is

an  admirable  step. Along with retraining,  there

must also be prudent redeployment of staff so that

there  will  be a well-balanced staff position  in

all Government departments and statutory boards. I

suggest a concerted study so that we could avoid a

waste of funds and ensure an even distribution  of

staff  at  all  levels and in every department.  I

propose, therefore, that the training of staff and

their  redeployment should be  made  a  compulsory

feature  in the public service so that  one  could

fit into any capacity in any department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We accept in toto the 1975 Budget and the

Memorandum on the Estimates.



I  strongly support the tax increases as  proposed

since  they  only affect luxuries and other  items

that  can be considered as health hazards. I  need

not  emphasise  that less cars on the  road  means

minimum  pollution, few accidents  and  infrequent

traffic  congestion;  less  smoking  means   fewer

cancer cases and heart-attacks; and a reduction in

the  consumption  of  alcohol  would  bring  about

better  health  all  round. The $1,000  additional

earned  income relief for those above 55 years  is

another  imaginative  and  beneficial  move.  This

humanitarian gesture results in only a  negligible

loss in our revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our prudent planning and farsighted efforts have

averted disasters and they have even helped us  to

bring  about a better balance of payments position

than  what we recorded in the years 1972 and 1973.

There have been extensive expansion all round  and

subsequently  vast  increases in  expenditure  but

they have not, in any way, adversely affected  our

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have great faith in our capacity not only to

survive but also to overcome adversities. We  work

with one aim only - the welfare of our people -and

to  achieve  this,  we will not hesitate  to  take

stringent measures to prevent exploitation of  the

people,  to  stamp out corruption  and  to  uphold

justice. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



is why all of us should consider our Government as

a "People's Action Government".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I support the Budget statement that has

been delivered by our able Minister for Finance.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I would like to join hon. Members

of  this  House  in congratulating the  Honourable

Minister  for Finance for presenting another  fair

and  reasonable Budget on 3rd March, 1975, for the

financial  year  1st April, 1975  to  31st  March,

1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year we achieved real growth around

7% in  spite of global inflation and recession.

This  achievement of a 7% growth was made possible

through  the tripartite cooperation of Government,

Management and Labour. I believe that so  long  as

we  maintain  this tripartite cooperation  we  can

overcome  many difficulties and solve the  various

problems we are now facing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year a total of 16,940 workers were

retrenched  and some more will follow  this  year.

Luckily   a   good  number  of  them   could   get

alternative  employment. Most  of  the  retrenched

workers  are from the electronic, textile, garment

and  wood-based industries. In fact, about 70%  of

the  total number of retrenched workers last  year

were  from  the electronic industry. This  clearly

shows  that we should not depend too much  on  the

electronic  industry and we must concentrate  more

on sophisticated industries, such as machine-tool,

industrial     machinery,     diesel     machines,

construction machinery, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, concerning those workers who had been

retrenched  and  are still unemployed,  especially

those  who  have little skill, may I  request  the

Government  to encourage them to take up  a  study

for  some  skill work under the training programme

of  the National Productivity Board. The study  is

to  be  arranged in such a way that they learn  in

the NPB Training Centre and some of their time  is

to   be  spent  in  the  factories  for  practical

experience. Also,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



during  the period of training for a skilled  job,

the  trainee should be given some reasonable Study

Allowance  to  be paid by the Government  and  the

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the workers in Singapore fully appreciate

the  necessity  of upgrading their  skill  and  to

increase  productivity. They have the capacity  to

learn  a new trade as quickly as possible and  the

ability  to  achieve higher skill when  given  the

opportunity to do so. I am glad to know  that  the

Industrial   Training  Board  has  increased   its

industrial training capacity and I hope  employers

will  give  the  workers the  necessary  time  for

training to increase their skill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard so much emphasis being given

to workers to increase their skill and to increase

productivity  especially from the  employers,  but

when it comes to the question of incentive payment

for the workers, there is a complete silence. Sir,

I  would  like  to quote from the NPB  publication

Minimax  (January 1975) to prove what I have  just

said.



<br><br>`Castrol Ups Productivity 33%



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing to Minimax, Castrol management commented:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In common with the other industries which are

conscious  of  a  need  for  higher  productivity,

Castro! (Far East) Pte. Limited decided to improve

its  manufacturing know-how by sending two of  its

staff  to  the  Work  Study  course  conducted  by

National Productivity Board in July 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the course, we were motivated to

apply  in  our  own  factory  the  knowledge   and

techniques   acquired  as  part  of  an   in-plant

training  programme. The results  of  the  project

undertaken are encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of introducing these improvements,

the   department  is  capable  of   producing   an

additional  monthly output of  720  tons  of  oil,

thereby increasing production capacity from  2,160

tons  to  2,880  tons. This means an  increase  of

33.3%  of  the  Department's  production  capacity

which  result  in  greatly increased  revenue  and

profits to the Company."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to achieve 33.3% increase of productivity in

that Castrol Blending Department, the workers  had

given  full  cooperation  to  the  management  and

worked   very   hard.  But  who   benefited?   The

Government would get the revenue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



and  the  Company would get the additional  profit

from  the increased productivity. For the  Castrol

workers,  they  were not given a  single  cent  as

Productivity  Incentive Payment! I am  sure  there

are  many  employers  doing the  same  thing  like

Castrol. Perhaps the Training Programme in the NPB

on practical course on Work Study does not include

the necessity and importance for Management to pay

the workers Productivity Incentive Payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another type of selfish greedy

employer who wants to swallow all the profits  for

himself.  I  would like to quote  from  a  Straits

Times   report  dated  22nd  February,  1975,   as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Union: MD's bonus raised fourfold `But company

refused to pay full NWC'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A laundry company increased its managing

director's bonus by four times but refused to  pay

the  rest  of its workers the full 1974  NWC  wage

increase,  the Industrial Arbitration Court  heard

yesterday."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If employers are serious and sincere about

increased  productivity, common  sense  will  tell

them  that they have to offer to the workers  what

Productivity Incentive Payments they are  prepared

to   pay   and  when  they  would  like  to   form

Productivity    Committees.    Employers    should

appreciate   that  increased  productivity   means

workers  are  entitled  to Productivity  Incentive

Payment.  There  is nothing free  in  this  world.

Employers  want profit and workers would  like  to

share the profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, annually the National Wages Council gives

its  recommendations on guidelines for annual wage

increases  for the workers. Since  the  NWC  is  a

tripartite  representation, I  suggest  it  should

also give a guideline to the employers, especially

on  payment  of directors' or managing  directors'

bonus. There must be a limit too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Housing and Urban Development Co, will

build  42,000  housing units in  nine  residential

areas   for  the  middle  income  group.  I   also

understand that residents now staying in HDB fiats

are interested to purchase the HUDC flats. I would

suggest  that priority of allocation for the  HUDC

flats  should be given to the middle income  group

first, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



if  there is any surplus flats, then they could be

given to present HDB residents. It is not fair  to

the middle income group to allow HDB residents  to

join in the queue for the HUDC flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has very limited land and, in the

national  interest, I would request the Government

to consider buying up all available vacant land in

Singapore    for    residential   or    industrial

development.  All  land that  is  vacant  and  not

developed for three years, the Government must  be

given  the power to take over after paying a  fair

price.   We  must  not  allow  local  or   foreign

investors to buy up our land and to speculate  for

fantastic  profits.  I  am sure  when  the  global

inflation  and  recession  subside  and  with  the

improvement  of our economy, prices  of  land  and

housing  will go up again. To avoid this land  and

housing   speculation,  the  buying  up   of   all

available  land  by the Government  will  help  to

stabilise  the prices of housing especially  under

the HDB and HUDC projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of tourists visiting Singapore

last  year exceeded the one million mark. Some  of

these  tourists  have been fleeced  by  touts  and

shopkeepers.  This  gives  a  very  bad  image  of

Singapore and, if fleecing is not curbed, it  will

be  damaging to our tourist industry. All tourists

like to do their shopping in Singapore because  of

the  variety  of  things at reasonable  prices.  I

believe  that one best way to tackle this  problem

of fleecing is to establish a Co-operative Tourist

Shopping Centre through a joint enterprise between

NTUC and Government. Perhaps the Tourist Promotion

Board  can  also help in this matter. I  hope  the

Government and NTUC would consider this guaranteed

profit-making enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my

colleagues in this House in giving full support to

the Budget statement presented by the Minister for

Finance to Parliament on 3rd March, 1975.



<br><br>5.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, a Budget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



statement for any particular fiscal year  will  be

welcomed  by members of the public if  it  is  not

accompanied  by an increase in taxation.  However,

under normal circumstances, Government expenditure

will  rise  year  after  year.  This  increase  in

expenditure will have to be met by an increase  in

revenue. It is correct and proper for the Minister

for  Finance  to  increase taxes  on  tobacco  and

liquor.  However,  the ways  in  which  taxes  are

raised  and whether the method is right  or  wrong

will have to be discussed by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Minister in raising the

taxes  on liquor and tobacco. I would even suggest

that  there should be a further punitive  increase

in  taxes for these two items because they are bad

habits and a waste of money to indulge in. I  hope

the  people will shun these bad habits  which  are

detrimental  to health and a waste of money.  This

will  be  in  line  with the  Government's  recent

campaign to promote health among the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to increase road tax steeply and the way in

which  this  road  tax  is  increased  merits  our

discussion. At this juncture, we are not going  to

argue  whether  owning a car  is  a  luxury  or  a

necessity in this space age. To increase road  tax

may  prevent people from buying new cars and  this

will  help alleviate traffic congestion.  However,

looking at the different rates of road tax  levied

on  the different types of cars, it seems that the

middle  and lower income groups will have to  bear

the  brunt of such taxation because, according  to

the  Minister, cars under the 1000 cc  range  will

have  their tax increased by 6 cts per  cc,  those

between 1000 cc and 1600 cc will have their tax in

creased by 8 cts per cc, and those between 2000 cc

and 3000 cc will have their tax increased by 5 cts

per  cc.  We  know that only the big  tycoons  and

capitalists  can afford to own big cars.  It  does

not matter to them how much road tax is increased.

Mainly  the  salaried class in  middle  and  lower

income groups own medium-sized and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



small-sized cars. There are also small businessmen

who use their small cars to transport goods and as

a means to save labour and time in order to make a

meagre profit. In actual fact, to them the car has

become a necessity in their work or business and a

means  of  making a living. It is  something  that

they  cannot do without. I regret to say  that  in

order   to   cope   with  the  yearly   increasing

expenditure,  our Hon. Minister  for  Finance  has

resorted  to increase road tax on the  middle  and

lower income groups. Therefore, the rates of  road

tax  on medium and small-sized cars are more  than

those  on big-sized cars. In the midst of mounting

inflation today, this has caused great hardship to

these  people who earn their living from  hand  to

mouth.  No  wonder there is widespread  discontent

and  complaint by the people that as the  Minister

for  Finance was an ex-senior civil servant in the

colonial era the Budget drafted by him serves only

the interests of the capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, in respect of the amount of tax

relief as concession to the aged employees, namely

those who are over 55 years of age, the amount  of

relief  on  earned income is to be increased  from

the  original $1,000 to $2,000. Those who are over

60  will  have  their  earned  income  tax  relief

increased  from  $1,000 to $3,000.  The  rationale

behind  this  is that people who have reached  the

retiring age and are still able to work need  that

much  money to keep themselves healthy. This seems

plausible.  This measure will act as an  incentive

for  elderly  people  who  are  more  skilled  and

experienced to go on working. If I could represent

our  elderly  people, I would convey my  heartfelt

gratitude to the Minister for Finance.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what these elderly people need more is

medical care. There are people who have worked and

struggled  throughout  their  life  to  save  some

money,  and  when they retire their lifelong  hard

savings are passed on to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>





doctor  for medical fees within a short period  of

time. They will then be on the verge of starvation

until the day when they are summoned to heaven  by

the  Lord.  In this respect, retired  teachers  in

aided  schools  have  gone  through  such  painful

experience  because, under current regulations  on

the day an aided school teacher retires he has  to

give  up  his  Medical Benefits Entitlement  Card.

Therefore,  the  raising of tax relief  on  earned

income  for  the elderly people announced  by  the

Minister is, on the face of it, a token of respect

and  a  most  generous gesture. It  is  just  like

buying  a Big Sweep ticket so that everybody  will

have the hope of winning a prize.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister has done quite a lot of daily

work with his computer. He has the calculation  at

the  tips of his fingers that there are only  very

few  people who are above the stipulated  age  and

working;  so his jolly talk, because most  of  the

employees  will have to retire at the age  of  55.

Only  those big towkays can carry on working after

reaching  their  retiring age. Therefore,  if  the

Minister could use more sophisticated computers to

do more sophisticated calculations and if he could

be  more  charitable and be more generous  to  the

end,  he  could more heartily announce that  those

who  attain  the age of 70 and are still  fit  and

allowed to work, the tax relief for earned  income

would  be  increased to $5,000, and for those  who

have  the art of longevity, living up to 80  years

or over and are still allowed to work, they should

be  regarded as national treasures and be  totally

exempted from earned income tax. In addition, they

should be given a free trip round the world.  Does

this  not  go  to show that the Minister  is  more

charitable,  generous and is more  concerned  with

the  welfare of the elderly people? I believe that

all  the elderly people perhaps will bless him and

pray  everyday for his longevity. From  these  two

points  that I have raised, it could be seen  that

the Budget has only made provision for the benefit

of  the  capitalists, the wealthy people  and  the

Minister himself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, there is a saying in town today, which is current, and

it  runs as follows: Now that the painless  Budget

has been announced, the pain begins. I will not go

into  an examination of the details of the Budget,

as  I  have observed that my colleagues have  made

very  incisive and pertinent references  to  these

details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I begin by noting the Minister's Budget

statement   read  with  his  Economic  Survey   of

Singapore  in 1974 as a modest quiet statement  of

our  efforts and gains during a difficult year and

our  economic  plans  for  the  years  ahead,   in

particular for 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A growth of 6.8% acquired in a year of world

economic   instability  as  the  economic   survey

evinces  is  not something insignificant  but  the

Minister  chooses  to regard  it  as  merely  "not

unsatisfactory",  quite  characteristic   of   his

modest nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the strategy to contain the impact of further

world  recession  on  our economy,  the  statement

stresses the diversification of our industries and

services and that we should continue to strive for

higher  growth rates. New skills and technological

knowledge  are  being introduced  into  metal  and

precision  engineering, chemical and  electronics.

More  skilled and knowledge workers will be needed

to make Singapore a centre for services, technical

know-how,  tourism  and  finance.  This   strategy

underlines  the manpower factor in our  plans  for

future economic growth. I wish to dwell briefly on

this   subject  and  make  reference  to   matters

associated with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now we do not question the term "global city"

when  a reference is made to our city, as our city

trades with the whole world and it centralises the

organisation   and  management  of   our   rapidly

industrialising  state, which  is  structured  for

development    along   the    lines    of    other

technologically  advanced industrial  states  with

which we compete for economic gain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This modernisation of our economy has

necessitated  the training and production  of  the

engineering  man,  the building  and  construction

man, the businessman, the banking man, the science

man,  the electronics man, the economics man,  the

computer man, the organisation man and a  host  of

other  men and the skilled workmen. We have  spent

and are continuing to spend large amounts of money

educating and training our own citizens to be such

men.  In  doing  so we are giving these  men,  the

technocrats,  considerable economic relevance  and

worth   in   the  modern  world  of  science   and

technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global cities of industrial states in the world

too  have  a  need of such skilled  and  knowledge

workers, and there has therefore been movements of

such  workers between and among these cities.  The

emergence of the multinational companies and their

operations in global cities throughout  the  world

with   their  capacity  to  absorb  manpower  have

provided  the  opportunity  for  the  skilled  and

knowledge worker to shift his habitat,  if  he  so

desires.  The  modernisation of  our  economy  has

introduced our global city into the big league, so

to  speak,  and  present us with  the  problem  of

manpower  loss which can eventuate into  a  matter

for concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant development in the world today is

the increasing similarisation of urban life-styles

so  that an urban dweller from a city in the Third

World  does not find life in a global  city  of  a

more  advanced industrial country art unmanageable

personal  disruption, if it is any  disruption  at

all.  Usually life in a global city of an advanced

industrial  country is accepted with ease  by  the

prospective  resident worker  who  regards  it  as

holding  more  promises  of  opportunities  for  a

comfortable life. The movement of the skilled  and

knowledge  worker  from  former  colonies  to  the

cities  of the former colonial countries in Europe

had begun when these advanced industrial countries

yielded  to  the logic and guilt of  the  colonial

experience in Africa, Asia and the West Indies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



and  allowed  into their cities large  numbers  of

hopeful  and  aspiring Asians, Africans  and  West

Indians  before  controls  were  applied.  In  the

Commonwealth today there has been some movement of

skilled  and  knowledge  workers  from  cities  in

developing  countries to those  in  more  advanced

countries  such  as  Canada,  Australia  and   New

Zealand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other factors assist such movement of manpower.

For  example,  travelling  distances  today  is  a

convenient matter. The rights and expectations  of

the  worker  in the western democracies  are  more

liberal and entrenched in the relationship between

the   trade  unions  on  the  one  hand  and   the

management   in   private   industries   and   the

government on the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global cities in Europe and the Commonwealth arc

cosmopolitan.   They   are   not   found   to   be

discouragingly  foreign to  the  worker  from  the

Third World. Language is not a shortcoming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of our industrial development when

we  are  planning  expansion and innovation  in  a

number of growth sectors the skilled and knowledge

worker  is  much  needed by us.  Though  presently

there  is  no indication of anything resembling  a

consistent opting for what is considered to  be  a

better deal elsewhere, we should be aware all  the

time  that  the  skilled and knowledge  worker  in

Singapore has options.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our citizens may have their reasons to want to

move  to  a  global city of an advanced industrial

country, hut one which must not begin to encourage

them  is  the impression of uncertainty in  public

policy as the result of constant changes in policy

in  some areas of Government notably education and

insufficient  official  clarification   of   these

changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can appreciate the exigencies behind some

policy  changes by the Government today,  national

policies   must   invoke  in  our   citizens   the

confidence  that they can plan and organise  their

lives amidst reasonable economic opportunities and

comfort with some permanence. Further changes  and

innovations in national policies should not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



cause  public  uncertainty for  want  of  official

clarification and explanation of such changes  and

innovations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our society grows the problem will be how to

provide  for  our peoples with real  opportunities

which  can ensure satisfactions in work,  personal

aspirations,  relaxation and in  the  planning  of

their  children's future within the  framework  of

governmental policies which must necessarily  take

account  of  increasing  number  of  bodies,   the

expectations of the new generations of youths  and

the  unsettled  international economic  situation.

Apart from achieving a viable and lasting economy,

the  planning of government, in my view, must also

achieve a social ethos and a social elan which can

jell  a  people  in  society  with  cultural   and

intellectual  strength  and  meaningness   towards

which objective I urge for emphasis.



<br><br>6.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his

Budget  statement  for  the  financial  year  1975

presented  to this House on 3rd March  this  year,

apart from taxes on tobacco, liquor and cars,  the

Minister  for Finance has announced that  for  the

time being there would be no new taxes or increase

in  taxes.  In the face of international  economic

depression, it is commendable for the Minister for

Finance  to  be able to present to  this  House  a

Budget which does not adversely affect our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Economic Survey of Singapore for 1974 the

Minister for Finance highlighted the fact that the

manufacturing sector had a very good  performance,

showing  a  28% increase in value added,  although

the  real  output at constant prices increased  by

only  2%.  The  value  of production  amounted  to

$3,245  million.  Faced  with  a  declining  world

demand,  we were still able to export 54%  of  our

domestic  production. This shows that there  is  a

very  close  link in our international trade  with

the  world at large. It also underlines  the  good

quality  of  our goods which are known  for  being

good and at the same time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



cheap  and  very  well  accepted  internationally.

Because  of  all these factors our external  trade

continued to grow very substantially last year and

the increase amounted to $13,144 million. Compared

to  1973  there  was an increase of 37%.  External

trade has always been one of our main lifelines in

our economy. In the past we only provided entrepot

services  without our own production  for  export.

But   since   a   decade  ago   the   Government's

industrialisation programme has been in full swing

and    development   in   the    industrial    and

manufacturing sectors has been tremendous  indeed.

We  have  been  able to produce  a  lot  of  daily

necessities, canned food, machinery, etc. This has

enhanced our status as an exporter and has  earned

us a lot of foreign exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Estimates for the financial

year  1975-76,  the Housing and Development  Board

has been granted a loan of $718 million. This loan

is   meant  for  public  housing.  It  shows   the

determination  of  the  Government   to   speedily

promote    home-ownership   among   our    people.

Undoubtedly this beneficial measure will be warmly

welcomed  by the people at large. As a  matter  of

fact, this massive public housing scheme will  not

only  accelerate  the  allocation  of  housing  to

thousands  of people on the waiting list,  but  it

will  also provide jobs for thousands of  building

construction  workers as well as affording  better

development opportunity for industries and  trades

related  to  the building industry. This  gives  a

boost  to  our  economic  prosperity  and  a  good

counter-recessionary measure. At  the  same  time,

the  Minister  for Finance pointed  out  that,  as

compared  to 1973 where there was a drop  of  15%,

the  private construction sector showed a  further

`drop  of 11% in 1974. This shows that the private

building industry fared very poorly last year  and

is  on  the decline. The Government has  no  doubt

taken  some  remedial action  which  includes  the

relaxation  on  the control of  housing  loan  and

permission for aliens to buy flats in buildings of

more than six storeys high. But after implementing

these measures over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



past  few  months,  transactions  in  the  private

housing  industry do not seem to  have  picked  up

very much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help the private building industry to

develop and to ensure that this industry will make

a  better contribution to our national economy,  I

feel  that  the Minister for Finance may  find  it

necessary  to  further relax the  control  on  the

purchase  of houses by aliens. This is because  if

the  private  building industry is  still  in  the

doldrums  it will be a setback to our  efforts  to

diversify our economy. At the same time,  all  the

professional  people connected with  the  building

industry will be adversely affected. These  people

include  architects,  civil engineers,  electrical

engineers,   surveyors,  quantity  surveyors   and

draughts-men. Furthermore, lawyers and accountants

as  well  as  valuers who are  also  in  some  way

connected with the private building industry  will

also   be   affected.  According   to   unofficial

estimates  there are about 5,000  such  people  in

all,  and  80%  of them are local citizens.  These

people  have received high education in  Singapore

and  some  have  returned from  foreign  countries

after  receiving higher education. Their  business

and professional practices are closely related  to

the  private  building industry.  If  the  private

building  industry  is  allowed  to  continue   to

decline,  they  will be adversely affected.  Since

the  Government pays so much emphasis on the elite

and  the  utilization of their skills,  it  should

also  pay attention to their livelihood so  as  to

prevent a brain drain overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has emphasised a need

for    the   diversification   of   our   economic

activities.  This  is a very correct  strategy  to

adopt.  Diversification of the economy means  that

apart  from the positive development of industries

there is also the need to expand our manufacturing

base,  particularly  in  relation  to  metal   and

precision    engineering,    chemical    industry,

electronic     industry    and     transportation.

Furthermore, international trade, shipbuilding and

tourism   are  also  our  great  foreign  exchange

earners. They are the great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



pillars of our diversified economic activities. As

a  matter  of fact, as Singapore is the centre  of

international transport and communication in South-east  Asia  there is plenty of scope  for  further

diversification  in our economy. For  example,  in

the timber and textile industries, no doubt in the

last year these two industries have been adversely

affected by international recession. But  in  1973

there  was  a  big  boom in the  timber  industry.

According  to available statistics,  in  1973  the

export  of timber amounted to 1,157 million  cubic

metres, valued at $305 million. Our main customers

were France, South Africa and England. But in 1974

this   business  dropped  by  40%.  According   to

businessmen  in the timber trade, apart  from  the

decline   in  the  demand  for  timber  owing   to

international     economic    depression,     some

unscrupulous timber merchants had exported  timber

of    a    quality   not   in   accordance    with

specifications,   and  this   has   affected   the

confidence  of international buyers in our  timber

trade.  If  that allegation is true  I  think  the

Timber  Export Department and Forestry  Department

should  be answerable, because it is the  business

of   these   two  Departments  to  ensure   proper

supervision and grading of our timber and to raise

the  quality  of timber as well as  to  carry  out

research  in this trade. Therefore, if  there  had

been  any non-compliance of specifications in this

respect,  can  the reasons be established?  Is  it

because  the  staff  had been negligent  in  their

duties?  I  hope the Minister concerned will  look

into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, our timber re-export trade

has a very good future. This is because we are  in

the centre of South-east Asia, and our neighbours,

Malaysia   and  Indonesia,  are  timber  producing

countries.   We  have  a  very  modern  commercial

infrastructure    -port    facilities,    banking,

warehousing,   insurance  and  telecommunications.

Therefore,  the  Government  should  attach  great

importance  to  the  timber  re-export  trade  and

improve  the  administrative  efficiency  of   the

Timber  Export Department, so as to make Singapore

a centre for timber drying and treating.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



Another  important activity is timber  processing,

such as manufacturing furniture, wooden doors  and

windows and other industrial timber products. This

industry  is  flourishing in Taiwan, Korea,  Japan

and other European countries. So we can take a cue

from them and try to catch up. In promoting timber

processing  and re-exporting we may be faced  with

some  problems, such as the provision  of  factory

sites,  capital and technical personnel.  In  this

respect   the   Government  should  give   certain

encouragement  and assistance.  For  example,  the

Government can provide factory sites near the  sea

coast  for the processing and drying of timber  to

facilitate the import and export of the commodity.

But   since  a  large  capital  is  required,  the

Government should consider granting a tax  holiday

for this industry and give whatever financial aids

or   loans  that  may  be  required.  As   regards

technical  personnel,  if  we  lack  local  people

perhaps a relaxation of immigration regulations in

regard   to  such  people  from  abroad   can   be

considered. According to estimates there are about

116   sawmills   in  Singapore  and   309   timber

exporters, making timber quite a big business.  So

reactivation  of  timber industry  will  not  only

contribute  to the diversification of our  economy

but also provide jobs for thousands of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the question of tax

increases. Generally speaking, there should be  no

complaint  against tax increases  on  tobacco  and

liquor because they do not affect the people  very

much. But what is unfortunate is that the Minister

for  Finance has also increased road  tax,  and  I

feel that this is quite unreasonable. For example,

for  vehicles in the range of 1000 cc to 1600  cc,

the  increase is about 50%. Vehicles in this range

are  actually  small  and  medium-sized  and  they

constitute more than 80% of the number of vehicles

registered. For vehicles of more than 3000 cc  the

tax  increase  is 5 cents per cc,  which  is  only

about  15%.  Vehicles in the 1000 cc  to  1600  cc

range  are commonly owned by people in the  middle

income  group  in the private and public  sectors.

Their income is not very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



much.  So  the  Government should sympathize  with

them and not further aggravate their burden in the

face  of  inflation. Therefore, I  would  like  to

appeal  to  the  Minister to avoid increasing  the

road tax in respect of vehicles in this range.  If

at  all  an  increase is necessary and inevitable,

then  it  should be reasonable and I would suggest

that an increase from 17 cents to 20 cents per  cc

would  be more reasonable than an increase  of  as

much as 50%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards luxury vehicles of 3000 cc and above,

I  feel that the increase is not adequate.  As  we

all  know,  a person who can afford a car  costing

$50,000  or  more must be a very rich man  with  a

very  handsome income. Since he has a big  income,

he  is  certainly able and expects to  pay  higher

taxes.  So  the Minister should actually  readjust

the  tax  increase, as it does not appear fair  to

impose  only a nominal increase in this  range  of

luxury cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance also announced two

tax  concessions. But these concessions  are  only

applicable  to  people who are 55  years  old  and

above.  As  from  the 1976 year of assessment  the

earned  income relief of those beyond 55 years  of

age will be increased from



$1,000 to $2,000, and for those over



60  years  their  earned  income  relief  will  be

increased from $1,000 to $3,000. But those who are

under 55 will get no further relief at all. Sir, I

support  these tax concessions in principle.  But,

as  a  matter of fact, I doubt whether many people

will  benefit from these concessions. I think  the

number  will be few and far between. In the public

sector, there is the compulsory retirement age  of

55  years. Public servants who retire will have no

income  at all; so how can they benefit  from  the

tax  relief  on  earned  income?  In  the  private

sector, I feel that the number of such people will

also  be very small. Again, I think the number  of

those who benefit from these tax concessions  must

have   been  very  carefully  calculated  by   the

Minister, and the benefits, if I may say  so,  are

more  imaginary than real. Since the benefits  are

more imaginary than real, the loss



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



in revenue is negligible, if at all. Therefore, in

my  view,  these  tax concessions  should  not  be

subjected  to the age qualifications of employees.

This is a very reasonable expectation. As a matter

of  fact, the present personal relief on income is

inadequate because it was fixed more than 20 years

ago  when  the value of money was much higher  and

the   prices  of  commodities  were  much   lower.

Compared to the present level, I think prices have

gone  up  a  great deal. But the  tax  relief  has

remained  unchanged.  So  how  can  this   measure

relieve   the   burden  of  the  salaried   class?

Therefore,  I  feel  that the  wise  Minister  for

Finance   should  make  some  wise  tax  reduction

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the proposal to remove the age limit

cannot  be  agreed to, perhaps I can make  another

suggestion, and that is, in respect of  those  who

maintain  their  aged parents and grandparents.  I

think  a  similar tax relief should be  considered

since  the  Government is encouraging citizens  to

have  their parents stay with them so that members

of  the  family can be better looked after.  These

people  should  he given tax concessions  so  that

they   will  be  better  able  to  maintain  their

parents.  Otherwise, with more  taxes  taken  from

them,  these  people  might not  be  in  a  better

position,  or in any position at all, to  maintain

their parents who may thus suffer. This is one way

that the Government can encourage respect for  the

aged people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, the annual Budget statement is

highly   commendable.  In  terms  of  policy   for

industrial and commercial development, we can  see

the  determination  of and the  positive  measures

taken  by our Government to counter recession  and

to  promote  economic development,  which  is  the

basic  spirit  of  the Budget.  The  Minister  for

Finance also predicted that our economy would turn

for the better in the latter half of this year.  I

hope that he is not wrong in his prediction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the turn for the better in the

international situation, another factor that  will

be  required for our development and prosperity is

the good quality of our people. Therefore, our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



people  should continue to develop and demonstrate

this  spirit  of diligence and dogged  effort  and

help  to  implement  the  wise  policies  of   our

Government  so  that in the coming  year  we  will

achieve greater prosperity and progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the policy of the annual Budget

statement.



<br><br>6.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the same breath, in

expressing  his  reluctance to  increase  taxation

"lest  it  should  raise the prices  of  essential

goods  and services, especially food and clothing,

public  transport and housing", the Hon.  Minister

for  Finance argued that "additional revenue  will

have  to  come  from increased taxes  on  tobacco,

liquor  and  cars". Transportation  is  vital  for

essential commodities like vegetables, fish,  meat

and  so  on,  to be taken to markets for  sale  to

consumers.  Vans,  cars,  motorcycles  with  side-carriages,  the  majority  of  which  are   petrol

driven,  are utilised to transport these essential

commodities to markets. The increase in  the  road

tax  of  vehicles would mean increasing  costs  in

transportation   of   essential   commodities   to

markets. My fear is that this will cause increases

in  the  prices of essential commodities  and  the

consumer   will  have  to  pay  more   for   these

essentials.  If  the rationale  behind  increasing

road tax for motor vehicles is to limit the number

of cars on the roads because of traffic congestion

and  air pollution, then taxation at source  would

be more realistic. In addition, stringent measures

could also be introduced to ensure that only  road

worthy  vehicles  are allowed on roads  as  poorly

maintained   vehicles  cause  not   only   traffic

congestion,  because  of  constant  stalling   and

breakdowns,  but  also  air pollution  because  of

wornout machine parts that lead to excessive smoke

being  emitted.  However, if the rationale  is  to

increase   the   Government  revenue   to   offset

expenditure,  surely another  method  of  taxation

which  will not cause price increases of essential

commodities could be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to make mention that the

Budget statement was tempered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



with  compassion  in its consideration  for  those

above  55  and  above 60 years  of  age.  The  tax

concession offered to working people over  55  and

over  60  years old is indeed a gesture of  humane

regard for their long years of contribution to our

Republic. In addition to their being able to spend

more  money staying healthy and getting  to  work,

they  will  have a sense of importance because  of

their recognition by Government. They will also be

able  to  spend  a few extra dollars,  which  they

always  do, without too much constraint for  their

children  and  their grandchildren, especially  on

occasions   like   birthdays,  anniversaries   and

festivals.  As people get older they  need  to  be

reassured  from time to time that they are  wanted

by  society, a society that they have  spent  many

years  working  for.  The  method  introduced   by

Government  to  reassure these  people  is  indeed

praiseworthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the importance of tripartite cooperation

among the Government, employers and workers cannot

be  overemphasised. And I am in absolute agreement

with   the   Hon.  Minister.  This  is   a   major

requirement for Singapore's continued progress and

prosperity  in  times like this or  at  any  other

time.  In the midst of rapid technological change,

our  nation  and  our  people  have  accepted  the

challenges  and  the  hardships  of  change.   The

Government harnessed the change, painful though it

might  have been, for the benefit of the community

as a whole and for gaining economic strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we need to speed up the pace of

industrial training to ensure that those  affected

by  industrial change are given the opportunity to

be  trained to take advantage of the jobs that new

growth  industries  are  providing.  We  are   too

dependent  on  imported skills in many  industrial

areas.  Employers  are not playing  a  significant

enough  role  in the industrial training  process.

They must be required not only to promote but also

to assist in the promotion of industrial training.

In  addition, it is necessary for us to  keep  our

goods  competitive by keeping costs  from  rising.

This  can  be  done effectively  by  economies  in

manning and the elimination of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



waste.  This is a positive way and is a sure  road

to higher real wages and high standards of living.

Unfortunately,  this is not practised  religiously

by   employers.  There  is  also  a  tendency  for

employers to seek to take industrial relations out

of  the field of human relations. This tendency is

detrimental   to  worker-management   cooperation.

There  is  no  future in this direction  and  this

tendency should be strongly deprecated.

<br><br><!-- Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at first I had

not  intended `to participate in the debate on the

Budget,  but after hearing the views  of  so  many

Members  who have spoken, I feel I should  involve

myself in this debate and speak, if only briefly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the Budget as presented by the Minister

for   Finance.  It  is  a  very  moderate   Budget

considering   the   problems  of   inflation   and

recession all over the world. In debating  matters

connected  with tax increases one thing should  be

borne  in  mind. It is a truism that not a  single

Finance Minister is able to present a budget  that

everybody  could accept with a smile.  Only  those

who  benefit will smile but those who are affected

will always complain. It is like a father who  has

perhaps  five  or six children to look  after.  He

will not be able to satisfy all of them. I feel we

are  lucky to have a Minister for Finance  who  is

efficient, but humble and publicity-shy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the reference made to his service

during the colonial regime, I would like to remind

Members  here that history has shown that not  all

those people who worked during the colonial period

are  traitors to the nation. In fact, many of them

became  heroes  in  their fight for  independence.

History has also shown that many people who fought

for  independence were opposed to colonialism, but

the  moment they attained independence they became

traitors  to their nation's cause. So the question

of personality should not be raised in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



House  because,  as  I  said earlier,  no  Finance

Minister  can  present  a  budget  that  will   be

received with a smile by every individual citizen.

I  would  like to stress to Members  that  we  are

indeed   lucky  to  have  a  very  polite  Finance

Minister who works hard without any publicity  and

is  able  to present a budget that can  bring  our

country to economic success and prosperity in this

region.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Minister

for  Finance,  in presenting his Budget  Estimates

for  1975, has clearly shown that he has done  his

homework   and   that   he   has   given   careful

consideration   to   every  possible   factor   or

circumstance   which   may   affect    Singapore's

budgetary  affairs. At a time when most  countries

in   the   world,  apart  from  the  oil-producing

countries,  are  having economic convulsions,  the 1975  Budget Estimates prescribe a preventive dose

of remedy against economic recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the skilful management of our economy and with

the  cooperation of all concerned,  Singapore  has

done considerably better despite the fact that  we

have  neither  raw material nor energy  resources.

While  the  major industrial nations of the  world

are   expected  to  recover  from  their   present

economic   difficulties  in   the   near   future,

Singapore's  outlook for the future  seems  rather

bright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as the Minister himself has cautioned, there

will  be a time lapse before the economic recovery

of  the industrial powers of the world can have an

effect  on  Singapore's economy. Again,  something

unforeseen  may  crop  up to  delay  the  expected

economic recovery or its effect on our economy. It

is   reasonable,  in  the  circumstances,  not  to

anticipate any such economic recovery before early

1976  but to have our own plans of development  so

as to maintain our economy at a steady pace in the

meantime.  If we were to do nothing  in  the  hope

that our own economy would surely benefit from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



general  economic recovery of the world, we  might

find  that  our economy would have  lost  so  much

momentum as to be unable to take advantage of  any

future economic boom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect, the development plans outlined

by  the Minister, for giving a booster jab to  our

economy  and making available the funds  for  this

purpose,  cannot be disputed. Just as it  is  said

that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound

of   cure,   it  is  logical  now  to  channel   a

significant proportion of our limited  funds  into

development projects to prevent a slowdown of  our

economy rather than to squander later on far  more

funds  in  reactivating an economy that  has  been

allowed to slow down significantly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, however, comments to make on three

matters  which  have  been unsatisfactorily  dealt

with  or  completely omitted in the annual  Budget

statement  and  in  the  Revenue  and  Expenditure

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first matter relates to the establishment of

a  high-powered  body, such as the Road  Transport

Action  Committee,  on which five  Ministries  are

represented   by   their   respective    Permanent

Secretaries and to the enactment of a statute such

as  the  Road Traffic Act, portions of  which  are

administered   and  enforced  by   two   different

Ministries.  Sir, I would like to  make  it  clear

that  I support the establishment of such a  high-powered body which is normally associated with one

Ministry,   in  particular,  and   which   is   so

constituted  as to avoid bureaucratic red-tape  in

order   to   resolve  the  traffic  nightmare.   I

appreciate  that it is not practical  or  feasible

for  every  Ministry to enforce  by  itself  every

statute it has to administer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, any committee, even a high-powered

one,  and  any enactment, in the normal course  of

its operation or implementation, may give rise  to

grievances which require to be resolved.  Some  of

the  grievances  may be petty or  groundless.  But

then  again,  some grievances may  be  genuine  as

there may be anomalies which have somehow been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



overlooked  by  the committee in its deliberations

or  which  have  not been readily apparent  before

implementation of such an Act or a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that, to facilitate the

accounting   by  the  executive  to  this   House,

separate  budgetary provisions  be  made  for  any

committee   or  body  which  exists   beyond   the

jurisdiction  of  any particular Ministry  or  the

portfolios of the different Ministries be  revised

to provide for such committee or body.



The   second  matter  relates  to  the  Minister's

proposal to increase the road tax on petrol-driven

private  vehicles. The apparent justification  for

an   increase  in  this  particular  tax  is   the

anticipated  fall  in revenue from  other  sources

taken in conjunction with the proposed increase in

the development expenditure. Then again, the brunt

of  the  proposed road tax increase falls  on  the

owners  of petrol-driven private vehicles  in  the

1001-2000 cc range. The apparent justification is



that the affected category of vehicles constitutes

the  bulk  of  private vehicles  on  the  road  in

Singapore.    Any   tax   measure    that    would

significantly help to keep down the number of cars

on  the  road would apparently help to  ease  road

congestion  in  Singapore.  In  that  sense,   the

Government  has  evidently intended  to  kill  two

birds with one stone, that is, raise funds and  at

the  same time relieve traffic congestion  in  the

Central Business District.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of road tax on petrol-driven private

vehicles,  a  certain  amount  of  confusion   has

resulted  from the proposal to impose the heaviest

tax  increase  on  vehicles in  the  1001-2000  cc

range.



The existing graduated scale of road tax, that is,

before  3rd March, 1975 on petrol-driven  vehicles

has   presumably  been  drawn  up  to   discourage

Singaporeans    from    owning    vehicles    with

unnecessarily large engines. Every drop of  petrol

that  is needlessly burned up merely adds  to  the

pollution of Singapore's atmosphere and  the  size

of  Singapore's foreign exchange spending.  It  is

also  to  be  presumed that the justification  for

this  graduated scale of road tax continues to  be

as  valid as ever. That is why I find it  hard  to

see any real need for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



a  re-adjustment of such scale in favour of owners

of petrol-driven vehicles of over 2000 cc, because

the bigger the vehicle the greater the luxury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the third matter on which I

want   to  comment,  that  is,  the  question   of

pollution. Singapore, of course, is a small island

with  a  proportionately thin strip of territorial

water and tiny air space over which Singapore  can

exercise  any  control in so far as anti-pollution

measures   are   concerned.   The   pollution   of

Singapore's seas by the



"Showa  Maru"  disaster and the pollution  of  our

atmosphere   by   forest  fires  in   neighbouring

countries  show the extent to which  Singapore  is

vulnerable to external events and circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But within these rather narrow limits Singapore

should and could provide all reasonable facilities

and  measures to combat and control  any  form  of

pollution in Singapore. An illustration  in  point

is  the  `formation  of a centralised  command  to

combat oil spill in and around Singapore waters  - mainly  the  Anti-sea Pollution Unit of  PSA  -  a

measure  which  the  Government  deserves  to   be

congratulated. But such praise cannot be given  to

the  Government  in  relation  to  its  effort  in

controlling other forms of pollution in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister in his annual Budget statement has

correctly  dealt on the need for development.  But

any  form  of development is bound to  affect  not

only  our  economy  but also our environment,  for

better or for worse. If the effect is bad, as when

it  results in some form of pollution, then it  is

necessary  that  steps are  taken  to  prevent  or

minimise  such  pollution. The  provision  in  the

Budget for additional development does not seem to

consider  the  need for additional expenditure  on

anti-pollution measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater danger is posed by chemical

pollutants since their toxic effects are built  up

slowly   in  human  tissue  and  are  not  readily

apparent at the beginning.

By  the  time  the full toxic effects of  chemical

pollutants  are felt, it may be too  late.  It  is

pointless to create jobs for our workers, only  to

turn them into bed-ridden patients in later years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be appropriate for me to remark at

this  juncture  on the absence of  any  Government

action  on the level of pollution emitted  by  SBS

buses, which is most annoying to other road users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective anti-pollution planning, however, may

necessitate the coordination of action by  two  or

more  Ministries. That brings me back to the first

matter  I  have commented upon. One  Ministry  may

sponsor and administer a piece of legislation, but

it  may  enforce that legislation only through  or

with  the  aid  of  another Ministry.  This  is  a

problem  which  has  not been dealt  with  by  the

Government up to now.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this has been a rather long

day   and  I  have  listened  very  carefully  and

patiently to all the remarks which have been  made

by all the Members who have spoken this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to thank Members,

almost  all  I  think,  for  their  congratulatory

remarks  upon both the performance of the  economy

and  for the responsibility which my Ministry  has

borne  in  regard to the results which  have  been

achieved over the past year. I thank them also for

the  many  suggestions which have  been  made  for

improvements  either  in the  economy  or  in  the

various  Ministries and departments. I even  thank

them for the brick-bats which have been hurled  at

me, because these critical remarks may be valuable

in  dispelling  any  smugness or  self-complacency

which   may   affect  Government  Ministries   and

departments in the success which we have had  over

the  past few years. I think the slowing  down  of

the  growth  rate  may have been  to  some  extent

salutary in warning us that we cannot presume upon

success  all the time and that we need  constantly

to  increase  our efforts to improve the  economy.

This smugness and complacency is felt not only  in

the  civil service, which has been singled out for

critical  mention here and to which I  will  refer

later, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



also  perhaps even in our own House, in the nation

as  a whole, and in the way in which they seem  to

regard  success  as being natural  and  likely  to

continue.  I hope that this very false  impression

can  be  disabused of and that  there  will  be  a

greater  effort  to  try and  continue  growth  in

Singapore  at  the very high rate  which  we  have

experienced in the past and to which I hope growth

would  return, if not this year, at least  in  the

following year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to deal with the comments of

Members.  Let  me first deal with the  problem  of

taxes  which has perhaps aroused most  emotion  in

the  House,  so that I can get it out of  the  way

before making my comments on other criticisms.  It

is  always very difficult to balance the needs for

additional  revenue  (and  these  needs  are  more

evident  this  year  than last year)  against  the

concessions  which Members think should  be  given

because   of   the  inflationary  or  recessionary

effects  which  we  are experiencing  at  present.

These  recessionary and inflationary effects  have

influenced  the  population and have,  of  course,

affected  the  way in which matters  of  taxation,

such  as  those I have introduced in  this  House,

have  been regarded. At the same time there  is  a

great  need  for  recognition by all  citizens  in

Singapore  of their responsibility of  paying  for

some  of the services, which are afforded  by  the

Government   and  which  cost  the  Government   a

considerable  amount  of  money,  which  must   be

financed. I `have previously stated, as being  the

opinion   of  some  international  experts,   that

perhaps the burden of taxation is not being spread

broadly  enough  to bring home to  the  people  of

Singapore  the realisation that the Government  is

there  not  only to spread benefits  but  also  to

provide the means to pay for these services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the matter which raised most excitement

was  the  increase in road tax on cars. There  has

not  been  a  dissentient voice on the  taxes  for

tobacco.  In fact, there was even one  Member  who

was  in favour of increasing the taxes on tobacco.

There  was  general support on the tax on  liquor,

although one Member,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



who  thought  that  I  was  not  a  beer  drinker,

suggested  that  it was unfair generally  to  beer

drinkers   who  are  increasing  in   number   and

therefore  this  measure is `likely  to  affect  a

major  part  of the population. May I assure  that

Member  that I am also a beer drinker but I  would

not  grudge the extra that I have to pay  for  the

bottle of beer that I consume. I hope that he  and

members of the public will feel the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that quite a number of Members have been

somewhat critical about the way in which  I  `have

framed  the  increase in road  tax.  Some  Members

thought that the emphasis was perhaps on the lower

or  at  least the middle group of cars.  I  should

explain  that while it is true that the burden  of

this  particular taxation has been on the 1000  cc

to  2000  cc  cars, that on these  the  burden  is

heaviest,  when  you  look  at  the  whole  range,

starting  from  cars below 1000 cc to  those  over

3000   cc,   the  burden  of  taxation  has   been

relatively  fair. Therefore, I would ask  them  to

look   at   the  whole  package  rather  than   on

particular  aspects of the package. I  have  noted

the  names of Members who spoke on this, but  they

are  so numerous that I think there is no need for

me  to repeat them here. But I have taken note  of

those Members who are particularly unhappy about a

particular part of the package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Members believe that the tax is not what I

said,  i.e, that it does not affect matters  basic

to  life  for  the  average  family.  The  general

feeling  is that the average family is  now  in  a

position  to afford a car, perhaps even a  car  in

the 1000 cc to 2000 cc group. I am very happy that

this  is the general impression because it  really

reflects  the growing affluence of our  community.

If it is true that it is no longer a luxury to own

a  car  but  a standard possession of the  average

family in Singapore, then I think it is also  true

that  "there  is  a  chicken  in  every  pot"   in

Singapore.  Maybe we have achieved this particular

objective.  I  doubt it myself, but after  hearing

Members  I  get that impression. After saying  all

this may I say that I am totally unrepentant about

having



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



imposed this rather modest tax. I thought that the

increase  of  $60 per annum for the  1000  cc  and

under cars is very modest. Sixty dollars a year is

merely $5 a month. I am sure that anyone who  goes

to  the  Orchard Road Car Park, Albert  Street  or

Bugis  Street area and does not spend $5  for  one

good  meal  with  his friends or  members  of  the

family  would be rather unusual. So if it is  true

that  a  1000 cc car is now a standard possession,

then the $5 increase per month for that particular

possession is a very reasonable price to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members thought that my objective of

increasing the road tax was to prevent  a  greater

number of new cars getting on the road. That was a

secondary  objective. I did  not  put  forth  this

objective   as   the  reason  for  imposing   this

particular  tax. In fact, if Members had  read  my

Budget statement carefully, I made it quite  clear

that  I  wanted  more revenue  and  this  was  one

method.  The amount of tax for individual cars  is

rather  small  - $5 a month - but collectively  it

comes  to  a respectable sum. In fact, I  did  not

think  that this is the solution to the congestion

problem  nor would this be the answer to making  a

success  of  the CBD scheme or the Park  and  Ride

scheme. It is purely a psychological reminder that

these  schemes are coming, and that some influence

should  be exercised upon persons to try  and  use

more  public transport. In order to make a success

of  the schemes which we are proposing, there  may

be  a  need  for  further tax  provisions  in  the

future. Therefore, I do not want Members to  think

that  this  is  the final round of tax,  and  that

having  imposed this tax, this is the end  of  all

taxes as far as road transportation is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the tax concession which I made for

people  who work beyond the age of 55 or 60 years.

I  think very few Members welcomed this particular

tax concession. The Member for Potong Pasir was an

exception.  But  most of the Members  thought  the

relief for workers over 50 was purely token.



The cost of the tax concession is going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



to  be  $4 million, and certainly no Minister  for

Finance  would regard this as purely token.  If  I

did not consider it necessary that this should  be

given  for  a very definite purpose, I  would  not

have agreed to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar was particularly

ironical about this particular tax concession.  He

is  perhaps unusually suspicious, but that may  be

the result of his own environment and experiences.

Maybe he has had a harder life than most of us and

that accounts for his rather jaundiced view. But I

hope  he will live long enough to continue working

until  well over 55 or well over 60 years so  that

he can enjoy this particular concession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other countries where people work

over  55.  In  fact, the retirement  age  in  some

countries  is  65.  As to the suggestion  that  we

should  have  a  retirement age  of  60,  that  is

already  in  force  at least  for  new  Government

servants. If there is a request by those who  were

engaged before a certain date, and who are covered

by safeguards under the Constitution, to opt for a

new  retirement age instead of 55 without  wanting

to  keep  their safeguard, I think the  Government

would  be  most happy to consider an extension  of

their retirement age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that there is or was until recently

a  manpower shortage and in giving this particular

concession  I  am hoping that we  will  soon  come

again to that happy position. In fact, we are  now

issuing  work  permits  to  people  who  are  non-citizens,  which means that there is a demand  for

additional  labour.  We have  tried  to  encourage

greater   female  participation   from   our   own

population with some success. But I am afraid that

the  possibilities of extending  this  beyond  the

present  position are not very good. In any  case,

some  of  our  women would be better  off  looking

after the children. We are trying our best to  try

and  get  as  many people, who are not at  present

economically active, into employment. For example,

I  think the employment of crippled or handicapped

people in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



certain jobs has been tried quite successfully  in

the  Government  service, and  there  is  all  the

reason  in the world why people who are still  fit

after  55 or even after 60 years should be induced

to carry on working for as long as possible. There

was  a  suggestion that employers are not prepared

to  maintain employment for people who are over 55

years.  Of  course, this may be true in particular

cases, but if those over 55 years have skills,  as

we hope they will increasingly acquire skills over

the  next  few  years, then they  will  be  valued

employees,  and I am sure employers will  want  to

retain them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a possibility that the wages

obtaining at 55 years would be higher than may  be

justified by the skills; in which case, of course,

the  regard  for seniority will have  to  be  cast

aside  and  the employee over 55 or 60 years  must

merely get the rate for the job he is doing.  This

also happens in the Government service. There  are

some  people who get the rate for the job. In  the

past  the  Government paid three-quarters  of  the

salary   for  people  who  came  back   into   the

Government  service. In the last few  years  there

have  been others who have come back on full  pay.

This   is  obviously  what  they  are  worth  and,

therefore, they should receive the full pay  which

they deserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In place of this relief for workers of over 55 or

60 years I think there was a very impassioned plea

- I am not quite sure which Member made it



for  extending  reliefs for young  couples  rather

than  for  those over 55 years. There was  another

suggestion  that the relief which I am  giving  to

people  over 55 years should be extended  also  to

all  workers  below that age.  It  is  simply  not

possible for any Minister for Finance to  do  that

because  it  really comes back to the question  of

whether  I  should give additional tax  relief  to

every  taxpayer.  I am afraid that  would  not  be

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few people who can avoid taxes.

There are two things we cannot avoid -- death  and

taxes!  At  least those who are in the comfortable

class of being able to come within the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



provisions  of the Income Tax Ordinance  certainly

cannot  escape, not even hawkers. There were  some

criticisms  to the effect that the Inland  Revenue

Department  had  not  been taking  action  against

hawkers.  The reason was that the return or  yield

from action against hawkers was not adequate,  and

in  some  cases we spent much more  than  what  we

collected.  I  think  I need not  have  to  assure

Members that where cases of flagrant violation  of

income  tax laws are brought to our notice we  are

prepared to prosecute offenders to the full extent

of  the  law even if it means that we will have  a

negative  return on our efforts. But last  year  I

suggested  that if Members knew of any  particular

hawkers  who were making extraordinary amounts  of

money they should bring them to our notice, and we

would be very happy to make the investigations and

to  collect whatever was due to the Government and

to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other suggestions for new

taxes, and I am very grateful to Members for  even

thinking about them. Some of these are for capital

gains  tax  (capital  gains in  the  stock  market

perhaps) and increased taxes on companies. I  need

only  say  that  these are among  the  very  hardy

perennial suggestions which have been made  to  us

and  which  we have consistently rejected  because

they  are  against our ideas on  how  our  economy

should develop. If we really do want to have multi-nationals   and   to  have  them  manufacture   in

Singapore,  and if we want to compete in  the  way

that  we  have done in the past, then these  ideas

are not really feasible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one further variant of the suggestion

that  tax relief for workers over 55 years  should

be changed, and this is that the income tax relief

for parents or grandparents ought to be increased.

This  was  also  examined. I thought  that  having

regard  to  the  fact that we were already  giving

$750  relief per parent or grandparent living with

the  taxpayer, this was adequate. I see no  reason

to  change my mind on this at the moment. I do not

think  there are any other ideas on taxation,  but

if there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



are  I  will examine them when I have the time  to

look  over the very voluminous notes I have  taken

this evening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the civil service. There were two

comments.  One  was by the Member for  Katong.  He

mentioned that while in Fullerton Building he  saw

a number of civil servants sauntering and lounging

and enjoying themselves. I would appreciate it  if

he   had  come  to  me  and  told  me  about  this

particular  department instead of just  mentioning

it  here.  I hope, after the meeting here tonight,

he would do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley also dealt with the

subject which, I think, he originally spoke on  in

the debate on the President's speech. He mentioned

the  implementation process, the  difficulties  of

the  professional  and medical  services  and  the

bureaucratic way in which matters were being dealt

with  in the Ministries, particularly the Ministry

of   Finance  with  regard  to  the  authority  on

expenditure of funds, virements and so on.  It  is

very  easy for the civil service to be the  target

whether of Members here or of the people who write

to  the  Press.  Civil servants are  prevented  by

regulations  from making any reply themselves  and

so, as the Minister in charge, perhaps I can in  a

very  small  way  reply  on  their  behalf.  I  am

grateful, of course, for any suggestion which  may

be made to improve civil service standards, and  I

am   obliged   for  one  or  two  expressions   of

satisfaction  for  the  efficiency  of  our  civil

service  generally. I think there is  no  question

that,  at least in this particular region  of  the

world,  our  civil  service is regarded  as  being

perhaps as efficient, if not more efficient,  than

those  of other jurisdictions. I think members  of

the  civil  service are justified in being  a  bit

proud  of  their  reputation  and  standing.  They

should not, of course, carry this pride into their

relations with the public, and I do not think they

do  except  for a few black sheep. I certainly  do

not accept the general truth of any criticisms  of

this  nature,  and  if there  are  any  particular

instances  I  hope  Members  will  not  just  make

general remarks but refer particular instances  to

me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service is so constituted that there are

various spheres of responsibility and those in the

higher levels of the service, of course, should be

concerned  with  matters of higher  administration

and policy, while the administration generally  of

rules  and regulations must remain with the  lower

ranks   of  the  civil  service.  This  is  really

necessary  as  a  measure of efficiency,  and  the

problems to he dealt with should be dealt with  at

as  low  a  level  as possible.  Only  when  these

problems  are  not  capable of solution  at  these

lower  levels should they be referred upwards.  So

the  problems  such  as those of  compliance  with

financial regulations or authority for expenditure

and so on are, in fact, devolved upon the clerical

service  and perhaps the executive service.  These

officers  ought  to  be  able  to  implement   the

regulations and the people who submit requests for

authorisation ought to be able to deal  with  them

without too much difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley also mentioned a few

instances  which  are  obviously  ridiculous.  For

example,  the  approval of  a  50-cycle  generator

accompanied  by  the query that  there  should  be

justification for the purchase of 50  bicycles  is

rather  an  extreme case. In my own experience  of

matters which have come to me, I do not think that

there   are  many  instances  of  such  ridiculous

requests by the Budget Division of my Ministry. If

there were such examples, again I would like these

to  be brought to my notice and perhaps those  who

perpetrated  these blunders can  be  sent  to  our

Staff Training Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the comment that virements could

not  be  approved by the higher civil servants  of

other   ministries.  I  do  not  think   that   is

particularly    true.    This    is    really    a

misunderstanding or misconception.  Authority  for

certain  virements have already been delegated  to

Permanent  Secretaries  of  other  ministries  and

there  is  really no need to refer  any  of  these

virements to us. However, there are certain  other

types of vire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



ments  which  require approval from the  Treasury,

because  they are subject to Treasury sanction  or

to   certain   regulations  which  prevent,   say,

expenditure on manpower being vired to  a  special

expenditure. These requirements are, I think, only

to   be  expected.  Nevertheless,  I  welcome  the

suggestion of the Member for River Valley that the

Estimates Committee should try and improve on  our

methods  and procedures, and I will be very  happy

to  receive  suggestions from  the  House  or  the

Estimates Committee on how our procedures  can  be

improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one formal comment in regard

to  the  civil service, and this is  a  matter  on

which I thought Members would have expressed  some

appreciation. This is on the presentation  of  the

Budget.  But the only comment I had has  been,  in

fact, an adverse comment - that we have classified

the  Estimates  so  that  we  now  can  tell  what

appropriations  are  made  for  various   economic

purposes,  but the emphasis should  really  be  on

performance  rather than on cost. I ought  to  say

that performance budgetting is one other aspect of

budgetting  procedures  which  we  are  trying  to

improve.  But  in view of the work which  we  were

already doing on the manner of presentation of the

Budget,  we thought that that should have priority

before  we went into the new method of performance

budgetting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to deal with the matter of

tourism. A number of Members in this House thought

that the natural advantages of Singapore would  be

sufficient to attract tourists without our  having

to  spend  any  money  on  the  Singapore  Tourist

Promotion Board. This was, in fact, the policy  we

adopted  in  the early years of the 1960s  -  that

tourism was not important and that if the tourists

wanted   to   come  to  Singapore,   the   natural

advantages  would be such that there was  no  need

for  further promotion. I think we have  abandoned

that  particular  practice or policy.  We  decided

that  certainly in the years when the British were

having  a  military rundown from  their  Singapore

bases the earnings from tourism would be very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



helpful  in  improving the balance of payments  by

earning foreign exchange for Singapore. And I  see

no  particular reason why we should depart from  a

policy  which  has  paid such dividends  over  the

`last few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a further comment that the Singapore

Tourist Promotion Board had not been paying enough

attention  to,  or that some of the revenue  which

they obtained from cess on tourist establishments,

restaurants  and so on, could be used  to  finance

the  arts or culture. The Tourist Promotion Board,

in  fact,  has  spent  money  in  sending  troupes

overseas for cultural shows. Perhaps this  is  not

the  very  best way in which funds of the  Tourist

Promotion Board can be applied because much of the

money that is being used has gone into the payment

of fares for the people who travel overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board has also started a

project  to  promote arts and craft in  Singapore.

There  will  be a centre for arts and craft  which

will  be near the Board's offices in Orchard Road.

I  think a very considerable amount of money  will

be spent on this arts and craft centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the comment by the Member for Jalan

Kayu  that  the  report of the  Tourist  Promotion

Board  has  not  been produced as  rapidly  as  it

should  be.  I have pressed the Singapore  Tourist

Promotion  Board  to  produce their  reports  more

expeditiously. And the reason why  they  have  not

been  able  to  do  this is that there  have  been

considerable movements of staff which  have  meant

that the people responsible for these reports  had

unfortunately not been able to complete their work

before leaving the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the comment by the Member for Bukit Ho

Swee  that tourists were being fleeced.  This  and

other defects are all, I think, being remedied and

I  hope  that  the  situation will  be  much  more

satisfactory in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu thought that in view of

the  contribution which tourism has  made  to  our

economic development the increases in costs which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



have  been  imposed upon the hotels and  upon  the

tourist   industry  generally  have  been   rather

adverse  in their effects. Unfortunately,  due  to

the  greater  cost of oil, electricity  and  other

costs, like increases in wages and so on, have  to

be  recovered. I do not think there is any  remedy

for  this.  Our  only consolation  is  that  these

higher  costs also affect our competitors  in  the

tourism industry, and therefore we should be  able

to maintain our competitive edge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the matters on which I have some

responsibility. There were other matters raised by

Members  but they really concern other  Ministries

and might perhaps better be raised when the debate

on the Estimates takes place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, however, to comment on the

representations  of  the Member  for  Jurong,  who

generally  at  this  time of the  year  speaks  on

agriculture  and of my neglect of this  particular

sector of the economy. I think I have responded at

some  length  in  previous Budget debates.  But  I

always  listen  to  the  Member  for  Jurong  with

sympathy  because my early years were spent  on  a

farm.  I was born on a farm. In my early years  in

the  civil  service, I think I was regarded  as  a

fairly competent land officer; at least I hope so!

I  am  quite  aware  of  the problems  of  farmers

-having served in the Land Office from 1939  until

1959, at least when I ended up as Commissioner  of

Lands.  So  I  may  be  said  to  have  had   some

experience of the problems relating to farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately with the development of the economy

in Singapore, the amount of land that will be left

for agriculture will be very limited, and there is

no redress that I can see. There is no possibility

that  we  can find enough land for all the farming

desired.  All of us, I think, are in some respects

farmers at heart. We like to own a piece of  land.

We  like  to see things growing but we all  cannot

fulfil our ambition to be farmers. Nevertheless, I

am  filled  with  admiration by  the  achievement,

under  very  great difficulties of our farmers  in

making  us  self-sufficient in pigs,  poultry  and

eggs, in supplying so much of our table vegetables

and in many other ways. As I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



say,  I  cannot, as Minister for Finance, see  any

way  in  which  we  can  increase  the  supply  of

agricultural land and I am afraid that we may have

to  look  to other areas for the supply  of  these

vegetables.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the kind of farming which is possible in the

future,  I think what we are trying to  do  is  to

finance the industrial type of farming - the  very

capital-intensive type of pig and poultry  farming

which is really a kind of industry rather than the

old type of farming which we are accustomed to  in

the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point which was made - the

question  of  timber  and the  warning  which  the

Members for Katong and Sembawang gave against  the

reputation for the quality of our timber  industry

being    spoilt   by   exporters    with    rather

unsatisfactory  practices.  I  will   take   their

suggestions into consideration and hope  that  our

Timber  Industry  Board can  remedy  the  mistakes

which have been pointed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that there was general support for the

education  and  manpower training which  we  shall

have  to  maintain  or initiate  so  that  we  can

improve  the skills of our workers and  prevent  a

brain  drain overseas. I am conscious of the  need

to  provide sufficient opportunities for  our  own

people  in the kind of industries which will  make

the fullest use of these skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were other matters mentioned by the Member

for  Aljunied,  such as the Road Transport  Action

Committee   and  pollution  measures.  These   are

matters  not  really within my competence,  and  I

hope  he  will  raise  them  with  the  particular

Minister in charge of these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to comment on the need

which  one  or  two  Members  have  expressed  for

tripartite  cooperation  in  connection  with  the

National    Wages   Council   and   the   National

Productivity Board. The need for such cooperation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



is  the reason why, in my Budget statement and  in

this  particular reply, I do not propose to  offer

any  suggestions  or guidelines for  the  National

Wages Council, as was suggested by one Member.  It

would  be  presumptuous of me to provide  what  is

really within the functions of a tripartite  body.

I  agree entirely with Members that cooperation of

this kind is very desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the points

raised.  There are various other matters  which  I

have notes on, but at this stage perhaps they  may

not be necessary for me to reply.



<br><br>7.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before listening to the Finance Minister's

reply I then had a certain prejudice against  him.

But now after having heard his reply, I would like

to  withdraw what I had said earlier about him.  I

refer to the two matters which I had touched  upon

regarding  our Minister for Finance  as  a  senior

officer  during  the colonial time  and  that  the

budget  formulated  by  him  was  slanted  towards

supporting the capitalists. These remarks I  would

now  like  to withdraw. These are the  two  points

directed  at the Minister for Finance which  would

appear to be disrespectful to him. So I would like

to  withdraw.  I  express my appreciation  of  his

explanation, and I hope the Minister  for  Finance

will excuse me in a most generous way.

<div align="center"><b>TRAFFIC POLICE MOBILE SQUAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs what is the present strength of the mobile squad (including women) in the Traffic Police and if there is any intention to increase this strength.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st March, 1975, the Mobile Squad including women had 166 officers against 184 posts, i.e. 18 vacancies, representing 10% of the total number of posts.

For the whole Police Force the corresponding vacancy rate is 15%. The Mobile Squad is relatively better staffed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of Vehicles Department has also its own Mobile Squad for enforcement work. On 1st March, 1975, the ROV Mobile Squad had 42 officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time better work methods have been introduced. In October 1974 a radio communications system was introduced. Through this system Mobile Squad patrolmen can maintain radio contact with their Headquarters. This in turn enables the Headquarters to deploy Mobile Squad patrolmen promptly to deal with traffic situations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, two new pursuit cars have been added to the existing fleet.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st March, 1975, the Ticketing System and Points Demerit System were introducted.

Under the Ticketing System a Mobile Squad Officer can issue a traffic ticket, which has

the effect of a court summons, to an offending motorist on the spot for a compoundable

traffic offence for which only the driver is liable. This has cut down time which a Mobile

Squad Officer had to spend previously in reporting a traffic offender.  The Road Traffic Act has

also been amended to enable the Police to tender in court, as prima facie evidence, a certificate

signed by a competent police officer certifying the accuracy and reliability of policy equipment

used in speeding cases.  Hence, there is no need for the whole team of seven squad officers

to testify in court in speeding cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Points Demerit System is aimed at identifying and removing dangerous drivers

from the road.  This System should make motorists drive more carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these changes the manpower requirements for the entire Traffice Division

is being re-examined.  My Ministry has set up a Manpower Review Committee to reassess the

manpower situation for the whole Police Force.  It is premature to say whether the

strength of the Mobile Squad would be increased.

categories:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Restricted circulation - 14 titles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not available for public reading.
