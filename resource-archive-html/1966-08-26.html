Sir,  Government has no plan to build a post office

or to establish a postal agency, as adequate postal

facilities  already  exist  in  the  neighbourhood.

There is a post office about one and three-quarters

of  a  mile and a stamp vendor about three-quarters

of  a  mile from Kampong Tengah. Further, a  mobile

post  office visits Kampong Tengah once a  week  to

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Sim Boon Woo</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister whether he is aware that several Singapore

citizens  with foreign honours or titles are  still

using  them;  what is the Government's attitude  in

citizens.  All  foreign missions in Singapore  have

also  been informed and have noted that it  is  not

the  practice  in  Singapore  to  use  any  foreign

titles, including that of Malaysia, when addressing

or  referring to any Singapore citizen. I hope also

to  take  the opportunity to inform the Press  that

this is the ruling of the Singapore Government  and

we  would be obliged indeed if Singapore papers  in

particular would remember the instructions that  we

have given not only to our own departments but also

to foreign missions based in Singapore. However, it

is  the  common  practice that foreign  titles  and

decorations can be used at any function given by or

in the country of origin. And in any case, I do not

believe that those Singapore citizens with any self-respect, while they cherish the honour bestowed  on

them  by  past colonial governments or  by  foreign

governments,  will  want to distinguish  themselves

from  the rest of the people of Singapore by  being

publicly referred to by their title.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

Minister  for Education (a) how many children  from

the  Kampong Kembangan Constituency have registered

for  the 1967 Primary 1 classes in each of the four

given  places  in  the schools at  which  they  had

registered  and  how many will be sent  to  schools

elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total

number  of  children registered in primary  schools

within  the Kampong Kembangan Constituency for  the 1967 Primary One classes is 1,842. The total number

of  children who will be admitted into the  schools

at  which they registered is 1,374, and the  number

of  children who will be sent to schools  elsewhere

is 468. Of the 468 children who will be posted to a

school  other  than  the  school  where  they   had

registered,  88  of them will be  admitted  into  a

neighbouring  school within the  constituency,  and

the remaining 380 children into the newly-completed

<div align="center"><b>CANCER OF THE WOMB</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Preventive measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Health,  in  view  of  the prevalence  of  patients

suffering from cancer of the womb, whether  he  has

plans  to  expand the facilities for the preventive

and early diagnosis of female genital cancer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a small-scale screening unit was introduced last year

(1965) in the Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital  to

detect early cancer of the womb of patients as they

were   being  treated  for  routine  gynaecological

complaints  or after child-birth. As  a  result  of

this  screening  service, the number  of  cases  of

cancer of the womb which was at 351 in 1964 rose to

576  last year. Deaths arising from cancer  of  the

womb were 90 in 1964 and 69 in 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staffing of this cancer screening unit has

been further strengthened this year with the return

of  a  Medical  Officer specially trained  in  this

technique in the United States of America and  four

laboratory assistants have also been recruited  for

training in this technique.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for an effective preventive service to

provide  early diagnosis of female genital  cancer,

it  will  be  necessary to examine every  woman  in

Singapore  in the dangerous age group of 30-50.  As

there  are approximately 160,000 in this age group,

it  is  therefore obvious, Sir, that this desirable

task cannot be achieved for some time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for the immediate future, only

selective  examination of cases will be  undertaken

by  the  screening unit in Kandang Kerbau  Hospital

until  more funds can be allocated towards training

more  staff  and  provision of more  equipment  and

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, happy to disclose that a second

cancer screening unit for women in the Republic  is

likely  to be established, before the end  of  this

year,  under  the auspices of the Singapore  Family

Planning and Population Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>OUTPATIENT CLINIC IN DELTA CONSTITUENCY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Health  whether  he  has  plans  to  establish   an

outpatient clinic in the Delta Constituency, which,

according to statistics, has over 50,000 residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to

inform the hon. Member for Delta that there are  no

plans to establish an Outpatient Dispensary in  her

constituency for two reasons:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there are already two Government

Outpatient Dispensaries in very close proximity  to

Delta Constituency:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Tiong Bahru Outpatient Dispensary with three

doctors at Jalan Membina, which is just outside

Delta Constituency boundary, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Prince Philip Avenue Outpatient Dispensary

with  one  doctor, which is about half-a-mile

away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, out of an approved doctor establishment

of  461,  there are still 37 vacancies and even  if

all  these  posts  are filled,  which  is  possible

within the foreseeable future, the need for doctors

to  be  posted into hospital wards is greater  than

that of the opening of new Outpatient Dispensaries.

It  is  my  view  that the existing  26  Government

Outpatient Dispensaries, which serve the  whole  of

Singapore   island,  are  more  than  adequate   at

present, and no expansion is therefore contemplated

for some time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Daily-rated staff and expansion of operations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Health (a) in July 1962 and July 1966, (i) how many

daily-rated labourers were employed in  the  Public

Health  Division, and (ii) how many  carts,  trucks

and   other  refuse  carriers  were  used  by  that

Division;  and (b) whether there are any  plans  to

expand the operations of that Division in future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the number of daily-rated

labourers  employed in the Public Health  Division,

as a whole, was 4,805 as at July 1962, and 5,542 as

at  July  1966.  In  respect  of  Public  Cleansing

Department  alone,  they  were  2,461   and   3,078

respectively.  It should be stated,  however,  that

the  latter figure of 3,078 includes the  Emergency

Cleansing Corps whose strength was 563 then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of carts, trucks and other refuse

carriers used by the Public Health Division was  as

follows:

<pre>

                                             July 1962  July 1966



              Refuse carts of all  types       1,065      1,442

              Refuse vehicles in transport

                pool, including spare and

                obsolete vehicles                 77        147



              ( But of these refuse vehicles

                those in  actual use were as

                follows )                         69        109

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the query whether there are any plans

to  expand  the operations of the public  cleansing

service  in  future, the answer is that ever  since

October  1965,  a  year  ago,  reorganisation   and

expansion has been going on simultaneously and will

continue  for  some  time.  There  cannot  be   any

improvement in the public cleansing service  merely

through expansion on the basis of operations  prior

to October 1965, with:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Ineffective Disciplinary Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) High absenteeism on weekdays, especially

on   Mondays   and  on  days  following   public

holidays,  but with practically full  attendance

on Sundays and on public holidays,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Payout of over $1 million per annum for

overtime  work, on the basis of 1½ times  normal

pay  during week-days, 2 times for Sunday and  3

times for public holiday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the revision of the Disciplinary Code,

effective  as from 25th October, 1965,  it  is  now

possible  to  improve and to stiffen discipline  in

the  work force so that even the then Secretary  of

the Public Daily-Rated Cleansing Workers' Union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



(Mr  M.  A.  Latiff), who had  a  long  record  of

habitual  absenteeism  and frequent  absences  from

work sites, etc., had to be dismissed in April 1966

when  he refused to change for the better. Up  till

the  end of July, there have been 7 dismissals  and

another   22   are  the  subject  of   disciplinary

inquiries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other important reorganisation steps which have

been taken, so far, are as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In October 1965, recruitment of an auxiliary

public  cleansing force known as the Emergency

Cleansing Corps was started. This is a uniformed

and  disciplined task force, and the basis  of

recruitment is from two sources, namely, the Work

Brigade and from the thousands of our unemployed

citizens,  now  in receipt of  Social  Welfare

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the Emergency Cleansing Corps

today  is  624 and this is being stepped  up,

without  limit at present, to  keep  up  with

requirements  of reorganisation  for  a  more

efficient   public   cleansing   service   in

Singapore than is available at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In May this year, overtime work (at 1½

rates)  during  weekdays was stopped,  unless

at   the  request  of  the  Public  Cleansing

Department.  Prior to this, between  250  and

300   were   on  such  overtime,  daily,   on

weekdays.   Now,   the  number   on   weekday

overtime work is at the most around ten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) We have also decided to stop Sunday work (at

double rates) and public holiday work (at treble

rates) with effect from 1st October, 1966.  It

should be brought home to the knowledge of this

House that, as a rule, the amount of refuse cleared

on Sundays and public holidays



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



(after  paying  double and treble  rates)  is

less  than  what is cleared during  a  normal

weekday!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) It is also necessary for me now to reveal

certain  startling facts why public cleansing  in

Singapore    needs    wholesale    reorganisation

involving   even  its  pattern  of  work   before

contemplating any expansion of work force:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Out of 184,431 assessed buildings in

Singapore, there are only 48,345 dust-bins or 26

per cent!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Out of a daily collection of over 600 tons of

refuse, an estimated 245 tons or 40 per cent is

removed by direct collection from household dust-bins, and this involves 230 workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) There is therefore an estimated 60

per  cent  of  refuse  which  has  to  be

laboriously  swept up  by  hand,  dug  up

from  drains,  put into  hand-carts,  and

then  pushed  to  and placed  into  large

public   dust-bins  at   over   500   bin

centres, by nearly 2,000 workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of this refuse, not collected from dust-bins, is largely due to certain irresponsible

sections  of  the  public,  including  hawkers  and

householders, who indiscriminately throw refuse  on

to  roads  and into drains or any vacant  piece  of

land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised pattern of work on re-organisation

will include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A gradual switch-over to one or more

direct   collection  and   less   of   street

cleansing.   Any   householder   or   hawker,

without  a  proper dust-bin, will be  charged

and penalised with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



a  deterrent  fine for being a public  health

menace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A system of task work will be introduced so

that a refuse vehicle and work force attached to it

(not as many as eight as at present but reduced by one-half to four) will be given an allotted beat

with a daily quota of dust-bins to be cleared and

the vehicle and crew will be allowed to check-off,

even before official knocking-off time, when they

complete their allotted task, so that there will be

no  excuse to slacken or to resort to delaying

tactics as responsibility for satisfactory task

work  will clearly fall on workers as well  as

supervisory staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A two-shift system is to be established in

place  of  the  present  unsatisfactory  one-shift system of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Something new - a bonus will be paid to

workers  who do not use up their 42  days  of

sick leave provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) A long-term health education campaign will

be  initiated and maintained both in  schools

for  the  children  and for  members  of  the

public, through the mass media of the  Press,

Radio and Television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall shortly be inviting the officials of both

the Public Daily-Rated Cleansing Workers' Union and

that  section of the A.U.P.E. which represents  the

supervisory   grades   of  the   Public   Cleansing

Department   for  a  discussion  on  the   proposed

reorganised methods and pattern of work and hope to

get  their  full  support and co-operation  towards

putting an end, once and for all, to the ridiculous

inefficiency   of  our  present  public   cleansing

service, and thus to augur a new chapter for a more

efficient  public cleansing service for  Singapore,

as from October 1966.

Club came forward suggesting that it be allowed  to

<div align="center"><b>RESIGNATION OF DOCTORS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Health

how  many doctors resigned from the service  during

the  period 1st January to 31st July, 1966, and the

reasons  for  their resignations, and  whether  and

what   steps   have  been  taken  to  improve   the

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The number of doctors who have

resigned  from Government service during the  first

seven months of 1966 is 39. Of these, nine resigned

to   take  up  appointment  in  the  University  of

Singapore - not actually resignations from our  point

of  view,  because the University must  get  staff;

three   took  up  appointments  in  other   medical

services,  for  example, to join the  Army  Medical

Corps;  two went for further studies overseas;  six

resigned  to go into private practice, but  19  did

not give any reasons for their resignation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention, however, that during the

same period, 64 doctors were recruited.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be accepted that there will always be a

number  of  resignations from service  for  various

reasons.   Whilst  admitting  that  the   rate   of

resignation   is   still  high,  we   should   take

cognisance  of whether the rate of resignation  has

been  reduced  in  recent years,  and  this,  I  am

pleased to state, is the case. In 1964, out  of  an

approved  establishment of 453 doctors, there  were

97  --  almost 100 -- vacancies, but as at 31st  July

this  year,  the position is 461 on approved  establishment  with  37  vacancies  or  a  60  per  cent

improvement over that of 1½ years ago. Furthermore,

it  is confidently expected that all vacancies  are

likely to be filled by 1967 next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the steps taken to improve the situation,

other  than  a review of salaries which  is  to  be

determined  by  the  Salaries  Commission  now   in

session, we have already reorganised the pattern of

work  for  doctors in service, in order  to  reduce

their  work-load as much as possible and  generally

to improve their conditions of work, for example:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In August 1964, the Outpatient Dispensary in

Outram Road General Hospital was closed  down

and  the outpatient service decentralised to 26 Outpatient Dispensaries with simultaneous

introduction of a token charge  of  50  cents

per  attendance. This firm move  has  brought

about  an  improved service  for  the  public

because  waiting  time has  been  drastically

cut  down as malingerers were weeded out  and

doctors  can now spend more time  with  their

patients.   This   is   reflected   in    the

significant    drop   in    attendances    at

Government Outpatient Dispensaries  from  the

peak  figure  of 2.7 million in 1963  to  2.1

million in 1965 (last year).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In December 1964, a nominal charge of $10

for  'C'  class  patients was  introduced  in

Kandang Kerbau Maternity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



Hospital  in  an  endeavour  to  cut  down  the

excessive number of deliveries at this  grossly

over-worked hospital and instead to  popularise

the  free domiciliary midwifery service.  Added

to  this was the launching of a massive  5-year

family    planning   campaign    through    the

establishment  of  the  Family   Planning   and

Population Board in January this year with  the

objective  of reducing our present  birth  rate

of  29  per thousand by one-half. I am  pleased

to  state  that  there are  strong  indications

that   our  womenfolk  are  responding   whole-heartedly towards family planning in  order  to

have  smaller yet happier families. During  the

last  seven  months, over 19,000  mothers  have

been  given family planning assistance  by  the

Family Planning and Population Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) We have also adopted a liberal policy towards

employment  of  doctors  with  so-called   non-registrable  degrees  as  far  as  the   United

Kingdom  General Medical Council is  concerned,

so   long  as  there  exists  a  large  vacancy

situation  on  our doctor establishment  as  at

present.





<br><br>This is shown by the number of such doctors now in service:-

<div align="center"><b>(Provision of water and electricity supplies)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development what progress  has  been

made  with  the approved projects for provision  of

water and electricity supplies for the residents of

Trafalgar   Estate   in  the   light   of   changed

circumstances connected with control of the  former

Cable    and   Wireless   installations   in    the

neighbourhood between the end of 1965 and now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 3rd

January, 1966, the Cable & Wireless Receiving sites

at   Trafalgar  Estate  were  taken  over  by   the

Singapore  Government. This is  an  overseas  radio

receiving station occupying 250 acres of  land,  of

which nearly 200 acres were rented out in 140 plots

which  vary from 1/8th to 5½ acres. There  are  119

houses on the site accommodating some 1,116 people.

For  some  time now these people have  been  making

requests  for cracks to be repaired, drains  to  be

made,  standpipes to be installed, and  electricity

to be supplied in Trafalgar Estate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, security objection to allowing

a  settler within the compound of an overseas radio

receiving  station. The aerials that are  installed

on  the  ground  constitute the  life-line  of  the

station  and any interference or damage  will  have

far-reaching    consequences   on    the    traffic

communications network. It would, therefore, appear

that  action  should  be taken  to  resettle  these

squatters   instead   of   providing   water    and

electricity  supplies and thereby encouraging  them

to settle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

they pay rent. But my question is: whether and when

will resettlement take place?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

immediate plan to resettle these squatters  at  the

moment. But it is needless for the hon. Member  for

for them to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> A supplementary question, Sir.

The  Parliamentary Secretary talks about Government

making plans to resettle these people. More than  a

year has passed and may I ask when will these plans

be ready?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Cable &

<div align="center"><b>COMMON CURRENCY AND BANKING SYSTEM</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the House is

aware  that just over a week ago, to be  exact,  on

the  17th  August, both the Singapore and Malaysian

Governments announced that they could not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



reach  agreement for a common currency and  banking

system. As a result, beginning from the 12th  June,

1967,  Singapore,  Malaysia and Brunei  will  issue

their own separate currencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House and the people of Singapore are

entitled  to have a full and frank account  of  the

negotiations  and the reasons for its breakdown.  I

am,   therefore,   taking  the  first   opportunity

available  to  inform the House of what  has  taken

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open society, Sir, it is not possible to

suppress     important     Government-to-Government

negotiations and the reasons for failure  to  reach

an  agreement.  We  are, therefore,  releasing  the

exchange of correspondence and memoranda that  have

taken  place  between the two Governments  on  this

subject in the form of a White Paper which will  be

placed before this House later this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it all began on the 8th

November,  1965, when in my letter to the Malaysian

Finance  Minister, I suggested  that  in  order  to

maintain public and international confidence in the

economic  future  of Singapore  and  Malaysia,  the

issue  of currency under the Currency Board  system

should continue until the time is more opportune to

make   a   change.  Alternatively,  Singapore   and

Malaysia could establish a joint Central Bank. Both

these   proposals  were  not  acceptable   to   the

Malaysians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meanwhile, we agreed that the officials

should  meet to find another formula for  a  common

currency and banking system. It was then decided to

ask for technical assistance from the International

Monetary   Fund.  And  at  the  request   of   both

countries, the I.M.F. sent a preliminary mission to

Singapore and Malaysia in December last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission reported on 1st March, 1966, and

noted  correctly  Singapore's major  pre-occupation

for  the  safety  of the foreign exchange  reserves

backing the currency. This is further emphasised by

my  letter  of 21st March, 1966, addressed  to  the

Governor of Bank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



Negara, Malaysia, in which I stated, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Government wishes to be assured

that  in  the  event  of subsequent  withdrawal  by

either  party from the proposed currency agreement,

it should have immediate access to its share of the

currency reserve.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it was also suggested in the same letter that

another  I.M.F. team be called to provide technical

expertise. I quote again from the letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We suggest that one of the major tasks to be set

for  the I.M.F., should both our Governments decide

to  call on them to provide technical expertise, is

to devise a mutually satisfactory formula to ensure

indisputable  ownership  and  prompt  division   of

reserves  if and when a currency union,  either  in

the  form  of a joint Central Bank or as  envisaged

under the Bank's present proposals, break up.'



<br><br>The  reply from the Bank Negara Malaysia dated 20th

April, 1966, states, and I quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We note, however, your concern over the control

and  management  of Singapore's  share  of  foreign

exchange  reserves  in  the  currency  and  banking

arrangements  that we have proposed. We  feel  that

this  concern  is  wholly  justified  and  we  have

accordingly reviewed this particular aspect of  our

proposals.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enclosed with this letter, Mr Speaker, Sir, was

also  a  memorandum setting out in detail the  Bank

Negara's revised proposals. I should like to  quote

from  two  parts of this memorandum. The  first,  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is clear from the rest of the arguments put

forward by the Singapore Minister for Finance  that

the  Singapore Government is concerned chiefly with

(a)  the  need to maintain its sovereign rights  in

any  proposals for future currency arrangements and

(b)  the  need  to safeguard its interests  in  the

matter  of foreign exchange reserves and the manner

in  which these reserves are utilised. This concern

is  of  course  justified and any  fears  that  the

Singapore  Government may have on serious  breaches

of  its  sovereignty or the deprivation of a  major

part  of  Singapore's  external  assets  should  be

dispelled entirely.'



<br><br>The  second quotation from this memorandum  on  the

question of reserves is - I quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Government is probably justified

in  claiming that the arrangements proposed by Bank

Negara  on the control and management of the Bank's

foreign exchange reserves are unsatisfactory  since

these do not provide for a "hard core" of assets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



which would always belong to Singapore and to which

the   Singapore  Government  would  have  immediate

access   in  the  event  of  withdrawal  from   the

agreement   by  either  party.  Bank   Negara   has

therefore  reviewed that aspect  of  its  proposals

relating  to  the  control and  management  of  its

foreign  exchange  reserves and  has  come  to  the

conclusion  that it would be desirable to  separate

the respective reserves of the two countries at the

outset of the proposed arrangements.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that the Malaysians

took  cognisance of our concern over the safety  of

our currency assets. Once it has been accepted that

the agreement should guarantee both Governments  of

their  ownership, management, control and immediate

access  to  their respective assets at  all  times,

formal  negotiations  began  in  earnest  with  the

assistance  of  another team of two officials  from

the  I.M.F.  In  all, Sir, 11 formal meetings  were

held  between the 10th of June and the 5th of July,

1966,  chaired  by  the  Governor  of  Bank  Negara

Malaysia, Tan Sri Ismail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like here to pay tribute to all those who

took  part in the meetings, including the officials

of  the I.M.F., for the intense work they put  into

their  difficult  task to find a  formula  for  two

independent  countries to co-operate  on  a  common

currency and banking system. Proposals and counter-proposals   were   made.  Many  difficulties   were

encountered  and  overcome,  but  even  after   the

eleventh  meeting held on 5th July, which  happened

to  be  the  last of the series, there  were  still

doubts  as  to  how the ownership of the  Singapore

assets were to be resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was indicated by a letter from the Governor

of  Bank Negara Malaysia dated 11th July, 1966,  to

the   Permanent  Secretary  (Economic   Development

Division)  who was leading the Singapore  team.  In

it, he wanted clarification as to how the piece  of

land  in Singapore, which is at present in the name

of  Bank Negara Malaysia, can be transferred to the

Central  Bank of Malaysia, Singapore.  He  proposed

that while the value of this land would be credited

to  the  account of the Central Bank  of  Malaysia,

Singapore, the title should remain in the  name  of

Bank Negara Malaysia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication of this formula was far-reaching.

For  if  we were to agree to this, it follows  that

all our currency assets would have to be vested  in

Bank  Negara Malaysia and that this statutory  body

created  by  the  Malaysian  Government  would   be

appointing  itself  the  trustee  of  our  currency

reserves and assets. In other words, Sir, we  would

have to hand over legal ownership of all our assets

to  a  bank  which was a statutory body of  another

country and entirely subject to its legislation and

control.  This does not give us the guarantee  over

the  ownership and immediate access to  our  assets

and foreign exchange reserves on the basis of which

we  began  negotiations. We must  ensure  that  the

title   to  Singapore's  assets,  be  it  land   or

securities, should be vested in Singapore,  in  the

same  way that the title to the currency assets  of

Malaysia  are  vested  in  themselves  Bank  Negara

Malaysia.  Since  the  Central  Bank  of  Malaysia,

Singapore,  has  no  legal  entity,  in  reply  we

proposed that both our assets should be placed with

the  I.M.F. or the Bank of England  or  any  other

third party mutually acceptable as both our trustee

or,  alternatively, that the Deputy  Governor  for

Singapore should be incorporated into a corporation

sole and all currency assets of Singapore could  be

vested in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Government have always agreed that

our assets must belong to us and that they can have

no  claims on them. The deposit with a third  party

like  the I.M.F. or the incorporation of the Deputy

Governor  as a corporation sole to hold the  assets

will  ensure that no future government in Malaysia,

if  it  decides  to  give  orders  to  Bank  Negara

Malaysia contrary to the letter and spirit  of  the

agreement between Singapore and Malaysia,  will  be

in a position to jeopardise Singapore's assets. The

Malaysian Government, however, could not agree that

the   assets  be  placed  in  a  third  party   and

considered  that incorporating the Deputy  Governor

for  Singapore  as  a corporation  sole  meant  the

creation of two Central Banks. We cannot agree, Mr

Speaker, Sir, with this interpretation. Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



Attorney-General's Chambers have  advised  us  that

this  will,  in  no  way, prejudice  what  we  have

already  agreed  to,  and  that  is,  Bank   Negara

Malaysia should have only one legal entity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It saddens me to report, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

all  the  obvious advantages of a common  currency,

affirmed  and  reaffirmed by  the  Governments  and

people  on both sides of the Causeway, have  to  be

thrown  away  because our proposals  to  leave  the

assets with the I.M.F. or the Bank of England or in

Singapore with the Deputy Governor as a corporation

sole  were  all  not acceptable and  the  Malaysian

Government   has   no   time  to   consider   other

alternatives because their printers in London  were

pressing  them to decide on the printing  of  their

new notes immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Mr Speaker, I would now like to comment on

the  few points highlighted by Press reports of the

replies  to  questions by the Minister of  Finance,

Malaysia,  raised in the Malaysian  Parliament.  It

was stated that the draft agreement has been agreed

to  by  officials of the two countries. I will  now

quote from minutes of the meeting of officials held

on 26th June, 1966, made by Bank Negara Malaysia:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore representatives pointed out that

the  clauses which had been agreed to at  the  past

seven meetings at the official level should not  be

regarded as final and irreversible. They maintained

that the officials of both Governments reserved the

right  to review and change the draft Agreement  in

whatever  way  necessary  in  the  light   of   the

Agreement as a whole.'



<br><br>I  will  now further quote from the minutes of  the

eleventh  and last meeting held on 5th July,  1966,

also  recorded by Bank Negara Malaysia with  regard

to  the  position  of  the working  drafts  of  the

officials:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It was noted that both the Malaysian and

Singapore Governments reserved the right to  decide

in  the final analysis, whether this Clause or  any

other clauses should be included in the Agreement.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>* * *</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Sri Ismail suggested that these final drafts

should be transmitted to the respective Governments

for consideration. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



views  and reactions of both the Governments  would

be discussed at the next meeting.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drafts are working drafts, subject to further

clarification by both sides when any  point  is  in

doubt. Nowhere was it stated that the working draft

is the final draft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may be interested to hear the I.M.F.'s

advice  on  the  negotiations. The  leader  of  the

second  I.M.F. mission  in  his  remarks  on   the

commencement  of the negotiations  stated  that  as

technicians,  the  two I.M.F. officials  found  the

Bank   Negara's  revised  proposal   as   generally

workable and sound. However, it was emphasised that

there was the need for the two Governments to  join

issue  on  fundamental matters  which  have  to  be

resolved during the course of the negotiations.  He

described  the I.M.F.'s role as that of  an  honest

broker  and at no stage did it make any attempt  to

give  policy  advice  to  either  Government.   The

I.M.F., Sir, never recommended acceptance of the so-called final working draft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, what are Singapore's plans

for  the  future,  if  no  agreement  on  a  common

currency  can  be reached? I think it is  important

for  all of us to understand the present system  on

which  our currency is based. I shall then  explain

why it is vital for Singapore's economy to continue

with  the Currency Board arrangements with 100  per

cent backing in foreign exchange reserves for every

dollar we issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present currency system is based on what is

called  the sterling exchange standard. This  means

that  the  holder of a currency note has  a  right,

guaranteed  under  the  law,  to  exchange  it  for

equivalent value in sterling. To ensure  that  this

legal  right of the currency holder can  always  be

effectively  met,  the Board  of  Commissioners  of

Currency  is required under the law, to maintain  a

100 per cent backing of the note issue in sterling.

This  means  that for every dollar in  circulation,

there  is 2s. 4d, worth of assets held by the Crown

Agents   in  London  on  behalf  of  the   Currency

Commissioners.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This right of automatic convertibility of the

dollar into sterling and through sterling to  other

currencies  of the world is important. So  long  as

sterling (or other overseas) assets are not less in

value  than  the  total value of note  circulation,

automatic convertibility is guaranteed both in  law

and in fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system has three important consequences on

the  economy. First, it allows foreign trade to  be

conducted    without   exchange    control.    From

Singapore's  point of view as an  entrepot  trading

centre,  the  absence  of exchange  control  is  an

essential feature of our monetary system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of the automatic sterling

exchange  standard  is  that  balance  of  payments

equilibrium  is  achieved  through  variations   in

incomes.  For instance, if imports for  consumption

exceed earnings from exports and services, this  is

adjusted automatically by the reduction of  incomes

working through the economy and reducing imports in

subsequent  periods. As people's incomes  contract,

they buy less and with reduced expenditure, imports

also go down. Similarly, when earnings from exports

and  services  exceed imports in any given  period,

the  tendency is for increasing incomes to lead  to

increasing   expenditure  and  thus  to  increasing

imports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that, apart from overseas

loans  and grants, the Government must balance  its

budget,  both its recurrent and capital development

projects.  Total  Government  expenditure  must  be

balanced  by Government revenue and borrowing  from

the  public.  Where the Government  has  set  aside

reserves,  say, in the Development or other  Funds,

these  reserves  can be run down but  in  the  long

term, income must balance expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not always the case in other countries.

Leaving   aside  loans  and  grants  from  overseas

countries,  governments can borrow from  their  own

Central  Bank. This is a euphemism for printing  of

currency notes by the Central Bank and handing them

over  to the government to spend. Such Central Bank

loans   to  the  government  are  sometimes  called

"credit creation". It is the result



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



of  deficit financing, i.e., when government spends

more  than what it can collect in the form of taxes

or  borrow from the money market. "Credit creation"

in  this  sense  usually leads  to  more  money  in

circulation  chasing the same amount of  goods  and

services leading to rising prices or inflation.  In

its  acute  form,  it leads to a  collapse  of  the

exchange   currency,  as  has  happened   in   some

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial result of government borrowing from

the  Central  Bank  (printing  new  currency  notes

against  loan  scripts  signed  by  a  government's

finance minister) is that the money income  of  the

nation is increased by the amount of the additional

notes.  As  people  spend this  additional  income,

prices  begin  to  rise. Where part  of  the  money

income  is  spent on imports, then  there  will  be

pressure   on   the   country's  foreign   exchange

reserves.  For  unless exports keep pace  with  the

increase  in imports, the foreign exchange reserves

will   fall,   if   expenditure  on   imports   for

consumption  continues  to  exceed  earnings   from

exports, it will be necessary for the government to

ration the use of foreign exchange. The holder of a

currency  note  then loses his right  to  automatic

conversion  on  demand  into foreign  currency.  He

applies  for  permission to buy foreign currencies.

This is known as "exchange control". Unfortunately,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, exchange control has had  to  be

imposed in almost all the under-developed countries

which  have  emerged into independence since  World

War II and which have established their own Central

Banks.  For  our trading economy it  is  imperative

that  our  money must remain convertible to  enable

our traders to import almost anything from anywhere

either for resale or for our own consumption. There

is  no  rationing  of foreign exchange.  Obviously,

this  makes  trading much easier and  is  of  great

advantage to our entrepot economy. We must continue

this practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this system

was established by the colonial administration. The

Currency  Board system is not necessarily defective

just because a colonial administration used



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



it. Many newly independent countries have gone  on

to  the central banking system because the Currency

Board  system  prevented them from  spending  money

they  were not earning, as no notes could be issued

without 100 per cent backing in reserves. In  fact,

if  we  look  at  the  matter dispassionately,  the

Currency Board system has contributed substantially

to  the  financial stability of the present dollar.

Under  the Currency Board system it is not possible

for  a country to spend a dollar more than it earns

abroad.  As  a trading community, Singapore  cannot

afford  to have a currency that is less than  this.

If  our  word  is to be as good as our  bond,  then

Singapore's  currency must always remain  a  freely

convertible  one,  that is  a  hard  currency.  We,

therefore,  propose to continue with  the  Currency

Board system. In other words, Sir, the new currency

that  Singapore will issue from June next year will

at  all  times be backed 100 per cent  by  gold  or

foreign  exchange  assets, and  will  remain  fully

convertible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will begin its currency board issue on

a  sound  financial basis. Compared to the  end  of

1965,   official  reserves,  not  counting  foreign

assets  held  by commercial banks and  the  private

sector,  stand at over $1,021 million. This  is  10

per  cent  above the level of official reserves  at

the  end  of  last  year. This amount  of  official

reserves  is  adequate to finance retained  imports

into  Singapore for 10 months. This liquid position

compares  favourably with the most solvent  nations

of  the  world.  Another  strong  feature  is  that

Singapore's external debt position at the level  of

only $58 million is one of the lowest in the world.

This  amount of external debt represents  only  0.5

per  cent  of  current account earnings  in  recent

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term outlook is equally sound. Soon

after  the  separation of Singapore from  Malaysia,

the  World  Bank  sent  a  mission  to  assess  the

economic  and  financial position of Singapore.  In

the  estimation  of  the World  Bank,  the  foreign

exchange gap over the next five years until 1970



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



will  amount to only $350 million. This gap can  be

easily met. Prospects are good that the Bank itself

will  be prepared to lend Singapore about one-third

of  the  foreign exchange requirements.  The  World

Bank has already agreed to lend $45 million to  the

Port of Singapore Authority. Another one-third  can

be  made  available  through  bilateral  commercial

credits. A loan to finance the construction of  the

new Jurong Power Station has been negotiated with a

Japanese   supplier.   The  remaining   amount   is

therefore a relatively minor sum which can  be  met

by  Singapore itself. But even if Singapore borrows

the  entire shortfall of about $350 million in  the

next  five years to finance a development programme

estimated  at  $1,750 million,  the  external  debt

service  will amount to only slightly more  than  2

per  cent of estimated current account earnings  in

1970, the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years domestic exports have been

rising.  For  the annual period ending  June  1966,

domestic exports amounted to $1,090 million, or  an

increase  of  24 per cent over the same  period  in

1965.  The volume of trade for the 12 months ending

June  1966  showed an increase of $569 million,  or

just  over 9 per cent over the corresponding period

of  the  previous  year. Bank loans  and  advances,

always  good economic indicators, rose from  $1,011

million  at  the end of June last year  to  $1,054

million at the end of June this year, reflecting an

increase  of  4.3  per cent. Revenue  from  liquor,

tobacco and petroleum, the major sources of  public

finance,  have  also increased by about  12.24  per

cent this year. Finally, Singapore's gross domestic

product  in  1965  is estimated at $3,023  million,

which is an increase of $213 million, or 8 per cent

over the 1964 output. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, means

that  the per capital national income of Singapore,

after  stagnating in 1964, is again  on  an  upward

trend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These indicators reflect an expanding economy at

a  good rate of growth which can be maintained  and

even accelerated, given international confidence in

our  currency and economy, prudent use of resources

and hard work on our part.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful consideration, the Government has

decided to continue with a currency board which can

issue notes only with full 100 per cent backing  in

reserves.  We have decided to abjure  some  of  the

comforts  of  Central Banking finance which  offers

flexibility  and  temporary  relief  for  financial

stringency   but  which  often  leads  to   chronic

monetary difficulties. No developing country has as

yet demonstrated that it can successfully engage in

Central    Bank    credit   creation.    Calamitous

consequences  have  invariably  followed   when   a

developing  country indulges in borrowing  currency

notes  printed by its Central Bank. For  Singapore,

whose  economy  is  open and faces  competition  at

every  point from the rest of the world,  the  most

rigorous  monetary policies have  to  be  followed.

This  calls  for the tightest economic  and  social

discipline  from the people of Singapore.  The  100

per  cent  backed currency system that we  will  be

operating means that if Singapore wishes  to  spend

more, then we must first earn more. Productivity of

labour,  efficiency of management and the  strength

of   our   economic  infrastructure  have   to   be

maintained and improved continuously. There  is  no

alternative for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the luxury of maintaining

temporary full employment in an election year, with

which   some   governments  have   pampered   their

population by following inflationary policies,  low

interest rates and easy credits in order to  expand

consumption  and expand employment and  temporarily

expand  imports at the risk of running  down  their

foreign exchange reserves, is not one which will be

open  to  the Singapore Government. Whether  it  is

election  year, or any other year, if  there  is  a

fall  in  the dollars we earn either by  production

and sale of our goods and services, or by brokerage

on  trade,  then  the  amount of  foreign  exchange

earned  will  immediately go down,  the  amount  of

money  available for expenditure will also go down,

demands  on  goods and services will  go  down  and

unemployment must go up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rigorous regime but we must accept this

austere   and   severe  system  of  adjusting   our

consumption to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



earnings at all times if we are to maintain our pre-eminence  as a great trading centre. Whatever  else

may  be in doubt, the value of our currency and the

certainty  of its maintaining that value  at  which

prices  are  being quoted all over the  world,  can

never be placed in jeopardy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unless we reach a compromise agreement with

Malaysia  before the 12th of June,  1967,  we  must

constitute our Currency Board, for the old Currency

Board   consisting   of  representatives   of   the

Governments of Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei  will

be dissolved. On the new Currency Board, there will

be  adequate representation for our bankers,  both

those    representing   local   banks   and   banks

incorporated overseas. So it shall always be  known

and  manifestly known by banking circles throughout

the  world  that  for  every  Singapore  dollar  in

circulation,  there  is 2s  4d, worth  of  foreign

exchange,  or  0.290299 gramme of fine  gold  being

held by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that as long as we keep to the

mundane policies of a Currency Board and avoid  the

temptations  of  the  acrobatic  heights  of   high

finance   covered  by  the  Central   Bank   credit

creation, Singapore, over the next five years, will

demonstrate  its economic strength and  resilience,

and continue as a strong financial centre and haven

of capital in this part of South-east Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

decision to issue separate currencies as from  12th

June,  1967, was announced separately both in Kuala

Lumpur  and  Singapore  on the  afternoon  of  17th

August,  1966.  In view of the vital importance  of

this  matter, could the Minister say whether  there

is   any   reason   why  a  Ministerial   statement

explaining  the  differences and the  circumstances

which led to the breakdown of negotiations was  not

issued when Parliament met on the afternoon of 17th

August?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, correspondence

and  memoranda, as I said, will be published  in  a

White  Paper and tabled here later on. If the  hon.

Member  has a chance later on to look at  them,  he

will  notice  that in my letter to the Minister  of

Finance,  Malaysia, I did ask whether  he  had  any

alternative  arrangements to ensure that  we  would

have,  all  the  time, indisputable  ownership  and

control  of our assets other than the  suggestions

that I put forward to him. Therefore, at that time,

I  was still hoping that the door would be open for

negotiations,  and  I thought  it  might  prejudice

whatever chances we might have had of coming to  an

agreement if a statement were to be made then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for  Finance has informed  the  House  of

Singapore's  share  of the reserves  in  the  Joint

Currency Board. Will this sum form the reserves  of

our own new currency issue?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could you answer that question

without notice, Mr Lim?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, I will, as best I can.

Under the present system of the Currency Board,  it

is  estimated that Singapore's share of the  assets

totalling about $1,600 million now would  be  round

about $400 million - that is about 24 per cent. But

whether it will be much more than this will  depend

upon  the  redemption of the old currency when  the

new currency comes out. My own estimate is that  it

is  much more than a quarter, which is estimated by

the Currency Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lastly, what I can say now is that our

estimated share is about $400 million and this will

form the basis of reserves for our new currency.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, according to the answer made  by  the

Minister  for Finance to the Member for Changi,  he

said  that the reserves that we have come to  about

$1,600 million. I would like to ask him where these

reserves  are  now being held and  who  is  holding

them?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could it be that the Member

misunderstood the Minister's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



answer? I think his answer was that the reserves of

the Currency Board were about $1,600 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The reserves of the Currency

Board  are.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, these  reserves  of

about $1,600 million, or £200 million sterling, are

being  held by the Crown Agents who are  agents  of

the  Currency Board. The control and management  of

the  reserves  is by the Currency Board.  They  are

held in London by the Crown Agents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  ask the Minister for Finance this question:  is

it  because of the disagreement over the control of

this  amount  of Singapore's reserves that  is  the

cause of the breakdown in negotiations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not so

much  over  the  control of the reserves.  The  two

officials had met and had worked out different ways

in which each country can have control over its own

reserves. The disagreement is over the question  of

ownership of the reserves. The crux of the  problem

is  the suggestion made by Bank Negara Malaysia  as

to  how we can transfer our property to Bank Negara

Malaysia  in Singapore, since Bank Negara  Malaysia

in Singapore has no legal entity. At the same time,

it  also  suggested that the value of the  property

could  be  credited to the account of  Bank  Negara

Malaysia  in  Singapore,  while  the  title  should

remain with Bank Negara Malaysia, and we were asked

to  transfer  ownership of all our assets  to  Bank

Negara  Malaysia. Are we willing  to  transfer  our

currency  assets  to  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  -   a

statutory  body created by the Malaysian Government

and  over which it has full jurisdiction'? That  is

the  crux  of the problem. We are unwilling  to  do

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, our suggestion is that we either place

it  with  a third party - the I.M.F., the  Bank  of

England, or any party mutually acceptable -  or  we

form the Deputy Governor into a corporation to hold

our  currency  reserves in the  same  way  as  Bank

Negara Malaysia holds and owns the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



assets  of  the currency reserves of the  Malaysian

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I further clarify? When I say Deputy

Governor, I mean Deputy Governor for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Berita Harian of

the  23rd  of  August carried a headline  "SEPARATE

CURRENCY - SINGAPORE WAS IN THE WRONG". It went  on

to  say that the Malaysian Minister of Finance, Mr

Tan   Siew  Sin,  had  blamed  Singapore  for   the

breakdown  in  creating  a  common  currency   with

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister for Finance

explain  why, after he had agreed to make  a  joint

statement  without blaming any party  he  had  been

blamed by the Malaysian Finance Minister for  being

responsible for the breakdown?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would be a

superman  if I could prevent the Malaysian Minister

of  Finance from blaming me or anybody for anything

which we may or may not have done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the accusation which appeared in

headlines in the Berita Harian that Singapore is in

the wrong, that Singapore turned down the agreement

after  the officials had agreed after negotiations,

I  think in my statement I have made it very  clear

that  the  officials  never  agreed  on  any  draft

agreement  which  they worked on,  that  the  draft

agreements were actually draft agreements and  that

in  the event of any doubt arising, the two parties

should get together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

agreement  we  are  entering  into  is   a   unique

agreement where two sovereign nations are trying to

find  a  formula  to  work a  common  currency  and

banking  arrangement. The World Bank admitted  that

this  is  unique.  Therefore,  no  one  knows   the

formula.  When  all the officials  meet,  it  is  a

question  of  exploring. That is why  I  said  that

proposals  and  counter-proposals were  made.  They

were  exploring all the different devices in  which

they could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



accommodate  one another. Never was there  a  final

agreement  reached  on the proposals  and  counter-proposals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   if  the  cause  of  the  breakdown  of   the

negotiations was over the ownership of  Singapore's

reserves, how is it that we read in the papers that

Mr  Tan  Siew Sin said in the Malaysian Parliament

that  disagreement  over the economic  and  banking

policies  arising  out  of two  separate  political

entities  of  Singapore and  Malaysia  led  to  the

breakdown of the negotiations? Why has our Minister

for  Finance  not told us of this in his  statement

this afternoon?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not aware

of  any differences in banking and financial policy

so  far.  That is the reason why I have not touched

on it at all in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. Members are aware that the Bank

Negara Malaysia has a branch in Singapore and it is

still  looking  after  the  banking  and  financial

policy  here. At the very outset, I felt that  both

currency and banking is the strongest tie  that  is

holding us together. And I was hoping that as  long

as  we  could maintain this tie, it would be easier

to  have economic co-operation elsewhere. For  that

reason,  we never told the Bank Negara Malaysia  to

withdraw  its  branch  here.  There  have  been  no

differences  at  all as far as I am  aware  in  the

banking,  financial or monetary policy.  I  do  not

know,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  but  maybe  in  future,

Malaysia  may  have  a different financial  policy.

From  my statement today, you will realise that  we

are  going  on  with  a  hundred  per  cent  backed

currency, whereas the Malaysian Government, because

of  certain amendments to the Currency Regulations,

will  empower the Minister of Finance to  vary  the

backing from a hundred to 70 per cent. That is  the

beginning   of   differences  in  monetary   policy

already.  But in the past, as far as  I  am  aware,

there has been no difference at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I understand from the proceedings  in

the Malaysian Parliament that the advice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



of  the International Monetary Fund was accepted by

the   Malaysian  Government  but  rejected  by  the

Singapore Government. Can the Minister for  Finance

tell   this  House  why  the  Singapore  Government

rejected the advice of the I.M.F.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the hon.

Member  had  been  paying  close  attention  to  my

statement,  he would not have asked that  question.

But for his benefit, may I quote again the relevant

portions   to   show  that  the   officials   never

recommended   or  never  agreed   on   this   draft

agreement?  If you will bear with me, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I will look for the relevant portion. Here  it

is and I quote, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore representatives pointed out that

the  clauses which had been agreed to at  the  past

seven meetings at the official level should not  be

regarded as final and irreversible. They maintained

that the officials of both Governments reserved the

right  to review and change the draft Agreement  in

whatever  way  necessary  in  the  light   of   the

Agreement as a whole.'



<br><br>Now,  there is a further quotation here, and I will

continue with this quotation, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It was noted that both the Malaysian and

Singapore Governments reserved the right to  decide

in  the final analysis, whether this Clause or  any

other clauses should be included in the Agreement.'



<br><br>Tan  Sri Ismail, if you will remember, Mr Speaker,

Sir, chaired the meetings, and this is a record  of

the  meeting  made by Bank Negara Malaysia, and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tan Sri Ismail suggested that these final drafts

should be transmitted to the respective Governments

for  consideration. The views and reactions of both

the  Governments  would be discussed  at  the  next

meeting.'



<br><br>This  is a record of the meeting which was held  on

the 5th of July, 1966. This happened to be the last

meeting and there was no meeting called in spite of

what  is  recorded  here  -  that  "the  views  and

reactions   of  both  the  Governments   would   be

discussed at the next meeting." Therefore,  it  was

apparent  from the quotations of records  of  these

minutes of the meetings that the officials of both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



sides were never agreed on this draft agreement  at

all, nor did they recommend it and we reject it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I ask the Minister to clarify one point in

his statement on common currency?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just talked of a possible compromise

agreement. Would he enlighten the House on  whether

he  is prepared to compromise on the principle that

the  assets  of  Singapore should be  safe  against

unilateral breach of the agreement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> No, Sir. There is a basic

assumption on which we start. We have made  certain

proposals which, in our view, would ensure that our

assets would never be jeopardised. But I would come

to  an agreement if the Malaysian Government or the

Malaysian  Finance  Minister  has  got  any   other

alternative proposals which would ensure the safety

of our assets.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. A. Gonzales (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis leaders who  are

absent   from  this  House  have  issued  a   Press

statement  saying that our currency will be  weaker

and the value of our dollar will be lower than that

of  the Malaysian dollar, because Singapore has  no

natural resources as Malaysia has. Can the Minister

for  Finance assure the House of the value  of  the

Singapore   dollar  since  Singapore  has   limited

natural resources?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I say that the

Barisan  Sosialis are always out to do a disservice

not  only  to  us but to the people  of  Singapore.

Hence  this  white lie which they  put  up  -  that

because Singapore has got no natural resources, the

Singapore  dollar will be weaker than the Malaysian

dollar.  That  is utter rot and utter nonsense.  We

have   seen   many  countries  with  rich   natural

resources.  But what happens to their currency?  It

is  just  like "banana notes" - I need not  mention

the country. But here we are going on a hundred per

cent  backed  currency which means that  no  matter

what happens, even if we are burnt down,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



if  we  are  looted and all that,  our  assets  are

outside.  Anyone who holds a Singapore  dollar  can

redeem  it. We have got the backing for it.  It  is

not  what you have that counts. It is what you earn

and how you manage your currency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> How much

you print.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, and how much you print. If

you  have a backing of $100 million, and you  print

$1,000  million, then obviously the  value  of  the

currency goes down. It is a simple thing, like  the

running  of  a  household. If you are earning  less

than  what you spend, then, of course, you get into

difficulties. As for Singapore, we will never allow

the  Finance Minister of Singapore to take the easy

way  out;  that is, whenever he cannot balance  his

budget,  he goes to the Central Bank and  says,  "I

give  you  an  I.O.U.," and the Central  Bank  just

churns out notes! No, I do not think that is a good

way. And we have seen many new developing countries

where  that is done. It is a very simple  thing  to

do.  It  becomes  habit forming and,  in  the  end,

nothing  is  left. You will have notes  which  cost

more  than what it costs to print. We are not going

in for that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has  made  a

statement  just now. I would like  to  ask  him  to

clarify  a  step further in order to enable  us  to

know  when  or whether we can have our own  Central

Bank,  like that of Malaysia, so that it can  issue

its  own currency and need not have to depend on  a

Currency Board created under a colonial regime,  as

in  the  past. I would also like to ask him whether

it  is  necessary for us to have a Central Bank  to

issue  currency and, at the same time, to  preserve

the  value  of our currency against any fluctuation

or other influences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

reason why we should have one. Our feeling is this:

looking around us we have seen that Central Banking

financing in developing countries is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



prelude   to  an  easy  way  out  of  a   difficult

situation,  and  it has led to disaster.  One  must

first  understand what is the objective of  setting

up  a  Central Bank; whether it is for prestige  so

that you can go to an international conference  and

say,  "Look, I have got a Central Bank and this  is

the Governor of my Central Bank." Or do you want it

to  serve a useful purpose? A Central Bank, as  far

as  I understand it, can only be effective if there

is  what  you call a highly developed money market.

And  I,  for  one,  feel that  in  most  developing

countries  there  is not a highly  developed  money

market;  there  is  an absence of  a  money  market

entirely. Central Banks are set up, first, probably

for prestige, and second, for the flexibility which

allows Finance Ministers to juggle with expenditure

when  they  are  engaged in deficit  financing.  In

Singapore,  where we really have to work  hard  and

discipline  ourselves, we must not be put  to  this

temptation - for me or any future Finance Minister.

Therefore, as far as we are concerned, I think  the

control of banking and the control of watching over

foreign  exchange can be supervised by other  means

than  a  Central  Bank. One of the  most  important

functions  of a Central Bank in a highly  developed

country  is  to  influence  the  amount  of   money

available   through  what  we  call   open   market

operations. In most of the developing countries, it

is  not possible to do that simply because there is

no  money market. So for our purpose I do not think

it  would  be  advisable to set up a Central  Bank.

Anyway,  that  is  our thought at  the  moment  and

unless and until some -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is a final thought.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The Prime Minister, having

listened to what a Finance Minister could  do  with

the flexibility of a Central Bank, has put his foot

down and says, "This is our final resolve. There is

going to be no Central Bank."



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we have heard the answers  given

by the Minister for Finance of Singapore in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



which   he  gave  reasons  for  the  breakdown   of

negotiations on a common currency. Is he not  aware

that  the  Malaysian Minister of Finance  does  not

intend  to  co-operate  for  mutual  interest?  The

Malaysian  Finance Minister has all along  supplied

statistics of imports and exports which have  given

faith to traders not only in Singapore but also  in

Malaysia.   Therefore,   the   Malaysian    Finance

Minister's  intention is to barrage the economy  of

Singapore with -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Inche Mahmud, could you

please  try to frame your "question" as a question,

rather than in the form of a long speech? Could you

be more precise with your question?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, when

I  put my question, it was a bit long-winded.  Sir,

Singapore  traders  have  complete  faith  in   the

economy  of  Singapore which ensures our prosperity

compared  to that of Malaysia. My question  is:  is

the  Finance Minister of Singapore aware  that  the

Malaysian  Finance Minister has ill  intentions  to

cause the breakdown of negotiations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not think I

can  comment on what the hon. Member has said. What

he meant was that the Malaysian Minister of Finance

wants to do Singapore in. I cannot comment on that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the

Minister  for  Finance reveal  to  this  House  the

contents   of   the  draft  agreement   which   the

International  Monetary Fund helped to  draft,  and

what  were  the differences which were unacceptable

to the Singapore Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they will be

in the White Paper - the draft agreement - which is

not drafted by the I.M.F. There is no agreement. It

is just a draft working agreement. They will all be

published in the White Paper which I hope will come

here in time from the Printers this afternoon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been

told by the Finance Minister that our currency will

be  backed 100 per cent by sterling. In view of the

frequent  crises of the pound, however,  would  the

Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I never said that our currency

would  be backed 100 per cent by sterling.  I  said

our currency will have 100 per cent backing.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does that answer your question, Mr

Tang?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Not quite, Mr Speaker,

because  the  Finance Minister  did  say  that  our

dollar  can  always be exchanged at  2s.  4d.  That

means  that  we  are pegging our  dollar  to  pound

sterling,  in  which  case,  should  there   be   a

devaluation in pound sterling, we may  then  be  in

some trouble. In view of this, would the Government

consider, instead of fixing the exchange parity  at

2s. 4d, pound sterling, pegging our dollar to gold,

so  as  to  ensure  that  we  would  not  run  into

financial  crises whenever the pound sterling  does

so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not share

the  lack of confidence of the hon. Member for Choa

Chu  Kang  in the pound sterling. Anyway, there  is

nothing that we can do until June 1967. What  I  am

saying  is  that  the value of our dollar  will  be

equal  to 2s. 4d, or its equivalent in gold,  which

is .2 something gramme of fine gold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Time is getting on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> One last question, Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

acknowledged  that the continuance  of  the  common

currency  and  banking arrangements  is  of  mutual

interest  to  both  countries.  Will  the  Minister

kindly indicate whether there is any likelihood  of

a   fresh  approach  being  made  to  resolve  this

arrangement?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We are still leaving the door

open,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. As I said, the matter  is

not  finalised until 12th June, 1967. I have in  my

letter requested for alternative proposals if  they

have  alternative proposals. We are always,  within

reason,  ready  to  talk  as  long  as  the   basic

assumptions  are agreed on. I have spelt  out  what

the  basic assumptions are and we are at  any  time

ready to come and talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has your question been covered

already?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you please say what you have

to say?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I am

going  to say is not on something which has already

been  covered, as you have suggested, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will take two more questions - Mr

Teong's and one more after that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what  I want to ask is very brief.  Once  our

country  issues our own currency, I would  like  to

ask  the  Minister concerned whether there will  be

any  change  in our currency system. For  instance,

will  the value of our currency be higher than  its

present  value? Secondly, I would like to  ask  the

Minister this: once we issue our own currency, what

will  be the convertibility of the currency between

Singapore and Malaysia, and whether there  will  be

any   arrangement  or  system  to  channelise  this

convertibility between the two currencies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, as I said, the

value  of our dollar will be the same as it is  now

2s.  4d., or its equivalent in gold. I believe  the

Malaysians  have also pegged their new currency  to

the equivalent of 2s. 4d, or, as they put it in  so

many grammes of gold.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  it  is  likely that the  new  Malaysian

dollar and our dollar - that is, if we do not  come

to  an  agreement - would have the  same  value  and

probably  agreement could be reached  later  on  on

what  we  call "customary tender"; that  is,  their

notes  would be acceptable here and our notes would

be  acceptable  there and the value  would  be  the

same.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will now move on to Government

<div align="center"><b>PUNISHMENT FOR VANDALISM BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be aware of the reasons for this

Bill, for we have witnessed for some time the sorry

spectacle  of  people  of  ill-will  smearing   and

defacing  our  fair city. The writing  of  slogans,

drawing  of  pictures,  painting  and  marking   or

inscribing on public and private property has  been

rampant. Indeed, even the sides of drains have been

used  by anti-social and anti-national elements  in

the  name  of  democracy, but their crude  artistic

feats  in  effect destroy and deface what democracy

has built for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has also recently witnessed acts of

vandalism  like  the theft of insulating  oil  from

electrical power stations and the wanton damage  to

fountains.  Damaging or destroying public  property

which  is  provided for the benefit of  the  people

must be considered extremely serious, for it is the

people  themselves  who  ultimately  pay  for   the

services  and amenities provided by the Government.

However,    there    are,   regrettably,    certain

irresponsible persons in the community who  find  a

cruel   joy  in  destroying  and  damaging   public

property.  In  the interests of the nation,  it  is

therefore  necessary that the  minority  who  cause

damage should be dealt with severely.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill are simple and

straightforward.  Clause  2  of  the  Bill  defines

"private property", "public property", and "act  of

vandalism". An act of vandalism includes  stealing,

destroying or damaging any public property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides that not only a person who

commits  the  act  of vandalism but  also  one  who

attempts  or  causes any such act to  be  committed

shall  be  guilty of the offence. Persons  who  are

convicted  of  the offence of vandalism  shall,  in

addition  to  fine or imprisonment,  be  liable  to

caning.  Sir,  during the Committee  stage  of  the

House,  I shall introduce amendments for increasing

the  penalty  of  fine  and  imprisonment  and  for

specifying  the  minimum  and  maximum  number   of

strokes  of the cane. Exemption from the punishment

of  caning is granted to all women and men who  are

more  than 50 years of age and those who have  been

sentenced to death. Clause 3 also provides that the

punishment of caning shall not be imposed on  first

conviction  in  the  case of an  act  of  vandalism

involving writing, drawing, painting, etc, with  a

delible  substance such as crayon, chalk or  pencil

and  not with an indelible substance such as  paint

or tar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides that the written authority or

the written consent as the case may be required for

a  person to put up posters, etc, shall be produced

on  demand to any member of the Police, the Special

Constabulary, the Auxiliary Police or any member of

the Naval, Military or Air Force of Singapore or of

those  lawfully present in Singapore. A person  who

fails,  refuses or neglects to produce such written

authority  shall  be guilty of an  offence  and  is

liable to a fine not exceeding $500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides for the seizure of posters,

placards, bunting, etc, to serve as exhibits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 6 the offence is made seizable and non-bailable. This means that any person may arrest one

who  engages  in an act of vandalism and  hand  him

over to the police.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of the Bill is the fact that

not  only  the  person or persons who  actually  do

these  acts  will be punished but  also  those  who

cause  such acts to be done. It is common knowledge

to Members that anti-national elements use children

and other young persons to smear and mar public and

private  property. These young people  may  not  be

expected to understand their acts and they could be

disciplined  by  their elders giving  them  a  good

spanking.  However, the person actually responsible

for  these acts has hitherto got away with it. This

Bill now gives the power to use the rod effectively

on  those  who  are  really  behind  such  acts  of

vandalism.   Indeed  the  punishment  which   would

normally be meted out to children can now be  meted

out  to  the adult delinquents actually responsible

for wanton acts of vandalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to state at this stage that two new

clauses to the Bill will be proposed by me  at  the

Committee stage of the House. I shall give  reasons

for these new clauses at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reasons for the

introduction  of  this Bill  are  quite  clear  and

anyone  who loves his country and who loves to  see

it  clean and tidy will not oppose this Bill  which

is  to  provide exemplary punishment  for  acts  of

vandalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

House will accept the reasons given by the Minister

of   State   of   Defence  for  the  necessity   of

introducing this Bill. However, looking at the Bill

as  a  whole and especially at the amendments  that

the   Minister  is  going  to  introduce  for   the

punishment of acts of vandalism as defined  in  the

Bill, I have the impression that the Government  is

taking  the view that severity of punishment  is  a

deterrent. Mr Speaker, Sir, severity of punishment

may  not, in fact, necessarily be a deterrent.  The

way to deter any crime, I submit, is to impress  on

the wrong-doer the certainty of his being found out

if he commits one. Also I have the impression



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



that  as  far as acts  of  vandalism  are

concerned,  that  is, excluding  the  anti-national

elements,  this  Bill  could  only  be  an  interim

measure, because, as I see it, vandalism cannot  be

rooted out by the introduction of a Bill with  very

severe  punishment. It can only be  rooted  out  by

educating our young to respect public property  and

to  have  a  sense of pride in the public amenities

provided  by  society.  Also  there  appear  to  be

certain inconsistencies in the law if this Bill  is

passed,  and  I  wonder whether the  Minister  will

consider  amending  the  law regarding  punishment.

Here  in this Bill it says that an act of vandalism

- if the amendments go through - is punishable by a

fine of not exceeding $2,000, or imprisonment of  a

term  not exceeding three years, and also mandatory

caning  except  in certain circumstances.  However,

the  Minor Offences Ordinance, section 11 of  which

has not been -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, if you are addressing

yourself to specific provisions as you are  now,  I

suggest that the Committee stage would be the  more

appropriate  place to address your  remarks.  Could

you  try to speak now on the broad policies of  the

Bill rather than on narrow specific details?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. But these

specific details, in fact, concern the broad policy

of  the  Bill,  because it does mean that,  broadly

speaking, the punishment provided in this Bill,  as

I  view  it,  is  far too severe  in  view  of  the

existing   provisions   of   the   Minor   Offences

Ordinance,  section 11 (1) of which  has  not  been

amended. May I, Mr Speaker, quote from section 11?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`11 - (1) Any person who commits any of the

following  offences shall be liable to a  fine  not

exceeding fifty dollars:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) without authority in the case of public

property, or without the consent of the  owner

<br><br>This person would then be punished with only a fine

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



if  the law-enforcing authorities should charge the

same person for the same offence under the new  Act

to  be passed, he would be punished with a fine  of

not less than $2,000 or imprisonment of three years

with  mandatory caning. I am just bringing up these

provisions for the consideration of the Government.

Possibly  the Government may wish to amend  section

11  (1)  of the Minor Offences Ordinance so  as  to

bring  it  into line with the policy  of  deterrent

against offenders who commit acts of vandalism.  As

I  said,  Mr Speaker, on the whole, we  appreciate

the reasons for the introduction of this Bill and I

on balance support it.



<br><br>4.38p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to explain to the House what we are seeking to

do  by  making this departure from what  is  normal

criminal  law legislation. One of the  problems  we

face    in   running   the   British   system    of

administration of justice is that the law is  often

being  administered, particularly in recent  years,

by  legally trained magistrates who do not have the

advantage  of the wider background of the  problems

of  the  society and of administering that society.

So  it  is  that  by  the time the  offender  of  a

particularly  vicious  social  misdemeanour,   like

taking a pot of paint and going to every bus  stand

and  chalking  up anti-American or anti-British  or

pro-Vietcong slogans, is apprehended and brought to

court,   from  the  vicious  petty  slogan-shouting

hooligan  that  he is outside, he converts  himself

into  a  meek, humble breadwinner of a large family

who  was doing no more than just giving vent to his

political  exuberance.  And  he  gets  off  with  a

caution and sometimes a light fine. The net  result

is    that   this   particularly   vicious   social

misdemeanour  is not capable of being checked,  let

alone  stopped. It is difficult enough to apprehend

these  offenders. Under the section  in  the  Minor

Offences  Ordinance which we have to operate,  this

is  a  non-seizable offence. So if you  are  not  a

police officer, or even if you are a member of  the

Vigilante Corps, you will be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



very  brave man to go and apprehend such a culprit.

I  do not think it is possible for us to go back to

the  old  British  practice where  people  who  are

administrators,  having  served  a  term   in   the

business of running the government, then do a spell

of  two or more years on the Bench, and so there is

a  constant flow of fairly matter-of-fact gentlemen

who  understand  the mechanics of  how  the  system

works and know the other side of the coin, not just

what happens in the courtroom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes a clear distinction between what

is  considered  a  lesser offence, something  which

just  dirties up the wall - which is delible -  and

where  you  deliberately seek to mess up the  place

from  time to time with red paint, which is a  very

difficult  substance to eradicate, on bus  shelters

and  public  buildings. Large  sums  of  money  are

expended  in  order to remove the  unsightly  scars

which they leave behind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the problem has been complicated by the

ease  of  access to public property which,  in  the

nature  of things, is difficult to prevent.  Thefts

of  fountain  heads  made of copper,  copper  tubes

outside Housing and Development Board premises used

for  boilers  and other things - and copper  is  in

short  supply because of the transportation problem

of  Rhodesian  and Zambian copper - and  thefts  of

valuable  parts  of non-ferrous metals  have  taken

place,  to  be sold for a fraction of their  actual

cost.  I do not think we can allow this to  go  on,

and  I  know  how strongly the profession  and  the

penologists  are  against caning.  But  we  have  a

society  which, unfortunately, I think, understands

only  two things - the incentive and the deterrent.

We  intend  to use both, the carrot and the  stick.

The  carrot  is good citizenship. It is a  seizable

offence  to do any of these acts of vandalism,  and

any  member of the Vigilante Corps, any  member  of

the  public, can apprehend. A reward will be  given

in  order  that these culprits will be  apprehended

and these crimes will stop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a fine will not deter the type

of  criminal  we  are  facing  here.  He  is  quite

prepared to go to gaol,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



having  defaced  public buildings with  red  paint.

Flaunting the values of his ideology, he  is  quite

prepared  to  make a martyr of himself  and  go  to

gaol.  He  will  not  pay  the  fine  and  make   a

demonstration of his martyrdom. But if he knows  he

is  going to get three of the best, I think he will

lose  a great deal of enthusiasm, because there  is

little  glory  attached to the  rather  humiliating

experience of having to be caned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I am

quite sure that this is going to solve our problem,

but  I am convinced that if we are not prepared  to

innovate,  if  we are just to stick to  old  formal

channels  of legislation or old forms and modes  of

social  control,  then these are  areas  of  public

behaviour  over which society will have no  control

whatsoever.  I hope that there will  never  be  any

cause,  once these provisions are known,  for  them

ever to be invoked. But I feel reasonably confident

that  if the offenders are apprehended - as I think

they   can   be  apprehended;  these  are  seizable

offences  and  there  are  enough  people  in   the

Vigilante Corps and public-spirited members of  the

ordinary public - and an example is made of a  few,

then  we  will not have the discomfiture of finding

the electric power supply failing, because somebody

risks blowing up a whole transformer substation for

a  few  dollars' worth of public property which  is

not  sufficiently guarded. If this is understood  -

and they have a tendency to understand very quickly

once  the  word gets around -I am quite  sure  that

there  will  be  a healthier respect for  community

property. This happens all over the world.  But  in

every society, values are different, and ours is  a

new and young one. We could take the other point of

view - the Government could be purely negative  and

say,  "Well, in that case, we should not have  this

community  property. We should not have  fountains.

We  should not have these parks. We should not have

these  amenities,  because they are  likely  to  be

destroyed, mutilated and losses will be  heavy."  I

think that is a defeatist attitude. By and large, I

would say that the majority of the people are  law-

abiding and respect community property,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



and if we can check the misbehaviour of this

minority,  then  we can move into wider  fields  of

public  amenities  with  greater  confidence  that,

first,  the  expenditure will not be  wasted,  and,

second,  the maintenance will be what the  planners

estimate it to be and not what we subsequently find

ourselves carrying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope eventually that the remarks I have made

here in this House will also be heeded not only  by

the offenders but also by those who participate  in

the  administration of justice. I  have  a  feeling

that often in the younger ranks of the service, the

administration  of justice is believed  to  be  the

application of the law. It is because they  believe

that, that we are forced to take these measures.  I

think  a wider grasp that administration of justice

means  the application of the letter of the law  in

such  a  spirit  that society is  able  to  protect

itself, is fundamental. If we are able to implement

these  provisions with efficacy in  the  first  few

months,  I am quite sure that this will be  a  dead

letter in our statute book.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members

will  have observed that this Bill seeks to provide

exemplary punishment for acts of vandalism and that

such punishment is to include caning which is to be

made mandatory on conviction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, it must be conceded that present-day penological trends are against the infliction

of caning as a punishment and that legal opinion is

in  general  against  the  imposition  of  corporal

punishment  in  cases  not  involving  violence  or

brutality.    We   are,   however,   unfortunately,

confronted  with a situation which has  to  be  met

with  boldly  and must take effective  measures  to

curb,  indeed  eradicate, completely  irresponsible

acts  of  hooliganism. Parts of fountains built  at

considerable expense to beautify the city have been

destroyed  or stolen, thus completely or  partially

immobilising them and making it necessary  to  post

policemen in the vicinity of fountains. Yet  others

steal  vital  parts from electric switch-boxes  and

substations, supremely indifferent to the attendant

risk of fire and loss of life and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



property. Other acts of vandalism include  painting

slogans  on bus shelters, telephone booths, bridges

and  walls, affixing posters and banners on  public

and   private   property,  thus   defacing   public

property.  Apart from defacement of such  property,

such  slogans often are not of a nature  calculated

to  keep the peace. There are yet others who scrawl

on  walls  or deface or destroy property for  sheer

devilment or mischief. However, Members will, I  am

sure, agree that it is imperative to make provision

in the law for deterrent punishment which this Bill

now before the House seeks to do. I need hardly say

that  the  existing  punishment provided  for  such

offences  is, as the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  has

pointed out, a fine not exceeding $50, and  has  in

the  present context proved to be wholly inadequate

as a deterrent measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides that where any person steals,

destroys or damages any public property, or without

the written consent of the owner or occupier in the

case   of   private  property  or  without  written

authority in the case of public property, paints or

marks  any  public or private property, or  affixes

any poster or placard or any bunting or banner with

any  slogan or caricature on, in or from  any  such

property, or attempts to do the same or causes  the

same to be damaged, he is to be caned on conviction

in addition to being fined or imprisoned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to move amendments to the Bill in

Committee whereby the number of strokes insofar  as

caning  is  concerned is to be  specified  and  the

period  of imprisonment increased. But we will  say

more  about  that in Committee. The  punishment  of

caning  has  been  introduced advisedly  and  after

considerable thought. It has been found in practice

that  while  many  convicted  persons  will  accept

without  demur  a  heavy fine  or  even  a  lengthy

sentence  of imprisonment, they tend to  view  with

the  greatest  alarm and despondency  any  sentence

which  requires the infliction of caning. This  is,

of  course, typical of the mentality of  the  bully

and   the  coward  and  of  those  who  choose   to

perpetrate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



their  offences under cover of darkness, which  is,

in fact, the case with the majority of acts of this

sort.  Caning  has accordingly been made  mandatory

upon conviction and the Court is required to impose

such  a sentence, though their acceptance prohibits

the   infliction  of  corporal  punishment   on   a

teenager,   and  the  Court  is  given  a   further

discretion not to impose corporal punishment  where

the  prisoner is more than 50 years of  age.  These

prohibitions have been inserted in order  that  the

general  rules governing the infliction of corporal

punishment   now  to  be  found  in  the   Criminal

Procedure  Code are not contradictory. Caning  will

also not be imposed on a first conviction where the

act  of vandalism comprises drawing or marking with

pen,   pencil,  crayon,  chalk  or  other   delible

substance but not with an indelible substance  such

as paint. Neither will a person be caned on a first

conviction  for affixing or displaying  posters  or

hanging  or suspending banners as it would only  be

fair  to  equate  both  these  offences  with   the

punishment for delible writing since posters can be

torn off easily enough and banners taken down.  All

these  detailed provisions are deemed necessary  in

order  that  this  new legislation may  effectively

achieve its object.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the amendments to the Bill which it is

proposed  to move in Committee are the introduction

of   two   important  clauses:  one   relating   to

presumptions in the law of evidence and  the  other

to  second-hand  dealers who receive  stolen  State

property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by a two-pronged move, one,

dealing as severely as possible with the malefactor

who  is  the  actual  perpetrator  of  the  act  of

vandalism and, secondly, by cutting off his  avenue

for  the  sale  of  such property  as  well  as  by

cancelling  the  licences  of  second-hand  dealers

convicted  of  receiving such stolen  property,  we

hope  to remove this blot on the fair name  of  the

Republic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the substitution of the phrase

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Penal Code provides a maximum of three years'

imprisonment  for  theft and for  receiving  stolen

property. Clause 3 of this Bill covers stealing  of

public property having regard to the provisions  in

the   Penal   Code.   And   in   order   to   avoid

inconsistency,  it  is necessary  to  increase  the

penalty  in  clause 3 of the Bill  to  a  fine  not

exceeding $2,000 and to imprisonment for a term not

exceeding three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

"with not less than three strokes and not more than

eight strokes".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision in clause 3 with regard to caning

does not specify the number of strokes of the cane.

This  leaves  the position uncertain and  throws  a

heavy  burden on the Court. In order to avoid this,

it  is considered that provision should be made for

the  maximum  and  minimum number of  strokes  that

should  be  inflicted on persons convicted  of  the

offence,  leaving to the Court only the  discretion

to  decide  on  the  number of strokes  within  the

number  of  eight strokes and a minimum  number  of

three strokes of the cane.

hundreds  of  dollars and which cannot be  obtained

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is to provide the

permissive legal framework for the establishment of

free  trade  zones  in Singapore  to  preserve  and

promote the entrepot and transit trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attain a rapid rate of economic growth and to

provide  employment  opportunities  for  a  growing

population,  the  Government  has  embarked  on   a

programme  for rapid development of the  industrial

sector.  At the same time all efforts must be  made

to safeguard the interests of the entrepot trade as

it  is  still  the  most important  sector  of  the

economy  and  the main source of foreign  exchange.

With  the  end  of  confrontation,  prospects  have

returned   for  not  only  maintaining   but   even

expanding the level of entrepot trade. In addition,

new trade links are being forged with new countries

who  did  not  trade with us before.  Attracted  by

Singapore's   excellent  distribution   facilities,

commercial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



connections  and  other ancillary  services,  these

countries  are  expected to  utilise  the  Port  of

Singapore for selling their goods in this  part  of

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A free trade zone for Singapore to replace her

free  port  status was recommended by a World  Bank

Mission in July 1963, when the Telok Ayer Basin was

suggested as the site for entrepot goods discharged

by  lighter and other small craft. During Malaysia,

the  site  was initially developed and  legislation

drafted so as to declare the Basin and the port for

the  purpose of establishing the first  free  trade

zone in Singapore. In the zone trading and entrepot

activities  would  be entirely  free  from  customs

control. Upon separation, the draft legislation was

revised  yet  again to suit the changed  short-term

conditions,  but not to lose sight of  the  longer-term interests of this region as a whole. The views

of   representatives  of  the  four   Chambers   of

Commerce,  as  well as the Singapore Manufacturer's

Association,    on    the   desirable    permissive

legislation  for  the establishment  of  such  free

trade zones have been solicited during the drafting

of    the   permissive   legislation   now   before

Parliament, and it is considered that for the large

entrepot  trade of Singapore, specially  designated

free trade zones in addition to licensed and bonded

warehouses  with  drawback facilities  provide  the

best solution. From within such zones, the entrepot

and  transit  trades can be conducted  without  the

payment of any tariffs and with the minimal customs

control.   In  the  principal  customs   territory,

additional  Government licensed factory  warehouses

will  continue  to be utilised for the  storage  of

dutiable goods, particularly high-duty goods as  at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the contents of the Bill, I would like

to elaborate on the more salient clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 allows for the designation of any

areas in Singapore as free trade zones and for  the

appointment  of  the authority  to  administer  and

operate such zones.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 defines the operations which will be

permitted within a free trade zone. Goods which are

not  specifically prohibited may  be  brought  into

free   trade  zones,  destroyed,  sent  to  customs

territory  or exported to any other country.  Goods

may be stored, processed, exhibited and manipulated

within  a free trade zone. Goods which are  brought

into  the free trade zone from "customs territory",

shall  be  regarded as exported for the purpose  of

claiming drawback on duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 11, the Minister may permit

manufacture to be carried out in the zone  as  this

is  necessary  to cater for existing  manufacturers

within  the envisaged free trade zone, and also  to

allow  for  the  setting  up  of  export-orientated

industries where feasible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 7 provides powers for the regulation

of  operations,  customs  supervision  and  control

within the zone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 makes provision for the calculation of

duties  to be levied on goods manufactured  in  the

zone   when  they  are  bought  into  the  "customs

territory". This is an important clause to  protect

the  interests of the manufacturers in the "customs

territory" and will ensure that manufacturers sited

in  the  free  trade zone area do not  enjoy  undue

advantage   over  manufacturers  in  the   "customs

territory".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 regulates the consumption of dutiable

goods within the zone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 deals with the responsibilities and

functions of the authority administering  the  zone

such  as  maintenance of proper facilities for  the

zone  and  provision for customs checks, collection

of revenue and prevention of evasion of duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 gives powers to the administering

authority  to  exclude or remove  goods  which  are

prejudicial to the public interest or safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 provides for the maintenance of

accounts as prescribed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 20 to 24 make provision for dealing with

offences and contraventions of the law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier in the year, the Customs (Amendment)

Act,   1966,   was  enacted  to  conform   to   the

constitutional changes and to make improvements  in

customs administration and facilities in the  light

of past experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make further modifications to

the Customs laws to provide for and to take account

of  the future establishment of free trade zones in

Singapore.   Provision  is  also   made   for   the

introduction of duty-free shops to operate  in  the

City  outside  any free trade zone, and  for  their

regulation and control.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the more important clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 of the Bill changes the definitions

of  "dutiable goods", "export", "import",  "goods",

"value"   and  introduces  three  new  definitions:

"customs   territory",  "free   trade   zone"   and

"tourist",  to accord with the replacement  of  the

existing  free  port status by a principal  customs

territory and a free trade zone or zones.  "import"

no   longer  means  the  bringing  of  goods   into

Singapore  but  into "customs territory"  from  any

place outside, including any free trade zone. Goods

genuinely in transit are not included as such goods

will  be  within  any free trade zone  and  outside

customs  control. Likewise, "export" will not  mean

taking  of  goods  out  of  Singapore  but  out  of

"customs  territory" to any outside place including

any free trade zone. The term "value" is amended to

specify  equitably that customs duties and  charges

incurred on wharf handling, storage, removal and so

on,  incurred in a free trade zone are  not  to  be

included. To ensure that the sale of dutiable goods

in  duty-free shops is made to bona fide  tourists,

"tourist"  is defined to mean any person, including

persons  in transit, whose entry into Singapore  is

dependent  upon the presentation of a  passport  or

other  travel document, and whose stay in Singapore

does not exceed six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for customs and

excise  duties  to be levied on any goods  imported

into  the  "customs  territory"  which  refers   to

Singapore and her territorial waters, but  excludes

any  free  trade zone. The present section  11  (1)

will  thus  be superseded as it would be inadequate

when  free  trade zones co-exist with the  "customs

territory".  Free trade zones, of course,  will  be

areas  declared  for that purpose  under  the  Free

Trade Zone Bill, which accompanies this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 22 of the principal

Ordinance  to  put beyond doubt the time  at  which

customs  controls  may be imposed  on  imported  or

exported goods. Controls may be imposed at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



time goods enter or leave the "customs territory'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To direct control of all dutiable goods, clause 7

of  this  Bill replaces section 45 of the principal

Ordinance  and  will  enable  the  Comptroller   of

Customs  to  require the landing  of  all  dutiable

goods,  or  mixed  cargoes  of  dutiable  and  non-dutiable  goods, in any free trade zone, designated

warehouse or customs premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 53 of the principal Ordinance is repealed

and  replaced  by clause 10 of this Bill  to  allow

dutiable goods for transhipment to be deposited  in

a  free  trade zone. This is necessary  to  protect

transhipment  trade and reduce  the  risk  of  such

dutiable   goods   being  smuggled   into   customs

territory for domestic consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 is designed to safeguard the tourist

trade  by providing for licensed duty-free  tourist

shops and to regulate their operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 provides for action against tourists

who  abuse the privilege of purchasing at duty-free

tourist shops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made in this Bill for the

establishment of a new kind of warehouse  known  as

"licensed    factory    warehouse"    to     enable

manufacturers  in  the customs territory,  wherever

permissible,  to store dutiable materials  used  in

the  manufacture of their products for the domestic

and  export markets, without payment of  duty,  but

subject to customs requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would first like to outline

the reasons why Singapore has become a signatory to

the  Asian Development Bank Agreement. Firstly,  by

joining the Asian Development Bank, Singapore  will

have an additional source of loans open to it.  The

Asian Development Bank has an authorised capital of

$1,000  million. Its paid-up capital will be US$100

million  in  the  first year of its operations  and

this  amount will rise up to US$500 million by  the

fifth  year. In addition to its share capital,  the

Bank  can  also  raise loans from  major  financial

markets  to  supplement  its  own  funds  for  loan

operations.  Also,  if approved  by  the  Board  of

Governors of the Bank, the Bank can participate  in

equity. This may turn out to be a useful source  of

funds  for  some  of Singapore's future  industrial

projects.  Secondly,  participation  in  the   Bank

associates Singapore with other Asian countries  in

the field of regional co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 31 signatories to the Asian Development

Bank  Agreement of which 19 are regional  countries

and 12 are non-regional countries. Subscriptions to

the  share capital of the Bank by various countries

are  in  accordance  with financial  resources  and

commitments  of  the  various countries  concerned.

Singapore's  subscription  to  the  Bank  is   US$5

million,  half of which will be paid in five  equal

annual  instalments of US$500,000 each.  Each  such

instalment  is  divided  equally  into  convertible

currency  and local currency. For each of the  five

years, therefore, Singapore will be required to pay

US$250,000  in convertible currency and  US$250,000

in local currency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable Singapore to ratify the Asian

Development  Bank Agreement, it is  necessary  that

appropriate    legislation   be    enacted.    Upon

ratification  of  the  Agreement,  Singapore   will

become one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



of  the  original members of the Asian  Development

Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation therefore authorises the

President   to  appoint  someone  to  deposit   the

Instrument  of  Ratification  with  the  Secretary-General of the United Nations. Clause 4 of the Bill

enables  the  Singapore Government to subscribe  to

the  original  authorised capital of the  Bank.  It

also  provides that should the Bank in future  find

it  necessary  to increase its original  authorised

capital,  Singapore  is able to  subscribe  towards

such  an  increase provided that such  subscription

does   not   exceed   US$5   million.   Singapore's

subscription to the Bank shall be charged,  in  the

first  instance,  to  the  Consolidated  Fund.  The

Government however may raise loans for the purposes

of  providing  any  sums required  for  making  any

payments to the Bank. Also, in lieu of payments  to

the  Bank  in local currencies, the Government  can

also  create  and  issue to the Bank  non-interest-bearing   and   non-negotiable   notes   or   other

obligations.  The  Bill also seeks  to  give  legal

effect  to  the provisions of Chapter VIII  of  the

Agreement  which provides for the granting  to  the

Bank and its officers and employees certain status,

exemptions  and  privileges. These  privileges  are

similar  to  those  granted to other  international

institutions,   for   example,  the   International

Monetary  Fund  and  the  International  Bank   for

Reconstruction  and Development of which  Singapore

is also a member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.14p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  the  Bill.  The reasons  outlined  by  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance

for  Singapore  to join the Asian Development  Bank

are  cogent enough. By becoming a member, Singapore

will  be  able  to take advantage of not  only  the

financial  facilities of the Bank, but  also  other

technical  facilities. Looking  through  the  Bill,

however,  I  see  that clause 9  (1)  provides  for

certain provisions of the Agreement of the Bank  to

have the force of law in Singapore. And turning  to

paragraph 2 of Article 56



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



as  published in the Schedule of the Bill, it would

appear that employees of the Bank, irrespective  of

their  status,  would  have facilities  offered  to

them,  amongst  which facilities is  the  exemption

from  income tax. Now, most countries in the  world

always reserve the right to themselves to tax their

own  nationals  and I see no reason  why  Singapore

should  be  an exception; that is, I see no  reason

why  Singapore should give up the right to tax  its

nationals simply because they are employees of  the

Bank.  I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary

to the Minister for Finance will give this House an

undertaking  that employees of the Bank,  at  least

the clerical staff, will not get exemption from the

tax laws of Singapore. Subject to that reservation,

Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> The hon. Member's suggestion not

to  exempt local employees of the Asian Development

Bank  from payment of income tax will be considered

by  the Government. We will find out what agreement

there  will be with regard to this point among  the

member  countries. There are implications which  we

have  to weigh in this matter. If we agree  to  the

Member's request straightaway, we may not get  good

local  technical officers to come here and help  us

in  our  projects. But the hon. Member has  earlier

stated  that he wants the clerical officers not  to

be  exempted from income tax. I can assure him that

the  clerical officers will have to pay income tax.

This  category of workers will definitely pay  tax,

but not the technical officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Minor Offences

Ordinance so as to provide that the letting off  of

fireworks  shall be restricted only when  an  Order

has  been  issued  by  the Deputy  Commissioner  of

Police to restrict such fireworks. The Order issued

by the Deputy Commissioner of Police may specify  a

period  or  place  in  which  the  letting  off  of

fireworks  may be restricted. The present provision

in  the  Ordinance  in  this respect  empowers  the

Deputy  Commissioner  of  Police  to  issue  Orders

authorising the letting off of fireworks during any

specific  periods  and within specified  areas  and

makes  it an offence to let off fireworks otherwise

than  in accordance with such Orders. The amendment

contained in clause 3 of the Bill will, in  effect,

mean that fireworks may be let off at any time  and

at  any  place except those specified in  an  Order

made by the Deputy Commissioner of Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has been taken to effect certain

amendments  to  the  Ordinance  which  have  become

necessary  in consequence of the present status  of

Singapore  and  the  administrative  set-up.  These

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Singapore was part of Malaysia and our High

Court was a Court of Malaysia, writs were issued in

the  name of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong as the  Head

of  State of Malaysia. Singapore ceased to be  part

of  Malaysia  on  the  9th  of  August,  1965.  But

unfortunately, a number of writs of our High  Court

were  still  issued in the name  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Agong instead of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

or,  after  the  21st  day of December,  1965,  the

President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courts have now decided that such writs are

null and void as they were issued in the name of  a

foreign  sovereign. In his judgment in the  Federal

Court, the Chief Justice of Singapore said,  and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the light of our decision in this appeal, it

may  not be out of place for me to express the hope

that consideration may elsewhere be given as to the

desirability  of  validating  all  writs  totalling

several  hundreds - so we have been  informed  from

the Bar - issued in the name of the Yang di-Pertuan

Agong  between the 9th August, 1965, and  the  date

when  the  Republic of Singapore Independence  Act,

1965, was published in the Government Gazette.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations were also received from the

Singapore  Bar Committee and a number of  advocates

and  solicitors as to the desirability of  enacting

validating  legislation in respect of  such  writs.

The  Government,  after full consideration  of  the

matter,  has  decided not to enact  any  validating

legislation in respect of the writs issued  in  the

name of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong after the 9th day

of  August,  1965.  However, it is  felt  that  the

persons who have issued such writs and whose causes

of  action have been barred by limitation should be

allowed  to  initiate proceedings anew.  The  Bill,

therefore,  provides  that such  causes  of  action

which would, but for this Act, have been barred  by

limitation be revived and kept alive for  a  period

of three months from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



the  date of the coming into operation of this  Act

when  enacted. The Singapore Bar Committee has been

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is designed to enable the President to

make arrangements with the Government of the United

Kingdom for appeals from the Federal Court or other

Appellate  Court in Singapore to be  heard  by  the

Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. A Bill  to

give  the  Judicial Committee power  to  hear  such

appeals has already been introduced into this House

and will be taken through today. This Bill seeks to

amend   the   Constitution  of  Malaysia   in   its

application to Singapore to enable arrangements  to

be  made with the United Kingdom Government to give

such jurisdiction to the Judicial Committee of  the

Privy  Council.  Complementary action  has  already

been  taken in the Parliament of the United Kingdom

which  has  passed the Singapore Act,  1966,  which

provides that, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Her Majesty may by Order-in-Council confer on

the  Judicial  Committee of the Privy Council  such

jurisdiction and powers in respect of  the  Federal

Court  of Malaysia acting on appeals from the  High

Court  of Singapore and in respect of appeals  from

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.37p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to enable appeals and

other  proceedings to be brought with leave to  the

Judicial Committee of the Privy Council without the

necessity of presenting a petition to the Queen, as

was   the  practice  prior  to  the  formation   of

Malaysia, or to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong,  as  was

the practice when Singapore was in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, the Bill constitutes the Judicial

Committee  of the Privy Council as the final  Court

of Appeal for Singapore. Appeals will only lie with

the   leave  either  of  the  Appellate  Court   in

Singapore  or  of the Privy Council.  Provision  is

made  for  the  enforcement of the  Orders  of  the

Judicial  Committee and for the payment  of  costs.

All pending appeals will be deemed to be appeals to

the Judicial Committee.

<div align="center"><b>LABOUR BY GOVERNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>6.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

about  two  years ago my colleague, the Member  for

Telok Blangah, drew the attention of this House  to

the  increasing tendency in the public  service  to

resort to contract labour in places where work  was

previously  done by directly recruited  labour.  He

dealt  at length with the views of the trade  union

movement on these practices and also touched on the

distinction  between  work of  a  recurring  nature

normally  done by direct employees and those  which

were  thought  to  be  more  efficiently  done   by

contract  schemes,  for example, building  projects

and  so  forth. He also drew the attention  of  the

Government  to the concern among workers  over  the

number    of    vacancies   in   the    daily-rated

establishment which remained unfilled  due  to  the

growth  of this practice of using contract  labour.

My  colleague,  the Member for Telok Blangah,  then

made it clear to the House that workers led by  the

N.T.U.C. could not condone this practice and  urged

Government  to  take positive steps to  remedy  the

situation.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>6.59 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, far from there being any improvement

in  this situation, what do we find? I am told that

this  tendency  is increasing day  by  day  in  all

directions.  I  hear that more  and  more  work  in

Government   departments,  which   was   previously

undertaken   by   directly  recruited   daily-rated

workers, is being farmed out to contractors. At one

time,  we found such work as grass-cutting only  in

the  hands  of contractors but today we notice  the

tendency  is  spreading to use contract  labour  so

that even minor road repairs and similar work of  a

recurring   nature   is   being   farmed   out   to

contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can almost anticipate, if the Minister for

Finance  is  here, he will come and  say  that  the

Government  use contract labour for the purpose  of

efficiency and also for economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



reasons.  And I also will expect him  to  say  that

most   daily-rated  workers,  if   not   all,   are

malingerers. He will add that there is  a  definite

attempt  to  reduce daily output and to  accumulate

work  over  the  week, in order that  work  may  be

obtained on a Sunday, when double pay is paid. I am

sure the question of triple pay will be highlighted

as  the evil of the daily-rated system, even though

very  few  people realise that there  are  only  11

public  holidays  in  a year in  which  daily-rated

workmen can enjoy such benefits, and then only when

the employer calls them up for work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a representative of a responsible trade

union movement, I do not for a moment wish to  deny

that, in a work force of ten thousand men, many  of

whom are probably earning a subsistence wage, there

are some malingerers. This is the inevitable result

the  world over if labour is underpaid. I will  not

deny  either that there may be instances of  output

being  below  expected standards.  However,  I  ask

Members  of this House to recognise that only  part

of  the blame can be laid at the door of labour.  I

suggest  that  the  problem is bound  up  with  the

question  of  supervision; and to the  extent  that

these  malpractices occur, I say  that  this  is  a

measure  of  the failure of management.  Given  the

right  supervision and the right management, I  can

see no reason why malingerers cannot be brought  to

book and restrictive practices removed with the co-operation of the workers and their trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point I wish to ask Members of this

House  to appreciate is that the large majority  of

daily-rated  workers  in  the  public  services  in

Singapore  are not engaged in work which is  easily

measurable  in  terms of output. For  example:  how

does  one  decide on the appropriate  output  of  a

cleansing labourer working in Tanglin area? On  the

other hand, how can one compare this with the  work

required  in one of the new housing estates,  where

one has to take into account not only the space  to

be  cleaned at ground level, but also the number of

floors  above, and the number of people who  reside

there, all of whom constantly contribute towards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



the  quantity of litter and refuse that has  to  be

removed? What in fact is the measure to be accepted

in  cases where large numbers of stationary hawkers

are   involved,  or  where  well-to-do  second-hand

dealers choose to dump their scrap metal and  other

refuse  on  the  roadside? I ask  the  experts  who

advise our Ministers to define and make public  the

norms  of  cleansing workers in the public  utility

services. Sir, I ask Members of this House to  bear

these  points  in  mind before  making  general  or

sweeping  statements  concerning  malingering   and

restrictive  practices in the public  services.  My

colleagues  from  the  trade  union  movement   are

convinced  that the simple solution suggested  from

time  to  time  by  Treasury  and  Health  Ministry

officials that contract labour should be used is no

real  answer.  We  are convinced that  this  is  an

enormously  complex  problem  for  management   and

labour  to  solve  together  and  one  which  calls

immediately   for  an  objective   study   of   the

supervisory  system of daily-rated  workers  and  a

search for fair and equitable remedies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already voiced my fear that some

Members  of  this House will suggest that  contract

labour  is the only answer and I would not  be  the

least  surprised if someone even went so far as  to

spell  out some of the glowing virtues of  contract

labour. Of late it has become so fashionable to say

such  things  that  hardly any day  passes  without

someone  extolling  the virtue of  contract  labour

without considering its real implications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not for a moment deny the fact that

contract labour is cheap in a short-sighted sort of

way.  I  admit  that  all over the  world  contract

labour  is cheaper to the employer only than direct

labour.  The final cost to the community,  however,

is  vastly different and vastly greater. What we in

the  trade  union  movement,  who  believe  in  the

dignity   of   human  labour,  consider  profoundly

objectionable in contract labour is the price which

workers  pay in such employment. The man who  bears

the evil of the system and is called upon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



to  subsidise the real costs is not the  contractor

but the labourer, who by force of circumstances  is

obliged to accept such an employment. To those  who

choose to observe the scene around them, I will ask

them  to recall for a moment those workmen and even

young girls who can be seen sweating from seven  in

the  morning to seven at night every day, in  spite

of  the existence of the Labour Ordinance. Whatever

others may say, it is well known that any complaint

over  long hours by such contract workers will mean

the  end  of even the casual work they now possess.

Notwithstanding    the    Workmen's    Compensation

Ordinance,  we see many such men and  women  taking

undue  risks without even the barest of safeguards.

When  they suffer illness, which they often do,  on

whom  do  they  depend? Of course,  the  Government

outdoor  clinic is available to them,  not  at  the

employer's  expense  but  at  the  Government's.  I

mention this simply to demonstrate that much of the

burden that Government shoulders in the case of its

own  direct  workers, is also borne as a  concealed

added  cost  by  society, when contract  labour  is

employed.  When  I  think of the  conditions  under

which contract labour toils - and look at the  many

modern  buildings, including our own multi-storeyed

houses,  in  which we regularly take pride,  I  say

they stand out really as monuments to the sweat and

toil of contract labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I stress is not merely a figment of my

imagination.  It is a fact. The evils  of  contract

labour  are recognised throughout the world and  no

less   a   body   than  the  International   Labour

Organisation, of which Singapore is a  member,  has

cried   aloud   against  its  evil  practices.   My

colleague,  the Minister for Labour,  who  recently

attended the I.L.O. General Assembly, must be aware

of   the   importance  that  is   placed   on   the

decasualisation   of  labour   by   the   civilised

countries  of  the world. Lest what is  decided  in

Geneva  be considered remote and inappropriate  for

our developing society, let us cite an endeavour in

our  very  midst,  to  show  that  we  are  equally

concerned in such matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask Members of this House to recall the

Commission  of Inquiry into contract  labour  which

this  Government set up soon after it came to power

in  1959.  The  Commission vigorously  decried  the

evils   of   contract  labour  in   Singapore   and

specifically   drew  attention  to  the   following

features emphasising:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the irregularity of employment;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the insecurity of payment of wages and often

underpayment   in  relation  to   established

industrial wage pattern;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the evasion of benefits under the Labour

Ordinance;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the absence of hospital benefits;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the evasion of Provident Fund contributions; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) the inadequate provision of safeguards

against accidents and hazards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding this

indictment, there appears to be a growing  tendency

in  our  Government departments to utilise contract

labour.  I  would cite as examples the Ministry  of

Law  and  National Development. Very  unfortunately

the  present  Minister is not  the  person  who  is

responsible for that, but nevertheless  it  is  now

his portfolio. So he has got to carry the baby.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.W.D. Workshop Section - repairs of rubbish

pails, cleansing carts, welding of nightsoil pails,

buckets, refuse bins and repairs of tools  used  by

daily-rated workmen - all this work which has  been

normally  done  by the daily-rated workers  is  now

being farmed out to the contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance is the Marine Workshop, such as

the  building  of seawalls, buoys and signal  light

posts  in the sea. In the rural sector, the cutting

of   grass.  All  this  has  been  given   to   the

contractors.  Sir, there are so  many  examples  of

Government  using contract labour  to  replace  the

regular work force, but I do not like to go on  and

on.  But  I  would  ask the Minister  for  Law  and

National   Development   to   study   the   present

situation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



which is a grave injustice not only to the existing

organised  workers but also to those who are  being

exploited by the contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have felt myself compelled today, Sir, to make

these  comments because my colleagues and I in  the

N.T.U.C. have observed a disquieting and increasing

tendency  on  the  part  of some  Members  of  this

Government  to  suggest that the  solution  to  our

problems  today  here in Singapore  is  to  discard

those ideals in which we have believed for so  long

because of the compulsions of our new situation. We

find  ourselves  the  more  puzzled  because  these

utterances  in  support of contract labour  are  so

completely at variance with the precepts and ideals

as  we know them of the Prime Minister. I refer  to

his recommendations in the case of the 9,000 daily-rated  workers in the Port of Singapore  Authority,

where  for  many  years  the workers  struggled  to

remove the contract labour system and its attendant

malpractices.  Members of this  House  will  recall

that following the decasualisation of labour in the

Port of Singapore Authority, there continued to  be

serious allegations of malingering, accumulation of

work,  and improper overtime practices. There  were

also  allegations  of  other types  of  restrictive

practices.  One  would  have  expected   that   the

Government  would be tempted to return to  contract

labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying that the trade union is

jealous of the Port of Singapore Authority workers.

They  have  removed  the malpractices  of  contract

labour and they still have malpractices of overtime

and  all  that.  I am not asking the Government  to

introduce,  but  I am only quoting as  an  example,

because  I  am  afraid  that the  newspapers  might

misquote  me  tomorrow and say that the  Secretary-General  of the N.T.U.C. also prefers to  introduce

contract   labour  into  the  Port   of   Singapore

Authority.  The hours of work of the  workmen  were

streamlined. They introduced a shift system with an

element  of  shift allowances. They also introduced

improved  incentive  bonuses  in  order  to  ensure

faster  working  of  cargoes.  These  are  improved

measures to replace malingering and so on, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  are  not doing  in  their  various

departments. To crown it all, bonuses were paid  on

the  instructions  of  the  Prime  Minister  on  an

instalment  basis. Today users of the  Port  praise

its efficiency. Surely, Sir, it is difficult for us

who  belong to the trade union movement to  believe

after this glowing example in the Port of Singapore

Authority  that  the Minister for  Finance  and  my

other colleagues sincerely mean what they say  when

they speak of contract labour. What happened in the

Port Authority was, in fact, an objective appraisal

of  the  problem and an objective solution,  worked

out  in conjunction with the National Trades  Union

Congress   representing  the  workers.  From   this

example, Sir, the workers of Singapore cannot,  for

a  moment,  believe  that the suggestions  now  put

forward  and being implemented in the case  of  the

public  daily-rated employees are anything  but  an

intellectual aberration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of a Government dedicated to the

realisation  of  a more just and equal  society,  I

call  upon  my colleagues to discontinue advocating

this  practice  of contract labour - unfortunately,

the   Minister  for  Finance  is  not  here  -  and

recognise clearly the problem affecting the  daily-rated  workers  in  Singapore which  is  simply  to

secure a living wage for a proper day's work. I ask

them  that,  just  as  in  the  case  of  the  Port

Authority,  they  demonstrate  their  sincerity  by

entering   into  discussions  with   the   N.T.U.C.

immediately to find equitable and lasting solutions

to our current problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to consider with open minds an

entirely new system if this is finally shown to  us

to  be  necessary for the long-term  viability  and

survival of Singapore as a nation. Organised labour

has   no   fear  of  incentives;  it   only   fears

exploitation.  We ask that the ambiguities  of  the

present  situation be removed by a clear  statement

of  purpose  and  policy by the Government  on  its

part. We, on our part, state categorically that our

purpose  and  policy is simply to  secure  for  all

workers  in Singapore conditions of labour which  a

man can accept with dignity, and a sufficient wage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



in  exchange for a fair week's work, to support him

and   his   family   in   modest   but   reasonable

circumstances.



<br><br>7.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bras

Basah  has referred to a speech made by the  Member

for Telok Blangah in this House two years ago about

the  evils of contract labour. I thought then  that

my   predecessor  in  the  Ministry   of   National

Development,  who is now the Minister for  Finance,

had  satisfactorily replied to the Member for Telok

Blangah. However, though the Member for Bras  Basah

puts  most of the blame on my predecessor,  at  the

same  time,  he  says  that  I  am  not  completely

blameless.  But  he has spoken  well  of  the  Port

Authority and perhaps he has forgotten that I  have

been  in charge of the Port Authority from the  1st

of  November, 1964. I remember that from the moment

I  was  in  charge, we had to introduce a temporary

system  of contract labour in the Port, and it  was

for  good reason too. The reason was this.  In  the

Port  we  had, and we still have, peak periods.  We

have  a normal labour force which can look after  a

certain number of ships coming in every month,  but

the  number of ships coming into Singapore  is  not

the  same every month. There are peak periods  when

more ships come in and the normal number of workmen

cannot satisfactorily unload all the goods from the

ships. That was the reason why contract labour  was

taken  on as a temporary measure. But the immediate

result  of bringing in contract labour was that  we

met with protests from the union. At the same time,

the efficiency of the workers of the new union went

up.  However, we settled that matter satisfactorily

when we agreed to stop using contract labour within

three  months. We looked for a device  and  it  was

this.  We formed a temporary labour pool consisting

of  about  600 or 700 labourers who reported  every

day.  If  they had no work, they would  be  paid  a

dollar a day, and if there was work for them,  they

would  be paid the regular wage. At the moment,  we

have  a  casual labour pool of about  700  workmen.

They   are   temporary,  but  whenever  there   are

vacancies in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



permanent  establishment, these temporary labourers

become  permanent. But this temporary  labour  pool

meets the situation during peak periods. There,  we

had  a  good excuse to use contract labour and,  at

the  same time, we found a method or device whereby

we got rid of contract labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah says that there has

been no improvement for over two years. Now perhaps

I  should  tell him why contract labour has  to  be

used  sometimes, though, as a general  policy,  the

Government  is  against it. At  the  same  time,  I

should point out to him the advantages sometimes of

contract  labour.  Sometimes existing  departmental

labour  and  resources are unable  to  tackle  some

maintenance  work  efficiently  and  speedily   due

either  to the size of the work or to the need  for

specialised   skills   ----   for   instance,   the

maintenance  of  intricate and expensive  equipment

like  pumps in sewerage pumping stations and sewage

disposal    plants,   renovation   of    Government

buildings, major face-lifting, etc. One outstanding

example  is the case of repairs to Anderson  Bridge

where  welding  work  had to  be  done  by  skilled

contract  labour as the departmental labour  lacked

such  skill.  Experience  has  shown  that  it   is

sometimes more economical, efficient and speedy  to

employ  contract  labour. Departmental  work  costs

more because of fixed hours of work and often over-time  allowances must be paid for work  done  after

normal   hours   or   on   public   holidays,   and

departmental transport must be provided. Again, the

rate of absenteeism among departmental employees is

quite  high  and,  in  some  cases,  has  adversely

affected  work  at the site. For example,  where  a

plant  operator  or a driver is absent,  then  that

particular plant will be left idle, unless there is

a standby operator easily available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should cite to the House just one

example,  comparing the costs for work carried  out

by   departmental  labour  with  contract   labour.

Members  of  the  House must  know  very  well  the

bungalows  "Brighton"  and "Hove"  at  Changi.  The

repairs  of the seawall carried out by departmental

labour consisted of plastering the seawall 150 feet

long by 6 feet high and the breakdown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



of  the  costs  was  as  follows:  wages,  $685.80;

cement, $81; sand, $15; and transport, $50 -  total

cost $831.80. This worked Out at an average cost of

$5.56  per  foot  run.  This  was  carried  out  by

departmental labour. The repairs of the seawall  at

Tanjong  Kling Police Station were carried  out  by

contract  labour. The repair work was  similar  and

the  wall  was  of  the same height.  The  cost  of

plastering  520  feet long of seawall  was  $2,340,

which  worked out at an average of $4.50  per  foot

run,  which is about $1 less per foot run and about

20  per  cent  less  than  the  foot  run  done  by

departmental labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has referred to grass

cutting   by  the  Public  Works  Department.   The

position here is that prior to 1960 the P.W.D. was

responsible  for grass cutting in the  rural  areas

and  employed departmental labour, whereas the City

Council  was  responsible for grass cutting  within

the  City and the City Council farmed out the  work

to  contractors. This means that for  most  of  the

time  P.W.D. labourers will be  riding  on  P.W.D.

lorries  going  from one place to  another  cutting

grass  in  various  parts of  the  rural  areas  in

Singapore. It is not difficult to imagine that most

of  the  time departmental labour will be spent  in

assembling,  mustering, and transporting  labourers

from  the  mustering points to where the grass  is,

working  for  a  short period, and then  collecting

them   again  to  transport  them  back  to   their

quarters. Is it little wonder, Sir, that  the  cost

of  grass  cutting by departmental  labour  on  the

average  works  out  at $25 per  acre,  whereas  by

contract the cost is less than $16 per acre?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has also referred to

seawalls  and  signal light posts in the  area.  In

this   connection,  minor  works   connected   with

repairs, maintenance and repainting of these  items

are  done by departmental labour. Only major  works

of  construction or major repairs are given out  to

contractors. In 1964, however, buoys, signal  posts

and  beacons  were taken over by  the  Director  of

Marine,  and  departmental labour  in  the  P.W.D.,

which should have gone over to the Marine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



Department,  would have been employed  to  continue

maintenance  and  minor repairs  work.  The  P.W.D.

daily-rated   labour,  however,   refused   to   be

transferred to the Marine Department,  and  all  of

them are being retained in the Marine Branch of the

P.W.D.  It  is  true that in most of  these  marine

repair  works, the time when such work  has  to  be

done  will be dictated by the tide. Now, our daily-rated  labourers work fixed hours and none of  them

will  wait for the time or the tide. The Union,  in

fact, has refused to accept the P.W.D.'s suggestion

that  working hours will be amended or  revised  to

suit  the  conditions of the tide. Hence,  contract

labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has also referred to

carts  for  rubbish and nightsoil bins  as  coming

under  the  P.W.D. I am afraid this does  not  come

under  my jurisdiction. It comes under that of  the

Minister  for Health who, I believe, is waiting  to

say something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has quoted from the

Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the System

of  Contract Labour in Singapore. This was a report

which  came out in 1960. It did point out the evils

of  contract labour as has been recited by the hon.

Member,  but  it  also spoke of the  advantages  of

contract labour, and I quote paragraph 50  at  page

13:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The system of contractor labour appears to have

certain advantages:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) division of labour;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) decentralisation of functions;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) control of cost.'.



<br><br>It goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These advantages may be more general with

technical   labour,   technical   contractors   and

specialised  principals, than  in  the  case  where

unskilled and semi-skilled manual labour is in use.

It  is true, in fact, that elsewhere, overseas  for

instance,  there  are segments of  labour  employed

under   a   contractor  system.  They  are   always

technical  segments  highly organised  associations

and/or  trade unions, highly paid, and  covered  by

thoroughly    policed   and   very   wide    labour

legislation. This is the case for instance  in  the

United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



In  none  of these countries, however, is unskilled

labour  employed under a contractor system  in  any

way similar to that in operation in Singapore.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this Report did not say that all contract

labour   should   be   got   rid   of.   It    made

recommendations for the removal of contract  labour

in certain trades, but not in all. For instance, at

page 73:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Commission arrived at the conclusion that in

neither the building and construction industry, nor

in  the  electrical  and plumbing  trades,  was  it

possible to suggest changes from contractor  labour

system  to  direct labour employment. We  were  all

agreed, however, that a number of safeguards  could

be  introduced to bring the terms of employment  of

this  segment  of  labour in  line  with  those  of

directly employed personnel.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind this House, Sir, that some of the

Members  of this Commission were people  like  Fong

Swee Suan and Woodhull - purported champions of the

labour  class. But even they did not say, "Get  rid

of all contract labour," but only in some trades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I end up, Sir, by saying that we as a

Government  would like, if it is possible,  to  get

rid of all contract labour. We realise the evils of

the  system as pointed out by the Member  for  Bras

Basah, but sometimes it is not possible to do  away

with  contract  labour. In the Port  Authority,  an

example  which  I have mentioned, we discussed  the

matter  and  managed to find a solution  which  was

acceptable to the Union. As a result, I am glad  to

say  that even the Member for Bras Basah has agreed

that the Port is working efficiently, and that  the

workers  are  happy with the bonus system  and  the

shift system. If the National Trades Union Congress

has any suggestions whereby contract labour can  be

replaced  by  permanent  labour  in  any   of   the

Departments that come under my jurisdiction, I  can

assure  him that I will give his suggestions  every

consideration. But we may come up against obstacles

like  the tide, for instance. It is no use  saying,

"Get departmental labour." We will get departmental

labour  provided the particular labourer is willing

to  work  at  12  midnight. So on that  basis,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I think I should end now and give  my

colleague,  the Minister for Health, a little  time

to say what he wants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Bras

Basah made passing mention of the fact that in  the

Health  Ministry  refuse handcarts  and  night-soil

pails are being farmed out to contractors. I hope I

have got him right there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> This unfortunately is a very

general statement and is a little out of date if it

is  a  statement of fact, unless he is able to give

specific  examples.  I  understand  there   was   a

contract not within the last two years but as  long

ago  as  1959 - seven years ago, and rather out  of

date I should say -and the contract was let out for

3,000  nightsoil pails at the rate of  $3.57  each;

and  that ever since 1960 such work has been  dealt

with  through  departmental labour. I  would  like,

first  of  all, to say that I regret that the  hon.

Member  for Bras Basah has made a general statement

which  is not true. And if it is true, that  it  is

seven  years  behind  time. [Interruption]  I  look

forward  to  that, Sir, when I am in a position  to

answer  specific complaints. But if it is a general

statement, I am afraid I am just being drawn into a

discussion on other topics. Sir, I welcome the hon.

Member putting forward specific complaints to which

I will then give him my answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, unfortunately, in his long speech, he

brought  in  topics like, "How is  it  possible  to

assess  the output of a cleansing worker,  say,  in

Tanglin, as compared with a cleansing worker  in  a

new  housing  estate  or at hawker  congregations?"

Sir,  I have indicated earlier on that part of  the

plan  for  reorganisation of the  public  cleansing

service  will  be to start a new system  whereby  a

refuse vehicle will have a work force of, say, four

workers  including the driver, who  will  be  given

what is called a norm. Naturally the norm will be a

little  different in a congested area from  a  norm

for  a  residential area, and a norm  for  a  rural

area. That will have to be determined. It will  not

be  infallible.  And there will, therefore,  be  an

allotted beat, shall we say, allocated to a team of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



workers  plus  the vehicle with a  daily  quota  of

dustbins to be collected. It may be 1,000,  it  may

be 1,500, or it may just be 500. And I have already

indicated  that  we  will  not  insist  that   this

particular task force work from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. If

they  are  efficient enough and be able to complete

their  duties  by 12 o'clock - one  hour  ahead  of

knocking-off  time - we are going to  start  a  new

precedent and say that they can check out  and  not

try  to  linger and dilly-dally, park their  refuse

vehicles  under a shade and spend a long time  over

coffee,  or park their refuse vehicles in front  of

junk shops and bargain over how much they could get

for  old  bottles and old tins. What  we  want  our

cleansing   workers  to  do  is  to  be  reasonably

efficient  and productive and to do their  allotted

share  of  work,  clear and dump the  rubbish,  and

clean  up and go home. What they do after  that  is

their  business. That is why we want  to  introduce

not  just one shift duty but two shift duties. They

know  exactly what they are supposed to do. If they

have  done  their job, off they go. They get  their

pay  and off they go. And it will be possible  then

to pin responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the hon. Member for Bras Basah that

lack  of supervision has been responsible for  what

has  gone  wrong.  That is why, in  winding  up  my

rather  long  reply to the hon.  Member  for  Anson

today over the public cleansing service, I shall be

inviting  officials not only of the  Public  Daily-Rated  Cleansing  Workers'  Union  but  also   that

section  of A.U.P.E., the monthly-rated supervisory

staff,  for  a discussion on this matter.  I  think

they  are both jointly responsible for an efficient

service.  So I shall be cracking the whip not  only

at the daily-rated workers but also at the monthly-rated  to do their share of work and try to produce

something  that  is  more like a  public  cleansing

service for a city of ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to hear, too in the very early

part  of  the  speech by the hon. Member  for  Bras

Basah, who is the Secretary-General of our National

Trades  Union  Congress, on the subject  of  Sunday

work  and public holiday work at the rate of  twice

normal  day  pay  and three times  normal  day  pay

respectively



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



that  this  is  at the request of employers.  Hear,

hear!  That  is what I like to hear: that  work  on

Sundays and public holidays would be at the request

of  employers,  and that is exactly  what  we  have

decided in this re-organisation that this should be

so. If the Public Cleansing Department requires the

cleansing  workers to turn up for work  on  Sundays

and  on  public  holidays - and may I  repeat  that

there  are 52 Sundays and 11 public holidays  in  a

year, making a total of 63 days - because it wishes

certain  work  to  be  done on Sundays  and  public

holidays, and it says, "Yes, we want 300 workers or

500  workers," then it will pay this overtime.  But

not where the whole force turn up on the 52 Sundays

and  the  11 public holidays and clear less  refuse

than  they  do under normal working conditions  and

absent  themselves on Mondays and on days following

public  holidays. This is ridiculous. So I am  very

pleased -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, are you prepared to

give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Overtime is not compulsory. He

need not have to elaborate on overtime.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am very pleased to have

given way, Sir, because that is exactly what I

want to hear from trade unionists, that overtime

is not compulsory. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am happy to hear that

confirmation,  Sir. So let us  not  therefore  get

ourselves  all worked up over the fact that  there

will be no Sunday work nor public holiday work  as

from  1st  October, 1966, unless we want  them  to

turn  up.  Therefore, we do hope that the National

Trades  Union Congress will exert their  influence

in  this  respect,  and that  in  the  discussions

which  I  shall  have with the  officials  of  the

Public  Daily-Rated Cleansing Workers'  Union  and

A.U.P.E.,   they  will  be  able  to   give   them

responsible  advice,  that  the  scheme   of   re-organisation which the Ministry of Health  has  in

mind   can  have  their  full  support   and   co-operation,  and  that we can  look  forward  to  a

reasonably   more   efficient   public   cleansing

service  in  Singapore than has been  possible  in

the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>Second Language in Secondary Schools</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Education in how many secondary schools are  second

language  classes conducted, and how many  students

are taking up a second language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Second languages are being

taught  to  students in all the 114 Government  and

Government-aided   secondary   schools,   including

technical  and  vocational  secondary  schools  and

secondary departments of full schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether, out of a total of 132,722 secondary

school students, 112,997 students, or 85.1 per cent

of  the  secondary enrolment, are  being  taught  a

second language in secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure includes 32,591 Secondary 1 students

for whom a second language is compulsory this year.

A  second language is being made compulsory in  the

secondary schools by stages, so that by 1969  every

secondary  student will have to sit  for  a  second

language in the School Certificate examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>Vocational Schools</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Education what is the number of Vocational Schools;

what  type  of  education  is  provided,  and  what

opportunities  are  open  for  further   vocational

education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> There are 11 Secondary

Vocational  Schools  which  provide  two  years  of

secondary education comprising 50 per cent  general

subjects  and  50 per cent practical subjects  like

woodwork, metalwork, domestic science and  art  and

crafts.   The   education  and  training   at   the

Vocational  School  would  provide  pupils  with  a

suitable  background  for the  type  of  employment

where basic vocational skill and knowledge would be

an  advantage.  At the end of the two-year  course,

students  sit  for the Secondary Vocational  School

Certificate  examination conducted by the  Ministry

of  Education.  Those  with  good  passes  in  this

examination  are given preference for admission  to

the  Singapore Vocational Institute which  provides

training  for  entry into industry in  the  skilled

trades.  The  courses available  at  the  Institute

include  Electrical Fitting, Mechanical Engineering

Practice, Motor Vehicle Mechanics, Plumbing,  Radio

Servicing,   Refrigeration  and   Air-Conditioning,

Tinsmithing,  Reinforced  Concrete  and  Brickwork,

Welding  and Shipbuilding. This year, 195  students

with  the  Secondary Vocational School  Certificate

were   enrolled  for  full-time  courses   at   the

Singapore Vocational Institute.
