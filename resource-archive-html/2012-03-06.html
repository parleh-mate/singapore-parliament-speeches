Mr Chairman, Sir, defence lies at the heart of a nation's security
and confidence. National Service has played that similar role, bonding our
nation. The reality of the current geo-political landscape is one
of constant flux. Economics and defence have through history remained
the carrot and stick, at the disposal of governments to ensure that
any nation is taken seriously on the international stage. For Singapore,
our journey to independence was one fraught with the whims of the
political powers of the times. From our time as a little inhabited
island to the early days of our independence, our defence laid not
in our hands but that of others.</p>

Kranji War Memorial on the eve of the 70th Anniversary of the Fall of
Singapore. Amidst the stillness of the grounds, the words "they
died for all free men" stood in recognition of the 24,000 who gave
their lives in Malaya. As I drove past the civilian War Memorial
the day after, I was reminded that over 50,000 victims buried there were
lost to the scourge of war, all because they were simply present
on this island we now call home.</p>

the British military in 1971, Singapore took the significant step to
take defence into our own hands with the introduction of National
Service. The formation of a conscript army is never easy. The late
Dr Goh Keng Swee underpinned the challenge by quoting Prof Dennis
N Wright that it was more difficult to understand 2 million Singaporeans
than 100 million Japanese. The reason was simple: Japanese are homogeneous,
Singaporeans are not. To a Minister for Defence in Singapore, this
is a sombre matter.</p>

book called "Youth in the Army" by Major Leong Choon Cheong, the
then chief psychologist at SAF, written in 1978, the introduction
to National Service was written in these words: "Every year in Singapore,
thousands trudge to military camps scattered across the island.
Most have prepared for this. News has gone out that army life is
tough, so it is fun before the ultimate surrender to drill and discipline."
Forty-five years on, National Service has evolved considerably.
Yet the camaraderie has remained the experience still invaluable.</p>

the Ministry to consider marking the significance of National Service
(NS) in our nation's history. This should be both at the institutional
level so that younger Singaporeans are re-acquainted with the importance
of NS, and at the individual level so that the contributions of
generations of NSmen are recognised beyond the National Service
Recognition Award. Each NSman has played a crucial role and should
be recognised as such. A greater distinction should also be made,
especially in contrasting those who have served and to remove the
perception that there are newcomers who have benefited from our
system but have not taken time to serve.</p>

Mr Chairman, full-time National Service (NS) was introduced in Singapore
in March 1967. This month marks the 45th Anniversary of NS. When
Singapore attained independence in 1965, we urgently needed to build
up our own defence capability. However, we could not afford a large
army of professional soldiers. Conscription was seen as the best
way to build up a credible defence force without placing a heavy
burden on Singapore's manpower and financial resources. Are these
considerations for NS 45 years ago and now still the same? Can MINDEF
explain the consideration behind maintaining NS? How has MINDEF
continued to strengthen NS as an institution?</p>

one of the longest mandatory military service period for males at
30 months prior to 2005. That was reduced to 24 months due to technological advances
and improved training. But at 24 months, we are still having one
of the longest compulsory military service in the world. In Finland,
it is six to 12 months; in Russia, it is 12 months; in Turkey, it
is six to 15 months and in Iran, it is 16 to 20 months. Korea is the
closest to us – at 22 months. Like other countries like Turkey,
men can choose to defer NS for various reasons, including education.
In Korea, they can choose to defer all the way up to age 30. Many
are asking if the duration can be shortened further and if disruption
can be made more flexible in view of the changing tertiary education landscape
locally and as more students choose to pursue their education overseas.</p>

Sir, the security and defence of Singapore is not to be taken for
granted. Citizens should play an active role through National Service.
I wish to raise two points in this regard which deserve our due consideration.
The first relates to various proposals for National Service to be
shortened from the current two years to one year or so. In its place,
the professional armed forces can be further built up by boosting
the incentives for young men and women to join as regulars. Taiwan
has announced that it will cut the length of its military conscription from
one year to just four months next year. South Korea has set it to
be 21 months. Singapore is the country with the second longest fixed
conscription length in the world, just behind Israel. I am sure
this House will agree that South Korea and Taiwan are not in any
less need of strong armed forces than Singapore. If anything, their
armed forces have been called up for actual combat action in the
past two decades. My main reason for advocating the shortening of
NS is this: since the Government has welcomed such a number of foreigners
into our workforce in the past decade, Singapore may urgently need
to close the gap as to when they start their working lives.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c18298af-c4ed-4cff-a46d-0545ac230465">
                  <a name="budget__id-c18298af-c4ed-4cff-a46d-0545ac230465"><!--a--></a>This relates to my second
point which is that some employers prefer to hire foreigners over
Singaporeans because Singaporean males are liable for reservist training.
Understandably, the employer is left in the lurch when the employee
cannot show up for work particularly when the job in question is
labour-intensive. If the resentment
among Singaporeans affected is left unchecked, the result would
be the complete opposite of what the Government had set out to achieve
with NS, namely, to inculcate a commitment to Singapore's defence
and security. How does the Government plan to address this?</p>

Mr Chairman, the National Sports scene in Singapore has come a long
way. Back in the 1950s when local athletes started representing
us in international and regional games, the numbers were few. Many
of them were juggling a full-time job and their sport. Due to the
lack of support from the Government, talents like Olympic weightlifter,
Mr Tan Howe Liang, had to finance his training. There was no monetary
reward for his Olympic feat.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-42367f8a-f115-4865-a8b8-2d331bf3f1d5">
                  <a name="budget__id-42367f8a-f115-4865-a8b8-2d331bf3f1d5"><!--a--></a>Today, the landscape has
changed. Top coaches are hired to nurture Team Singapore with the
help of carefully planned training programmes, overseas enrichment
stints, amongst others, expenses covered by the various grants and
sponsorships. Clearly, the importance and acceptance of professional
sport has shifted dramatically. </p>

brilliant schemes that helped to unearth new talents and hone the
abilities and achievements of Team Singapore. But we can do more
to give young male athletes the opportunity when it presents itself.
One hurdle they now face is to get deferment from National Service.
To many athletes, taking two-year breaks is detrimental to an athlete's
career, especially when he is in his teens and at the upward climb
of his performance. Two years of National Service is a very long
break for just about anyone. </p>

of our 16-year-old swimming prodigy Joseph Schooling are worrying
about the impact of National Service on their son's Olympic dream.
A recent <em class="ph i">Sunday Times</em> report entitled "Joseph's a bit special,
can we help him to be even more?" accurately sums up the problems
of the inflexible stance towards National Service deferment. Joseph
is so talented that national swim teams like the US, Australia and
Malaysia are believed to be interested in poaching him. American
colleges are also inviting him to join them. Should he decide to
further his swimming career in other countries, Singapore will not
only lose an excellent opportunity for an Olympic medal, but also
a very talented young athlete. It will be a short-sighted policy
on promoting sports. Certainly, the security of our nation transcends
any number of Olympic medals, and everyone has a role to play in
national defence, but there can be more flexible ways to achieve
this.</p>

of the proposals I brought up at last year's Committee of Supply.
National athletes should be allowed to defer their NS as long as
they are below 30 years old, just like in Korea. If they achieve
a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games or Asian Games, or a medal
of any colour in the Olympics, they can be exempted from NS in gratitude
for the honour they have bestowed on the country. Perhaps, just require
them to do basic military training. Athletes who did not do so well
will serve NS after their prime performance period or major games,
thus ensuring that nobody escapes their rightful duty without having
their opportunities denied. If they get a deferment, they still
do NS but later. This means they will be discharged later also to
go to university and to seek jobs.</p>

Singapore are like diamonds; coming along only once in a while,
fading and disappearing if we do not treasure them. Let us do the
wise thing and bring our National Sports scene to even greater heights.
Currently, America has "Linsanity". Singapore will have "Josanity",
or even more, if we tweak the National Service policy now for all
our deserving elite athletes.</p>

Thank you, Mr Chairman. I understand that MINDEF is reviewing the
NS leave system for athletes and more specifically the SAF sportsman scheme.
It is noteworthy that when the National Football team recently lost
7-1 to Iraq, Harris Harun, Safuwan Baharudin, Shakir Hamzah and
winger Yasir Hanapi were all ruled out because of National Service
commitments. I understand that MINDEF already grants deferments
on a case-by-case basis, with some athletes delaying enlistment
to prepare and compete in major competitions. What are the weaknesses
of the current system and how different is MINDEF's proposed holistic
framework of NS deferment for athletes that is currently underway?
In addition, what competitions will come under the purview of the
new framework and is the Malaysian Super League included in the proposed
list?</p>

phrase that has become commonplace in Singapore since the Government
opened the door to new immigrants. It is short and provocative but
very damaging to the institution of National Service and it has
the potential to compromise, if it has not already, the commitment
generations of Singaporeans have devoted to National Service. It
goes like this: "NS for Singaporeans; jobs for foreigners". The
phrase is quite commonplace in the subconscious of many NSmen I
have spoken with. I am sure Members have come across such remarks,
particularly online. In view of the Government's stated need for
immigrants to support our elderly population and to make up for
our poor Total Fertility Rate, will MINDEF consider introducing
some variation of National Service for new immigrants? This could
take the form of a shorter NS programme or even island defence or
protection of key installation duties, followed by an NS cycle that
will ramp up their military skills in other areas. Such a policy
may have the potential of not only ensuring new immigrants pull
their weight insofar as National Service is concerned, but also
serve the dual purpose of ensuring the quicker integration of our
new immigrants into Singapore society.</p>

the deployment of new immigrants who enlist into National Service
against the large numbers of long-resident Malay servicemen who
appear to be demographically over-represented in the Singapore Civil
Defence Force and the Singapore Police Force. Security reasons have
long been alluded to as the reason why some MINDEF positions remain

Mr Chairman, Sir, this year marks the 45th Anniversary of National
Service, an important milestone in the history of our nation-building.
We will be remiss in our responsibilities if we do not take stock
of this historic moment about the sacrifice and contributions of
the many generations of young men. The SAF owes much of its success
to the conscript of young men from the age of 18 and regular reservists
called up throughout their adult lives. However, our modern lifestyle has
meant that our servicemen are sacrificing a meaningful part of their
early adulthood, often finding themselves two years late to the
party when they compete in universities or on the job market globally,
and often more sacrifices when they have to take time out from the
professional and family commitments during reservist training. In
view of the contributions and efforts of our NSmen, how can MINDEF
better recognise this publicly?</p>

the issue from a national security perspective and not from a racial

can stir up emotions if it is not handled properly. In fact, misunderstanding
and baseless accusations can bring about unhappiness. The fact is
that the SAF has an increasingly open door policy for the past few
years, and there are more Malays holding important posts, even though
there might be some concern following 9/11, the Jemaah Islamiyah
issue and the cases of National Servicemen who became radical.</p>

Much obliged, Mr Chairman. Thank you, Minister, too. Mr Chairman,
I will deal with the SAF cut first. Mr Chairman, our younger generations today
are by and large more highly educated and IT-savvy. They also tend
to be regular users of smart phones with various mesmerising applications. </p>

our NSmen carrying an iPad, instead of a gun during training. It
is very hard to wean our youth from his heavy reliance on a smart
device that he has regarded as very essential to him.</p>

the SAF, such devices are not allowed to be carried during training.
Has this caused the new NS recruits any hangovers? How has it affected
the level and speed with which these NSmen perform their tasks?
How much of the training of a soldier can be done through computer
teaching and the Internet to turn them into an advanced fighting
force? How are they integrated into the fighting system? How realistic
can the training be because real wartime situations will be very
difficult to simulate and incomprehensible to the younger generations
who have only experienced peace, not war?</p>

more complex. As we rely on the SAF to defend Singapore and Singaporeans'
interests, we need to know if the SAF is up to its mark to know
what they may probably face in the real conflict situations, if
they have the appropriate strategies to counter their enemies and
if they believe that they are competent and skilful on the world
stage. This is because we are seeing more visits from high-ranking
military officers comprising Defence Ministers and other dignitaries
who are interested to know the security situation in the region
and internationally as well. Singapore's hosting of the annual Shangri-La
Dialogue, already into its 11th year this year means that the interaction
cannot be confined to just the Ministers for Defence alone but also
the Chiefs of Armed Forces, Army, Navy and the Air Force and the
Chiefs of Staff. SAF personnel have also regularly participated
in bilateral exercises and multinational air, sea and land combat
exercises conducted overseas.</p>

us an idea of the types of professional development that are being
taught, the duration and intensity of these courses, and if these
are on co-payment basis? If there is no co-payment, is there a period
of bonding and, if so, for how long? Could we also know specifically
which category of personnel such programmes are offered to, what
are the take-up rate and the success rate? Is there a difference
between "professional development" and "continuing education schemes"?
Can we have a glimpse of the contents in the continuing education
schemes that would enhance the competence of our SAF personnel?
Are these schemes tailored to only SAF-related environment because,
otherwise, they would be of no use when these SAF personnel leave
service and join the private sector? Mr Chairman, I will go on to
the point where I left off last night.</p>

Hanoi in 2010. It is a significant milestone for ASEAN as eight
countries outside of ASEAN, namely, Australia, China, India, Japan,
New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US, were keen to join ADMM Plus

have come to terms with the need to send their children for overseas

confident that MINDEF would do all that it can to prevent misadventures
and accidents. But like the Chinese saying goes, "不怕一万，只怕万一" We
may have planned for all contingencies but a single injury or death due
to the unexpected is one too many. At the same time, while we must
make sure that training conditions do not end up being unrealistic,
we must continually train with safety as the priority for our NSmen.
Could the Ministry assure the House of how it plans to ensure the
safety and well-being of our servicemen during training?</p>

Mr Chairman, I recently attended the Total Defence Day Celebrations
for 2012 at ITE College West. It was an energetic event that was
put up not just by officers from MINDEF and the Home Team but also
by students of ITE College West. What stood out in particular was
the team song, "It's my turn", that was composed, written and performed
by the students themselves. Through their performance, I could feel
the sense of their pride and commitment to the cause. </p>

pride and commitment to be felt by students in schools as well, in
particular, through National Education. Based on my interactions

I could gather that they are quite indifferent about National Education

a propaganda tool. I am concerned about this indifference.</p>

Defence continues to be relevant and what is the current focus of

we find that we have amidst us, "new citizens", if I may refer to
them as such. There is little doubt that they contribute to our
society in a large variety of ways. They add to our cultural strongholds
and more than often, they also seek to make Singapore "home". An
important aspect of this process of making Singapore home, especially
for men, is the involvement with our armed forces. As conscript
armed forces, we are well aware of the importance of building commitment
to defence and National Service among Singaporeans. All Singaporeans,
be they men or women, "old" or "new" citizens, are a part of this. </p>

very nature, National Service will be more relevant to Singaporean
men. Even this year's theme for the NS45 campaign, "From Fathers
to Sons", reflects this. But we cannot forget that there is the
other half of the population, our women, whom we must engage on
both National Service and larger defence issues. As men rub shoulders
and discuss their National Service days and speak with pride of their
contribution to our nation, our women often feel left out. It is
not an experience they share or often that they can relate to. </p>

Mr Chairman, let me first thank Members for their questions and
comments. Over the years, MINDEF has been grateful to receive very
strong support from Singaporeans and Members in this House. We all share
this deep conviction that Singapore must be able to defend itself,
to keep the right to determine our own future and protect our way
of life. I find it also significant that Members of Parliament and
Non-Constituency Members of Parliament from all political parties
as well as Nominated Members of Parliament support our defence policies.
That is important. But MINDEF is also mindful that this trust has
been earned over the years through careful spending and the equitable
implementation of all our policies. I want to reassure Members of
this House that MINDEF will endeavour to maintain and deepen this
trust, and it is in that spirit, I welcome the opportunity to respond
to queries from hon Members, to forge a strong and collective will.
I will have to although add a caveat. The questions are all encompassing
and look way into the future. I think it will take many days to
respond to all their questions. So, with your indulgence, I will
just touch on the main points and then we can carry on with the
clarifications.</p>

been and is a "resident power" – I am using a term that former US
Defence Secretary Robert Gates used – it has been a resident power
in the Asia-Pacific for over half a century, whose presence has
been a vital force for stability and prosperity. It has been long
enough here in the Asia-Pacific for us to be able to assess the
contributions and role of the US' presence. And I think, on balance,
history will be kind to their presence here. To quote former Indonesian
Defence Minister Dr Juwono Sudarsono: "America's 'forward presence'€¦
provided vital 'strategic assurance', guaranteeing regional and
financial growth. America's dominance over the global commons was
the critical pillar enabling all East Asia export-based strategies, augmenting
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China to develop their trade, finance, investment
and banking reach." This is a quote from the former Indonesian Defence Minister.
Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Najib Razak, in last year's Shangri-La Dialogue
(SLD) where he was the keynote speaker, said this: "The United States
has long been a modernising and moderating force within our region,
supporting democratic institutions, improving governance and fostering
respect for human rights." </p>

rise has also presented tremendous economic opportunities for countries
within and beyond the region. China is now the top trading partner
of ASEAN, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia. By virtue
of its geography and growing influence, China will play a critical
role in regional security and stability. </p>

between the US, a "resident power", and China, a "rising power",
how they accommodate each other's interests and relate with other
countries in the region, will inevitably affect relationships with
and between ASEAN countries. We recognise that there is bound to
be competition between the US and China, but also urge both sides
to expand the common grounds to cooperate, to develop a relationship
based on mutual trust and common understanding. We were therefore
heartened that during Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping's recent
visit to the US, it was announced that both sides would hold the fourth round of the
Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the second round of the Strategic
Security Dialogue in China this May.</p>

potential flashpoints in Asia such as the Korean Peninsula and the
South China Sea, as many Members noted, including Dr Lim and Ms
Ellen Lee. In the South China Sea, activities by states to assert
their claims could cause tensions. As Members rightly pointed out,
non-traditional security challenges continue to confront us. You
will remember the Mumbai attacks in 2008 that shocked us all, and
the Jakarta hotel bombings in 2009 reminded us that terrorism remains
a persistent threat to all nations. Our intelligence assessment
for terrorism is that Singapore continues to be a target of terrorists.
Piracy is another challenge. As a maritime trading nation, we have
a vested interest in ensuring that sea routes continue to be safe
and open. </p>

the common security challenges that countries within this region
must respond to. Dr Lim, Ms Ellen Lee, Mr Ong Teng Koon, Mr Pritam
Singh and Mr Alvin Yeo have rightly pointed out that the SAF will
now have to deal with a wider theatre of operations that includes
such non-traditional threats related to terrorism, maritime security,
piracy and humanitarian assistance disaster relief (HADR). They
also asked if MINDEF and the SAF were responding adequately to these
new scenarios. At the same time, Members have raised questions about
our defence spending. In addressing these questions – how much we
need to spend, why and what for – I would like all of us to bear
in mind what we are up against and what we need to protect. I think that
is the first starting point.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-84f95c71-b74f-447c-84df-60eea67da11e"><!--a--></a>For Singapore, the harsh
reality is that our defence needs are also determined, or, more
accurately, compounded by our geography and limited natural resources.
Nothing will change the fact that we are a small island of just
over 700 square kilometres. We are also one of the most densely-populated
countries in the world with no strategic depth. What does that mean?
It means that we lack any hinterland to buffer our people and infrastructure
against attacks. The sea is at our backs. With an economy that is
highly dependent on global trade to survive, we need to ensure the
continuity of our lines of communication and trade through air,
sea and land. Many of you here, if not all of you, will remember
SARS in 2003. SARS provided a bitter foretaste of what would happen
if the flows of people and goods were disrupted, and that was only
for a few weeks. Trade came down, confidence was lost, businesses
bombed, and there was severe impact. These constraints are immutable
and have been recognised since Independence.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-a383600f-ed42-4f44-b10d-2943c4875dea"><!--a--></a>Dr Goh Keng Swee, who
played a seminal role in building the SAF from scratch, understood
clearly the almost insurmountable difficulties and inherent challenges.
But he also understood the imperative. We look at our archives often,
because it is a treasure trove of information, and Dr Goh had two
pieces of sagely advice. First, in 1973, when Singapore was still
relatively poor and undeveloped, Dr Goh said, "The curious thing about
Singaporeans in general is that they are very optimistic that war
will never occur in Singapore. This attitude of the general public
is all right for the economic progress of Singapore but it should
never be that of the policy makers in the public sector. We have to
think of such eventualities and make preparation well in advance."
Let me give Members a second quote. This was one in 1984, when our
nation was on a much firmer footing. Dr Goh added, "The most dependable
guarantee of our Independence is a strong SAF. A strong SAF in turn
depends on the political will to make the effort and pay the price."
His advice, therefore: prepare for unthinkable eventualities well
in advance and maintain the political will for a strong defence.
This is why we invest considerable amounts each year on defence.
But more than that, as Mrs Lina Chiam, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Pritam Singh
talked about, we require each Singaporean male to commit himself to
many years of National Service. Can we keep up that political will?
We have many opportunity costs, divergent needs, individual aspirations.
Can we keep up that political will, which Dr Goh quite presciently
pointed out that we needed to do? We must.</p>

a famous statesman, we dare not tempt others with our weakness.
Who said that? The then US President John F Kennedy. How much more
so this reality for a small country like ours. We dare not tempt
others with our weakness, because as a "jewel of Asia", we dare
not tempt others because we certainly have more to protect today.
Sir, this is not a theoretical threat, only relevant in the distant
past. In 1990, it took only one day for Iraqi forces to seize control
of Kuwait, considered a small rich country but really is about 25
times the size of Singapore. Just last month, Defence Minister of
the Philippines Voltaire Gazmin said, "Without a deterrent force,
we can be easily pushed around, our territories will be violated."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-060ac0e6-2ecf-487d-8897-e5b8a52023f4">

to be violated. Dr Lim rightly pointed out that we remain vulnerable.
Both he and Mr Pritam Singh asked the right questions. How does Singapore,
a small country with little natural resources, defend itself against
traditional and non-traditional threats? What kind of SAF do we
need? How will we know when we have achieved it? Sir, these immutable
constraints force us to leverage on technology, innovation and unflinching
human will to overcome our limitations. Translated to stark military
terms, we have to know more, see first, and respond sharply and
decisively to disable, if not destroy, would-be aggressors. That
kind of capability is hard to come by, even if we are willing to
pay for it. But we have made considerable progress over the years.
And the questions that you asked today indicate that we have made
considerable progress. The questions were: Can we now afford to
relax a little? How are we changing our SAF? Can we now reduce NS
commitments? The very fact that you are asking it is a reflection
that we have succeeded. Today, the SAF is widely acknowledged to
be a highly capable and professional military force, able to execute
missions across the spectrum of security challenges. We have achieved
real-time situational awareness of our airspace and sea lanes. We
owe a great debt to the pioneers and successive cohorts of SAF soldiers
and commanders who built it up through their blood, sweat and tears. </p>

primary mission seriously – to deter, and if deterrence fails, swiftly
defeat any potential threats to our sovereignty and security. We
could only have achieved and maintained these capabilities by an
unwavering commitment to invest considerable resources over a prolonged
period. </p>

Pritam Singh have asked how MINDEF plans its defence budget. Dr
Lim said, how did we get value for money? Let me provide details.
We have said previously that the Government is prepared to spend
up to 6% of GDP on defence, but MINDEF only asks for what we need
each year. Our overall approach is to maintain a stable defence
budget that grows gradually in absolute terms and to manage that prudently.
Over the last five years, defence expenditure has grown steadily
by about 4% annually, on average. It was $10.7 billion in 2008 and,
as Members pointed out, $12.3 billion this year. Such steady spending
is a critical enabler, because it allows MINDEF to take a long-term
view and obtain the best value for our defence investments. It allows the
SAF to steadily build up its capabilities, exploit nascent technologies
– so in other words, we can actually spot a technology that will
come on the market even before it has and exploit it – minimise disruptions
and effectively network its various services so that the combined
capability is more powerful than its individual parts.</p>

that MINDEF is mindful of our responsibility to spend carefully
and wisely. We are acutely aware that we have a major share of our Government
budget. We buy only what we need, scrutinise available options for
the most cost-effective solution. Our first instinct is to upgrade
existing platforms to extend their lifespan, instead of purchasing
new ones. For example, the Navy's corvettes – some of you may have
served on it – are 21 years old, but instead of being replaced immediately,
they will be upgraded to add many more years of operations. Our
two Archer-class submarines were bought second-hand and upgraded
to be stealthier, with longer endurance, and extended reach. Our
Leopard tanks were also bought second-hand and upgraded to meet
our operational needs. </p>

when the capabilities they provide are considered critical − for
example, F-15SG fighters, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System
(HIMARS) and S-70B naval helicopters. These new platforms allow
the SAF to keep a fighting edge. And when it is more cost-effective
to do so, we build our own, as we did for the Terrex Infantry Carrier
Vehicles, which provide our infantry troops more protection, mobility and
firepower. </p>

asked for an update on efforts to transform the SAF into a 3rd Generation
fighting force, and we have made significant advances. But I thought, instead
of me telling you, it would be better to show a video that illustrates
the SAF's current capabilities. Military forces all over know that
one of the hardest missions to conduct is what we call the "integrated
strike". That means close coordination, cross-coordination, between
different elements to neutralise a moving target. Because we can easily
understand why that is difficult, it requires all your platforms,
your units to be able to talk to each other in real-time amidst
a fast-flowing and almost-chaotic environment. And the video that
Members are about to see, show our "sensors", command post and "shooters"
tightly linked, allowing us to strike targets with a swifter and
deadlier punch. Let us take a look. [<em class="ph i">A <a href="http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/resource/videos/Integrated_Strike_020312.html">video

the sense-to-strike cycle down to a matter of minutes, a quantum
leap in our capabilities. The Commanding General of US' Fort Sill
army base, this was a Major-General, David Halverson, said after
witnessing one of these integrated live-firing exercises, "It is
apparent that the SAF has tremendous attack and defence capabilities.
I witnessed a world-class effort earlier with the complex coordination
with the various land and air assets." It is a major achievement.
If you talk to the pioneers of the SAF, they know what we were up
against, how difficult it was even to have a joint command. For
them to see these capabilities today, they know that we made major progress. </p>

capabilities, some Members have asked if Singapore can afford to
reduce our defence posture and preparations. It is a fair question.
I think Mr Pritam Singh and Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked that. It is a
fair question but difficult for anyone to know what the right answer
is. 9/11 caught many countries off guard. Many European countries
planned to enjoy the peace dividend after the Cold War. When I meet
Defence Ministers
today in Europe, they tell me exactly that. They were planning to
downsize after the Cold War, but after 9/11 found themselves stretched
and hurried to respond adequately. Canada was also reducing and
replacing some of its tanks. It is further away, separated by the
Atlantic. And then 9/11 occurred. It then had to hurriedly acquire
new tanks for their troops in Afghanistan. Once a particular capability
is lost, it will take many years to recover even if spending is
ramped up later. Worse still, it can cause the loss of lives later.
The UK is an example. In the late 1970s, the Royal Navy failed to
replace its airborne early warning capability in its ageing fleet.
So in the unanticipated Falklands War in 1982, this led directly
to the loss of a number of ships and deaths of many servicemen and
civilians. Mr Ong Teng Koon talked about this when he mentioned "unknown
unknowns". But even for known threats, any military force will tell
you that there are always ways to further strengthen defences if
more resources are allocated. I think, on balance, all of us will
feel safer if we continue to maintain a potent SAF through steady
and prudent investments.</p>

is our people – our NSFs, NSmen and regulars – who form the SAF
fighting force. And I share Mr Pritam Singh's concern. He mentioned
that there were perceptions about how Singaporeans feel that they
have to contribute more to Singapore, including NS, and that others
reap the benefits. I share that concern. We have to show Singaporeans
that we value their contributions. And that is what we are trying to
do, whether it is through education, pre-school education, special
education, health, housing, retirement, even NS itself, even the
SAF itself, it is all for Singaporeans. Some of you may have not
been struck by the slide that the Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister
Tharman showed in economic terms, how much taxes for the median
or the average worker versus how much you get over a lifetime. It
was quite an interesting fact that you did not own a car, you actually
get more than what you get. But translated to day-to-day experiences,
I hope that Singaporeans recognise that all that we are doing to build
this Singapore up, the various systems and social support, is for
Singaporeans. And we will have to do more, recognising the NS contributions
to show that citizens count for more and that foreigners complement
and help us build this place. </p>

enough, but I think we also have to bear in mind that Singaporeans,
on the other hand, have also received from others. We have many Singaporeans
who go overseas, to the UK, to Canada, to Australia, to the US.
And when I was studying in the US – I was doing my fellowship in
cancer surgery, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center – it was during
the time of the first Iraqi War. And there were lectures, scheduled
surgeries that I could attend then and I was there on a Government scholarship.
And top surgeons from this top cancer centre were called up, volunteered. A
top thoracic surgeon suddenly was called up; lectures were cancelled
because he went to serve. I was there, he is protecting his interests.
I am continuing to study while he is giving up opportunity cost.
So the shoe can be on the other foot. And we have to explain to
Singaporeans in the longer term, this is for our country and for
your children. And I hope that this will remind them that they are
valued.</p>

best in each NSman because with falling fertility rates, as many
of you pointed out, each NSman must shoulder more responsibility

that we must get the best from each NSman applies to all Singaporeans,
of all races. So, I was glad to hear Mr Zaqy Mohamad share, ask
and point out that
as he has observed, the contributions of Malay servicemen have indeed risen
in the SAF and he is right. Because we operate on this principle,
as long as a serviceman is committed to Singapore, dedicated to
the SAF and capable of doing the job, his appointment and advancement
in the SAF will be based on qualifications and merit. Qualifications
and merit. And in tandem with the rising educational standards,
as Mr Zaqy Mohamad has observed, more Malays have been appointed
to higher and more demanding roles across the SAF, including the
Commandos, Engineers, Artillery, Signals, Pilots and Sea Soldiers. </p>

Zaqy talked about the SPF and SCDF. As a matter of fact, the SAF

it takes more NS enlistees than the SPF and SCDF combined. But the
SAF is a big organisation, so I can understand the perception that
they do not realise that this is so, but the facts show that this
is so. And more regular servicemen, more Malay regular servicemen,
have also risen to hold senior Command and Staff appointments within
the SAF.</p>

− Dr Lim, Mr Alex Yam, Mrs Lina Chiam − raised pertinent questions
on NS and they asked, for example, can we shorten it. The primary consideration
is our NSmen are not the second line of defence. They do not go
behind somebody. When there is a need, they are the first responders,
to protect Singapore when our survival is threatened. So, in that
eventuality, we have to have sufficient numbers and we need to train
them, we need to have adequate time to train and prepare them for
their role effectively. In 2004, because of our 3G (3rd Generation) transformation
and technological improvements, we shortened it, from 2.5 years
to two years. And in 2006, we shortened the Operationally Ready
NS (ORNS) from 13 years to 10 years. And that reduction, whether
it was in 2004 or 2006, in NS duration corresponded with the surge
in NS intake from 2006 to 2015. In other words, we are seeing that
surge now. But from 2016, our cohort size will fall. There is a
demographic echo there. It occurs a few years when they come on
stream to NS. So, from 2016, the cohort size, the absolute numbers,
will fall. Therefore, until further review, we should maintain these
two years needed for full-time NS, and 10 years for ORNS, because
we need this to bring our soldiers and units up to the level of
operational readiness. </p>

asked about our bilateral defence relationships, our neighbours,
major powers and key countries, and Ms Ellen Lee is correct – no
country can do it alone. We have built up an extensive network.
Let me start with our neighbours. Our defence ties with Malaysia
are broad-based and long-standing. My counterpart, Dato' Seri Zahid
Hamidi, and I exchanged introductory visits last year. I am happy
to report to this House that since last May, both our Air Forces
resumed fighter aircraft stopovers and fuelling at each other's
air bases. So we started doing that. We also have a close relationship
with Indonesia, with regular professional exchanges and bilateral exercises.
Last year, the SAF and TNI co-hosted the first ASEAN military exercise,
a table-top HADR (humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations)
in disaster relief operation.</p>

and Ms Ellen Lee asked about ADMM. We have a long-standing relationship
with the US. The US remains one of our strongest and closest defence partners,
and the US' presence has brought about stability in this region.
We have therefore allowed US military aircraft and vessels the use
of our facilities since the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) in 1990. And in 2005, both Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
and then President George Bush signed the Strategic Framework Agreement
(SFA) to look for areas where we can facilitate this continued presence
of the US in this region. And the deployment to Singapore of the
US Navy's Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) is a manifestation of that
cooperation. So in line with this 1990 MOU and 2005 SFA, Singapore
is working with our US counterparts for one or two Littoral Combat
Ships (LCS), to use our facilities after tests and trials on these
new ships. We have been informed by the US that this is possible
from 2013, when they will start to deploy these Littoral Combat
Ships. While there have been some preliminary staff level discussions
on increasing this to four by 2016, we will only evaluate it when
we receive a formal request from the US. </p>

information on the LCS. It is similar in size to our frigates, with
about 75 crew members each. And like all other US ships and planes
that use our facilities, the LCS are not based in Singapore, and
the crew members will live on board the LCS throughout the duration
of their deployment. While deployed here, the LCS will make port
calls around the region to engage other navies and activities in
the region.</p>

the Gulf of Aden. The SAF took command of the CTF151 for the second

the SAF deployments in Afghanistan. I visited our servicemen in
Afghanistan last October. I saw the challenges they face up close.
They are subjected to risk. But we continue to help, together with

the SAF would have completed five years of deployments to Afghanistan.
We started in 2007 in Bamiyan, with a five-man dental team and a
five-man construction engineering team. I remember the dental team
coming back to report and said it was a welcome relief, literally
and metaphorically. Queues of up to one to two hours of people,
long-suffering, with their decayed teeth; so we did a lot of extractions down
there, of the right kind. Our deployments peaked in 2010 with about
100 SAF personnel deployed, as part of our Weapon Locating Radar,
UAV Task Group, and our medical, surgical, institutional trainers,
and imagery analysis teams. At present, the SAF is deployed in Kabul
and Oruzgan, two teams of a total of 15 trainers and a team of six imagery
analysts.</p>

Wong)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman, let me start by elaborating further
on our NS policies. MINDEF earns the trust and support for NS from
all Singaporeans, only when we adhere strictly to three fundamental
principles. First, NS must be to meet a critical national need for
security and survival because it imposes considerable cost both
to the individual and to the nation. Second, NS must be universal.
All young Singaporean males who are fit to serve are eligible for
conscription. The third principle is equity which means that NS
policies are applied equitably to everyone regardless of background
or status.</p>

if our disruption policy can be made more flexible in view of the
changing tertiary education landscape. MINDEF is very mindful about
the changing trends in the education as well as employment of NSmen.
We do exercise flexibility in considering disruption requests, but
we have to balance this against the impact that disruptions have
on the training and operational readiness of the individual and
his unit. At the same time, in looking at disruption matters, we
continue to uphold the fundamental principles that I outlined earlier.
For this reason, disruption for studies is considered only on the
basis of equity, so that individuals in the same Singapore school cohort
but in different enlistment intakes can still proceed for their
degree studies at the same university at the same time. </p>

Mr Pritam Singh asked about our deferment policy for athletes and
sportsmen. In particular, Er Dr Lee spoke very passionately about
this, and I would like to assure her that we understand the concerns
that are raised. MINDEF also exercises flexibility to allow deferment
from full-time NS for exceptional sportsmen, who have been strongly
supported by MCYS and selected to represent Singapore in major competitions
like the Olympics. For every such case, MINDEF considers the individual's
past achievements, his potential and the need for long deferments.
In addition, MINDEF also exercises flexibility to grant deferments
of shorter periods to national athletes representing Singapore in
major competitions. For example, 13 athletes were deferred for a period of
two to six months to participate in the 2011 SEA Games and 2010
Asian Games. </p>

have noted, this year marks the 45th Anniversary of the establishment
of National Service. It is a significant milestone. We have chosen
the theme of "NS: From Fathers to Sons" for the NS45 celebrations,
to highlight that NS is truly a shared legacy across generations.
In fact, as we go through the COS debate this week, some 3,000 Singaporean
sons will be going through their first week of Basic Military Training,
most of them following in their fathers' footsteps into the service
of our country. Just as their fathers did years ago, they will train,
sweat and persevere together with other Singaporean sons; and, in
the process, form friendships, forge bonds and learn the soldiering
skills to defend our country. </p>

MINDEF intends to commemorate National Service 45 both at the institutional
and the individual levels. Let me highlight two of the key activities: First,
we are engaging Singaporeans through an online effort, to ask them
to reflect on their NS experiences. Even today, I am sure, many
of us continue to reminisce about our time in NS. Because no matter
how long ago we did our NS, there is always something special about
our NS experience that we all cherish and remember, especially when
we get together with our unit mates. So, I invite all Singaporeans
to share their stories and engage in conversations on our NS45 website
as well as through our online story competition, "My NS Story",
which is taking place from now till April. Your reflections will
be shared with other Singaporeans during NS45 events throughout
the year. </p>

House in May will also serve as an anchor event for the commemoration
activities. For the first time, the Army will hold its Open House
in the heart of the city, at the F1 Pit Building, so as to reach
out to more Singaporeans. And to bring the NS45 celebrations even
closer to our people, we will also have a mobile NS showcase that
will visit various heartland communities after the Army Open House.
I encourage all Singaporeans to participate in these activities. </p>

how we can better recognise the contributions of our NSmen. Over
the years, the Government has been recognising the contributions
of NSmen in different ways. We have the National Service Recognition
Award (NSRA) to recognise our National Servicemen throughout their
NS training cycle. We have various initiatives to help NSmen better
balance their NS obligations with their civilian commitments, like
the IPPT-In-Your-Community Project, which has rolled out 100 fitness centres
with IPPT training facilities in different housing estates. We also
provide NSmen and their families with quality recreational facilities,
like the SAFRA clubs and NSRCC. SAFRA is presently undertaking a
strategic review to see how it can better serve our NSmen, not just
by offering attractive clubhouses and facilities, but also by playing
a more active role in engaging NSmen and fostering unit cohesion. </p>

earlier, MINDEF has conducted a review of the NS rank allowance,
which was last revised in 2009. From April this year, the rank allowance
for all servicemen in the SAF, SPF and SCDF will be increased by
$60 per month across all ranks. This latest allowance review goes
one step further in signalling our acknowledgement of our servicemen's
commitment and service, as we mark 45 years of NS. Going forward, MINDEF will continue
to look into ways in which we can better recognise the contributions
of our NSmen. </p>

how we are improving learning and training in the SAF, issues which
Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Ms Ellen Lee asked about. Our current
generation of NSFs is a technology-savvy group, more accustomed
to a self-directed learning environment from their days in school.
And we have observed that they learn better when they collaborate
and exchange knowledge with their peers. In so doing, they become
more adaptive, take greater ownership of their training. And these
abilities – to sense-make and adapt rapidly, to work together collaboratively
– are essential for today's soldiers in the modern battlefield. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-86c99089-886e-4902-9cab-36ce70bc94af">
                  <a name="budget__id-86c99089-886e-4902-9cab-36ce70bc94af"><!--a--></a>Hence, the SAF has started
to transform its learning and training systems to take into account
these considerations, which also serve to help ease the transition
into NS for our enlistees, and make NS a more positive experience
for them. First, we are adopting a more learner-centric pedagogy
to create a training experience that is consistent with the learning
habits and expectations of our soldiers. For example, our trainers
today employ more coaching and facilitation methodologies. Trainees
have more team-based active learning, with time allocated for them
to consolidate and share their knowledge. We also invest in simulators
to enhance experiential learning. </p>

Members about our pilot roll-out of LEARNet to the Basic Military
Training Centre, Officer Cadet School, Specialist Cadet School and
Signal Institute, enabling trainees in these units to access learning
resources through portable devices. The trainees have provided positive
feedback that they were able to learn at their own pace, and gain
the confidence to apply these lessons out in the field. Following the
success of this pilot, the SAF plans to extend LEARNet progressively
over the next five years to some 80 other units. </p>

modern pedagogies, learning tools and simulation technologies, we
will continue to uphold rigorous standards of training, to prepare
our soldiers to meet the demands of military operations. Our efforts
to leverage technologies and platforms such as LEARNet have, in
fact, allowed the SAF to reduce the time our soldiers spend in classrooms
by 15% to 20%. And we reinvest this time into tough, realistic and
rigorous training for our soldiers. </p>

leverage on technology to improve the efficiency of In-Camp Training
(ICT), to minimise inconveniences and "standing around" time, and
to help our NSmen focus on their training and operational duties.
As Members may know, we already have a computerised registration
and scoring system for the IPPT. Last year, we introduced electronic
equipment at the firing range. Previously, firing ranges were operated
on a manual basis. Some of us may recall during our NS time doing
butt party duties,
counting bullet holes on targets, and covering them with stickers
so that the targets can be re-cycled. Now, everything is automated
– NSmen can register for their range sessions by scanning their
identity cards, they do their firing and their scores at the range
are electronically recorded, resulting in significant time saved. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-9facb076-9113-4896-867a-8eb2be9f28ba"><!--a--></a>We have received positive
feedback on these initiatives from many NSmen, like 3SG (NS) Murugan
s/o Ratnam, from 724 Guards. He said: "This is my sixth ICT, and
I see that a lot of feedback has been heard, and changes have been
made. I can see progressive improvements each time I come back for
ICT." Indeed, with these efficiency gains, our NSmen have more time
for field training. So each time they come for their ICT, they can focus
on improving their combat proficiency, and thus feel more confident
about their skills.</p>

and Ms Ellen Lee also asked about professional development and continuing
education, which go hand-in-hand in improving the overall professionalism
of our Regular servicemen. Under our continuing education efforts,
the SAF has established education tie-ups with various Institutes
of Higher Learning, such as the Nanyang Polytechnic, UniSIM and
NTU, which also cater to the different educational start points
of our servicemen. This allows the SAF to have a high-quality Regular
corps that is able to lead and train our NSFs and NSmen. </p>

with Nanyang Polytechnic, the SAF introduced the Certificate in
Business Management programme for Warrant Officers, Specialists
and Military Experts to pursue their Diploma in this field. For
our officers, they can take up modules at the Goh Keng Swee Command
and Staff College in SAFTI Military Institute, and these modules
are accredited towards NTU Master's programmes. Since then, 12 graduates
have embarked on this programme. And the SAF will continue to collaborate with
our polytechnics and universities, to give our servicemen full opportunities
for continuing education and lifelong learning. And as Ms Ellen
Lee said, these are competencies and skills which we believe will
be useful, not just for our servicemen in the SAF but also if they
were to choose to pursue second careers in the private sector. </p>

how MINDEF ensures the safety and well-being of our servicemen during
training. Sir, while we train realistically and rigorously to prepare
our servicemen for military operations, we will never compromise
on safety. The SAF has put in place many measures – safety briefings,
lesson plans, training safety regulations, multi-tier supervision.
These all complement one another to ensure the safety of our soldiers.
MINDEF is also committed to ensuring that our safety systems are
robust and constantly reviewed. We emphasise safety as a key responsibility
of our commanders, who are charged with the duty to look out for
the men under their care, and mitigate potential risks during operations
and training. Our commanders are trained to educate and actively
engage our people on the importance of tough but safe training.
Units are also encouraged to provide feedback in an open manner
on safety issues. And through these efforts, we have built a culture
of safety throughout the SAF. </p>

system does not guarantee zero incidents in the SAF. From time to
time, unfortunately, incidents do happen, resulting in injuries
and casualties. In such cases, let me assure Members that we will
take all steps to investigate and manage the case well, provide
support to the families as well as take immediate corrective action
to prevent further similar incidents. I will now hand over to Dr
Maliki, who will speak on Total Defence and our efforts to strengthen
commitment to defence.</p>

Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Dr Mohamad
Maliki Bin Osman)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, Dr Intan asked about our
Total Defence efforts, especially with schools, and about the relevance
of Total Defence. Sir, we have heard from Dr Ng that the threats
to our peace and security have expanded in scope and complexity.
Such threats have widespread repercussions and require a multi-sector response. </p>

five aspects of military, civil, economic, social and psychological
defence – provides this multi-sector response by bringing Singaporeans together
in a united and integrated approach to deal with national crises
of all kinds. For example, we were able to pull through the recent
economic crisis, the worst since our independence, relatively unscathed
through strong cooperation between the Government, employers and
workers.</p>

everyone has to play a part. This is the message of our annual campaigns
since we first launched Total Defence in 1984. The response to our campaigns
so far shows that Singaporeans understand this. For instance, Mr
Jeremy Lim Hon Lee, an NUS student, said to <em class="ph i">The New Paper</em>,
and I quote, "Every day is Total Defence Day, as we have to continue
maintaining our strengths and enhancing our capabilities. It is
the responsibility of every Singaporean to do so." Mr Lim, as some
of you may know, was born with brittle bone disease. He has risen
above adversity to now study at NUS and actively gives back to society
– a true inspiration to all of us.</p>

beyond the "head" and "heart" to the "hands". MINDEF will work with
other agencies that represent other components of Total Defence
to encourage Singaporeans to build up and keep up-to-date skills
for Total Defence. For instance, we will continue to work with the
Ministry of Home Affairs, the Singapore Civil Defence Force and
other partners involved in Civil Defence like the People's Association and
its grassroots movement to ensure that Singaporeans know what to
do in case of any emergencies. </p>

this year also reminds us that Total Defence is an effort that requires
all Singaporeans of every generation to play a part. Carrying the
theme "Total Defence – It's My Turn", the campaign centres on getting
Singaporeans to take action in our own ways to strengthen Total
Defence, including doing our part to help fellow Singaporeans by
being involved in community work and at the same time strengthening
our spirit of volunteerism and active citizenry. We heard from Dr
Intan how impressed she was with the students who came up with the
theme song for this year's campaign.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-deba4cdf-d883-463a-89e8-c3dcec3666b0">
                  <a name="budget__id-deba4cdf-d883-463a-89e8-c3dcec3666b0"><!--a--></a>Indeed, when Singaporeans
reach out and help fellow Singaporeans, we are strengthening our
Social Defence. A key component of this year's campaign is thus
a series of ground-initiated community projects that see Singaporeans
from all walks of life volunteering to do something for the community.
For instance, local restaurateur Willin Low organised a three-course
Chinese New Year lunch for elderly residents during the festive
period, while Ngee Ann Polytechnic Film and Media Studies student Mr
Chong Yu Lun organised a music video production workshop for youths,
especially those who lack opportunities – to equip them with the
skills to express themselves creatively. </p>

this year, the SAF also partnered with four schools – ITE College
West, Raffles Institution, Singapore Polytechnic and Tampines Junior
College – to jointly organise the Total Defence Day event held at
these schools. Total Defence Day is one of the four core National Education
events commemorated by schools every year. With this collaboration,
this year's event, which showcased different aspects of Total Defence,
including a CPR training workshop, reached out to more than 15,000
students, sending the message that you are never too young to be
involved in Total Defence.</p>

to engage different segments of society to enhance commitment to
defence and support for National Service. We engage the grassroots leaders
and a wide range of community stakeholders on defence issues through,
for example, the Advisory Council for Community Relations in Defence
(ACCORD). We also work closely with employers to gain their support
for their employees' NS commitments. This is what Mrs Lina Chiam
mentioned earlier, seemingly that Singaporeans seem to be disadvantaged
because of their National Service obligations. I want to assure
Mrs Lina Chiam that many employers do understand and support the need
for defence. Over the years, many employers, both local and foreign,
MNCs and SMEs, across various industry sectors have been awarded
the Total Defence Award for their commitment and support to MINDEF
which serves to recognise the employers who have demonstrated their
strong support for defence.</p>

by MINDEF, over 80% of NSmen said that their employers are supportive
of their NS commitments. </p>

educators to equip them to be effective interlocutors on defence
issues. In collaboration with MOE, MINDEF/SAF rolled out the SAF-School Partnership
Programme in 2011 to the Junior Colleges, schools with Integrated Programmes,
Polytechnics and ITEs. Twenty-nine out of 30 of these Post-secondary Education
Institutions signed up, partnering with SAF units to co-organise
meaningful activities to expose students, both boys and girls, to
defence issues and also prepare the male pre-enlistees for NS. We
also sought new ways for families and friends of our servicemen
and members of the public to support our servicemen on overseas deployments.
One example is the Navy's Sea of Support microsite, where messages
of support can be posted. </p>

right that women are very much part of our National Service journey.
They are critical in sustaining our national commitment to defence
and supporting our servicemen's commitment to NS. Some of you may
have seen video clips made by students for our current N.E.mation!
competition that make this very point. If you have not, I encourage
you to have a look, at <em class="ph i">www.nemation.sg</em>. Additionally, since
2007, MINDEF has been regularly conducting dialogue sessions with representatives
from various women's groups to seek their views, concerns, suggestions
and support for NS and our commitment to defence.</p>

initiatives to reach out to the wider population of Singaporeans,
including women. For example, we produced a 12-part web mini-series
called "<em class="ph i">Basic Military Talk</em> ". This mini-series aims to inform
viewers from all walks of life, particularly women, on different
facets of military life in an entertaining manner. In January, our <em class="ph i">PIONEER</em> magazine
also hit the newsstands bundled with entertainment weekly <em class="ph i">8 Days</em>,
so as to allow us to reach out to more Singaporeans, beyond our
traditional NSman audience. We are looking to extend this initiative
to other magazines in the months ahead, so keep a lookout. </p>

approach has shifted towards a more "participative" form of engagement,
using new media platforms. For example, through the annual N.E.mation!
competition, we encourage young Singaporeans to reflect on the importance
of Total Defence and the Singaporean identity through the creative medium
of animation. More recently, the inaugural ciNE65 short-film competition
last year asked aspiring film-makers to share what Singapore means
to them through the medium of film. </p>

a vibrant and expanding online presence and is reaching out via
new social media platforms to engage Singaporeans. People have been regularly
"liking" and sharing our content on our cyberpioneer Facebook page,
while our cyberpioneerTV YouTube channel now has over 300 videos
and about 6.4 million views. The TV-adaptation of the reality-style
web-series "Every Singaporean Son" (ESS) started screening on the
National Geographic Channel in March 2011. Based on its ratings
then, "ESS" was the No. 1 programme on Singapore Cable TV over the
last two years, across what the media industry calls "factual entertainment
channels". Entertainment aside, these efforts help to deepen the
public's understanding of and support for NS and enhance their commitment
to defence.</p>

that Singaporeans' commitment to NS and defence remains high. Our
survey conducted in 2011 showed that more than 90% of our respondents
– comprising NSFs, NSmen and members of the public – agree that
NS is necessary, Singapore is where they belong and they would defend
Singapore should it come under threat. But what is just as heartening
as the survey results are the many examples of NSmen who time and
again have proven their strong commitment to serve. For example,
MAJ (NS) Tan Tze Hian of 434 SAR has been coming back for ICT every
year since 1998 and has now completed 13 ICT cycles in total. In
another example, CPT(NS) Edzra Bin Iskandar, the Battalion 2IC of
806 SIR, who graduated from the 12th NS Command and Staff Course
last October, is currently serving another high-key ICT within the
same work year. Both MAJ (NS) Tan and CPT (NS) Edzra are examples
of NSmen with unwavering commitment to our NS system and will go
the extra mile for their ICT. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, while the Government is pushing
for productivity in the private sector and asking the private sector
to review the way it does things, I hope MINDEF and SAF also can
do likewise. I am heartened to hear from the Minister of State just
now that NSmen are using the LEARNet now to improve learning so
that it can cut down learning time by 10% to 15%. They are using
electronic range now so that the time taken is shortened as well.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-63d82636-59e2-4dd0-8260-f9c44ba557da">
                  <a name="budget__id-63d82636-59e2-4dd0-8260-f9c44ba557da"><!--a--></a>I would like to ask the
Minister now to clarify whether the considerations to reduce the
NS duration from 30 months to 24 months in 2004-2005 period, does
it stand still or are we continuing to improve? Does he foresee
that we will be able to reduce the NS duration further because of
the productivity gains we are gaining?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8d907946-82e9-4381-856f-7b70ff8727c4">
                  <a name="budget__id-8d907946-82e9-4381-856f-7b70ff8727c4"><!--a--></a>The Minister also mentioned
that there is a political will, but there is also an opportunity
cost. Yes, I understand that. I am talking about this now because
I am not gunning for political gains because I am from the same
party. I am here speaking on behalf of Singapore because there is
really an opportunity cost for our young Singapore males who are
serving NS now, but they are competing with an international workforce, they
are competing with males from other countries at the international
realm. That is one clarification.</p>

is for the Minister of State regarding the issue on equity. He mentioned
that the principle of NS has to be on equity. I would like to ask
the Minister of State, when we were asking for flexibility in terms
of disruptions and deferment, it does not mean that the NSman or
the NSF does not want to serve. They want to serve but they are
hoping that they can fulfil their personal aspiration of completing
part of their tertiary education before they come back to serve.
Many countries such as Turkey, Korea and even Taiwan have introduced
flexibility in their system whereby they allow the males to serve
as long as they serve before a certain age. So, perhaps the Minister of
State can elaborate on that.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Dr Ng Eng Hen</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
I gave the considerations in terms of ascribing the NS duration.
The first consideration is that our NSmen are not second line response.
They are the force that has to be stood up. And you need an adequate
duration to train them to play that role effectively. I think a
greater sin is to call up people for NS and not train them effectively
for that role. So, I think all of us will agree that the political
will means that you call them up and you train them effectively
to play that role. That is a primary consideration. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3791e28d-3b09-4fb1-9146-480e6a4f77ed">

two and a half to two years in 2004, and, in 2006, the ORNS from
13 years to 10 years. But as I said, that was in line with our 3G
transformation and technological improvements. More importantly,
it also corresponded with a surge of NS intakes that occurred from
2006 to 2015. But from 2016, each cohort size will fall. So, I think
we want to be very careful about this transition, study it carefully
to see what it entails in terms of capabilities and operational
aspects. So, until further review, we should keep at least the two-year
and 10-year cycles.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
I thank the Member for that clarification. As I mentioned earlier,
our considerations for disruption are based on the fundamental principle
of equity. In doing so, we want to maintain the integrity of our
National Service system. This is of importance because, as the Minister
explained, National Servicemen form the backbone of the SAF. When
we look at considerations for deferment, we already do that for
up to the first education bar, which means for NS-liable males to
do their A-levels,
polytechnics, or equivalent educational qualifications. And then
beyond that, I think if we allow a system where anyone can choose
to do NS at his own time, it would be very difficult to have an
NS system that works. So, we allow for deferment for up to the first
education bar. Thereafter, the NS-liable males come in, they do
their NS together and beyond that, we have a system that ensures
that students of the same cohort can be disrupted to go to university
at the same time. This is a system that we have maintained and we
should continue to preserve this system so that the integrity of our
National Service system is maintained. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
I have two clarifications for Minister of State Lawrence Wong. First
question is, how long NS deferment is MINDEF prepared to consider
for Joseph Schooling? For male swimmers, I understand that they
will peak at around 23, 24 years old, that is, by the 2020 Olympics.
Second clarification: is MINDEF ready to recognise sports achievement
in lieu of National Service, that means, exempt them if they obtain
Olympic medals?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>
                  </span>: I thank
the Member for the clarifications. I would rather not get into the
details of individual cases, but I will just say for Joseph Schooling,
as I understand, he is already deferred from his National Service
up to 2014. This is on the premise of the deferment for the first
education bar which I talked about. So, he will have time to train
for the Olympics this year and I am sure we will cheer for him and
wish him well. Beyond that, I think it is premature to talk about
whether or not we can defer any further. If he wishes to apply for
deferment later on, we will look at the particular case and application,
and as I mentioned earlier, we will review each case on its own
merit, on the basis of the individual's potential, performance and
also with input from MCYS. I am sure, if that application is made
by Joseph Schooling, we will look at it appropriately. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ef61aded-f2a9-4816-b35b-8764e987738e">
                  <a name="budget__id-ef61aded-f2a9-4816-b35b-8764e987738e"><!--a--></a>On the second query on
allowing for exemption of National Service on the basis of sports
achievement, I think this is a very fundamental issue because we
have National Service obligations and duties for every Singaporean
male. This is something we preserve. If we were to allow for exemptions,
it would be very difficult, as I mentioned earlier, to preserve
that integrity of our National Service system, and that must be
the core basis upon which we make our considerations. I would not
want to have a broad-based policy to say that anyone who makes certain
achievements can be exempted, but rather, I think, we should preserve
the integrity of our NS system so that it remains a core of SAF.
But from time to time, for individual cases, for exceptional sportsmen,
as I mentioned earlier, we can and we have given flexibility for
them to pursue their aspirations to train and also to compete in
international competitions. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>
                  </span>: I have
three points to make. I struggle to say whether they are clarifications
or not – just some reflections on what the Minister has said. I
will be as brief as I can. The first point I would like to make
is with reference to the Minister's comments. I completely acknowledge
the strategic considerations that necessitate a strong SAF; and,
I think, many Singaporeans probably feel the same way. My only concern
is this: I remember a few days ago, the Minister of Finance <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam
spoke about looking for new ways to raise taxes in future to look
after the next generation of Singaporeans.
My concern is defence will always come in the gun sights of many,
many Singaporeans as the Ministry which has to reduce spending.
It is almost like a contradiction; on the one hand, we appreciate
that we need a strong SAF, but on the other hand, there is a danger
that it will always be in the spotlight for that reason. And people
will always come up with counter arguments about how we are not
in an environment where this is Kuwait or Iraq, and so forth.</span>

disagree with that. I recognise that it is important. My only concern
is it may in future become a cause for consideration. Every few
years, someone will raise the issue and MINDEF has to go through
this process again. My whole point was it may be a case of reminding
Singaporeans that this is important.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, the
SAF is a microcosm of the entire society. Rather than go into debate
as to who leads what, it is an evolving aspect. As I have answered
in my reply, our principle is that we will maximise from each NSman
regardless of race. If the serviceman is committed to the SAF and
has the educational qualifications, we will deploy him and advance
him based on that merit qualifications.</p>

details, indeed, in tandem with rising educational qualifications,
both the number and the roles that Malays have played in SAF have increased,
whether it is commandos, artillery, sea soldiers, or pilots. And
we will continue to work with the rest of the society for this. </p>

Mr Pritam Singh's earlier point that Singaporeans are feeling that they

                  </span>: Thank you,
Mr Chairman. I would like to clarify with the Minister of State
with regard to his statement about cohort integrity – how important
is cohort integrity in the whole question of equity. As we know,
every single unit in SAF now, men and women who are in the unit
are of different ages and from different cohorts. Why is this cohort
integrity important rather than flexibility?</p>

                  </span>: I thank
the Member for the opportunity to clarify this point again. I do
not think it is the case that every single unit has men of different
ages. They largely come in after school in the same cohorts and
therefore we do not want to have people comparing with one another
when they can start their university studies. Our approach is to
make sure that students coming into NS are of the same cohort. When they
complete their NS, they will have the chance, if they want to go
on to university studies, to pursue their studies at the university
at the same time. That is why we have given flexibility for disruption
for students to make sure that this is possible. Before they come
into National Service, we also give them flexibility to defer up
to the first education bar, as I mentioned earlier. So, these are
considerations both before enlistment and towards the tail end of
their National Service period where we also offer flexibility for disruption
to ensure that students of the same cohort get into university at
the same time.</p>

casting doubts on whether this goal is realistic. ASEAN Secretariat
Finance Integration head Aladdin D Rillo has expressed doubts regarding
the integration of ASEAN in the timeframe outlined by the ASEAN
Economic Community Blueprint. He said in an interview to <em class="ph i">Jakarta
Post</em> in 2010 "there will only be a semblance of economic integration.
Not the full integration as the term implies. Because if we want to
have full economic integration, it means really a single market,
a single production base. It also means financial markets are fully
integrated." He does not think that will be happening any soon. </p>

Communique was released. This was the result of intense negotiations
between Nixon and Premier Chou En Lai. The Communique stated, and
I quote, "express the hope that the gains achieved during that visit
would open up new prospects for relationships between the two countries".
For the first time since the Cold War, the Communique was a breakthrough
and resulted in normalisation of the relationship between the US

also contributed to relaxation of tension in Asia and in the world. </p>

to cause increased anxiety in China, with specific concerns likely

already have or are developing a unique strategic relationship with
the US. In light of our significant economic relationship with many
Asia-Pacific countries, particularly the key strategic players,
what is Singapore's approach to managing our relationship with China?
Does the Minister foresee the relationship coming under strain in
light of the US' renewed emphasis on Asia? More specifically, in view
of the Minister's recent trip to China and the US, does China appreciate
why Singapore requires a strong US presence in the region in addition
to the robust relation with other regional players, such as India?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, Clinton's November 2011 Foreign Policy Article heralded the
21st Century as America's Pacific century and the US strategic pivot or
rebouncing strategy from the Middle East towards the Asia Pacific.
However, if we look back at the past half a century, the US economic
and military presence in Asia certainly is not new. This is perhaps
why the recent talk about US pivot and a return to Asia has provoked
some nervousness. A number of countries in the region have warned that
the pivot would lead to growing tension and mistrust, or that it
would provoke responses from the region that would be detrimental
to regional stability. Questions have also been raised of the sufficiency
of the US pivot and whether this initiative can be sustained. The
pivot must be seen in the context of China's growing assertiveness. How
should Singapore position ourselves with respect to the US pivot?
How can we ensure that we are not caught in the middle of a conflict
between China and the US?</p>

Latin America, as a region, has experienced solid and sustained
economic growth over the past decade and is becoming increasingly
linked with the economies in East Asia, in particular China. What
are we doing to increase our engagement with Latin America? Have
we managed to increase our presence there? Elsewhere in the world,
the unrest that has come to be known as the Arab Spring continues
to simmer. After having affected Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and
Bahrain, it is now strife and violence in Syria that occupy news
headlines. Companies and investors with activities and interests
in the region would no doubt have taken a hit. In this context, how
have Singapore's not unsubstantial efforts to engage the Middle
East be affected? In the long run, what are the prospects for this
engagement? Is there a need for us to adjust our approach? More
broadly, how best can Singapore continue to ensure that we are well
positioned to tap on new areas of economic opportunity in the different
regions around the world?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Singapore is a nation of travellers. Recently, I met a young resident
who shared that he was saving up for a trip to Fatu Hiva. I smiled
and nodded, but honestly, it took me some time to make out where
he was headed to. As Singaporeans continue to expand and explore
opportunities for work, business and leisure across the world, very
often, preparing for emergencies does not feature as one of the
things to do. Recent unfortunate incidents perhaps marked out the
significance and importance of such plans.</p>

the hope is perhaps never to have to deal with the tragedy not because
of the work involved but because of the emotional cost for the people
that they are helping. Yet our consular officers stand ready for
any scenario. As more Singaporeans continue to move about in a globalised
world, there will be increasing need for consular services. More
complex issues will arise for travel and migration. More complex
and responsive consular services are therefore vital. Internationally, since
9/11, consular service has emerged as an important task for Foreign
Ministries due to the international migration and the increase in
the travel activities of citizens. In this context, could the Ministry
update on any plans to beef up our consular services for Singaporeans?
Would the Ministry be increasing recruitment of consular officers
to ensure adequate services are provided for this, our nation of
travellers?</p>

right in the heart of the Pacific Ocean. Before Members consider
making travel plans to explore the valleys of the French Polynesia, may
I invite Members to explore the equally laid back beauty of the
Kranji countryside which is right in the heart of Yew Tee? No passports

ASEAN's long-term goal, and what ASEAN could learn from the EU.
The EU has massive experience in regional integration. It provides

We will keep our key objectives firmly in mind as we work towards
achieving a stronger ASEAN Community by 2015. This is a major effort and

the smooth handover of the waterworks under the 1961 Water Agreement

Water Agreement. Under this Agreement, Singapore has the right to draw up to
250 million gallons of water per day from the Johor River until
the expiry of the Agreement in 2061. </p>

Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Teo Ser Luck asked about
Singapore's approach to developments in Myanmar, and Myanmar's Chairmanship
of ASEAN in 2014. The Myanmar government has taken positive steps
in its transition to democracy. Clear indications of the President's
commitment in carrying out his reform agenda are there for everyone
to see. We are encouraged by the positive developments. Singapore
has, for a long time, taken the position that Myanmar needs to be
constructively engaged and it needs to be encouraged in its process
of reform. We hope that countries which have imposed sanctions can
consider lifting them soon. </p>

to face many challenges. Primary among them is an urgent need for
capacity building to continue reforms, particularly economic reforms. Singapore
will help. We signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Singapore-Myanmar

in Myanmar, Singapore and the other ASEAN countries supported Myanmar's

with the US and China. Mr Alex Yam and Mr Pritam Singh asked about
our ties with the US and China. For the past 50 years, the US role
has been irreplaceable in providing peace and stability to the region.
That has allowed all of us to grow and prosper. The US still remains
the market of last resort for East Asia. There is no alternative
to the US dollar as the international reserve currency. </p>

visit as Foreign Minister to the United States in early February.
After a substantive meeting with Secretary Clinton, we issued a
Joint Vision Statement which underscored the breadth and depth of
our bilateral relationship. We signed two Memoranda of Understanding
(MOU) − first, to establish a Strategic Partnership Dialogue between
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US Department of State;
and, second, to create a Singapore-US Third Country Training Programme
to jointly help developing countries, especially those in our region. </p>

who was also in the US at the same time, signed an MOU with his
US counterpart to further education co-operation. The two of us,
together with Minister Iswaran, then participated in a Singapore
Conference. The conference allowed us to reach out to and exchange
insights with some of the top opinion-shapers in the United States.
From all of these meetings, as well as discussions with US Congressional foreign
policy leadership and my legal counterpart Attorney General Eric
Holder, it was clear to us that the United States appreciates Singapore's
success and role in our part of the world, and is keen to explore
new areas of co-operation to deepen and broaden our partnership.</p>

The size, strength and resilience of the Chinese economy makes it
a stabilising force and an engine of growth for regional economies,
particularly so in the last few years. Singapore-China relations
are excellent and they are anchored by a steady exchange of high-level
visits, strengthening economic links, growing people-to-people exchanges.
Our leaders visit China regularly. Chinese leaders, including Vice
President Xi Jinping, Vice Premier Wang Qishan, as well as many
other central government and provincial level leaders have visited
Singapore in the past two years. </p>

introductory visit to China in February. I had good meetings with
the Chinese leaders, including Vice Premier Li, and discussed several
issues. Foreign Minister Yang and I reaffirmed the importance of
continued support from both our governments on a range of bilateral
cooperation projects. We discussed ways to expand bilateral cooperation
in new areas. Moving forward, our continued high-level exchanges
and institutionalised dialogues, for example, the annual Joint Council
for Bilateral Cooperation, co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo
Chee Hean and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan, will provide a firm
basis for further strengthening of bilateral relations. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b06b063d-aab9-4e6b-98a8-44abdf4a11bb">

are also underpinned by robust economic ties. In 2011, China was
Singapore's third largest trading partner. Singapore was China's
15th largest. China remains our top investment destination. Besides
our two flagship G-to-G projects, the Suzhou Industrial Park and
Tianjin Eco-city, we have stepped up our economic engagement at
the provincial level, through our seven provincial business councils,
and through private sector-led cooperation, such as the Guangzhou
Knowledge City and Sichuan Hi-Tech Innovation Park. As a mark of
the maturity of the bilateral relationship, both sides are increasingly
going beyond traditional parameters of economic cooperation. </p>

about the US' "pivot" to the region and how Singapore should position
itself, and Mr Singh asked about China's concern about containment and
how we will manage that. I will try and answer these questions –

announcement on the US' commitment to be a Pacific power. The US'
interest in Asia is not a recent phenomenon. The US has been a vital
part of our region, both strategically and economically, for decades

in the US for this policy. It is in the US' own interests to be
engaged in this growing and dynamic region. We encourage the US to stay deeply
engaged in this region, and to do so in a broad-based and multi-faceted
way. </p>

engagement with the region in recent years. It is a key player, with
strong linkages, through trade, investments, development assistance
and projection of soft power. And as its economy grows and domestic

region will increase. A stable and prosperous Asia-Pacific region

from China's prosperity. We welcome China's commitment to a peaceful approach

a zero-sum game. We believe that the US and China can manage their

Sino-US relationship during my visits to Washington DC and Beijing.
These messages were accepted by both sides as necessary to ensure
the peace, prosperity and progress for the US and China, as well

of containment − I think Mr Singh referred to that word − I had
publicly stated in Washington that containment of China is not a
feasible strategy, it is not tenable, and that it is not something
that the US should be identifying as its strategy. And in my meetings
with the US leadership, it was clear and I was assured that, that
is not part of their strategy either. So, if I have not answered
Mr Singh's questions fully, maybe he can clarify at the end of my

on Singapore's ties with our other key bilateral partners. Singapore
has maintained robust friendships with many of our key bilateral
partners. Starting with Japan, a very important partner for us,
Japan plays a key role in our region as a key Dialogue Partner of
ASEAN. Japan has gone through a difficult year. Singapore will continue
to do what we can to support Japan which has contributed so much
to our and our region's development. And this was demonstrated by
the outpouring of support by Singaporeans for Japan following the
Tohoku disasters last March. We also supported Japan's decision
to enter preliminary bilateral talks on its participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership
negotiations. We hope Japan can be a full member as soon as possible.</p>

and demands given the geopolitical and economic uncertainties in
the next few years. I am confident that we are capable of tackling
these challenges. We have a corps of committed and professional
Foreign Service Officers who are dedicated to defending and advancing
Singapore's foreign policy interests, looking after the interests
of our Singaporeans abroad. Nevertheless, I have to admit that my
Ministry is at present greatly stretched in terms of manning resources.
We have to ensure that our Foreign Service remains adequately and
competently staffed and resourced, in order for us to maintain the
high standards that we have set and in safeguarding and advancing
Singapore's interests.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman, Ms Ellen
Lee asked about developments in the Middle East and Singapore's efforts
to tap emerging markets like the Middle East and Latin America.
Despite the political turmoil in some parts of the Middle East,
Singapore's engagement in that region has continued. We have taken
a longer term perspective in developing relations with the Middle
East. While some Arab countries are understandably preoccupied domestically,
this should not hold us back from engaging others in the region.
On the whole, our relations with the region remain positive. </p>

that despite the political upheaval last year, our trade in the Middle
East countries had, in fact, increased 20% to a healthy $64 billion
from 2010. Indeed, some of our companies are doing well. For example,
in addition to its more than $1.1 billion portfolio of projects
in Saudi Arabia, Rotary recently secured a $43 million deal to build
storage facilities of an oil refinery in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Keppel
FELS also won a contract in Qatar to build two rigs worth more than
$400 million. </p>

Gulf countries, with whom we have developed strong relations since
2004. Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong recently visited Saudi
Arabia in January 2012, and had good meetings with Saudi leaders.
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean is scheduled to visit Qatar
in March. Minister Shanmugam also plans to visit the Gulf later
this year. Hence, at the political level, we have continued to engage
and strengthen relations. </p>

of countries in the Middle East, such as Egypt, are undergoing a
political transition and it will take time for the situation to
stabilise. The situation in Syria also remains troubling, and there
are concerns that sectarian strifes can spill over to other countries
in the region.</p>

Iran's nuclear programme. The politics in the Middle East is and
will always be complicated. While we strive to understand the region
better, we are cognisant that Singapore is not a major player politically.
But this should not prevent us from engaging the region and exploring
new areas of cooperation for mutual benefit. Our companies should
also take a long-term view and continue to explore business opportunities
in the region.</p>

Latin America has grown by 135% since 2007, reaching $31.3 billion
in 2011. Politically, the region is home to three G-20 members:
Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. It is in this context that we have
made a decision to open an Embassy in Brazil, to broaden and deepen
our engagement with the region. The recent signing of the Partial
Visa Abolition Agreement with Brazil to facilitate business and
tourism flows is an example of our growing cooperation in this regard. </p>

Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, Sir, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Mr Ong Teng Koon and Mr Alex
Yam asked for updates on how MFA is addressing the increasing demand
by Singaporeans overseas for consular assistance, especially during
times of emergencies. One of MFA's key challenges is providing round-the-clock
consular assistance to Singaporeans across the world. Singaporeans
are not only travelling more, but they are also travelling to more
far-flung places, places where we cannot even pronounce their names,
as mentioned by Mr Alex Yam just now. As a result, there has been
a corresponding increase in requests for consular services and assistance.
Singaporeans' expectations of our consular services have also risen
over time. We take the safety and security of our Singaporeans abroad
very seriously. So, we encourage Singaporeans who travel overseas
to e-register with us so that MFA can render assistance in an emergency.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c306508e-95eb-4be8-a1f4-e9d190bb51e5">

47 Embassies and Consulates, and this is in addition to a network
of 27 Consulates run by Honorary Consuls who provide consular assistance
to Singaporeans
in locations where we do not have representation. Where we do not
have representation, there is also an agreement among ASEAN countries
to help each other's nationals when there is an emergency. In extreme
situations and cases, we also request for assistance from friendly
countries like the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2033</p>

have a Duty Office which is manned 24/7 to deal with any emergencies.
We constantly review our contingency plans to deal with potential flashpoints
where Singaporeans could be affected. We have also participated
in many inter-Ministry emergency preparedness exercises. If there
is a need, we will also deploy Consular Response Teams (CRT) to
help Singaporeans in crisis areas following natural and man-made
disasters. For example, CRTs were deployed to Japan after the Fukushima
nuclear incident, and also to Bangkok during the floods last year,
to assist affected Singaporeans in these countries.</p>

to improve the quality of our consular services. We encourage Singaporeans
who travel overseas to e-register with us so that we can contact
them in the event of an emergency. We also launched a Twitter feed
in late 2011 to provide timely information on consular matters,
such as our travel notices and advice. Some of our Missions are
also active on the social media which gives them another platform
to keep in closer touch with Singaporeans in the areas of their
coverage. We also plan to launch our own smartphone application
in the next few months. Besides providing early information to e-register,
the smartphone application will also assist Singaporeans to locate
the nearest Singapore overseas mission based on their current location.
This application also makes access to consular information and services
to Singaporeans on-the-go.</p>

will continue to do all we can to assist Singaporeans in distress,
there are also clear limits to what we can do. We have received
many requests for assistance and not every request can be fulfilled
or within reason to expect MFA to deal with. The decision to travel
is a responsibility of the travellers and they should do all they
can to secure their personal safety. Singaporeans, when abroad,
should be prepared to put up with some inconveniences, unavoidable
frustrations and the occasional delays, especially when dealing
with unfamiliar foreign customs, cultures, rules and regulations.
At the same time, they must also follow the rules and the laws of the
countries that they are in. </p>

its own rules and laws that have to be respected by other countries
as sovereign rights. We cannot interfere in the laws of other countries
in the way that we will never allow a foreign country or government
to interfere with the application of our own laws in Singapore.
Notwithstanding all these constraints and conditions, MFA will continue
to provide consular services to Singaporeans to the best of its
ability.</p>

us going strongly and heartily.</p>

of the sort of assistance that MFA provides continue to rise, sometimes
it can be to an unrealistic level. This has become more evident
in recent times, and it is not unique to Singapore. It happens to
many other countries. Many of these extraordinary, if I may say
so, sometimes unreasonable requests, stem from a misperception of
the sort of consular assistance that MFA can provide. We receive
many kinds of requests, and the MFA officers always try their best
to do what they can to help. But sometimes, some things are simply
just beyond our powers and abilities. Let me just share some interesting
stories.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6babf5aa-42e0-4fe9-bffd-0ac1c85c1ea4">
                  <a name="budget__id-6babf5aa-42e0-4fe9-bffd-0ac1c85c1ea4"><!--a--></a>On one occasion, MFA received
a complaint from a Singaporean who claimed that he was subjected
to racial discrimination overseas because he received a smaller
piece of KFC chicken, compared to what the locals had. He wanted
MFA to investigate this incident and seek justice in that foreign
country for the unfair treatment he claimed to have received. Sir,
to accede to such requests will require the conduct of delicate "chicken"
diplomacy with another foreign country. But, Sir, it would have
been very difficult anyway, because the evidence, the subject of
the complaint, had been consumed; so we could not follow up. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8e155cb8-faa3-4fbd-b270-32df34a32349">
                  <a name="budget__id-8e155cb8-faa3-4fbd-b270-32df34a32349"><!--a--></a>On another occasion, a
Singaporean insisted that it was MFA's responsibility to retrieve
a kitchen appliance he left behind in a foreign country because
he had no money to pay for the excess baggage. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-261df8d4-4346-4ded-8f91-73df09ed258f">
                  <a name="budget__id-261df8d4-4346-4ded-8f91-73df09ed258f"><!--a--></a>Sir, there also many other
equally interesting stories and requests for consular services that
have been put forth to MFA. MFA's consular roles and responsibilities
in a country are strictly governed by the Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations. Singaporeans must realise that there is a cost when we
deal with such requests. It diverts our limited resources from dealing
with many other cases where we can and we should help Singaporeans
in real distress and where we are often really their only support
in a foreign land. So, we should focus our energy and attention
to render the much
required assistance to people who are in real distress and we are

Singaporeans, when abroad, also have to be prepared to put up with

MFA can do little in such instances. We cannot compel a foreign

                  </span>: Sir, the
vision of ASEAN Community 2015 in the economic, social and cultural
aspects requires greater connectivity, both physical as well as
people-to-people, and a greater understanding of ASEAN within the
countries. Primarily, a lot of people will start taking notice of
it if they see each other much more and there is greater physical
connectivity, and also if it increases trade and investment flows.
So, it has both direct tangible economic connotations and broader
intangible cultural and social connotations to try and create a
community that is bonded together, not just by economics but also
social and cultural value, and we are trying to increase it. It
is going to take a lot of effort. Simple things − if we can have,
say, very good rail, air, sea and road connections all across ASEAN,
it makes a big difference. I can go on for a long time on the many
different aspects of the ASEAN vision, but I just use these as an
illustration. </p>

Sir, one clarification. I would like to know from MFA what specific
assistance will be given to Singaporeans when a person passes away in
a foreign country
and they want to bring the body back to Singapore. For instance,
if a person who is working or travelling in China passed away and
the body is lying somewhere. I understand they usually face quite
a lot of difficulty because of documentation and all that. So, I
would like to know how, specifically, MFA would facilitate and help
them to bring the body back.</p>

                  </span>: I thank
Mr Low for his question. This arises quite a number of times in
China and elsewhere. There are a number of different aspects to
it. The first is the clearance from the local authorities, and their
own laws may require investigations as to the circumstances of the
death, for example, and sometimes bringing back the body may not
be possible immediately because of evidentiary and other legal requirements.
And then there are the practical aspects of getting the body over
through the appropriate transport channels.</p>

is contacted, is to then liaise with the local authorities – I am giving
you a generalised situation. Of course, it can vary from situation
to situation depending on whether we have people there, but our
approach is to do everything we can to try and help in such a situation.
First, to liaise with the Singaporean next-of-kin, notify them,
give them the data, help them access the place where the body is,
whether it is a hospital or some other place, and also liaise with
the local authorities to try and effect the speedy clearance and
then help the family in terms of trying to bring the body back by
liaising with the necessary authorities again in terms of transport.
Those are the kinds of things that we do.</p>

has a central theme of inclusiveness. Many Members in the House
have spoken about what that means – helping the elderly, helping
low-income families, Singaporeans with disabilities. One other group
which should not be forgotten are those who require expert advice
to navigate our laws and legal procedures so as to ensure that their
rights are protected and advanced but do not have the means to pay for
it. In criminal proceedings, life and liberty may be at stake. We
have done much to simplify our laws to make them more friendly and
less tied to the formal and rigid processes of the days gone by.
We have gone to the extent of substituting technical and even Latin
phrases with modern everyday language so that our laws are more
intuitive and can be better understood. But the law and its workings
remain a mystery to most. Most are intimidated by it and would prefer
to avoid the legal process even if it can help them.</p>

to justice involves being able to access the court and judicial remedies,
as well as legal representation. Legal representation is vital,
particularly because of the adversarial nature of our legal system
that is structured for and by the legally educated. While a person
is entitled to represent himself in court, the truth of the matter
is that most litigants in person will have a hard time knowing what
to do and understanding what is going on. And so, hiring a lawyer
becomes a necessity, but that is difficult for many as professional
legal fees and even the routine disbursements you have to incur
are not low.</p>

cannot afford legal representation, we need to have a ready pool
of lawyers who will act for free or at substantially reduced fees.
That brings me to one Latin term, which remains with us because
it has been woven into our language: <em class="ph i">pro bono publico</em> or <em class="ph i">pro
bono </em>for short, which means "for the public good". <em class="ph i">Pro bono </em>work
should remain at the forefront of the legal profession, as we must
never forget that the practice of law is a noble calling and is
ultimately for the service of the public good. It should be the
aim of every self-respecting legal system to ensure that access
to justice is not obstructed by the individual's pecuniary circumstances.</p>

to provide legal help to individuals who cannot afford it, such
as the Legal Aid Bureau and the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. Many
lawyers provide free legal clinics at community centres, religious
institutions and other organisations every week. Some firms even
offer <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> services but, save for few exceptions, these are
usually left to the individual lawyers to participate in and are
not structured. For a lawyer, particularly a junior one who is under
pressure to meet the demands of the court, the client, his senior
partner and that "master" known as billable hours, <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work
may be a luxury he can ill afford and cannot commit to on a regular
basis. As a result, <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work is still considered an
exception rather than the norm in our legal system. However, I strongly
believe that there is a great untapped potential in the legal profession
to offer such services.</p>

to do <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work and give back to the community. What they
need is a system or structure, within the profession and, particularly,
within their own firms, to facilitate this and recognise their contributions.
In the opening of the Legal Year, the honourable Chief Justice proposed
that firms could encourage <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work by crediting such
work with a notional income based on what they would have earned for
the firm at their normal charge-out rates. This would help reduce
the pressure on lawyers who turn away <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work and will
focus the effort on the firm and not just as individuals. I believe
that this is a sound step forward and should be encouraged.</p>

that lawyers should be mandated to complete a minimum number of <em class="ph i">pro

I understand mandatory rules make it more convenient and efficient
to implement a <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> system, but I would prefer that such
initiatives be voluntary and driven from the ground by the lawyers and the law firms
because they see a need for this and the good it will do. Every
single lawyer must be imbued with the mindset that each has a role
to play – from junior lawyer to senior lawyer and from every field
of practice. Making it compulsory detracts from the spirit in which
this help should be offered. But the Government can help to make
this a reality. It should work towards providing a framework that
will allow lawyers to offer <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> services and get recognition
without being saddled with copious paperwork or heavy administrative
costs. For example, <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work should only benefit those
who need financial assistance. However, it would be onerous for
lawyers and law firms to administer means-testing. If, for example,
there is a registry which can certify individuals who qualify for <em class="ph i">pro
bono</em> assistance, lawyers can take on these cases with the knowledge
that their goodwill is being extended to the right recipients.</p>

help in other ways. For example, cases which have been certified <em class="ph i">pro
bono</em> should enjoy discounted filing fees and shorter waiting
times for lawyers so that the time they can devote to billable work
will not be too compromised. Could the Government share its plans
on promoting <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work and, in particular, how it can
reduce the disincentives for lawyers to participate in such work?</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-e0c31cac-4ca1-45dd-b327-2d46394a1f45"><!--a--></a>On a related note, many
cases which would qualify for <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work will be in the domestic
practices in criminal and family law. During the debate on the amendments
to the LPA, I spoke of the danger of how such practices are in danger
of hollowing out as more law graduates turn to more lucrative and
sexier corporate and arbitration. We need to ensure that there are
sufficient lawyers in the system to practise in these domestic areas.
One source of lawyers would be graduates from non-recognised universities
as well as those with external law degrees. Some of them have switched
careers midway. They, too, have dreams of practising law and have
made considerable efforts and incurred huge sums to obtain a law
degree. We should not deny them the opportunity to practise simply
because of the school they went to. If the concern is to ensure
those who practise law are of sufficient calibre, we can address
that by making the Practice Law Course rigorous enough to ensure
that only those of the right quality will be called to the Bar.
In other words, we set the standards for admission and not rely
on someone else's examinations. I hope the Government will consider
this suggestion. I would also be grateful if the Government could
share what steps it will take to ensure that there are sufficient
numbers of practising lawyers in Singapore.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, more than 50 years ago, in April 1956, when the Legal Aid and
Advice Bill was first introduced, its aim was stated to be to make
legal aid and advice in the colony more readily available to persons
of limited means. That mission of a legal aid bureau remains valid
today except that the absolute definition of "limited means" must
be considered in the context of changing income levels. Applicants
for legal aid have to undergo means testing before such aid is granted. The
means criteria has got two components, both of which must be satisfied independently.
An applicant's disposable income which is income in the past 12
months before the date of application, after deducting prescribed
allowances, must not exceed $10,000. In addition, as a separate
head, the disposable capital after relevant allowances must also
not exceed $10,000.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2039</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ac4d9da7-76dc-412d-aca4-6b7d70f290a8">
                  <a name="budget__id-ac4d9da7-76dc-412d-aca4-6b7d70f290a8"><!--a--></a> Sir, I hope the Minister can consider
a review of the means criteria of both respects. First, the disposable
capital criteria. This is meant to exclude persons who have significant
capital assets, such as motor vehicle or private property. Anecdotally,
there have been instances where applications have been rejected
where the disposable capital exceeds $10,000 on account of the surrender
value of life insurance policies. Sir, the surrender value of $10,000
is not very high and there is a growing number in our population
who own life insurance policies. More importantly, a legal aid applicant, unlike
for a motorcar or property, should not be expected to cash out on
life insurance policies to fund his legal expenditure. Sir, I hope
the Minister can consider raising the disposable capital when it
comes to surrender value for life insurance policies.</p>

criteria. Sir, the last time a review was done, it was in 2007.
By way of illustration, the median household income for all residents
and the average monthly household income from work of residents
have risen about 35%-40% in that period. Whilst figures do not tell
us everything, what it does tell us is that the means criteria should
be regularly and constantly revised to keep pace with the changing
income levels. Sir, in that regard, would the Minister also consider
reviewing the relevant disposable income levels as a means criteria
testing?</p>

Sir, the Court of Appeal judgement in <em class="ph i">Muhammad bin Kadar </em>
                  <em class="ph i">v
PP</em> (2011) 3SRL 1205 was a welcome breakthrough in our journey
towards a more balanced criminal process. The judges squarely addressed
an issue I had first canvassed five years ago at MINLAW COS which
fell on deaf ears then. Due to the vast State powers in investigations
and gathering evidence, the prosecution should rightly be under
a duty to disclose to the defence before trial relevant evidence
gathered even if the prosecution does not intend to use it, especially
if it is helpful to the defence. After the judgement, the prosecution
got worried and took out an application to clarify its scope, in
particular, whether the prosecution was under a duty to go through
all the evidence gathered by investigators in order to disclose
it. The Court of Appeal clarified that it was not under such a duty
and needed only to disclose evidence which the prosecution was itself
aware of. This, unfortunately, may give rise to some potential for miscarriages
of justice if the processes between the police and the prosecution
are not tightened up.</p>

Sir, currently, external law degrees are not recognised for admission
to the Singapore Bar. This was based on recommendations in 1993
by the First Committee on the Supply of Lawyers, as part of broader
measures to restrict the supply of lawyers and enhance the quality
of the legal service in Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9b2dd648-8b29-4754-8226-3427110ed718">

the Committee took into consideration the comparative entry requirement,
time taken to complete the degree, class supervision and interaction
time as well as access to resources of external and full-time degrees. Nevertheless,
the Committee recognised that there could be outstanding external degree
students who could make a valuable contribution to Singapore's legal
services sector, thus individuals can seek an exemption from the
Minister for Law to be granted in his discretion. External law degrees
are so called, as they involve study outside where the university
offering the course is based. External law studies may be on a part-time or
full-time basis. Part-time study is particularly suited to students
who wish to study for a law degree but need to continue working
in their full-time jobs, say, as police officers, accountants, legal
secretaries or paralegals in law firms. </p>

Budget is on increasing productivity. We are investing significantly
in continuing education and training to help our workers develop
new skills and expertise and increase their versatility. In view
of the above, it may be timely to ask whether the existing rules
may be changed or discretion exercised in such a way to allow more
external law degree holders to take the Bar examination and undergo relevant
legal training at law firms for admission to the Bar, like many
of their counterparts holding full-time law degrees. </p>

holders are mature students who may have first degrees in other
disciplines or work experience in other fields; who for various
reasons, often financial, have taken to the study of law only late
in life. The value of such cross-training, such work experience
and industry knowledge, such versatility, is increasingly recognised
and may be helpful and desirable to future clients, provided that
the external law degree holder is admitted to practise. </p>

the First Committee made its recommendations almost 20 years ago.
In fact, the Third Committee on the Supply of Lawyers has since recommended
measures that will, in effect, increase the number of practising
lawyers in Singapore to ensure Singapore's growth as a leading provider
of legal services. In these 20 years, factors such as technological
changes affecting distance learning may also have addressed in part
some of the concerns expressed by the First Committee, such as those
over class supervision and interaction time, and access to resources
for external law students. </p>

degree holder who is granted exemption by the Minister, she would
only be admitted to practise after she has passed the Bar examination
and undergone relevant legal training at a law firm, which ought
to afford us reasonable assurance as to her ability to practise
law. I believe it is timely for us to consider or reconsider if
more, like her, should be given that chance. </p>

was charged with a capital drug offence, while his co-accused was

it was noteworthy that there were two relatively clear public camps

the gravity of the punishment prescribed for drug offences that

a non-capital offence for the same transaction? In addition, taking
public interest into account, would not disclosure by the Attorney-General
also engender greater trust in the legal system, and in the office

Sir, during the Debate on the President's Address last year, I asked
the Ministry of Law to further enhance access to justice for the
man-in-the-street by simplifying legal processes at the common interface
between community and the law. This will make it easier for laypersons
to navigate the law, particularly if they fall outside the Legal
Aid Bureau's means test, but who still find it expensive to engage
a lawyer. This can be an area for the Law Reform Committee to regularly
look into.</p>

Let us just take a look at the process for the application for probate

a supporting affidavit; (d) two copies of the Schedule of Assets;
(e) an Administration Oath; (f) certified true copies of the death

be extracted through a Request to Extract Grant of Probate or Letter
of Administration and the filing of the Administration Bond by sureties. The person
extracting the grant must also check to ensure there are no caveats in
force against the estate.</p>

and Administration is to ensure propriety in the handling of a person's
estate. Estate duty is no longer payable. While the process is relatively
easy for lawyers, it is not the case for the man-in-the-street,
who will at some point in time need to engage in this process. I
also hope Ministry of Law will consider amending the law to allow
the Public Trustee to help administer small estates below $50,000
which are non-contentious but which involve the Will. These are
usually simple estates. I urge the Ministry of Law to look at these
and other procedures for review. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
this is the cut on Internet Regulation. I refer to the Minister's
comments made in early January at the launch of "The Mortal Enemy",
the winning trailer for The Originals Get Reel Contest organised
by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), where it
was revealed that the Government is in discussion with the Motion
Pictures Association of America (MPAA) over the issue of piracy
and intellectual property protection. </p>

the Government's concerns were similar to the concerns raised by
some United States lawmakers, who have sought to pursue the now
apparently derailed legislative proposals in the United States for
legislation known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect
Intellectual Property Act (PIPA).</p>

main purposes of these Bills was to make it harder for sites €” especially
those located outside the United States €” to sell or distribute
pirated copyrighted material, such as movies and music, as well
as physical goods, such as counterfeit purses and watches. On the
one hand, the importance of protecting intellectual property is
self-evident. However, the worry is that such a move will introduce
many unwanted consequences, such as the stifling of legitimate expression
of free speech. One of the biggest fears is that such legislation
can be abused and could lead to censorship, on the pretext of protecting
intellectual property and preventing online piracy.</p>

Mortal Enemy and Minister's remarks on the same, SOPA and PIPA are
apparently dead in the water in the US, as the co-sponsors of the
legislation have withdrawn the Bill, ostensibly to seek more agreement
on the matter. On its part, the Obama administration has said that
it would not support any legislation that reduces freedom of expression,
increases cyber-security risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative
global Internet even as it recognises the serious problems posed
by online piracy. Can the Minister please clarify what stage of
talks the Government is at with the Motion Pictures Association
of America (MPAA), and what plans it currently has for similar legislation
in Singapore?</p>

Sir, this year's Budget encourages SMEs to find new ways to increase
performance and productivity. Innovation is about all the development of
new ideas to reap better economic performance. New inventions and
innovative ideas can
be harnessed and put to use in improving the operations of a business
or it can also be exploited by the innovator by selling the idea
or invention, or by licensing it to or managing it for third parties.</p>

it is vital that the IP regime and environment of Singapore be robust
and accessible. There are two aspects to this. The first is the
enhancement of Singapore as a regional or even a global hub for
IP services, much in the same way that the Government has successfully
developed Singapore as a leading arbitration hub. We should build
our infrastructure and offer tax and other incentives for global
MNCs to come to Singapore to develop, manufacture and exploit their
patents here.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5d2b7daf-83ef-42af-9a83-bc8043cba9c9">
                  <a name="budget__id-5d2b7daf-83ef-42af-9a83-bc8043cba9c9"><!--a--></a>In the last 10 years,
Singapore's IP landscape has seen much progress. But the need continues
to grow. Between 2006 and 2011, the number of patent applications
by local enterprises in Singapore almost doubled. And these numbers
reflect the global trend. In China, for example, patent filings
have increased significantly in the last decade and the Chinese
government has been aggressively building its IP marketplace, with
IP exchanges being set up providing a suite of services, such as
matching, valuation services and, generally, facilitating IP transactions. </p>

to monetise their IP assets. Singapore, with its complementary legal
and financial services infrastructure, can also prosper in this
space. Will the Minister share his plans for enhancing Singapore
as an IT hub and how the services which make up the entire IP ecosystem
in Singapore can be enhanced? Of particular importance will be how
local SMEs can stand to benefit from such enhancements. It appears
that some SMEs do not fully exploit their IP rights due to lack
of awareness or perhaps because their existing environment is not
sufficiently conducive. Will the Minister be able to address this
as well? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-66b1bbef-48aa-41b3-8e36-ca91b4ca1a51">
                  <a name="budget__id-66b1bbef-48aa-41b3-8e36-ca91b4ca1a51"><!--a--></a>The second aspect is to
build a strong culture and system for the protection and enforcement
of IP rights and resolving conflicts in an efficacious manner. This
is crucial to fostering intervention and innovation. Without appropriate
protection being given to businesses, it is unlikely that businesses,
both local and global, will be incentivised to innovate and operate
within the fields in Singapore. May I, therefore, ask the Minister what
plans he has in ensuring a stronger, more robust IP regime for the
recognition and protection of IP rights.</p>

Thank you, Sir. The protection of IP rights is important to many
industries, including media, technology, entertainment and pharmaceuticals.
Asia is an increasingly important hub for many of these and Singapore,
in particular, is getting stronger in biotechnology. One important
aspect of growing an IP hub is the protection of IP rights. Before
continuing on this particular aspect, I should probably declare
my interest as a lawyer practising at Norton Rose (Asia).</p>

high profile IP litigations took place in the western markets. Examples
would include litigations involving HTC, Samsung, LG, Sony and so
on. Domestically, in recent years, we have seen a number of IP-related
disputes across a variety of sectors, including media, technology
and pharmaceuticals. Might we expect more of such cases in Singapore?
IP disputes, in particular, are known to be highly complex, requiring
an intricate understanding of law, technology and business practices. As markets
develop and sophisticated IP licensing deals become more common,
we might find increasingly complicated IP disputes being brought
before the courts. How can we ensure that Singapore's capacity to
deliver efficient and effective dispute resolution for such cases
is available? And this is particularly because of the different
skills involved; it is not necessarily purely legal skills. </p>

significant progress in establishing ourselves as the key arbitration

would also be playing a greater role in catering for IP alternative

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Chen Show Mao</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, when
the Moneylenders Act was re-enacted in 2008, its stated objectives
were to facilitate moneylending in the modern credit economy and
to strike a proper balance between regulating licensed moneylenders
and safeguarding the interest of borrowers. In liberalising the
market, many of the controls under the old Act were relaxed. Importantly,
interest rate caps were removed except for 18% for unsecured and
12% for secured loans of up to $3,000 granted to low-income borrowers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f19b731a-128c-4130-8518-f56f28d9c890">

the Act took effect, the results of that liberalisation appeared
to be trending clear. The number of licensed moneylenders increased
from 173 in 2008 to 249 in 2011. The press reported that interest
rates are as high as 240% a year and effective rates could be even
higher. And even though some interest rate ceilings are in place,
the press reported that debtors are often subjected to additional
high charges under permitted fees. These include fees for loan administration
and late payment charges. According to press reports, the Registry
of Moneylenders received 67 complaints in 2010, up from 16 the year
before. Most complaints were about high interest rates, strong-arm
debt collection methods and unfair loan terms and conditions.</p>

that more action needs to be taken. It has implemented new rules
to regulate the advertising and other activities of licensed moneylenders.
It has imposed a fit and proper test and written test. There is
now a Bill before Parliament to increase some enforcement powers.
In addition to these measures, would the Government consider additional
substantive regulations of the interest rates and fees charged by
the moneylenders? Sir, the high interest rates and fees and the number
of complaints reported seem to suggest that this segment of the
credit market, for whatever reason, is not functioning well to deliver

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, Sir, the moneylending business in Singapore affects
a vulnerable segment of our society. More so, the family members
of the borrowers are affected and bear the brunt of the methods
of these lenders, licensed or otherwise.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0ce810ec-07c2-4d3e-a15f-30a139226bea">
                  <a name="budget__id-0ce810ec-07c2-4d3e-a15f-30a139226bea"><!--a--></a>We need to keep in view
and regularly update the enforcement methods and even more stringent
legislation to ensure that the interests of this segment of Singaporeans are
adequately protected.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4378e3e0-bcfc-4cf4-9972-6fbcdc0a6ff1">
                  <a name="budget__id-4378e3e0-bcfc-4cf4-9972-6fbcdc0a6ff1"><!--a--></a>The moneylending industry,
Sir, is a lucrative one. It has grown from 2007 to 2011 by 60%,
from 169 to 267. The attraction of this business has prompted these
operators to set up branches in neighbouring countries. Licensed
or not, their business model evolves and changes and we must keep
up with their practices.</p>

that the applicants and those approved are closely monitored and
not allow them to use the Moneylenders Act as a Trojan horse. Some
ground response
has fed back that the licensed moneylenders' methods in collection management
are no different from the "<em class="ph i">Ah Longs</em>"or illegal moneylenders,
known as loansharks. We need, therefore, to have better control,
audit the methods and ensure compliance with the Act, much like
the financial institutions registered with MAS are subjected to.
Licensed moneylenders, on top of their interest rates, will have
other fees and charges snowballing to as high as 260%, even higher
than what Mr Chairman was talking about – 260% of the borrowed sum.
This is no different from the unlicensed loansharks, as reported
in the media. Moneylenders are creative in charging all sorts of miscellaneous
fees and administration costs to the borrower.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, an
inclusive society is one where there is tolerance, respect and mutual
understanding. Yet, when people live cheek-by-jowl in highly urban Singapore,
disputes among neighbours are almost inevitable. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7475cc96-94a8-4a0b-a9c7-db11b0f956de">
                  <a name="budget__id-7475cc96-94a8-4a0b-a9c7-db11b0f956de"><!--a--></a>The number of mediations
conducted by the Community Mediation Centres (CMCs) has generally
been rising over the years. It is very telling that 75% of all disputes mediated
by CMCs involve neighbourly disputes. The next highest, 12%, are
between family members. More than 60% of disputes involve people
below the age of 50. Some of these disputes have hit the headlines.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-70ad87b7-1964-49f5-a994-57b037a6e329">

that take place all over the island are no less serious. In the last
month alone, I had been asked to intervene in three neighbour disputes,
all of which already involved the police. One pair of neighbours
came last night and sought my assistance. All these cases involved
young or middle-aged families.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3abd56b0-cee2-426b-bca6-ed36386c0bef">
                  <a name="budget__id-3abd56b0-cee2-426b-bca6-ed36386c0bef"><!--a--></a>While as a matter of principle,
mediation should be a voluntary process conducted in the spirit
of conciliation and give-and-take, I feel that there are some instances
where disputes may have become so serious that a far more robust
approach may be warranted. This could involve making attendance
at mediation sessions mandatory if assessed to be sufficiently serious
and are referred by certain agencies, such as the Police or the
CDCs. This is far better than letting the matter escalate to the
Courts, or worse, letting the feuding parties take things into their
own hands. There may also be some value in giving the Community
Mediation Centres legal teeth to require neighbours to keep the
peace. For example, the Community Mediation Centres Act can contain
powers similar to those found in the CPC to require warring parties
who have reached a settlement at the CMC to sign a bond to keep
the peace. I hope MinLaw will study these ideas for the future.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, I thank all the Members who have spoken. I will first deal
with the points made by Messrs Edwin Tong, Vikram Nair and Pritam
Singh on IP.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c2bae3b3-e582-45f2-bfd1-581b54b0de79">
                  <a name="budget__id-c2bae3b3-e582-45f2-bfd1-581b54b0de79"><!--a--></a>Sir, IP has become an
important part of the global economy. The value of intangible assets
for S&amp;P 500 companies, of which IP is a major component, is
about 80%. Thirty years
ago, it was just 17%. Over the last decade, global patent and trademark
filings have increased by over 40%. Worldwide royalty and licensing
revenue has more than doubled, to over US$200 billion. These trends
will continue. Singapore must try and ride on this trend. Our strengths
are a well-developed legal and financial system, and a workforce
that is comfortable with science and technology. At the same time,
our challenge is that we have a small domestic market which faces
difficulties in creating the marketplace and generating the demand
for IP services. Our ambition is to make Singapore the Asian IP
Hub. We have progressed well so far. Since 2006, Singapore's IP regime
has been consistently ranked amongst the best in the world by the
World Economic Forum as well as the IMD.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2047</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-052d64cf-bb6f-4c79-a746-625aedaee6b7">
                  <a name="budget__id-052d64cf-bb6f-4c79-a746-625aedaee6b7"><!--a--></a>We need to progress further.
We will convene an IP Steering Committee to study and develop the
IP Hub Masterplan. Members of the Committee will be from both the
private and public sectors. The Committee will be chaired by Mr
Teo Ming Kian, who was formerly Chairman EDB, Chairman of the then
National Science and Technology Board and Permanent Secretary (National
Research and Development). He is eminently qualified to lead the
committee. The committee will look into two key areas: (1) developing
a vibrant marketplace for IP transactions and commercialisation;
and (2) building world-class IP capabilities and infrastructure.</p>

develop a vibrant IP marketplace. The technology market is changing
rapidly and considerably. Consumer products combine IP in diverse
and complex ways. Some sources cite that a typical smartphone today
involves as many as 250,000 patent claims. Significant IP transactions
are required to achieve such aggregation. The Committee will recommend
strategies to: develop Singapore as the marketplace of choice to
transact IP; attract international firms and professionals who provide
IP transactional services, for example, licensing and brokerage;
and incentivise the creation, management and exploitation of IP
in Singapore. This will also benefit local companies which, as Mr
Edwin Tong points out, are creating more IP.</p>

build world-class IP capabilities and infrastructure. There are many
different aspects to it, including IP filing and protection. </p>

regime. At present, we adopt a self-assessment system, where patents
can be granted even if objections are raised in the examination
report. To enhance it, we should move to a positive grant system
where patents will be granted only if patentability requirements
are fully met first. This will increase confidence in the quality
of Singapore patents. </p>

search and examination capabilities for patent applications in niche
technology areas. Currently, search and examination work is outsourced.
We aim to develop world-class expertise to attract companies in
the region to have patents in niche areas examined in Singapore.</p>

the patent agent sector. There are about 100 Singapore-registered
patent agents in practice today. We want Singapore to be a key node
in global patent work. We aim to attract world-class patent firms
to operate here. We want to enable Singapore to service more of
the regional demand, and benefit local companies and research institutions
as well. We will provide better support to develop the local patent
agent profession.</p>

been that IP, including copyright, is a private right. Its enforcement
should be initiated by owners of those rights. Under our current
regime, copyright owners have the ability to take actions against
online copyright infringements. In recent years, owners of copyright
have indicated that digital piracy was increasingly taking place
online and that the traditional approach to address piracy would
no longer be sufficient for a number of reasons. Time does not permit
me to go into that.</p>

of online piracy in Singapore? Based on the data that rights holders
have shared with us, Singapore appears to have one of the highest
incidences of online piracy in the Asia-Pacific region. According
to various studies and inputs from rights holders, it has been estimated
that Singapore had over 300,000 incidences per month of illegal
downloading on average. It ranked the worst out of 15 countries
in the Asia-Pacific with 0.8 per capita incidences of infringement
per annum. In 2010, over 693,000 connections were detected in unauthorised
sharing of video games and work software on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks
through internet service providers (ISPs) located in Singapore.
Six out of the top hundred sites visited by Singapore internet users for
November 2011 host some copyright infringing content. Over 20% of
internet users in Singapore accessed selected file-sharing websites
at least once a month; and 3.7 million P2P downloads of US major
movies were initiated by Singapore users. </p>

possible consequences. Rights holders have stated that digital music
sales make up a large percentage of music producers' revenue. Online piracy,
if unchecked, could reduce the revenue. The Recording Industry Association
of Singapore (RIAS) has reported that physical sales have declined
from US$42.4 million to US$14.5 million in the decade leading up
to 2010, and were expected to fall further. However, unlike the
rest of Asia and the world, the decline in physical sales in Singapore has not been compensated
by a rise in digital sales. RIAS has warned that this, in turn, could
reduce the funding available for the development of new musical
talent in Singapore and stifle the growth of the creative industry. </p>

concerns raised that online piracy has contributed to providers
of legitimate online content staying away from Singapore. There

issue of the supply of lawyers. I think Mr <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Hri Kumar and Mr Chen Show Mao</span> made
some comments on this. It is important that we get this right to ensure
access to justice and in respect of our efforts to be a legal hub.
It involves both qualitative and quantitative aspects, and it is
something that we are continuously monitoring.</p>

that we recognise degrees from the two Singapore law schools, and
scheduled universities in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand
− they number 35. Many choose such avenues, and exemptions are also
granted to those who have studied in non-scheduled universities
on a case-by-case basis.</p>

external degrees has two aspects: (1) the degree itself; and (2) the
individual.</p>

this was first considered by the First Committee on the Supply of
Lawyers in 1993, headed by then Attorney-General (now Chief Justice)
with a Supreme Court Judge, Permanent Secretary (Law), Permanent Secretary
(Trade &amp; Industry), as well as the Deputy Vice Chancellor of
NUS (now Justice Tan Lee Meng), and the Dean of the NUS Faculty
of Law. They considered very carefully the comparative entry requirements
for such degree courses, the time taken to complete the degree,
the amount of class supervision and class interaction time and access
to resources. They concluded that they could not say, as a class,
that external law degrees were equal to full-time degrees, and that,
therefore, as a general policy, external law degrees have not been
recognised.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ef97d698-89da-4be1-8008-b35c0edb4a95">

nevertheless we recognise that individuals who hold an external
law degree can apply themselves diligently and prove themselves
in any field, and the policy takes that into account; individuals
who have substantial experience in the legal or law-related fields,
who have been validated by the market as it were, are granted exemptions.
Less than 30 have applied since 1994 and 11 of them have been granted
exemptions.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-f79a2d88-cfa3-4807-bab1-ba61c8fce2b9"><!--a--></a>We have also made changes
to allow more people to qualify. At the Third Committee on the Supply
of Lawyers' recommendation, we set up a second law school. The total number
of graduates increased from 250 to 370, which is quite significant.
The majority of that pioneer batch will be called to the Bar this
year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fab1dadb-6471-4aa6-85de-84ea11fc905c">
                  <a name="budget__id-fab1dadb-6471-4aa6-85de-84ea11fc905c"><!--a--></a>Since 2009, we have replaced
the one-year Diploma in Singapore Law course with an optional course
followed by the Part A Bar Examination, and relaxed criteria to
allow Second-Lower degree graduates from overseas universities to
qualify. About 600 Singaporean/Permanent Resident law graduates
from overseas universities have passed the Part A conversion examinations.
In 2011, 210 law graduates sat for Part A and 92% passed. We have
also replaced the post-graduate law course with the revamped Part
B examination that everyone sits for. </p>

is, and I agree with Mr Chen here, that the types of lawyers qualifying
to practise should be reviewed again, to deal with changing conditions.
For example, three factors (and he mentioned at least one of them):
(1) the aspirants have difficulties getting into our law schools;
(2) there is the cost of going overseas (we recognise that); and
(3) smaller law firms have difficulties in finding lawyers; and
I have mentioned that and one or two of the other factors a number
of times. </p>

these areas and see what can be done. So, I have recently convened
a Fourth Committee on the Supply of Lawyers to look into this and
other issues, because I think we need to re-look − not just external
law degrees but also the needs of the smaller law firms − how we
can get people who have the aspirations to become lawyers but cannot
afford to go overseas; what can we do about all of these, and how
can we do it in a rational manner so that we have lawyers who are
then able to use their skills in our marketplace. I think that is
important as well. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-eca7b85f-3125-40cf-9140-d0abdcef91e0">
                  <a name="budget__id-eca7b85f-3125-40cf-9140-d0abdcef91e0"><!--a--></a>So, in that context, I
have asked Judge of Appeal V K Rajah to head the Committee to look
into these issues. The Committee will consider how to augment the
talent pool for lawyers, including in domestic areas of law, for
example, criminal and family law, which we consider to be important
for access to justice. And they have been asked to consider possible adjustments
to current admissions policy, including the external law degrees policy. </p>

− I think Mr Kumar mentioned it, if I am not wrong − moving to a
model where a single Bar examination serves as the sole gatekeeper.
It is one of many possible models. There are other approaches that
can be considered. I do not want to pre-judge the Committee. Let
them do their work and come back, and we will report it in Parliament.</p>

administration of criminal justice. On prosecutorial discretion,
Mr Singh's point, we accept Article 35(8) of the Constitution vests prosecutorial
discretion in the Attorney-General. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1d808976-6e03-41c4-b817-08365427bba3">

the <em class="ph i">Ramalingam</em> case, has held that the prosecutorial power is
constitutionally co-equal to the judicial power, and the Court should
be slow to interfere with its exercise. And I think it is important
to see what the Court said in this context. In the Court's judgement,
at paragraphs 70 and 71, it says, "In this regard, the mere differentiation
of charges between co-offenders, even between those of equal guilt,
is not <em class="ph i">per se</em> sufficient to constitute <em class="ph i">prima facie</em> evidence
of bias or the taking into account of irrelevant considerations
that breaches Article 12(1). Differentiation between offenders of
equal guilt can be legitimately undertaken for many reasons and
based on the consideration of many factors." Paragraph 71: "...
given that there are many legitimate reasons for the prosecution
to differentiate between the charges brought against different offenders
involved in the same criminal enterprise, such differentiation <em class="ph i">per
se</em> does not necessarily mean that the prosecution has not given
unbiased consideration."</p>

Mr Singh is aware, went on to say that there are many good reasons
why differentiation may be necessary. It indicated some of those
good reasons, including the fact that there could have been intelligence
which the prosecution is not willing to share in the open. </p>

the system? I think we need to start with a context here − what
is the kind of criminal justice system that we want? We want a system
where the guilty are convicted, the innocent are acquitted and the
wider interests of society are protected, which include the protection
of society from those who could cause it harm. If it is clear that
public disclosure by the Attorney-General, of his reasons why differential treatment
has been given, will improve the criminal justice system, then it
is a no-brainer; we must make sure that the law requires such disclosures. </p>

that clear? The reality is that the position is not so clear. There are
trade-offs, as Members will know. What are the trade-offs here?
If the reasons for the underlying prosecutorial decisions are revealed,
it can compromise intelligence and other confidential sources that
inform such decisions, which, as I said earlier, the Court of Appeal
recognised. Let us not kid ourselves, you will have some criminals
who will try and work around the guidelines and game the system.
That is in the nature, not everyone, but there will be some people
who will do that. </p>

Singh is aware, there was a case where a person applied to court,
for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to disclose in advance,
the guidelines that would inform the DPP's decision whether an offence
which was going to be committed would be prosecuted. So, I am going
to do this, you tell me in advance − because you have published
the guidelines − whether I will be prosecuted when I do this. </p>

reasons are revealed, it can, of course, be a safeguard against the
discretion being exercised wrongly or maliciously by the Attorney-General.</p>

we have to ask ourselves is this: there are these two situations, the
risk of the prosecution acting wrongly, compared to the risks associated
with the compromise of intelligence and all the other attendant
risks if disclosure is made. Which is the more serious risk in the
context? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b19b24ba-ff41-415d-be16-f02f6c5a9cc0">

acting wrongly or maliciously is the lesser of the two risks. The
Attorney-General's Chambers has internal guidelines and layers of
review, and, in capital cases, the Attorney-General reviews the
facts himself. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bbc024a6-4d02-4ee7-bf00-1c93903884f6">

also held in <em class="ph i">Ramalingam</em> that if a prosecutorial decision
is untenable on its face, it must be explained, or else the Court
will infer that there is no good reason for it. </p>

layers of checks and, within this framework, we believe that a system
where the Attorney-General exercises his discretion without having
to make those reasons public is better for society. If we are convinced
of the opposite, I say to Members, unhesitatingly, that we will
change the law.</p>

Ms Sylvia Lim asked how the prosecution can work with the Police
to ensure comprehensive discovery of relevant evidence, in the light
of the Court of Appeal's judgement in the <em class="ph i">Kadar</em> case. I think
we accept – Ms Lim accepts – and everyone who has read the judgement
would accept, that the <em class="ph i">Kadar</em> case did not go into how the
Police and the prosecution should interact. That was stated clearly
in the supplementary judgment.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6f99de91-5a8b-47b5-9eaf-ee3b254a25b1">
                  <a name="budget__id-6f99de91-5a8b-47b5-9eaf-ee3b254a25b1"><!--a--></a>In practical terms, for
the Police, the function and duty of both the investigators and investigation
supervisors are that they need to go through the investigation papers
and ensure that all relevant information is presented to the prosecutor.
And the prosecution is under a duty to disclose relevant, credible,
unused material in its possession to the accused, and that duty
has been given statutory form through the CPC 2010, which we took
through this House. And the prosecution has to work closely with
the investigating officers to assess evidence in this regard. Any
doubts in a case will be referred by the prosecutor or the investigating
officer to their respective superiors, who will give guidance on
the proper practice. </p>

the Attorney-General's Chambers has also engaged the Law Society

and working out what the Bar will consider acceptable and appropriate.
Both the AGC and the defence bar are attuned to the same objectives

years ago, she made some suggestions which fell on deaf ears. I
am not sure I was in the House five years ago listening to her,
being a backbencher then. I think what needs to be recognised in
context is that the CPC and Penal Code have been amended substantively
since then. Discovery by the prosecution and the defence, which
are major steps, was included in the CPC which we took through the
House, and the Penal Code which was taken through by my predecessor.
Before we amended the CPC to substantively enhance the rights of
the accused, we consulted extensively, including with Ms Lim, who
made various suggestions. It was a long period of consultation.</p>

law evolved, when we made the amendments and thereafter, I have
more than once made clear in this House about the duties of the
prosecution in respect of the evidence that they have, which is
that the fundamental duty of any lawyer, whether prosecutor or defence,
is to be honest with the Court. Honesty requires you to disclose
all relevant evidence, whether or not it is in the Statute, and
if you withhold credible evidence, that is misconduct. I took pains
to make that clear, and the Court of Appeal referred to that statement
I made here in Parliament in making its decision; it adopted that
statement as the statement of principle in its decision in <em class="ph i">Kadar</em>.
So, when Ms Lim talks about a breakthrough in <em class="ph i">Kadar</em>, the
Court of Appeal was applying the law that we discussed in this House. </p>

question as best as I can from the Ministry of Law's perspective.
As for the detailed duties of the Police and what they may or may
not do, it is something that I am in no position to answer because
that is a Ministry of Home Affairs policy issue. But I can assure
Ms Lim that in our consultations with MHA on various issues, including
this, we have been assured, and I have set out for Ms Lim and Members,
of the kind of processes that are now in place. </p>

concern on simplifying the process for probate and letters of administration.
We intend to review and update the Probate and Administration Act,
together with the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office. We will look at how we can
refine the criteria and threshold of estate cases that can be administered
by the Public Trustee, and how we can simplify the existing procedure.
The Courts are supportive of all of these and we are working with
them closely.</p>

to share some measures that we have been exploring with regard to
fostering more <em class="ph i">pro bono </em>work. Some measures which we have
considered include, first, making <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work a mandatory
component of legal education. The Singapore Institute of Legal Education
(SILE) will work with the two law schools to put this in place in
time for the next academic year. This will help foster the <em class="ph i">pro
bono</em> spirit in law students at an early stage as well as help
them gain practical legal skills outside of the classroom. </p>

with SILE how lawyers who do <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work can be better recognised.
We are also increasing the number of internship places in the Legal
Aid Bureau (LAB) to support the implementation of <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> as
a mandatory component of legal education.</p>

the pool of Assigned Solicitors in LAB. In 2011, 50 new lawyers
joined the pool. In the past, the volunteers tended to be from the
smaller firms, and we are glad to note that a good number of the
new volunteer assigned solicitors are coming from the large and
medium-sized firms.</p>

that the Law Society is expanding and enhancing its <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> programmes.
It is working on an online portal to match volunteers with <em class="ph i">pro bono</em>opportunities,
developing a "Pro Bono Friendly" certification scheme for law practices,
and these schemes, together with existing schemes such as the Community Legal
Clinics and also those run by LAB, will provide structured opportunities
for lawyers and law firms to do <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work. The Ministry
of Law has been making financial contributions to the Law Society's
Pro Bono Services Office (PBSO). We are reviewing our contribution
to PBSO to enable it to do more. </p>

the Legal Aid Steering Committee (LASC) chaired by former Senior
Minister of State for Law Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee. A wider cross-section of
the legal community, including the judiciary, academia and practitioners,

community together in the Legal Aid Steering Committee to set the
strategic direction for <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> efforts and rally the legal community to
do more <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work. Together, we hope these initiatives
will help foster a greater spirit of giving within the legal profession

Sylvia Lim and Mr Vikram Nair expressed concerns on the administration
of bankruptcy cases. Currently, the Insolvency and Public Trustee's
Office (IPTO) administers over 25,000 bankruptcy estates. IPTO's
staffing in its Individual Insolvency Division has been increased
from 37 posts in 2009 to 74 now. IPTO is aware of the concerns such
as those raised by Ms Lim and Mr Nair. We will continue to review the
need for additional resources, always bearing in mind the cost to
the public purse.</p>

new ways to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of its processes.
For example, in 2011, IPTO enhanced its bankruptcy case management system
and introduced an electronic document management system, which digitises and
routes public correspondence electronically to case officers, and
facilitates monitoring by management. Later this month, IPTO will
be launching an enhanced online platform for bankrupts and creditors
to access case information, for example, claims made, and the amount
available in the bankruptcy estate. Bankrupts can check the submission
deadline for their Income and Expenditure Statements, and they can
also check the status of their applications to travel overseas,
manage businesses, or act as a company director. This service will
be provided to bankrupts free of charge.</p>

Repayment Scheme (DRS) may channel resources away from bankruptcy
administration. As I shared with the House last month, the DRS is
to allow debtors with regular incomes and debts not exceeding $100,000,
an opportunity to avoid bankruptcy. This is part of IPTO's work.
Whether it is in administering bankruptcy cases or administering
the DRS, IPTO will continue to look for efficiency gains in their
operations. </p>

IPTO does and will continue to take into account the bankrupt's
inability to earn a living as a result of factors such as old age
or ill health when evaluating the case for discharge. Other factors
considered include the bankrupt's conduct during bankruptcy, and
the amount of contributions he has made to his bankruptcy estate.</p>

Both Mr Arthur Fong and Mr Chen Show Mao have spoken on the regulation
of moneylenders and moneylending. We share their concerns, particularly
over protecting the interests of borrowers. </p>

our approach in this area. There will always be people in need of
credit and are unable to borrow from banks. Moneylenders meet this
need. If we completely abolish the industry, it will only be driven
underground, and borrowers will have no legal protection and will
be at the mercy of loansharks. </p>

the industry to operate, but regulate it to give protection to borrowers,
particularly those with lower incomes. What we have done in 2011
include the following: first, requiring moneylending licence applicants
to pass a test on the Moneylending Act and Rules; we have also tightened
the rules on moneylenders' business conduct − for instance, they
may not obtain borrowers' SingPass, bank account and other passwords.

put in place new rules relating to moneylending advertisements.
Recently, the Chinese press reported that new restrictions on advertisements
by licensed moneylenders have led to a proliferation of advertisements
by unlicensed moneylenders, which were misleading the public into
believing that they were legal. Let me reiterate that the purpose
of the rules is to prevent moneylending companies from using advertisements
to stimulate excessive demand for loans by the public. In the past, we
permitted licensed moneylenders to advertise in a variety of media,
to allow the borrowers to compare terms across different moneylenders.
However, we noticed that excessive advertising could stimulate excessive
demand for loans amongst those who did not truly require them, resulting
in unnecessary debt. Furthermore, borrowers needed to check the
Registry of Moneylenders' website to determine whether the advertisements
were being put out by licensed or unlicensed moneylenders.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2688c27e-caac-4b1d-924e-0dd68e80b62e">
                  <a name="budget__id-2688c27e-caac-4b1d-924e-0dd68e80b62e"><!--a--></a>We therefore put in new
rules: if moneylending companies wish to advertise, they can only
do so through business and consumer directories of services, their
own websites, and through advertisements at their premises. They
are not disallowed from advertising; they are only disallowed from
unsolicited advertising. The new rules help the public differentiate
between licensed and unlicensed moneylenders. Now the public no
longer need to verify if the flyers, SMSes, emails or other forms
of advertisements they received are from licensed moneylenders because
they can be sure that all such activities are not allowed. Such
advertisements would either be from licensed moneylenders operating
in violation of our rules, or loansharks. Errant licensed moneylenders
would be investigated by the Registry and loansharks would be investigated
by the Police. We urge the public to avoid taking loans from them.
We will continue to spread the message to let the public understand
such unsolicited advertisement is illegal. </p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>We have also
been studying how to further strengthen our regulatory framework,
and will be rolling out new measures to strengthen the regulation
of the industry and the protection of borrowers. We will be amending
the Moneylenders Act to strengthen the enforcement powers of the
Registry of Moneylenders; safeguard borrowers' information from
unlicensed moneylenders; and clarify the provisions governing the
moneylenders' place of business.</p>

for some time changes to the Moneylenders Rules to further strengthen
protection of borrowers, and these would address the concerns raised
by Mr Fong and Mr Chen. The directions that we are considering include: requiring
the use of Effective Interest Rate instead of Nominal Interest Rate;
extending existing caps on interest rate to protect a larger range
of borrowers; abolishing non-contingent fees which jack up the true
cost of borrowing; and abolishing all exceptions to the limit on
the amount of unsecured credit that a borrower can obtain, to close loopholes
that could lead to excessive debt.</p>

we will be doing more. We are currently in discussions with frontline
public agencies, for instance, the HDB, on several issues such as
compelling the use of mediation for disputes in their purview and enforcing
mediation agreements between parties. Mr Lee suggested that CMCs
be given the power, similar to Courts, to bind parties for good
behaviour. We will consider how best to do this in the context of
the whole community mediation framework, and so I thank him for

                  </span>: Thank you,
Mr Chairman. I refer to the Minister's remarks on my cut. First,
on Internet regulation. The Minister said that somehow I suggested
that the review was a pretext to censure. I think I need to put
in context of what I am saying one more time. I referred to the
US and its attempt to introduce legislation. I also referred to the
Protection of Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy
Act (SOPA). For example, PIPA, you have big corporate − US corporate
and Internet corporate like Google − who actually spoke out against
this Act. I was coming from that angle where there is a concern
that while on the one hand, you protect intellectual property, such legislation
to protect intellectual property could be used abusively and could
even lead to censorship. That is where I was coming from. It was
a point that I made in good faith, and I am not suggesting that
the Working Committee somehow was looking for a reason to initiate
legislation which would lead to censorship. That is not where I
was coming from. </p>

clarify, who are the members of this Working Committee that the
Minister was referring to? I have to say that the cut really came
from the comments that were made at the launch of "The Mortal Enemy".
That was where the concern came up, because that was the first time
I understood that the Government was in discussion with the Motion
Pictures Association of America. So, that is where I was coming
from. The second point about prosecutorial discretion −</p>

                  </span>: Yes. On
my second cut on prosecutorial discretion, I note the Minister's
comments, and I appreciate them. I did not make a case for introducing guidelines
where the AGC is expected to release these guidelines to the public,
as the Minister suggested. The real crux of the cut comes to the
point of the punishment with regard to the offence that Ramalingam
eventually was charged with, that is, the mandatory death penalty.
Again, in good faith, if the AG would decide to come out and say,
look, these are the reasons why we have decided not to review or
to review, I think that may be helpful for the general public. That
is really where I was coming from.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr K Shanmugam</strong>
                  </span>: I thank
Mr Singh for those remarks. First, there have been concerns expressed
internationally that when you move legislation like what were proposed
in the US that could affect freedom of speech or other concerns,
my point would be: first, all that we have said is that we are studying
this area. There is an inter-agency committee that is looking at
it, and we must obviously look at the US' experience and the experience
of the others. I made it quite clear that we look at it from the perspective
of the economic impact; should we do nothing, but we also need to
consider the legitimate viewpoints that have been put up by users
and others on a variety of issues. So, no decisions have been taken.
It is being studied and, as I have indicated, as and when we reach
a conclusion, then it will certainly be debated here. I only wanted
to be quite clear that Mr Singh was not suggesting that we were
using it as a pretext to cut down on freedom of speech because Mr
Singh combined the word "pretext" with "freedom of speech", and
I understood him to be suggesting that this exercise may be construed
by some as a pretext. I am glad he clarified that he holds no such
view. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-546e9ea1-521e-4af3-97ab-a62ac56f2cef"><!--a--></a>Second, on prosecutorial
discretion. I went through it quite carefully. You have two possibilities.
The prosecution, under our Constitution, is given the discretion
to make a decision on how offenders should be charged, and to make
distinctions. That exercise of discretion has to be made in good
faith, and it could be based on a number of factors, not all of
which can be publicly disclosed, as the Court of Appeal itself recognised.
For example, it could rely on intelligence; there could be real
reasons why one person could be treated differently from another,
but you cannot say it publicly. I said there are two possible models:
one, we require the prosecution either to publish guidelines, but
Mr Singh said that this is not what he was asking for, he wants
the AGC to explain publicly. But after a series of times when you
have explained publicly, it is as good as publishing the guidelines.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-115983f2-b310-4cec-ba6d-9afc214acfbe">
                  <a name="budget__id-115983f2-b310-4cec-ba6d-9afc214acfbe"><!--a--></a>So, it comes back to the
same thing, and you come back to this issue that there are all these
trade-offs. The prosecution sets out its decisions over a series
of cases over many years. In such a case, we make a distinction;
these are the reasons for the distinction. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c10a426c-80f1-498e-a78e-190ca8c08787">
                  <a name="budget__id-c10a426c-80f1-498e-a78e-190ca8c08787"><!--a--></a>Then, you consider two
alternate risks. The first risk is that the prosecution acts maliciously
or wrongly in making distinctions between two people who ought not
to be treated very differently. That is what society should guard
against. That is a risk and I accept that it is a risk. On the other
hand, there is a risk that criminals would start looking at those
published reasons and work out how the exercise of prosecutorial
discretion will take place, and then they will start gaming the
system.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-25e33d9a-fd0c-4f41-9ce9-496b54041ae5">
                  <a name="budget__id-25e33d9a-fd0c-4f41-9ce9-496b54041ae5"><!--a--></a>So, you have to assess,
this House has to assess, which is the more serious risk and which
is better for society. My assessment, and the assessment of the
many professionals involved, is that the risk that the prosecution
will act wrongly is far less serious compared with the possibility
that people or criminals will start gaming the system. And, do not
forget, ultimately, the Court of Appeal has indicated that where
on the face of it, the distinction that the prosecution makes between
two different accused, if it cries out for an explanation and the
prosecution offers no explanation, then the Court will make inferences.
So, that is a further check and safeguard as well. </p>

to work towards a better criminal justice system, and we believe
the current approach strikes the appropriate balance between the
different interests involved. But, as I have indicated more than
once in my explanations, if we believe that requiring the prosecution
to explain its reasons publicly, either by way of published guidelines
or by way of a case-by-case response, if we believe that that is better,
we will amend the Constitution. That is a no brainer and I say that
unhesitatingly.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms
Sylvia Lim</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, two points for the Minister for
Law, in relation to my cut on criminal procedure. First, in his
response, he suggested that my description of the <em class="ph i">Kadar</em>case
as a breakthrough was not quite fair − I am summarising what he
is saying. Or rather, he mentioned that in the CPC review resulting
in the Code in 2010, there had already been big steps taken towards
discovery and so the <em class="ph i">Kadar</em> case is supposed to be part of
that, if I can just maybe dilute the statement.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a1607890-da07-4fca-b2d1-f81fbf256353">
                  <a name="budget__id-a1607890-da07-4fca-b2d1-f81fbf256353"><!--a--></a>But does the Minister
not agree that actually nowhere in the CPC 2010, does it require in
its wording for the prosecution to disclose to the defence, evidence
which it does not intend to use as part of its case? That is not
present in any of the provisions, specifically in the CPC. That
is why the <em class="ph i">Kadar</em> judgement talks about common law duty to
disclose evidence which prosecution does not intend to use. The
second clarification which I like to seek from the Minister is whether
the Attorney-General's Chambers has actually issued any guidelines
to the Police on what they should disclose to the prosecution, post-<em class="ph i">Kadar</em> judgement
and, if it has issued some written guidelines, would it consider making
them public? If not in entirety, at least some sanitised version
which I think will go a long way to promote public confidence in
the system.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr K Shanmugam</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I made
no comments on Ms Lim's statement about the <em class="ph i">Kadar</em> judgement
being a breakthrough. I think Ms Lim would recall a few weeks ago
that I said in this House that most lawyers would consider that
the <em class="ph i">Kadar</em> judgement rightly expresses the law, and that expresses
my view. In terms of what the CPC 2010 does, I made the point that
it significantly enhanced the rights of the accused in terms of
the discovery obligations on both sides, and I think that made for
a better criminal justice procedure. It does not, in terms, in the
statutory provisions, refer to unused materials, but that was a
matter of debate during the Second Reading, and if I may quote myself,
I think for the second or third time, as to what I said then − and
Ms Lim could not have forgotten it – this was what I said, "Lawyers
appearing in Court, whether prosecution or defence lawyers, are
officers of the Court. If they deliberately suppress material evidence,
they would be acting in gross breach of their duties. One cannot
put forward evidence in Court while holding back other evidence
which could put a different complexion on the evidence that is in
fact being tendered in Court." I have no doubt that the Court would
take a serious view of such conduct. Ms Lim knows that the Court
of Appeal referred to that statement and said that it expressed
their view correctly and, in fact, relied on that statement to express
its own views. So, the law is clear. We are both involved on the
same side, as it were, to try and improve the administration of
criminal justice. Whether or not it is expressed in terms in the
Statute, this is what was said as being the law, and this was accepted
by the Court of Appeal as being the law. There is no doubt about
it. I think I have answered both Ms Lim's questions.</p>

                  </span>: In terms
of Police guidelines, both before and post-<em class="ph i">Kadar</em>, the approach
the prosecution has taken has always been that Police investigating
officers conduct the investigations and the material they collect
is gone through for relevance. They have supervising officers who
look through it, and that is then brought to the Attorney-General's
Chambers and there are guidelines on the kind of material that should
be produced. In fact, everything that they collect should be reviewed
by a Legal Officer
within the Attorney-General's Chambers. So, they have fairly clear
guidelines on how they work with each other.</p>

it is private practice or the Attorney-General's Chambers or the

can be lapses. That is not to say no lapses will ever occur. But
we have systems in place that try to minimise these lapses. Ultimately,
the Attorney-General's Chambers and lawyers are answerable to the
Court to practise to the best standards of the profession. </p>

anti-litter campaigns have achieved so much. We should take on a
new approach to bring the message home. What is the Ministry doing to
address this problem of littering? Can we start another campaign,

In Taipei, security cameras are installed at hot spots for littering,

and fined. Security cameras will solve the problem of nabbing litterbugs.
In South Korea, snap-happy citizens are rewarded for catching crime perpetrators

                  </span>: Sir, within a typical HDB precinct and
residential estate, there are few agencies which own these land
and amenities, and
are responsible for the management and maintenance of these areas.
For example, in the HDB estate, the cleaning and maintenance of
the common areas of each block, together with the front and back
apron, are done by the Town Council. As we move away from the block,
the pavement along the road, the turf next to the road, the road
itself, overhead bridges and the bus stops are cleaned by the NEA.
If there is a State Land within the HDB estate, the land is usually
maintained and cleaned by the Land Management Unit of the HDB. The
Park Connectors, which are connecting many towns these days, are
cleaned by the NParks. As a result, we often hear the question,
"Who owns this land?" or "Which agency maintains this land or amenity?"
before we further discuss any issue. </p>

Sir, Singapore is reputed for being a clean and green country. However,
the reality is that all the cleanliness comes about due to the many

rely heavily on foreign workers as Singaporeans do not wish to work
in this industry.</p>

the work permit for foreign workers, is MEWR monitoring the performance
of the cleaning companies? Will there be a fall in the standards

clean due to less frequent sweeping.</p>

Sir, Singapore is famous for its campaigns and one of the most longstanding
one is the anti-littering campaign. However, despite many years
of campaigns and the efforts that we have put in, we are still plagued
with inconsiderate anti-social littering behaviour. It is disturbing
to see that after a mass event, there is usually a lot of rubbish
on the floor. In the housing estates, litter is often seen scattered
all over the void decks in the early morning before the cleaners
start work. This is a sign that people have forgotten about their
social obligations as responsible citizens to keep our country litter-free
and clean.</p>

are Singaporeans who are still not taking ownership of the clean

In fact, people have forgotten about doing what is right, only about
not getting caught. This is not the way forward. We need to address
the root of the problem and not just focus on enforcement but also
on proactive risk management by shifting the mindset and instilling
the right behaviours.</p>

cases of high-rise littering. In my constituency, we have also faced
this problem but one big challenge is in holding the culprit accountable
despite knowing who the culprits are. We have found that NEA is
unable to do anything because we have to catch them in the act.
It seems ironic to me that NEA officers are catching more people
on the street throwing cigarette butts, such smaller littering offences,
than the more serious culprits who throw rubbish from their flats
and vehicles day in, day out. Why are there more litterbugs being
fined or taken to task for smaller offences than those who perpetuate
even more anti-social littering behaviour? Why are we unable to
hold this group of litterbugs accountable for their anti-social
action? I would like to ask NEA to review their enforcement and
regulation.</p>

Sir, I echo the sentiments on littering expressed by fellow Members.
Singapore used to have a global reputation for being a clean city.
Going by my observation and feedback received from Singaporeans
on littering as reflected in the media and other channels, I worry
that we may have lost our global reputation for being a clean city.
I googled to see whether Singapore is listed as one of the top 10
cleanest countries in the world, but, unfortunately, we are not.
In fact, there are many blogs and remarks lamenting the deterioration
in the level of cleanliness in our beloved country. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-06f589ce-0bbb-4fe3-a559-dba2ea0388fd"><!--a--></a>Sir, I believe the state
of cleanliness of a country or a city reflects many things about our
society: the level of civic consciousness, our attitude towards
the environment, our values, etc. If we assess these areas by using
the state of cleanliness as a yardstick, I am afraid we have failed
and we are far from being a gracious society. Many of us would have noticed that
Singapore's parks, estates and streets are cluttered with fresh
litter despite the daily cleaning being done. This is a tragic problem
and unless addressed, we run the risk of turning Singapore into
a "grubby, trash-laden metropolis", as quoted by one Canadian tourist
who revisited our country and expressed his disappointment in his blog.
A recent survey showed that 36.2% of people said that if they do
not get caught, they will litter. This reflects the lack of civic
consciousness in this group of people. NEA has conducted numerous
anti-littering campaigns and increased the fines imposed for littering,
but the littering problem has not abated. I would like to ask the
Minister for plans to inculcate a greater sense of personal responsibility
in Singaporeans in relation to cleanliness. Let us reclaim back
our reputation as a clean and green city that our previous generations
have worked very hard to achieve. </p>

I believe the Minister is well aware that residents living near
Bedok Reservoir have been plagued by midges again recently. The
swarm of green flies seems to have become an annual affair since
their outbreak in 2010. According to NEA, midges do not bite or
carry diseases but this is hardly a consolation to residents whose
lives are affected by this nuisance. Some residents are also worried
that property prices in the area may also be affected if the problem
is not solved.</p>

the various Government agencies such as NEA, PUB and NParks worked
closely with the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council during the outbreak
to minimise the impact of the midges on the residents and shop operators,
it is imperative that the Ministry solve the problem soon. Sir,
we cannot fire fight the problem every year. Not only is it is a
problem for the residents, it is also costly, as daily fogging must be
carried out during the outbreak. Moreover, fogging is not a solution
to the problem. Fogging will kill the adult midges and lower their
numbers, but not the larvae, which is the root cause. </p>

breeding ground of midges is in the reservoir. I would like to know

for the repeated outbreak over the last two years and the long-term

Sir, despite years of public campaigns by the Government, littering,
and in particular high-rise littering, remains a major problem in
Singapore. I understand that I am not alone in receiving complaints
from residents about this problem which seems to be worsening in
some of our estates. As soon as the cleaners have completed their
morning rounds, the estates are dirtied again in the afternoons.</p>

and Taiwan, I noticed that although there were few litter bins in
public places − in fact, sometimes, I notice there are none at all
− they were clean and litter-free. How I hope Singapore can achieve
what Japan and Taiwan have achieved in public cleanliness. If we
can all work together towards that, then there will be no need for
us to rely on foreign workers to help maintain the cleanliness of
our estates or worry about the dangers of high-rise littering and
killer-litter. There should be a better solution than blaming the
problems on foreign workers and foreign domestic maids, though some may be culprits,
or trying to ensure that the cleaning contractors carry out their jobs
properly. It is important that we all play our part to keep Singapore
litter-free and maintain her status as a Clean and Green City. Will
the Ministry share with us any updates it has to tackle this growing
problem? Without tackling it, very soon you will see, you will hear
many people complaining or saying "<em class="ph i">siam, siam, siam</em>" in the
housing estates.</p>

Sir, as Members, we often received complaints from residents about
their upstairs neighbour throwing things out of the window. Just
last night, in my Meet-the-People Sessions, I had a resident from
Block 520, Jelepang Road who was both angry and frustrated about
his upstairs neighbour throwing still-lit cigarette butts out of
the window. He was angry because these cigarette butts caused burns
to his curtains. He was frustrated because despite numerous complaints
to NEA, nothing was done or can be done. The NEA officer told the
resident there is not enough evidence to prosecute the resident
and there is really nothing much that can be done.</p>

Do we surrender to these recalcitrant litterbugs? I say we declare
war with these culprits and take firm measures as well as send a
strong signal that such acts would not be tolerated. Clearly, NEA
would need more resources and would need to invest in more technology
to deal with such dangerous and anti-social act. NEA would need
more advanced surveillance devices. I understand that Hong Kong has
started using the digital high-rise littering surveillance system
where CCTV and even laser guns are deployed to detect high-rise
littering. In some cases, in order to drive the point, evidence
such as cigarette butts or litter items should be sent for forensic
or DNA testing to ascertain the identity of the culprit.</p>

Ensuring a high standard of public cleanliness and hygiene is a

efforts. Last year, NEA focused on the provision of better litter
bin infrastructure, increased visibility of enforcement and public
outreach efforts targeted at youths. The initial results of this
strategy have been encouraging and we will continue with these efforts,

Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked what we are doing to improve the quality

an inter-agency Cleaning Industry Productivity Work Group, comprising

efforts of the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC)

a Bill to license cleaning companies in the next two years. This
will set minimum standards that all cleaning companies must meet
before they can operate. The voluntary Clean Mark accreditation
scheme that NEA has put in place since mid-2010 will complement
this. The scheme recognises companies that deliver high standards
of cleaning through their training of workers, good use of equipment,
and sound employment practices. Since its launch, 60 cleaning companies
have attained the Clean Mark Silver Award. In the Budget debate,
Mr Zainal exhorted that both Government and private sectors should
engage only accredited cleaning companies. The Government is indeed
taking the lead in this, with some 27 Government agencies already
engaging accredited cleaning companies. As announced by MOF a few
days ago, all Government
agencies, including the newly-established Department of Public Cleanliness,

of rising costs, we will create opportunities for greater cost efficiencies
in cleaning and waste disposal. Fuel and manpower costs have been
rising, and this has been reflected in our latest public waste collection
tenders when contracts were renewed. We will do our best to mitigate
rising costs. We will reduce the number of public waste collection
sectors from nine to six over the next few years to achieve greater
economies of scale, whilst still ensuring robust competition. From
this year, we will be aggregating waste collection fees progressively
to reduce the volatility and remove the disparity in waste collection
fees for households. The implementation details are being worked
out, in consultation with industry. </p>

public cleanliness strategy is stringent enforcement. We continually
seek new ways to improve the effectiveness of our enforcement efforts.
The example of high-rise littering illustrates how we are doing
this. Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang highlighted
the persistent problem of high-rise littering and how this undermines
public safety and cleanliness. My Ministry agrees that this is an
area of concern. </p>

against high-rise littering are typically labour-intensive, and
involves many hours of stakeouts. We carried out a pilot project
last year at 10 hotspot areas using surveillance cameras and video
analytic software to assess its effectiveness. Our trials have achieved
some success, and Members can see a picture of the kind of images
we can receive. </p>

surveillance cameras where there is a persistent high-rise littering
problem. For killer litter, or high-rise littering, which endangers
the personal safety of others, offenders can face imprisonment,
a fine, or both. HDB may also compulsorily acquire the HDB flat

for littering does not completely address the deeper challenge of
nurturing the right values. This is alluded to by Er Dr Lee, Mr
Yeo and Mr Zainal. We must build greater individual ownership and
community action if we are to raise the standard of cleanliness
in all our public spaces. We need to cultivate these attitudes and
values from a young age. And we are working with MOE to integrate environmental
responsibility into MOE's values-driven school curriculum. Also,
since last year, a day in April has been marked Youth for the Environment
Day, where schools organise activities in support of the environment.
This year, it falls on 20 April. Through such efforts, we hope young Singaporeans
will think more deeply about the environment and take meaningful
steps to care for the environment.</p>

that requires everyone to play a part. As Er Dr Lee pointed out,
we need to minimise the harmful effects of second-hand tobacco smoke

the Blue Ribbon movement by committing to actively advocate for
smoke-free premises and spread smoke-free messages to patrons. I

what we are doing to address the problem of midges in Bedok Reservoir.
Chironomids, commonly known as "midges", are insects that breed
in water bodies. Fortunately, although they look like mosquitoes,
they neither bite nor spread disease. Nonetheless, as Mr Low has
pointed out, we recognise they are a nuisance. Last year, Bedok
Reservoir residents experienced two incidents of midge emergence,
each lasting about four to six weeks. We worked with NParks and
the Town Councils to mitigate the nuisance by fogging the surrounding
area. Larvacide was also applied to the reservoir and around its
edges to kill the larvae. We are monitoring the midge population
in the reservoir and will step up control operations accordingly.</p>

of 33 cases as compared to 2010, marking the fourth year we bucked
the predicted rising trend of dengue. As there continues to be a
possibility of a dengue serotype switch, I urge members of the public
to conscientiously eliminate potential dengue breeding spots around
your homes, such as flowerpots and roof gutters, at least once a
week. Beyond our enforcement approach, NEA introduced a new "Homeowner

spaces we share, every thoughtless act has a significant impact
on those around us. Conversely, behaving with consideration extends
further than we imagine. We need to act responsibly, not just for

I am very happy to note the Minister's prompt decision to build
10 new hawker centres. May I ask the Minister where are these 10
new hawker centres? I hope to have one serving residents in Yishun.
All my parliamentary colleagues in Nee Soon GRC have been asking
for it. I would also like to ask the Minister if he can bring forward
the building of these hawker centres instead of the 10-year timeframe?
In view of the ever rising cost of cooked food, building it as soon
as possible will be helpful to residents.</p>

I hope that there will be new design features to solve the common
complaints about poor ventilation, stuffy on hot days, with birds
and strays making forays on the left-over food. I also hope to see
that there are designated areas for patrons to return their used
utensils. </p>

− let the nearby residents have the priority of renting the stalls,
for example, Nee Soon GRC residents to get priority in getting a
stall in the hawker centre in Yishun. This will provide residents
a workplace that is near their homes and hence save on transport.
All potential stallholders should be screened and only stallholders
who can cook and generally want to run a hawker stall are allowed
to rent a stall; and, if possible, rent it at a subsidised rate
instead of bidding at market rate. And why not bidding? My residents
told me that a cup of <em class="ph i">kopi O</em> costs only 50 to 60 cents in Ang
Mo Kio, but the rest of the hawker centres charge 80 to 90 cents.
So, it could be because those old hawker centres are having subsidised
rental rate. I hope the Minister will consider all these suggestions.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, like
Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, I want to thank the Minister for the decision
to resume building hawker centres after a 26-year break, something
many Members in this House have spoken about for many years. Judging
from the very positive reaction from the public, we can see that
this is what Singaporeans have wished for, for a long time. Indeed,
the significant growth in our population and the high rentals of
food stalls make this resumption to build new hawker centres a necessity. </p>

is how many hawker centres to build and how fast to build them.
There are two key issues here that need to be addressed − firstly,
it is the under supply of affordable eateries in new estates as
well as some of the more densely populated workplaces. Second, what
is the effective model to run hawker centres that will eradicate
high rental premiums and to keep food prices at affordable level?</p>

centres in 10 years, to me, is just too few and too long. It will
not be of sufficient scale and urgency to impact the overall market
rentals and to keep food prices affordable. In my view, a more appropriate
number and timeline should be to build 20 new hawkers centres in
five years. This will not only address the under supply situation
but also to allow us to build ahead of demand. Last year, HDB launched 25,000
new flats and will be launching another 25,000 units this year.
So, there are clearly more dwelling units coming up in the next
few years. </p>

hawker centre is that it need not be a massive or grand structure.
For those that are in neighbourhoods, we do not need hawker centres
that are of the scale or size of the Maxwell Food Market or the
Bukit Timah Hawker Centre. In fact, if the hawker centres are too
big in neighbourhood locations where there are space constraints,
it may result in parking and congestion problems. For neighbourhood hawker centres, I
think an optimum size would be about 40 to 50 stalls. And we need more
of such bite-sized hawker centres spread across more locations so
that it is convenient and accessible to more residents. </p>

Sir, unlike Mr Lim, I am asking for a hawker centre. I would like
to take this opportunity once again to request NEA to construct
a hawker centre-cum-market to serve residents at Pioneer constituency.
Being a relatively new estate, MND's policy so far has been that
new estates would not be provided hawker centres or markets. However,
both of these are institutions of Singapore. So, I am very heartened
that this policy has been reviewed. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ba7e0ccd-cd5a-4394-ae9e-3dd3e0a3db11">

cheaper alternative for food when compared to air-conditioned food
courts and supermarkets. In addition, they serve as wonderful congregation
hubs to bring residents closer to one another. </p>

to hear that there are plans to do away with the tendering out of stalls
to the highest bidders and instead to run these centres as "cooperatives"
or "social enterprises". Such a move presumably will keep prices
down but I am not sure whether the hawkers will raise margins instead
of passing on the lower cost. Will the Minister advise how this
objective can be met?</p>

to be successful, although it is very laudable to focus on the social
objectives which are central, we should also be cognisant that hawker
centres finally must sell good food where customers will come back
again and again. So, they must also be successful enterprises. </p>

"tenant mix", I would urge NEA not to be too prescriptive as local
conditions differ from estate to estate and to allow the local community
to be involved. For example, at Pioneer, there is a strong demand
for fresh food stalls, like chilled meats, fish and vegetables,
in addition to cooked food stalls. Finally, I would offer Pioneer
Constituency as one of the first estates to try out this new concept.
After all, we are known as "Pioneer".</p>

Sir, hawker centres are food and social icons of Singapore. Many
Singaporeans and tourists enjoy the cheap, good food provided at
the 107 hawker centres in Singapore. In HDB heartlands, many hawker
centres serve as gathering places for residents to meet and interact
with one another. </p>

management of hawker centres by NEA has changed to be more market-driven.
To date, some hawker stalls are sold while others are rented out
at market rate. These arrangements have increased the rental and
cost of running hawker stalls, resulting in an increase of hawker
food prices. This situation is further aggravated by the policy
to stop building hawker centres, and allowing assignment and sub-letting of
the stalls. Many HDB eating houses were let to competitive tender
at high prices to companies which, in turn, sub-let to eating house
operators who ultimately rent out the stalls at high rental. As
a result, the stallholders have no choice but to sell food at higher prices.
Residents in housing estates do not have much choice but to patronise
these eating houses in their neighbourhood. </p>

built to improve on public hygiene and resettle street hawkers.
Today, they have become an indispensible part of every Singaporean's
life. Not only do they provide a source of affordable food for our
three meals, but they are also synonymous with many of our signature
local dishes. Hawker centres are also a focal point of the neighbourhood
and a community space for all to interact, regardless of age, race,
religion or background. As such, following the October 2011 announcement
to build 10 new hawker centres in the next 10 years, there has been an
enthusiastic response from the public. The public has expressed
particular interest in the location and completion date of the new
centres, food price affordability and hygiene standards. </p>

year, my Ministry has been reviewing our hawker centre management
policies with people − the public and the stallholders – as our
top priority. In
November last year, industry professionals across various fields
were invited to form the Public Consultation Panel to deliberate
on the management, design and vibrancy of these new hawker centres.
They recently shared their recommendations and I would like to take
this opportunity to thank the Panel for their efforts and their
valuable suggestions. </p>

the process of reviewing our policies, I would like to provide an initial
update of our progress. First and foremost, the location and completion
date of the new hawker centres has been a subject of interest. We
have identified seven towns where new hawker centres will be located.
These are Bukit Panjang, Yishun, Pasir Ris, Jurong West, Admiralty,
Tampines and Punggol. Mr Cedric Foo has requested that a hawker
centre be built in the Pioneer SMC. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Liang
Eng Hwa have called for the Government to speed up the pace of development
to meet the community's needs. We estimate that within the next
five years, these hawker centres will be completed and able to serve
the community. The centre to be built in Jurong West will be adjacent
to Pioneer SMC, and can serve its residents. My Ministry will continue
to work closely with the relevant Government agencies to identify
suitable sites in other towns to build more new hawker centres,
should there be a need. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-aad0a664-1399-42d7-aa9c-cfc438305f69"><!--a--></a>Second, food price affordability
in our hawker centres is an issue which members of the public and
various MPs are concerned about. Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Gan Thiam
Poh have shared some valuable suggestions. The 10 new hawker centres
are expected to add about 600 hawker stalls to the market, which
will help better meet the demand for stalls and moderate stall rentals.
The new stalls will provide residents with more choices and in so
doing, ensure food prices remain affordable. Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested
fixing prices that stallholders can charge as a way to ensure affordability.
In determining the price for his food, a hawker has to consider
many factors. These include stall rental, utilities, labour and
raw materials. These factors differ from hawker to hawker, depending
on the type of food they sell. If the Government were to fix prices,
this would limit stallholders' income and affect their livelihood. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fdf9e566-b437-4ede-bedc-99eb24803eb1">
                  <a name="budget__id-fdf9e566-b437-4ede-bedc-99eb24803eb1"><!--a--></a>Mr Gan and Er Dr Lee also
suggested that the Government control the sub-letting of stalls
to reduce speculation which could raise rentals. This suggestion
is aligned with the Panel's recommendations. Hawker stalls were
set up to provide an opportunity for Singaporeans to run their own
small business. As such, we agree that stalls should be personally
run, and should not be used for profiteering. I would like to announce
that for all new stallholders, full-day subletting and assignment
will not be allowed from 1 April this year. Existing stallholders
will have a three-year grace period to adjust to these new conditions.
Controlling the sub-letting and assignment of stalls will help to
stabilise rentals, reduce costs for stallholders and achieve our
objective of food price affordability. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-61818e06-f89b-493b-a6c6-fd77645dd607">
                  <a name="budget__id-61818e06-f89b-493b-a6c6-fd77645dd607"><!--a--></a>The Panel had suggested
that operating hours of hawker centres be extended, which would
not only meet residents' dining needs for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
but would also improve the vibrancy and viability of hawker centres.
We recognise it is not easy for a stallholder to operate a stall
by himself or herself for all three meals. As such, from 1 April,
we have decided to permit joint tenancies and do away with the requirement
that each stall can only have a single tenant. We will also not
set a reserve rent when tendering out vacant stalls. This means
that even if the bidding price is below market price, we will allocate
the vacant stall to the highest bidder, as long as there are competitive bids.
Taken together, we hope that these measures will help to moderate costs
in running a hawker stall, and maintain food price affordability. </p>

of hygiene from our stallholders and hawker centres are key. Since
2002, NEA has been using the grading system to assess the hygiene
of stalls, and the proportion of "A" and "B" graded food outlets
and hawker stalls has increased steadily from 58% in 2002 to 95%
last year. On the whole, there has been an overall improvement in
Singapore's food hygiene standards in the past decade. To further
raise the food hygiene standards, my Ministry intends to publish
more detailed up-to-date information on the hygiene lapses of food
operators from June 2012. Beyond the track records of food caterers
which are already available online, this will include other food operators,
including hawker stalls, and enable Singaporeans to make more informed dining
choices. From June, we will also enhance our food grading system
by adjusting the grading in a timely manner following any verified
food poisoning incidents. </p>

such a model, the operator can consider Mr Lim's and Assoc Prof
Fatimah's suggestion to set aside stalls for the lower income and
special needs persons to set up low-cost businesses. We are currently assessing
the suitability of different management models. But regardless of
the management model adopted, the key social objectives of hawker
centres of affordability, cleanliness and vibrancy will be maintained.

delicious, affordable food at convenient locations – a very simple

will do for the Jurong West centre for Pioneer constituents. Their
design and development should be informed by the views of the people
they will serve as hawker centres are more than just places for
affordable food. They are also important common spaces that cultivate
the sense of community upon which
environmental stewardship depends. Like schools, parks, playgrounds
and community centres, they are places where Singaporeans from different
walks of life encounter one another, share the same space and experience
things together. As lively public spaces, they can make our society
stronger, and grow the connections that Singaporeans feel for each
other, for their neighbourhoods and their environment. They are
a necessary part of a city that is inclusive and makes room for
everyone.</p>

Mr Chairman, Sir, the expert panel on drainage design and flood
protection measures released its report, setting out key findings
and recommendations in January this year. The recommendations of
the panel were wide-ranging and addressed improvements which could
be made in Singapore's flood prevention efforts from very many perspectives.
It is certainly a very comprehensive report and one, which will
lay the groundwork for our next generation of flood protection.</p>

the recommendations of the expert panel and has since announced
further investments into flood protection mechanisms. As it has
been about a month since the Government announced that it was accepting
these recommendations, could the Minister provide an update on PUB's
response and whether any more concrete plans have been formulated
to implement these recommendations? Could the Minister also provide
an update on the enhancements to how flash flood information is
disseminated to the public including, as previously announced, CCTV
footage on PUB's website? And could the Minister also provide some data
on flash flood alerts in terms of how accurate the information eventually
turned out to be and the incidence of false alarms?</p>

err on the side of caution in forecasting flash floods. But this
must be balanced against the need to avoid causing undue alarm amongst
the general public. Finally, could the Minister also comment on
whether there are any plans to require buildings in flood-prone
areas with basement car parks to construct automatic flood defence
mechanisms to avoid damage being caused to vehicles by flood waters,
especially when heavy rains occur at night?</p>

under the current projections by MEWR, Singapore will only be completely
self-sufficient in terms of water supply around the time that the 1962
Water Agreement with Malaysia expires, that is, by 2061. While NEWater
and desalinated water will form a proportionately larger part of
our water supply over the next 50 years, we are still some way off
from being completely water self-sufficient. The Minister has recently
said that droughts are more worrying than flash floods. Now clearly,
being in our position, having any sort of weather change could affect
our ability to provide for our own water, which is something which
we should be very concerned about. Could the Minister therefore
provide some insights into what Singapore is doing to enhance the
resilience of our supply against the likelihood of extreme weather patterns?
And given that we are an island with easy access to sea water for
desalination, are we looking at investing more resources to identify
and develop more cost-effective desalination technology for our
water supply? </p>

that electro-chemical technology was being tested to desalt water
with testing scheduled to have ended in 2011. I also understand
that low-temperature evaporation technology was being evaluated
as an alternative means of desalting sea water. Could the Minister
please provide an update as to the results of these studies? And
finally, I understand that a few sites along our coastline have
been identified for future desalination plants, in addition to the
one in Tuas. But has any progress been made on constructing these
new plants?</p>

Mr Chairman. The cut on the 2011 Water Agreement. According to the
PUB, Singapore's water supply comes from four taps: local catchment, desalination,
NEWater and water from Malaysia. There has been some concern expressed
about the greater fear of droughts as opposed to flash floods. I
would like the Minister to clarify the situation affecting our water
resources in view of the recently lapsed 2011 Water Agreement with
Malaysia. More specifically, has the water supply, previously provided
by the 2011 Water Agreement, been completely replaced by one or more
those taps? Would the Minister also update the public on the current
and future water situation, specifically how much the desalination,
NEWater and local catchment taps, each provides as a percentage
of the overall water supply? In addition, and with the respect to
current patterns of water consumption and projections, what future population
size can our four taps of water actually accommodate?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, all of us can appreciate the importance of water conservation
especially in a place like Singapore. However, I am of the view
that the Government has over-taxed Singapore households for water
consumption. Besides charging water consumption by block, the Government
also imposes a water conservation
tax, a sanitary appliance fee and a waterborne fee. While it is
important to discourage excessive water consumption, the Government
should not take the punitive approach or slapping households with
heavy tax measures, given that water is an essential commodity in
every household.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-d80e1218-dd46-42da-be87-87c6e3dd7819"><!--a--></a>According to the Government,
the water conservation tax is to reinforce the water conservation
message. However, charges for consumption are already based on block usage;
households using more than 40 cubic metres a month are charged a
much higher tariff. Is this not enough to reinforce the message
of water conservation? The sanitary appliance fee and waterborne
fee are to offset the costs of treating used water and for the operation
and maintenance of the public sewage system. With the advent of NEWater,
the whole public sewage system is now part of operation for producing NEWater.
This is now a source of income for the PUB which resells the clean
water to households.</p>

is it fair to continue charging households the same fee? Should
the Government not review the fees charged? Finally, we also have
an issue of a tax-on-tax. Households have to pay GST for the water
conservation tax. That is not right to further tax the people on
the taxes they pay. I urge the Government to consider removing the
water conservation tax and reduce the fees imposed on domestic water consumption
to help lower the cost of living for Singaporeans. </p>

for us to look on the upside of things and to say what more can
we do to exploit our environment to the advantage of our community.
And here I refer to the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme
that has been a key programme of the MEWR in Budgets and COS past.
Under this programme, we look at water bodies within Singapore,
and we look at it as more than just providing for our consumption
and sustenance but to develop it and to expand it and overcome a
constraint in terms of possibilities for us to use; for population
to enjoy Singapore, not only on land but also on the water. And

improved the community space available. Sir, I would like to ask
the Minister, looking ahead, what the public can expect in terms
of projects in the pipeline?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, as mentioned earlier by Senior Minister of State Grace Fu,
Singapore's overall air quality has generally been rated good. There
are, as everyone knows, periods in which our PSI readings may creep
to the moderate or even unhealthy levels. Fortunately, we do not
cross into this unhealthy territory very often. While updated PSI
figures are always available on NEA's website, one of the more worrying
components of air pollution – particulate matter less than 2.5 microns
in diameter (PM 2.5) is not measured by PSI. Instead the PSI measures
larger particulate matter of PM 10. PM 2.5 has the potential to
have far more serious health implications than PM 10.</p>

a comparison of how our overall PM 2.5 levels compare with international
standards? Some reports I have read have indicated that our readings in
Singapore exceed those being accepted as being safe by both the
World Health Organization as well as the United States Environmental
Protection Agency. And one of the major components of air pollution
in Singapore is sulphur dioxide. There are significant amounts of
sulphur dioxide emitted by oil refineries as well as by our power stations
and ships. Could the Minister please let us know if there are any
plans to decrease the amounts of sulphur dioxide emissions permitted
by these major contributors? Could the Minister also provide some
further information as to how the other main components of air pollution
in Singapore? Could the Minister please also set out MEWR's long-term
plans to improve air quality especially in areas where international standards
have not been met, such as PM 2.5 levels? And could the Minister
please also inform us as to how long, as to the long-term targets
for PM 2.5 and sulphur dioxide and other pollutant levels, and when
are we expected to meet these targets?</p>

has been used in Singapore for a very long time and Singaporeans
are familiar with the Index, given that PSI does not provide indications
as to the levels of smaller particulate matter, which may enter
a person's blood circulation, is there any intention, either to
adjust the PSI, to take into consideration PM 2.5 or, alternatively,
to adopt a different index which will provide members of the public
with details about the components of air pollution?</p>

Sir, according to the World Wildlife Fund which released its report
yesterday, Singapore had the largest carbon footprint per person
in the Asia-Pacific region in 2010. I would like to ask the Minister
if he would consider making public events in Singapore greener.
For example, I recall that at the last Year End Countdown party,
which is into its seventh year, there were 20,000 plastic wishing
spheres, which were set afloat in Marina Bay. It was indeed a spectacular
visual arts display. I hope the spheres were picked up and recycled.
There was also a Countdown fireworks set off from the octagonal-shaped
pontoons. Another "stunning pyrotechnic display" as the organisers
promised. But, again, what is the cost in economic and environmental
terms?</p>

donate a certain amount to plant trees to offset the carbon emitted
when they take airplanes. Can the Minister come up with a set of

Ten years ago, MEWR recognised that Singapore's environmental sustainability
will suffer irreversibly if the Ministry does not have a strong
focus on the environment, and if it does not get every citizen,
every resident on board. As a result, the Singapore Green Plan 2012
was launched in 2002, and it
has got a very strong 3P approach – involving the people, the private
and the public sector. The idea then was not just to tell people
what to do, but to provide sufficient information and alternatives,
with a combination of carrots and sticks, to let people decide on
their needs and priorities, and take charge. </p>

effects, with many green environment-related interest groups mushrooming
on a whole range of issues. Ten years on, could MEWR share with this
House, what are the lessons learnt from this approach, the hits
and misses, and whether it has created a framework to ensure the
effective collaboration amongst the 3Ps, and hopefully, beyond that
of just environment-related issues? </p>

also update us on the progress of the six focus areas being: (i)
air and climate change; (ii) water; (iii) waste management; (iv)
nature; (v) public health; and (vi) international environmental
relations. Further, could the Minister also enlighten us on what
is beyond the 2012 Green Plans?</p>

it that while the people sector has increased its ground up activities,
many of these groups are either directly or indirectly initiated
by the Government. These organisations tend to be better funded,
have lots of facilitation and goodwill from the public sector, which
enable them to attract good people and grow. While all initiatives
are welcomed, I hope that the Government will also level the playing field
for those who are genuine ground up initiatives. Very often, these
organisations do not get the same facilitation or funding or demand
for their works, even though they are more passionate and no less
effective than the Government-initiated NPOs.</p>

survive because they tend to be self-funded from the founders' pockets
and that limits its growth and its scope in many ways. My question, therefore,
is how does the Government intend or not, to work with such NPOs
and help them to grow? And even better, how can the Government encourage
collaborations amongst the various types of NPOs, so that they can
share knowledge and expertise, and streamline their value chain?
And in addition, how can the Government encourage the private sector
to play a bigger role, beyond that of being technology or products partners,
beyond that of being a sponsor, to becoming a true partner and collaborate with
the people sector?</p>

Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)</strong>
                  </span>: Thank you, Mr
Chairman. I thank Members of the House for their questions and their
suggestions. I think by now it should be clear to all of you that
there are three broad themes behind all of MEWR's programmes. First,
to ensure that we continue to have a very high quality of life in
Singapore; second, to do our part in an inclusive society, in particular,
meaning, to always leave a low cost option on the table and also
provide opportunities for fair wages and good jobs; and third, to
make sure that we have a sustainable future. </p>

as far as these three themes are concerned. First, on quality of
life, many Members have mentioned the absolute importance of maintaining our
reputation for cleanliness. Senior Minister of State Grace Fu has
explained what we are doing. Basically to summarise: by having an
integrated cleaning agency that will be in charge of all public
areas. It will take on the contracts of all the multiple agencies
that currently do the job. So, you only need one number, one contact
point. Secondly, to increase and step up enforcement. And Members
have asked for videos and evidence and the rest of it, and we will
certainly use the latest technology in order to take enforcement actions
against killer litter and other types of anti-social behaviours. Thirdly,
to also promote public activism – the sort that Miss Penny Low has
referred to – because we need all Singaporeans to become part of
the solution, to jealously guard our cleanliness. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-acf553b6-97c2-41e8-baa5-9499b65b77ac"><!--a--></a>On hawker centres, I am
glad that this has been welcomed not only by all members in this
House but indeed many; I think I can say, practically all Singaporeans
out there. And I want to assure Singaporeans that we will continue
to make sure that we focus our top priority on ensuring that it
is cheap, it is good and it is clean. Everything else would be a
"nice to have", would be a frill but let us focus on making sure
these key priorities: cheap, good and clean.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-1f738781-7d11-4cd2-82b9-b9ddf9f6125b"><!--a--></a>Similarly, when we talk
about cleaners, I would like to make this commitment – that it is
time that the wages of cleaners go up. And therefore we need to
redesign jobs and we need to improve their productivity so that
we can give them a fair wage. And at the same time, while some of
that increase must filter back into prices; that firstly, people will
accept that this is fair; and secondly, because we redesigned our
processes, it does not necessarily lead to a sudden big jump in
prices. But for a long while, we in Singapore have enjoyed First
World living and paid very little relatively for human services
because they have been getting Third World wages. So, in the name
of an inclusive budget, this is the change that must come about
and I hope Members of this House will support that. </p>

the question of a sustainable future. Now, Singapore has enjoyed
a well-deserved reputation as a Clean and Green city in a garden
– a working model of the sustainable city of the future. Now, this
is not just a matter of national pride, but indeed a source of competitive
advantage. And this is even more important now because we live in
a world with seven billion people, and for the first time in human history,
more than half of humanity lives in cities. Therefore, the way we
structure and organise ourselves, and the way we create a sustainable
city for the future, will be a source of competitive advantage and
will give us many opportunities for the future. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-3cbcff7b-0ce9-4d95-9e33-80533d14990a"><!--a--></a>So, I say this so that
you understand that our current environmental excellence was not
achieved overnight but indeed over five decades, way before it was
fashionable, Mr Lee Kuan Yew embarked on a clean and green Singapore
− planted trees; made sure we did not pollute the air that we breathe
and insisted on clean and safe water. And of course the iconic project
was the 10-year clean up of the Singapore River, which was formerly
an open sewer. Most of us in this House would still remember the
pungent aroma of the Singapore River. Today, Marina Bay is an icon,
a magnet for the world in the midst of our new downtown. The audacity,
the ambition and the scale of that project transformed Singapore
and, in fact, has defined Singapore. I say this because we need to
remember that we have to make sure we do not lose this pole position
that we have. And we have to continue to make the necessary investments
and to take the long-term horizons that these sorts of plans require.</p>

when you are taking a 50-year time frame is obviously climate change.
Mr Liang Eng Hwa has asked how we are preparing for this and he
has referred to his own anecdotal experiences with having wet weather
programmes, having to be invoked more often than it was in the past.
Well, it is not just anecdotes – we have looked at 30-year data
from the Meteorological Service and it has shown that the intensity and
the frequency of high intensity rainfall have increased over the
past 30 years. </p>

you believe in it or not, is going to be another confounding factor.
And in the case of Singapore, what it does mean is that it will
increase the intensity and the frequency of such extreme weather
events and we have to prepare for it. We have to make sure our infrastructure
is ready and you cannot wait for a disaster to occur; you have got
to prepare years or decades in advance. And one of the problems with
climate change and the difficulty overseas is that there is too
much politics in climate change and not enough science. In the case
for Singapore, we intend to approach it from a strictly scientific
point of view. </p>

we are establishing is the Centre for Climate Research Singapore
(CCRS) this year which will run high-resolution regional climate
models. This will allow us to generate long-term projections of
rainfall, temperature, wind and sea-level in Singapore over the
next 50 to 100 years. The Centre will also undertake research on
the complex weather systems which affect Singapore and the region,
such as the severe tropical thunderstorms. Those of you who were
looking out of the windows yesterday morning will have seen a very
dark cloud – a Sumatran squall moving across from west to the east.
And these types of events we think will increase and we need to understand
the mechanics behind it in order to make sensible predictions and
plans to deal with it. The CCRS will also build up its capability
by leveraging on existing research partnerships and linkages with
both local and international experts and organisations, such as
the UK Met Office Hadley Centre. </p>

an Expert Panel to review our drainage and flood protection measures.
The Panel concluded its review and shared its recommendations. I
am glad to inform Mr Charles Chong who is now Chairman of the COS,
that we have accepted the recommendations of the panel, and we will
implement a comprehensive plan to strengthen Singapore's flood resilience.
This plan will cover the full spectrum of the drainage system: it
will enhance the design and also impose tighter regulatory standards;
it will explore new engineering solutions as well as improve the
accuracy of flood risk assessments. The implementation of this plan
has commenced, so for instance, by the end of the year, we will
have a high resolution digital elevation map for the Marina Catchment
area. This will enable us to carry out 3-dimensional modelling of the
catchment and it will in turn allow us to engage in more accurate
flood risk maps and to provide catchment-specific flood management
solutions. For Stamford Canal in particular, whilst the long-term
measures such as the diversion canal or detention ponds are being
considered, work is already underway within the canal itself in
order to increase its flow capacity. </p>

the inter-agency collaboration on drainage infrastructure and to
focus on non-traditional measures, such as minimising urban surface
runoff generated by new developments. And we will continue to engage
the various professional bodies such as the Institute of Engineers,
Singapore − which I believe Er Dr Lee is the past President of −
the Association of Consulting Engineers of Singapore, and all the
other relevant professional groups.</p>

Mr Chong that my Ministry will do our best and we will make all
the necessary long-term investments into the drainage system. Over
the next five years, we will invest in at least 20 new drainage
infrastructural projects in order to achieve a higher level of flood
protection across the entire island. And I also want to give this House the assurance
that we will do so but with a very keen eye on the bottom line, and
we will make sure that these investments are cost-effective, and
we will also adjust the plan as the situation evolves.</p>

candidly, given the complexity of the weather systems and the uncertainty
in the future, it is not possible for any Minister for Water Resources
to guarantee that floods will never recur. We will therefore have
to take the approach of taking all reasonable and cost-effective
measures to prevent and to mitigate the impact of floods in Singapore.
This means not just drains but also looking at the protection of local
buildings. I think a Member had recommended just now about making
sure that basement car parks have flood protection barriers. These
will be imposed through regulatory standards. </p>

of this strategy is transparency. We will make all the data from
all our sensors available in real time – so that the public can
be kept fully informed of the situation in real time and can take
the necessary precautions. It will also be an avenue for more stakeholders
to generate innovative solutions. That is why you may have noticed
that whenever there is a heavy storm, there is literally a flood
of SMS alerts; a flood of tweets from drain sensors; and updates
on social media platforms. Eventually, we will put all the real-time
closed-circuit television images available on websites and for the
public to access. So, remember, it is about keeping the public informed,
being transparent and honest, and providing new avenues for innovative
solutions, so that everyone can have a chance to become part of
the solution, rather than just to complain about the problem. </p>

and I think they have been distributed to all Members. I can take
Members through and give an update on our current integrated water
system [<em class="ph i">A <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=016_20120306_S0021_T0002.pdf"">slide</a> was shown to hon Members</em>].</p>

first tap that you see is imported water from Johor. You all know
that it is a matter of public record that we have the right to draw
250 million gallons a day from Johor. What most people in Singapore
do not realise is that the catchment area for the Johor River (reservoir),
which supplies half our water, is twice the size of Singapore. I
say that so that you understand what we are dealing with, and the vulnerability
and preciousness with which we have to treat water in Singapore. </p>

local catchment. As you will recall, we now have 17 reservoirs, and
we have now made two-thirds of our island a water catchment area.
What that means
is that we have increased our local water catchment, and that is
also one reason why we could allow the first agreement – which was
1961, not 2011 − to lapse last year; because we have enough in our
current menu of choices. The latest two reservoirs, the Punggol
and Serangoon reservoirs, were commissioned last year. And that,
together with Marina Reservoir, has led to our current situation
where we have, given current circumstances, maximised our water
catchment area. But that is not enough. I have told PUB that we
need to expand our water catchment area until we cover all meaningful land
areas in Singapore. Now, that poses a special challenge because
it means we have to ensure that the quality of water drawn from
all the catchments, or literally, from all land in Singapore, is
suitable for treatment to potable standards, and eventually through your
tap, to end up as a glass of water for you to drink or to make formula
milk with. </p>

every drain in Singapore leads to your tap. That requires obsessive
environmental engineering, enforcement, monitoring, cooperation
and community ownership by every single Singaporean. And we have
to make sure that all activities on our island do not pollute our
reservoirs, and we have to regularly update the processes in our
six waterworks. If you look at the chart, as it evolves, apart from desalinated
water, which I will explain more on, and NEWater, you will notice
we have 17 reservoirs and we have seven treatment plants – six in
Singapore and one in Johor.</p>

just now, because of variability in weather and the fact, therefore,
that we cannot assume we will always have surface water available,
we have had to increase the resilience of our water supply by expanding
rainfall-independent sources, that is, basically the other two taps
− desalinated water and NEWater. The construction of our second
desalination plant in Tuas commenced last year and will be ready
next year. When that is ready, we will have a capacity of 100 million
gallons per day of desalinated water. In the longer term, we will
also have to increase our capacity for NEWater. Currently, it stands
at about 120 million gallons per day. We will have to step that
up progressively over the next decade or two. In the long run, by
2061, we expect that desalination will provide about 30% of our
water needs and NEWater will provide 50% of our water needs. This
means that we will still be dependent on surface water for the remaining
20%. </p>

about electro-chemical desalting and Memstill. These are new technologies
which are still in evaluation. The results are not in yet, but I
assure you that we will, in Singapore, always be amongst the first
to test whatever is new. In particular, what we are looking for
is lower energy expenditure in order to produce fresh water. The
key thing that has changed in the last 10 years, with the advent
of membrane technology, is that now water <em class="ph i">per se</em> is not the
limiting factor. It is energy. As long as you have energy, you can
produce water good enough to drink, and water good enough for consumption.
So Mr Pritam Singh's question about maximum population size − if
you had asked that question 10 years ago − water would have been
a limiting factor. Today, water is not the rate-limiting factor.
There are other rate-limiting factors for population size, but I
do not intend to go into that now.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-fe7eed7e-28e4-45e6-bb18-cf544fa96791"><!--a--></a>We need to continue to
make investments to build up all these Four National Taps and we
need to improve the security, the diversity and the resilience of
our water supply, and it has to survive 50 years and beyond because
we are planning for 2061. From these Four National Taps – from the
seven water treatment plants, the water goes to 14 service reservoirs.
These are usually reservoirs on high land because from there, it
gravitates down to the 1.3 million premises, about 1.1 million or
1.2 million households where people live, and the other 100,000
or 200,000 of commercial premises. You will notice that I have put down
high-level water tanks. All of you here have HDB blocks to look after.
On top of every HDB block, there are between three and five high-level
water tanks, and so there are 54,000 high-level water tanks. I have
put all these so that you understand that high-level water tanks
in HDB blocks are a critical piece of national infrastructure. Although
the Town Councils are in charge of maintaining and looking after
them and ensuring security, this is a national project. If I can
move on to another slide, I want to also point out that we now have
a closed water loop. That means after water is used, it goes into
our sewers, and mind you, we have 3,400 kilometres of sewers and
also a deep tunnel sewerage system, 50 metres deep into the ground,
which ultimately leads to our water reclamation plants, and then
it is treated. First, we have to treat it to the level where it
is fit for discharge into the sea. Then, another separate pre-treatment
and reverse osmosis is needed to make it suitable for use, for potable
or, in our case, indirect potable use. </p>

going through all this because I wanted to address Mr Low's question.
His question basically was: are we overcharging for water? Well,
this entire chart which I have put up here, our plan for a 50-year
safe, secure, resilient supply of water for our country does not
come cheap. If you look at the annual report of PUB − which has
been laid on the Table, so all Members should have access to it
− it costs us basically $1.3 billion a year to run the system that
you see. Can it be done cheaper? Of course, it can be cheaper, and
you can cut corners and not be so worried about future reliability.
But this is what it costs. Mr Low asked about the charges. Again,
if you look at the annual report, for the sale of water (that is,
water tariffs), for the financial year that ended March 2011, PUB
collected $674 million. For the waterborne fee and the sanitary appliance
fee, it collected about $327 million. You can do a quick arithmetic.
You know that is nowhere near $1.3 billion. Even if you add the
water conservation tax, you still do not reach $1.3 billion. So,
the point is, we are not overcharging for water as far as funding
the system which we have.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-89e90ef9-8a88-499f-84ce-942453db706c">
                  <a name="budget__id-89e90ef9-8a88-499f-84ce-942453db706c"><!--a--></a>In fact, we are right
here in the Budget debate, because my Ministry, and in particular PUB,
is asking Parliament to approve an operating expenditure of $224
million and another $400 million of development expenditure for
PUB because we need to continue investing in the system. So, I want
to give the assurance to Mr Low and to all Singaporeans that we
are not profiteering or overcharging for water. If you want to lower
the prices further, you can, but it just means we have to come back
to Parliament and ask for more tax revenue. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7f4273ab-69f3-4eb9-a788-17b691f70bdf">
                  <a name="budget__id-7f4273ab-69f3-4eb9-a788-17b691f70bdf"><!--a--></a>But I think it is very
important for us to understand that we have to right-price water. The
Water Conservation Tax is a signal to remind all of us that water
is precious, it is a scarce commodity and, indeed, our nation's
survival and viability depends on it. So please do not waste it.
I did consider consolidating the sanitary appliance fee and the waterborne
fee, as Mr Low suggested, to make it all a volumetric charge. But
because this year's Budget's theme was "An Inclusive Society", when
I tried to merge the sanitary appliance fee and the waterborne fee
into a single volumetric charge, I realised that would mean charging
smaller households more. In a sense, the larger households with more
toilets would get a bigger discount. I did not think that was right
for this year's climate, so I decided we would not change the two.
But I give you the assurance that the combination of the waterborne
fee and sanitary appliance fee is still less than the cost of treating
used water. I would also like to confirm for this year that there
will be no change
to water tariffs and water charges, because I am assuming that Parliament
will approve the Budget and give PUB the additional tax dollars
that it needs in order to continue investing in the water system. </p>

building energy management capabilities and investing in new technologies.
We have a scheme called the Grant for Energy Efficient Technologies.

27 companies. This is supposed to generate about $163 million in
cost savings over the lifespan of the equipment. </p>

consumption in households, we have the Minimum Energy Performance
Standards (MEPS) which I am glad that Dr Teo has supported. So far,
this has been implemented for refrigerators and air conditioners,

therefore we avoid consumers being locked into high operating cost
of running inefficient appliances. We will be further tightening
the energy performance standards for household air conditioners
and refrigerators by the end of 2013. The same Minimum Energy Performance
Standards will also be extended to general lighting by 2014 and
we will consider extending this scheme to other appliances, such

air quality. The major sources of air pollution in Singapore are
the oil refineries, power plants and motor vehicles. We currently
impose safe emission standards and progressively cleaner fuels on
our industry. Sulphur dioxide (SO<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>) and fine particulate
matter (PM2.5) remain pollutants of concern. In order to curb SO<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>,
we require industries to use fuel oil with a low sulphur content
of not more than 1%. To further lower PM2.5, NEA will require all
new diesel vehicles registered on or after 1 January 2014 to meet
mandatory Euro V standards and the introduction of near-sulphur
free diesel for Euro V diesel vehicles will further reduce emissions

the House on the ABC Waters programme – "Active, Beautiful and Clean".
It may have started off by making it more beautiful and getting community
support and ownership, and that continues to be important. But now
it has also become clear that it is also part of the solution for
dealing with floods and for preparing for climate vulnerability.
For instance, in two weeks' time, the Prime Minister will open the
new Bishan Park where the Kallang River flows through. It used to
be just a canal. Today, if you go there, it is a meandering river.
But if you watch it with a more technical
eye, we have actually created a system in which its carrying capacity
has actually increased; and it also now serves a dual function,
not just cosmetic and community support, but also a functional drainage
purpose.</p>

Miss Penny Low highlighted the importance of the 3P approach. While

Peng's suggestion that we need to make our national events more
environmentally friendly. I think all of us remember the sight when

to me was not just the football, but the fact that after the million
people left, it was clean. </p>

of community and public spiritedness, that we leave a venue better
than when we first arrived at it. And I also agree with Mr Seah
that even at the organisational level, we need to do better. For
instance, I am always slightly amused when we have a health promotion
event and the food is not all that healthy, or when we have a recycling
event, I notice we are still using plastic cups and all other paraphernalia, which
may not necessarily be environmentally friendly. So, we need to
do all these things with a certain amount of planning, a certain
amount of forethought and a certain amount of consideration. And
the key thing, again, is to persuade people that each of us has
a responsibility and has to become part of the solution.</p>

that making a choice to care for our environment has to reflect our
values as a nation: that people come first, that convenience or
profits should not come at the expense of the health or well-being
of our families; and that everyone has the same equal right to clean
air, clean water and green spaces. If we can bear these in mind,
and if I can count on the support of Members of the House for the
programmes that we are running, both in the short term and long
term, I think we can continue to do our part to build a liveable
and sustainable Singapore as our home, and as a working model of
the future to our children and grandchildren.</p>

first, I would like to ask if the Ministry would consider giving

in running the hawker stalls. Next clarification is on "no smoking
at parks". Just now the Senior Minister of State mentioned that
it will be carried out at some selected parks. I would like to ask:

that we intend to accept the recommendations and the management
of the new centre should be by social enterprises, probably a co-operative,
and I hope there will be more than one co-operative or other social
enterprises that will step up to the plate. So, these local decisions

Ms Grace Fu expressed our position that in the long run, we want
no smoking in public areas unless otherwise designated. In other
words, today we have a list of areas where you are not allowed to
smoke. In the future, I think we will have a positive list of areas
where you are allowed to smoke and everywhere else, you are not allowed
to do it. But we have to manage this transition, taking into account
local conditions and local support for it. So, that is why, for
instance, hawker centres and parks, we want the local community
to decide collectively and take ownership, whether they want to
have a "Blue Ribbon" park or a "Blue Ribbon" hawker centre, and
then it is a community decision. It is not something top-down that
has been forced upon them. I believe we need to move towards such
a system because you cannot have an NEA officer everywhere trying
to enforce rules which the community is not prepared to support.
So, I have expressed our long-term position and that the transition
will have to be guided by community support. On the pace and extent
of the non-smoking zones, the community has to decide. </p>

the Senior Minister of State earlier on responded to my cut on "midges"
which has been a problem faced by Bedok Reservoir residents. Sir,
I would like to complain to you that there is nothing new in her
response to me. I read all the content from the newspapers. What
I wanted to know is, what is the long-term solution to the problem?
And I understand that they have engaged an external expert to do
some research into the problem. May I know what is the progress
so far? And please do not tell me that they are using larvacide
again. They used it last year, but the problem remains the same.
So, what I want to know is: what can the residents at Bedok Reservoir area
expect this year? Will we be facing the same problem again? Fire-fight
the "midges" and going to fog every day? </p>

is pertaining to water. The Minister said that PUB did not overcharge
Singaporeans for water. He referred to the collection of Conservation
Tax plus the waterborne fee and appliance fee. Perhaps, I think
he should let us know what is the cost per cubic metre of water
PUB produces and what is the effective tariff that PUB charges Singaporeans
or the household users. What do I mean by effective tariff − you
have a tariff on the first 40 cubic metres of water and different
tariffs after that. That is tariff on the water, and that is excluding
water conservation tax, appliance fee and waterborne fee. So, if
you take all that in, what is the effective tariff per cubic metre
that you charge Singaporeans <em class="ph i">vis-a-vis</em> the cost per cubic
metre of water that PUB produces?</p>

Let me deal with the water issue. That is far more important, with
due respect. You are aware of the tariffs that are charged. If you
are not, it is all available in the Annual Report. </p>

back to the overall system because we need to ensure that Singapore
will have a secure and reliable supply of water even when contracts
expire, even when
we face droughts, and even if there are any accidents or other disasters
in parts of our island. That should immediately tell you, it is
not a simple matter of how much it costs to buy water from Malaysia,
or to even get water from a desalination plant. You have to pay
for the cost of an entire system. And this is all very transparent
and it is laid before Parliament. It costs PUB $1.3 billion to run
a water system that we have today. And it is also equally transparent
that for a household that consumes less than 40 cubic metres a month,
the tariff is $1.17 per cubic metre, plus a Water Conservation Tax.
So, they will end up paying about $1.52 per cubic metre. That is
for potable water. For water that has to be treated, the Waterborne
Fee is $0.28 per cubic metre. Then there is a Sanitary Appliance
Fee of about $2.80 per latrine or water closet.</p>

can go through the figures with you to show that, on used water, we
are not collecting what it costs to treat the water to a standard
where it can be discharged into the sea. This is excluding the cost
of treating it as NEWater and making it safe for use. So, the figures
are all there, and I would like you to go through this, in detail
with me if you like, and we will show you that, in order to provide
the water system which I have described, we still require tax subvention
from Parliament. So, if you are proposing that we lower water tariffs,
I would suggest that we do not, because let us talk about real life. </p>

3-room HDB flat pays about $30 per month. Now we also have the U-Save
scheme, part of the GST offset scheme, which gives between $110
and $240 a year. What we have is a system in which a scarce, precious
commodity is right-priced so people do not waste. At the same time,
we have vouchers for the lower income, so that people can always
afford the water and electricity that they need. It is far better
to do it this way than to do what many other countries have done,
where they subsidise water or they give it at a fixed price, at
a level which causes people to not regard it as something precious.
If a leak springs up in your pipe, you just let it leak. I have
lived in a country like that. More importantly, there is also no
signal to the private sector to invest in infrastructure, to provide
technology and infrastructure for the future. So, the challenge
for us is to make sure our system is resilient, that we right-price
water, and that water remains affordable to everyone. On all these
three counts, I submit that the answer is yes.</p>

it. As far as Denmark, teams are studying the problems of why we
have a sudden increase in the population of such insects. Some have
attributed this to climate change, rainfall, the amount of nutrients
in the water. The truth is, I do not think anybody has been able
to lay their hands on the exact cause of the explosion of "midges". </p>

Mr Low will hear the same reasons in the House, and outside from
the papers, because we are trying our best and explaining what we
are doing. What we
are doing right now with the use of larvacide is what we know at
this point in time to be the most effective method. Of course, if
the Aljunied Town Council is able to fumigate and destroy the adult
population, then we will not have the larvae and the eggs being bred
in the water. But is that a realistic goal? I think all of us who
are involved in the management of municipal issues would know that
we have not been able to wipe out the population of flies, mosquitoes
and, now, probably "midges". So we are not taking a position that
this part is PUB's solution and this part is Town Council's solution.
We are taking a collaborative approach, working with the Town Council
to address the whole problem of the life cycle of "midges" from,
if you like, cradle to grave. And, hopefully, we can find a way
to break the cycle more effectively. And if Mr Low, with his experience
in Aljunied Town Council, is able to give us suggestions as to what
more we can do, we would be most happy to consider it. </p>

have something to add as well − back to high-rise littering. The
Senior Minister of State talked about the difficulty in enforcing
as well as prosecuting the high-rise litterers, which I agree is
difficult. That is why I spoke about having really stronger measures
to take care of this problem and also to do it with skill. We know
there is some equipment there but are we going to step up on this
so that more and different parts of Singapore and the towns will
all have this equipment to monitor it?</p>

I would just like to clarify that this will not be our first response to
any complaints of high-rise littering. We still believe that going
down the route of engaging the community and getting the community
to cooperate probably promotes better neighbourliness than if we
were to send in an enforcement officer at the very first complaint.
So, we would still like to go through this process of Town Councils,
together with the grassroots organisations, approaching the supposed
culprit to execute public education exercises as the first way to
manage local littering problems rather than to send in an enforcement
team to address every single complaint at the first instance. </p>

I thank Mr Seah for that additional question. As I said, I agree
with him. If we look at last year's National Day Parade as an example,
the organisers made
sure that there were sufficient litter bins and recycling bins and
that the waste and the recyclables that were collected, we are actually
keeping track of it at the NEA level. At the Clean and Green Singapore
events held last year, we ensured that the exhibits were made of
recycled materials. We also ensured that they were portable exhibits
so that they could be reused. We had recycling bins provided; we
used energy-saving light bulbs and made sure that the events were
held near MRT stations so that people could take public transport.
So, we have made a start but I agree with Mr Seah that we can do
more. </p>

Thank you, Mr Chairman, for allowing me to join in the debate. I
have a question on the operating model of the hawker centres. Earlier,
the Minister said that he intends to accept all of the Panel's proposals, so
I would like to ask regarding the model of letting the social enterprises
run the operations. Will the Ministry be keeping a very close watch
on the rents and the way the operations will be run? I consider
the provision of hawker centres to be essential social goods, to
make food prices affordable to everybody. I am concerned that sometimes when
we let market forces take over the provision of social goods, we
can end up with rising cost, just like we saw industrial spaces
going to REITs and then prices have been creeping up. So, is there
some assurance that there will be very close monitoring on the way
this is run, especially when more and more hawker centres are being
run by social enterprises?</p>

First, I better clarify that I did not say that I would accept all
the recommendations of the Panel. I was referring to the Drainage
Panel. The Hawker Centre Panel has not submitted their final recommendations
yet, so I do not want to jump the gun. But let me tell you basically
how I see this. </p>

all of you to accept that hawker centres are social infrastructures.
Therefore, as the ultimate landlord, we are not trying to maximise rentals
from it. </p>

recommendation for social enterprise because, if you remember, when
I first announced that we would reverse this policy, I said that
I wanted the management to be a not-for-profit model. Basically,
you still need to be viable and to make ends meet. But you are not
out there as a real estate player and you are not engaging in arbitrage.
And what starts off as a hawking business becomes a real estate business.
All this is very easy to express but I am not going to underestimate
the difficulty of making it work in practice. </p>

the most successful co-operative is FairPrice. I give all due respect
to Mr Seah Kian Peng. It is a social enterprise, it has fulfilled
a social mission of ensuring commodities and essential food are
priced reasonably and provides competition. What I am hoping to
do by changing this hawker centre policy is, number one, increase
the supply of places. That should have some effect on prices, both
in terms of rental as well as the prices charged by hawkers. But
having said that, I do not believe that simply lowering rentals
by itself will necessarily lead to lower prices charged by hawkers.
At the end of the day, they are people making a living. They will
also try to charge what the market will bear. </p>

− let us not be overly simplistic in the way we implement this,
and also to be very careful that we do not get unintended consequences.
For now, if we can get a cooperative to run it, and the cooperative
knows that what we are after is cheap, good and clean food, and
that the people who are working there are Singaporeans, locals −
better still if they are people within the community, they are there
to make a living for themselves and they are preparing cooked fresh
food, good enough for their own families and friends to eat − I
think that will be an achievement. That already makes us unique,
because when we first created hawker centres, it was just a hygiene
measure – clear mobile hawkers on the streets. But this has taken
on a life of its own, it has become a unique icon of Singapore life.
I give the Member the assurance that we will certainly be watching
it very, very closely, and to watch the evolution of these new generation
hawker centres, that it does not deviate from the original objective.
Does the Member have a specific suggestion in mind?</p>

do not have a specific suggestion. I thank the Minister for the
answers. It is easier to control when we have one or two hawker
centres being run by a particular social enterprise. But I imagine
a day when maybe we have half or even more of our hawker centres
being run by social enterprises, and then they become a very sizeable
market force. So, would we want to start thinking right now how
do we set the KPIs to ensure that the outcomes will always be affordable
food, whether it is done through fixing the rent that they can charge
to the hawkers or through other means? I think we should think seriously
about this rather than leave it to market forces.</p>

pertaining to the issue of air. It is heartening to note that we are
now meeting the WHO guidelines. As far as I know, that is 10 microgrammes
of PM2.5 per cubic metre. In 2010, Singapore was at 17. I think
MEWR's aspirational guideline is 12, by 2020. I would like to ask
if we have already met the target of 10.</p>

pertains to the interest in Euro V. Euro V is better than Euro IV,
which is better than Euro III, which is better than Euro II. But
within Euro V, the issue is that diesel cars are, of course, restricted
to less carbon emissions compared to petrol cars. At the same time,
in terms of nitrous oxide and particulate matters, they are allowed
a higher percentage compared to petrol cars. So, if we instil PM2.5 requirements
for all diesel vehicles, carbon emissions will go down. But if more
cars switch to diesel, we might actually see more PM and nitrous
oxides going up in comparison to petrol cars. That is actually worse
for health.</p>

We meet the WHO interim standards II. WHO has three different standards

reached the final standard. But having said that, we do want to
make sure that we are at an internationally comparable standard

about Euro V. There are actually two different programmes. While
they are related, they are quite distinct. I think the Member was
referring to the Carbon Emissions Vehicle Scheme (CEVS), which is
meant to replace the Green Vehicles rebate. We thought the CEVS
is a better scheme than the current Green Vehicles rebate because
it is technology agnostic, meaning, it encourages you to get more
fuel-efficient cars. It sends a signal to you and also penalises
you if you use a less fuel-efficient car. That is what the CEVS
is about. I do not expect that the CEVS will result in an overnight
transformation of all petrol cars into diesel vehicles. I do not think
that will happen.</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
I can appreciate the attention that Mr Low is putting on this very
important topic. Let me update the House that we have commissioned
a three-year study. The objective of the study is: first of all,
to establish which species contribute to the mass emergence event;
also to compare the composition and abundance of the midges collected
and study that of the 1960s and to look at how it has changed over
time to 2011 and 2012; and to establish the inter-annual variation
in the key midges groups, and also to investigate the correlation
of the abundance of the adult and larval midges with meteorological
condition, season and water quality. </p>

Low, is really just to explain that this is a complex issue. As much
as we would like to study the problem with dengue and the emergence
of new serotypes, and how that would have changed, and be affected
by climate change, this is a complex issue. As much as we would
like to have an immediate solution, I do not think we can offer
any promise that it is going to be an immediate one, except to say
that the team will provide us with quarterly updates and we wish
them the very best in their discovery, because if we can leave them
to do their work, then perhaps they will be in a better position
to give us practical solutions. </p>

assure Mr Low again that PUB and NEA will do more than just putting
larvacide. We are also scrubbing – can you imagine PUB scrubbing
the sides of reservoirs – to clear off eggs and larvae? We are also
monitoring the amount of larvae that we are observing in our water
samples, to try to get ahead of the next cycle of population explosion
or whatever you may call it. So we are trying, as much as possible, to
be ahead of the game. But as I said, it is not an easy problem to
solve and we hope that all the parties, including the Town Council,
will also be part of our solution.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I have two questions. First, I would
like to join the chorus of thanks to the Minister and the Ministry
for reintroducing the hawker centre. My Punggol residents will definitely
be very happy and we cannot wait for it to come to Punggol. And it
would be even better if it is run on a social enterprise model.
On that note itself, I am not sure what the fear about social enterprises
becoming a big market force is about, because after all, social
enterprises in the case of hawker centres is not just about having good
or reasonably priced food. But if it also creates jobs for Singaporeans
and gives opportunities to small businesses to upgrade themselves,
then why not? The more the merrier. So, my question on the hawker
centre part, really, is would we have any fear about 10 hawker centres
all running on social enterprise models, and whether we could have
one in Punggol sooner than at the end of the 10 years itself. </p>

                  </span>: First
of all, I think the model that is recommended by the Panel based
on the social enterprise model is something that is very new to
us. We are very keen to adopt and pilot it. If it is successful
and can be replicated, I think we will definitely consider replicating
it and implementing it across all the 10 centres. On the other hand,
I think we just have to be mindful that if we can find alternative
models that are as effective, we may also consider alternatives
as well. So, we are not, in any way, bound to any fixed model at
this point in time. </p>

the key point is really, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh has said, delicious,
good and cheap food at convenient locations. I think that is really
our most important social objective. As for Punggol, I would just
like to clarify what I have said in my speech is that Punggol would
be the first of the seven in Phase One and we will complete it within
five years, not at the end of the 10 years. How would we try to encourage
more in the community? As I have said earlier on, whether it is
through MOE working with the youths and working with NGOs, I think
that we will try to get ground-up support for what we are doing
as far as keeping Singapore clean, green and beautiful for everybody
is concerned. </p>

I derive great joy and satisfaction treating young children and
seeing them get well. As a surgeon, I often have to perform surgery
on young children. As you may know, surgeries in the paediatric
age group are usually performed under general anaesthesia. Parents
would usually accompany their children into the operating theatre
and coax them till the anaesthetists administer medicine to make
them fall asleep. What happens after that is something I always
find very touching. After
the child is asleep, the parents would often reluctantly leave the
operating theatre. With tears of apprehension welling up in their
eyes and a helpless countenance, they leave the child in full trust
and faith in the surgeon and the team. There also seems to be this

there is one comment made of nursing as a profession which I want
to share with the House: "The hours and duties of a nurse are endless. Understanding
human emotions in connection with their physical illnesses can only
be undertaken by a very compassionate person. Nurses truly are the
doctor's other hand and usually do not receive the thanks that they
should. The only people who should go into nursing are those who
do not expect gratitude for their giving. They also should desire
to be a bright light in someone's day even when the going gets tough."</p>

to attract healthcare workers to meet our own needs, our very own
healthcare workers are also being lured by better salaries and prospects
overseas. At the same time, the growth of the private sector also
contributed to higher attrition from the public sector. With the
setting up of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and the Sengkang General

all disciplines. </p>

healthcare workers, the rapid growth in the residential population
also puts tremendous strain on our healthcare infrastructure. Over
the past 10 years, our total population comprising Singaporeans,
PRs and foreigners has grown by over 25% from four million to almost
five million. A recent newspaper article reported that Tan Tock
Seng Hospital had to resort to putting some patients along the corridors, where
they usually had to spend a night. These are scenes reminiscent
of news reports in 2010 and 2011. Even Singapore's latest hospital,
Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, has had to convert its rooftop garden into
an additional ward despite having opened only in 2010, so as to
cater for the need for more hospital beds. </p>

meet its challenge of ensuring adequate hospital beds to meet the
growing demand, this will be exacerbated by the silver tsunami.
A growing, ageing population would add to the hospital bed crunch
as many people would have more health needs and are likely to require
longer stays. There is an urgent need to enhance the capabilities
and capacity of intermediate and long-term care services, including
the infrastructure, financial, manpower and professional developments.
In addition, it is also imperative to look into homecare and caregiver
support as another priority area in managing the needs of the elderly
sick. The "right-siting" of care is, therefore, necessary to free
up resources in acute hospitals.</p>

families. Can there be special attention and care given to this group?
Due to the poor home environments, such patients will have deficient
support that will make their conditions worse. These patients will
also cause negative impact to the family members who are already
struggling themselves. They may also cause disturbances to their
neighbours and the community due to the exacerbation of their conditions
with unacceptable behaviours. For doctors, as soon as patients are
clinically stable and are ready to be discharged back to the community,
I feel we need a holistic approach in discharging their psychiatric
patients back to the community. We need to give tailored assistance
individually in the areas of financial, family and home support upon
discharge. Medical certificates for such patients should be issued
by doctors more willingly and for longer term so that at least they
are eligible for ComCare or Public Assistance, as it is often difficult
for such patients to find employment. There should be synergy between
MOH and MCYS on discharging such patients. MCYS can play a bigger role
to ensure better provision of community environments for such patients. </p>

Breast cancer is the commonest cancer for women and, in view of
rising expectancy of age, could MOH step up the promotion in getting
better participation of women in cancer screening in order to save
lives?</p>

Sir, recently, a few Members have brought up in this House the issue
of lack of beds at our restructured hospitals. I began to feel and
witness such phenomenon when I saw many patients being lined up
along corridors at the emergency department of a local hospital
when I was there recently. When I asked about such a phenomenon,
I was told that it was due to the lack of beds at the hospital.
I understand that this phenomenon is common at a few other hospitals,
too. I began to feel concerned about this and realise that there
is a gap in the demand for healthcare and the available infrastructure
to meet this demand. I feel more concerned when I start thinking
about the impending "silver tsunami".</p>

to ask the Minister to share with the House on the current gap between
the demand for healthcare and the available infrastructure in Singapore.
How is the Ministry tackling these stress points on our health infrastructure
and how does it ensure that Singaporeans receive the necessary and
reasonable healthcare standards? In the short run, can the Ministry
work with the private hospitals to take up a portion of the demand
so that Singaporeans' health matters are not compromised due to
the current constraints in the infrastructure? With the impending
ageing population, what are the Ministry's short-term and long term-strategies
to meet these needs?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, for some time now, our Government restructured
hospitals have been facing a bed crunch, as several Members before
me have mentioned. With the current high bed occupancy rate, can
we be sure that our hospital system will be able to cope in the
event of a major outbreak or national disaster without resulting
in preventable deaths? I appreciate that hospital staff and administrators
are doing their best to manage these space constraints, but perhaps we
need to explore other ways to free up bed space.</p>

all beds in acute care Government hospitals are non-subsidised beds.
In our largest hospital – Singapore General Hospital – non-subsidised beds
make up 28% of its beds. This is according to a reply from the Minister
to my Question last month. If these hospitals convert some of their
private wards to subsidised wards, can more bed space be created?</p>

have is the doctor shortage in our public hospitals. I recognise that
this is a long standing and multi-faceted issue which has no simple
solution. Apart from recruiting more doctors, I believe more can
be done to make the best of the existing resources. According to <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits
Times</em>' report on 1 March 2012, the pay structure in public hospitals
includes three components: first, a basic salary, which is the same across
doctors of the same grade; second, an allowance pegged to medical
speciality with doctors doing surgery getting more; and, third,
a fee scheme determined by the type of patients the doctor treats.
A doctor who sees non-subsidised patients will earn more under the
scheme than one who treats more subsidised patients. A doctor who sees
non-subsidised patients who are foreigners earns even more.</p>

component, the fee scheme has an effect of incentivising doctors to
see private and foreign patients over subsidised local patients.
Is it possible that some senior doctors are seeing a high proportion
of private patients and leaving the subsidised patients to the more
junior doctors? If so, would the subsidised patients be losing out
because the more senior doctors spend less time seeing them? Or
will the junior
doctors get burnt out by the high patient load contributing to their
departure for private practice?</p>

to the fee scheme component to reward doctors based on the number

this will more fairly compensate doctors who shoulder a higher patient

reduce waiting time as well as improve the quality of care, especially
for subsidised patients.</p>

Sir, this year's Budget has seen significant increase in spending
for healthcare and rightly so with an ageing population in Singapore.
I would like to thank the Government for the various measures ranging
from hospitalisation subsidies for the middle income, increase in
hospital beds and top-ups to Medisave accounts. With the doubling
of the healthcare budget, I would like to understand from the Minister
how are we able to ensure that it would not lead to an over-consumption
of health services, such that it will stretch the system beyond
the threshold of our healthcare professionals. </p>

is a very challenging profession which can be both physically and
emotionally draining. As the Executive Secretary for the Healthcare
Services Employees' Union, we are often concerned about the welfare,
working conditions, recruitment and retention of quality healthcare
employees and professionals in our restructured hospitals, community
hospitals and nursing homes. We do not want to have a return saga
of seeing how another elderly folk has been mistreated and being thrown
onto the bed in a nursing home due to stressed out and unmotivated
healthcare staff. There should be an overall improvement in the
quality of services rendered as well as a better environment to
help the patients to recover.</p>

looking at a review of the pay of healthcare workers, in particular,
doctors, nurses and allied health professionals across our public
healthcare institutions. I thank MOH in advance. But I sincerely
urge MOH, in its review, to also consider the non-nursing staff
and employees who work alongside these healthcare professionals
in our public healthcare institutions who provide the necessary
support and backbone to ensure the entire healthcare eco-system
"works". In particular, I am extremely concerned for this group
of non-nursing staff, such as the patient-care associates and ward
clerks, who are often at the frontline with patients and whose salaries
are at the lower end of the pay scale. NTUC, e2i, the Healthcare
Services Employees' Union as well as the institutions have been
working very closely at projects to raise the productivity, re-create
and re-design the jobs at this lower end in the institutions. I
hope the efforts will not be derailed by the revision of wages of
only the professionals. In fact, I hope MOH and MOH Holdings will
take an even bolder step to work with the healthcare cluster of
unions and the institutions to uplift these healthcare employees
at the lower rung of the pay scale so that they will receive "better
jobs, better pay and better prospects".</p>

for home care. While the increase in financial subsidies will be
greatly helpful to families, it would be even better if there can be
integrated home care comprising of a multi-disciplinary team of
nurses, therapists and healthcare workers to provide the necessary
support systems and structures. As a team, they can better look
after the patients while the primary caregivers are away at work.
Recently, I met a resident who had wanted to keep her aged mother
at home to care for her instead of a nursing home or a community
hospital. However, she encountered difficulties in the application
for a work permit to employ a domestic worker whom she planned to
engage to help look after her mum due to her monthly remuneration.
My point is, besides the various initiatives and programmes by MOH
and its community partners, our policies should support, encourage
and incentivise home care to ensure we create a whole-of-Government
approach to healthcare.</p>

would be the increase in elderly psychiatric patients and how effective
we have been in taking care of them. I would like to ask the Minister
with regard to the Budget, will we see an increase in the funds
to be allocated to set up more rehabilitative facilities? How are
we also able to increase the financial support to needy families
with mental patients so that they can better take care of them?
If early detection helps in the treatment of mental illnesses, how
are we able to provide the education to the public to raise awareness
for early checks?</p>

Sir, as Singapore progresses in its ageing population journey, we
will certainly require additional manpower to care for our elders

to enter the healthcare workforce, develop and retain them. I feel
that we need to do more to attract Singaporeans medical professionals
who are practising overseas to come back and serve our nation's

giving to ensure that we have a comprehensive network that cares

                  </span>: Sir,
the objective of having a national electronic health records system
is to enable each person to have only one medical record that is accessible
to all healthcare professionals. This system is good as it allows
medical professionals, including those from private hospitals, polyclinics
and step-down care services, to access the medical record of the
patient they are treating, including previous diagnostic examination
of the patient done at other medical institutions. This will enable them
to do a more accurate diagnosis of the patient. I also believe this
will help to cut down healthcare cost in the long run. I would like
to know when will the whole system be completed and implemented,
and what can the medical professionals as well as the public expect
from the system.</p>

a subsidised patient who gets a prescription from a doctor at a
restructured hospital must go back to the pharmacy at that hospital
to get it filled. If he goes to another restructured hospital or
more likely a polyclinic nearer his home to get it filled, he will
not get the medication at subsidised rates. Some restructured hospitals
have home delivery services, but usually the fees are waived only if
the cost of medication exceeds a certain sum.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, in the
parliamentary answer on 14 February this year, the Ministry confirmed
that public hospitals operate their pharmacies as revenue centres.
In other words, public hospitals mark up their drugs for sale to
patients. It was stated that the typical range of mark-up was between
5% and 30%, implying that the mark-up could be even higher than
30% for certain drugs. The rationale for this is to help hospitals
earn revenue to defray their overall operating costs. This latitude
given to public hospitals results in the same drugs being priced
differently at different hospitals. Take for instance the drug Mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF) which is used in the treatment of auto-immune diseases
and for transplant patients. One tablet of MMF 500 mg is sold at
$2.75 at SGH and NUH but $3.31 at TTSH and $3.87 at CGH. The prices
quoted are the subsidised prices for transplant patients under the
Standard Drug List II, showing a variation of 40% among the public
hospitals. I understand that non-transplant patients who need the
drug for other conditions would pay significantly more. This disparity
of one tablet is magnified manifold for patients who typically need
to take several tablets a day over a prolonged period. </p>

drug Epoetin beta used in the treatment of anemia in kidney patients.
This is a non-standard drug but recently included for means-tested
subsidy under the medical assistance fund. An injection of 4,000
IU dosage costs $24.67 per syringe at TTSH, but $35.77 at CGH –
a difference of more than $10. Members of the public have expressed
surprise and confusion as to why different hospitals in the public sector
charge such varying prices for the same drugs. Why are the prices
of drugs not standardised throughout the public hospitals? Is the
variation partly due to the hospitals being organised into two clusters
which acquire their drugs separately? Is it feasible instead for
all hospitals to buy drugs together for greater economies of scale
to reduce prices
for their patients? More importantly, should public hospitals use
their pharmacies as profit centres in the first place?</p>

that healthcare costs are upper most in many Singaporeans' minds,
and that include drug costs. For non-standard drugs which are not subsidised,
is it not more equitable to price them based on cost recovery, plus
a small addition for administrative costs rather than to let public
hospitals make profits from the sales?</p>

explain the nature of the subsidies given for drugs on the subsidised
list and the Medical Assistance Fund? For instance, under part 2
of the Standard Drug List, the drugs can be subsidised at 50%. There
are also 13 drugs under the Medical Assistance Fund list which can
be subsidised up to 75%. Are these subsidies based on the selling
prices rather than the cost prices, that is, if the drugs have been marked
up, the subsidy is a discount of the marked-up price? Is it just
a market subsidy?</p>

I really hesitate to come forward again, hat in hand, to ask for

Even though we are one of the best countries in terms of healthcare

Government spending on healthcare was only 1.1% of GDP, and 7.1%

people think that Singapore does poorly in terms of "fairness of
financing" but ranks very highly in terms of healthcare effectiveness.
Singapore's philosophy of self-reliance means that there are considerable
out-of-pocket expenses. Even the 3M system – Medisave, MediShield
and Medifund – only comprises 10% of the patient's total healthcare expenditure.
This 10% figure comes from a published article by an NUS professor
at the School of
Medicine in 2004. Sir, I do not have the latest data. The Ministry

of financing", I would like to speak about the American healthcare
system a little. Dr David Himmelstein, the lead author of an important
study on healthcare and personal bankruptcies and also an Associate
Professor of Medicine at Harvard, said: "Unless you're Bill Gates
you're just one serious illness away from bankruptcy. Most of the
medically bankrupt were average Americans who happened to get sick."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-87c8ff75-c162-4585-85d4-9b988e46bca8">
                  <a name="budget__id-87c8ff75-c162-4585-85d4-9b988e46bca8"><!--a--></a>This professor had conducted
a study which said that about half of the personal bankruptcies
in America were due to healthcare costs. It found out that health
insurance policies − with high deductibles, co-pays, and many exclusions
− offer little protection during a serious illness. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7a7110b6-b4bb-42a3-b9b8-68529abd3df1">
                  <a name="budget__id-7a7110b6-b4bb-42a3-b9b8-68529abd3df1"><!--a--></a>A new study found that
the majority of debt among bankrupt consumers comprised non-medical
expenditures. When medical debts do partially contribute to bankruptcy, they
are likely to come from expensive, cutting-edge and end-of-life
treatments that are not covered by public insurance. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-527fa554-bfb9-4833-b55c-8066becd85e8">
                  <a name="budget__id-527fa554-bfb9-4833-b55c-8066becd85e8"><!--a--></a>For me, the lesson is
this – health is not just a matter of doctors and hospitals and drugs.
It is also a matter for jobs, frugality and personal provision.
Medical care and management is therefore a joint responsibility
of government, medical institutions and professionals, and the individuals.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-34409b36-862e-49ff-b8a8-8d4e9d91ca2e">

moment the state funds about one-third of Singapore's total health
costs. Individuals and their employers pay for the rest. With the
increase, this proportion will be more, but the fact is that more
than half of healthcare spending still comes from people or their
companies. Financial literacy is therefore a big part of healthcare
management in life, especially today, when there appears to be a tremendous
number of decisions that can be made by patients. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-104188b6-b415-4d38-a6ee-07d18b94f754">

− the information symmetry is important. Often, we are asked to
make important decisions that have impact not just on health outcomes
but also on finances. Who can then act as an honest broker between
healthcare providers and patients? In my opinion, the Singapore
Medical Association (SMA) can be the body to do this function.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2635be6e-83fe-4eff-83ae-f5b1f3092db8">
                  <a name="budget__id-2635be6e-83fe-4eff-83ae-f5b1f3092db8"><!--a--></a>Sir, I am of the knowledge
that true, SMA is not a disinterested body, and true, it has the
interest of doctors at its core because they are after all its members.
But SMA answers to a higher ethical code, greater than the sum of
its own part. Hence, in this case, I think that we need a band of
doctors to look after patients, not in a specific medical sense,
but in the sense of producing clear guidelines for fees, treatments
and options.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a32f3b7a-45b5-4b98-8faf-ae39cd3f328d">
                  <a name="budget__id-a32f3b7a-45b5-4b98-8faf-ae39cd3f328d"><!--a--></a>The SMA has proven that
it can do this role in the past when it provided guidelines for
doctors' fees. This acted for many years as a general benchmark
for doctors as well as for patients as to what is a fair expected
fee. This guideline, however, was removed a few years ago because
it was thought to be anti-competitive. However, on the ground, many
patients do not see it that way. There have been senior citizens
telling me that they would
know their medical fees in the past. But, now, they do not know
how much they need to pay until the nurses give them the bills.
So to the elderly, knowing how much are doctors' fees in advance
means a lot to them in managing their limited financial resources
and savings. Hence, I hope the Ministry can consider bringing back
doctors' fee guidelines.</p>

to ask the SMA to take on an additional advisory and educational role,
so that patients will make better decisions. I remember under Minister
Khaw Boon Wan, the hospitals are obliged to make their fees transparent,
which is a great step forward. But this may be more an incentive
for hospitals to improve as they benchmark against one another.
For the patients, not all things can be compared on price and medical
treatments.</p>

just in terms of data on fees but interpretation of data of a wider
and more nuanced scope. So, in this aspect, I urge the Minister
to either provide SMA funding for this public advisory and educational
role, or require the Ministry or the Health Promotion Board to do
this function itself.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, the
Budget focuses on increasing the support level for rising healthcare
costs through greater cash contributions into CPF accounts. Put
simply, this is the same as asking Singaporeans to forgo cash to
put up with rising medical costs. This is no different from past
Budgets. </p>

shared his $8 billion budget to expand medical infrastructure such
as ramping up healthcare services facilities. The question now is, how
does that manage healthcare costs in the longer term in a sustainable
manner? </p>

in Potong Pasir, in which Singaporeans might not be able to afford
adequate treatment. Some Singaporeans, especially the elderly, have
to seek treatment and surgery, and even buy standard drugs in Malaysia
because they cannot afford these back home. The costs of subsidised
drugs and non-standard drugs not covered by insurance are rising. </p>

is to conduct an international benchmarking exercise of medical
costs here against other developed cities in our region such as
Hong Kong and Shanghai. It is a known conundrum that healthcare
services will see ever-increasing costs as long as we fool ourselves
by thinking that the problem can be solved just by increasing the
pot of money available to cover the rising medical costs. </p>

at the same time: one, the Government should help Singaporeans provide
for future medical costs; two, the Government should proactively manage
healthcare costs. The solution for increasing medical fees cannot
always be a one-sided reduction of cash from Singaporean pockets.</p>

of our healthcare industry is also very important. A consultancy
study, led by the Ministry of Health, should be conducted to ensure
our cost components are reasonable when compared to international
standards. </p>

medical records be digitalised at the national level, so that the patient
records can be easily retrieved and transferred among medical institutions.
This could set the
ground for future virtual medical services, in which Singaporeans
can have access to more affordable medical services by harnessing
Information Technology.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: First,
I want to thank the several Members who have contributed very important
speeches and raised a number of important issues. These are very
critical issues that are facing the healthcare sector today and
these are also the issues that have kept MOH staff and myself awake
at night, particularly last night, and I am sure many more nights
to come. Before I address the specific issues raised by our Members,
I think it is useful for me to give an overview of our healthcare
system so as to provide the context to discuss these issues.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-14debdbc-7548-4a43-af94-0e2cf068d01e"><!--a--></a>Singapore's healthcare
has made good progress over the years. Our life expectancy has steadily
increased from 78 years in 2001 to almost 82 years in 2010. Infant
mortality has also fallen from 2.5 to 2.0 per 1,000 live births
over the same period. These achievements place us in the top quartile
of OECD countries, on par with First World countries like France
and Sweden. We have also shown steady improvement in other indicators,
such as reducing premature mortality. For example, the death rate
for heart diseases among adult Singaporeans aged 35 to 64 fell from
76.2 per 100,000 in 2001 to 49.9 in 2010. Like Mr Sam Tan said,
it is not how much we spent, but how we spend the healthcare dollars.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ea73421c-ab2e-490a-9b70-c7fbd922a7c3"><!--a--></a>Sir, we have achieved
these results on the back of a sound and sustainable financing system,
including a multi-layer safety net. Our strong economic growth in
the past has also provided us with the necessary resources to invest
in our healthcare system to achieve these healthcare outcomes. However,
there are areas where we can still do better, especially in preparing
ourselves for the challenges ahead of us, which I will now elaborate. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c8292d49-23dd-4b6a-b625-ed05a2eeb185">
                  <a name="budget__id-c8292d49-23dd-4b6a-b625-ed05a2eeb185"><!--a--></a>My Ministry is committed
to improving the healthcare system to achieve better outcomes, so
that Singaporeans can live well and enjoy peace of mind. However,
this will always be work-in-progress because we need to continuously
respond to the evolving needs of Singaporeans. At the same time,
we have to keep healthcare affordable for our people and our society
as a whole. I see a few challenges ahead of us. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9d5b904d-2909-45b1-8f2f-d1fca79e7538">
                  <a name="budget__id-9d5b904d-2909-45b1-8f2f-d1fca79e7538"><!--a--></a>The first challenge is
the combined impact of a growing and ageing population. The impact
of it is on our capacity needs. Our population grew 25% over 10
years and will continue to grow over the next decade. Healthcare
services will have to grow too to meet the rising needs. Our population
is also ageing very rapidly. By 2030, one in five Singaporean residents
will be aged 65 and above. This is a threefold increase to 960,000 elderly,
from about 350,000 today. The ageing population will be a strong
driver for healthcare demand, as the elderly require a higher intensity
of medical care. They are also
likely to stay longer once hospitalised. This will have tremendous
impact on the overall healthcare demand in future. Already, we are
seeing signs of capacity constraints across the system – from high
bed occupancy rates to long waiting times for appointments, as Assoc
Prof Dr Faishal has pointed out.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2110</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a9d240e4-4b3a-49e4-87e1-6231eeaab672">
                  <a name="budget__id-a9d240e4-4b3a-49e4-87e1-6231eeaab672"><!--a--></a>Second, the ageing population
also requires changes to how we organise and deliver our healthcare.
In the past, care was focused primarily on the acute hospitals.
This was not wrong, as our population was younger and our diseases
were more episodic in nature. With increasing life expectancy and
more sedentary lifestyles, we are faced with a growing burden of
chronic diseases. We have therefore been focusing now more on keeping
people healthy and managing their chronic conditions in the community
which is more effective and sustainable in the long term. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-af54921a-6c7d-4f0b-91ae-eff45f2baf87">
                  <a name="budget__id-af54921a-6c7d-4f0b-91ae-eff45f2baf87"><!--a--></a>Finally, we need to actively
manage the rise in healthcare costs, as many MPs have mentioned.
Around the world, many governments are struggling to contain rising
costs and Singapore too is not spared from the effects of global
healthcare inflation. We thus need to constantly innovate to stay
cost-effective in how we deliver care to ensure that healthcare
remains affordable for everyone.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-38ae220f-9939-4d10-a929-0043c8419d9d">
                  <a name="budget__id-38ae220f-9939-4d10-a929-0043c8419d9d"><!--a--></a>Several Members, such
as Dr Lam Pin Min, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Dr Lily Neo, asked how the
Government plans to address these challenges ahead of us. Let me
now speak a little bit on the broader shifts that our healthcare
system must make to prepare for the future.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5047467e-7883-4a7b-ab71-db91cd64e0b2">
                  <a name="budget__id-5047467e-7883-4a7b-ab71-db91cd64e0b2"><!--a--></a>The 1993 White Paper,
quite a long time ago, articulated the basic principles and objectives
of our healthcare policies. Many of these remain sound and relevant
today. The concept of co-payment, for example, continues to be a
fundamental feature of our healthcare design, to encourage personal
ownership of one's health and to discourage over-consumption of
healthcare services. Another design objective that remains relevant
is to nurture a healthy nation by promoting good health, as a healthy
population will reduce downstream healthcare costs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-70fbd650-2d33-485f-9244-32c15dae12a8">
                  <a name="budget__id-70fbd650-2d33-485f-9244-32c15dae12a8"><!--a--></a>As we look ahead, we will
re-examine the role of the private sector. They are an important
part of Singapore's healthcare landscape. As demand increases, we
will need to consider how we can tap on their capacity and expertise,
to serve our national healthcare needs, not just for the private
patients, but also for subsidised patients.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-22d80d1d-9a82-4183-a908-b227da0c2408">
                  <a name="budget__id-22d80d1d-9a82-4183-a908-b227da0c2408"><!--a--></a>Besides the private sector,
we will also need to involve the volunteer welfare organisations
(VWOs) as our integral partners. We want to tap on their drive and passion,
and foster community ownership of the healthcare challenges and
solutions, so that we can address these challenges together as a
society.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bbbb58fb-2b27-4d85-8348-2db3d2c9ee84">
                  <a name="budget__id-bbbb58fb-2b27-4d85-8348-2db3d2c9ee84"><!--a--></a>On the issue of affordability,
personal responsibility and family support remain important, but
we need to pay greater attention to the concerns of vulnerable groups
in our society such as the elderly and chronically ill. While we
have always focused more assistance on the lower-income, and rightly
so, as healthcare costs rise, some middle-income Singaporeans too
may find it difficult to pay for their bills, especially when it involves
intermediate and long-term care. We will thus need to find ways
to help the middle-income group, while continuing to keep an eye
on the lower-income group. Singaporeans should have the assurance
that they will be able to afford quality care appropriate to their needs. We will do
more to strengthen safety nets to build this peace of mind.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-5d2011ee-6adc-44dc-98aa-9a81d8040030"><!--a--></a>It is also critical that
we strengthen our feedback and engagement mechanisms with the public
and our stakeholders, so that we can benefit from their inputs and
co-create the solutions together. We have organised two major stakeholder
engagement sessions to date, first for the private sector GPs and
then for the leaders of aged care organisations earlier this year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-25e4725e-8185-40a7-be22-69ee5eafba64">
                  <a name="budget__id-25e4725e-8185-40a7-be22-69ee5eafba64"><!--a--></a>As we seek to provide
more services in the community, we will also need to engage the
residents more closely. Singaporeans may find themselves living
beside a new healthcare facility, be it an eldercare centre, nursing
home or a community health centre. Some may have concerns, and we
will try to engage them and address their concerns as best as we
can. I am confident that at the end of the day, as an inclusive
society, we can find the right balance to address the different
needs.</p>

over the last few months have enabled my Ministry to put together
a "Healthcare 2020" Masterplan to improve healthcare services for Singaporeans.
Healthcare 2020 is more than just a vision; it is a set of strategies
that will guide us in the building of an inclusive healthcare system
for the future.</p>

and Singaporeans will be able to afford such services. </p>

will talk about our efforts to integrate care through the Regional
Health Systems and how we intend to improve primary care so that
patients receive better care in the community. Third, I will touch

our public sector acute beds increased by 700 beds to around 6,900

the new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Over the last 10 years, our Community
Hospital beds have increased from 420 to 800. We also expanded nursing

in manpower development too. Over the last five years, we have increased

House our long- and short-term plans to expand capacity across our
healthcare sector. To tackle the short-term demand, our hospitals
have over the years improved their processes to reduce admissions
and facilitate discharges. Mrs Lina Chiam would be glad to know
that innovative initiatives such as discharge lounges have been
introduced for discharged patients to wait for their family members
to pick them up, enabling beds to be turned over more quickly for
incoming patients. Where possible, our hospitals have also added
more beds in an incremental way, by optimising space and converting
administrative areas into medical facilities and bed space. For example,
the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) moved more than 800 non-frontline staff
offsite to commercial buildings over the years, and converted the
administrative and office space to add over 50 beds and 20 outpatient
consultation rooms. We will continue to explore ways to optimise
the available bed capacity and space wherever possible. We also
make use of private wards for subsidised patients when necessary,
as suggested by Mr Gerald Giam. </p>

Prime Minister Tharman announced earlier in his Budget Speech that
we will make major investments in healthcare infrastructure in the
coming years. By as soon as next year, we will be adding some 170
acute and Community Hospital beds.</p>

the number of acute hospital beds by more than 30%, or 1,900 beds,
and Community Hospital beds by around 1,800, which is a tripling
of the 800 Community Hospital beds we have today. Altogether, we
will provide 3,700 more hospital beds over the next eight years.</p>

some details of our plans and some of you would be interested to
see what are the facilities that would be made available in your
areas. First, let me start with the west. In the western side of
Singapore, the new Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in Jurong is scheduled
to open in 2014, followed by the Jurong Community Hospital in 2015.
Taken together, these hospitals will add more than 1,000 beds in
total in the west.</p>

advance the opening of the new Sengkang General Hospital from 2020
to 2018. Not only are we bringing Sengkang General Hospital earlier,
we are also planning a much higher than usual capacity for this
hospital and its sister community hospital, altogether 1,400 beds.
We intend to integrate acute and community hospital beds to provide
greater flexibility and to better cater to the needs of the patients. This
is in fact contrary to Mrs Lina Chiam's earlier suggestion during
the Budget debate that we should segregate the acute and non-acute
facilities, which will result in less flexibility and maybe perhaps
even higher costs.</p>

for acute hospital beds. Nonetheless, we will continue to monitor
the growth in demand and, if necessary, we will start work on another
new hospital before 2020, so that it will be ready soon after 2020. </p>

up specialist outpatient capacity. The new NUH Medical Centre will
be ready in 2013. This will house the National University Cancer
Institute and increase the capacity for day surgery and specialist
outpatient clinics. The new National Heart Centre building at Outram
is also expected to be ready by 2013, with a more than threefold
increase in capacity. </p>

important sector that we will need to develop to prepare for emerging
needs. Working together with our private sector GPs and partners,
we will introduce new models of care to tap on the capacity of the
private GPs to provide Singaporeans with accessible, affordable
and high quality care. At the same time, we will also explore how
we can increase access to polyclinics, where necessary.</p>

opportunity for us to tap on the existing spare capacity in private hospitals.
The private hospitals' bed occupancy rate averages about 55% today.</p>

capacity is not entirely new to us. For example, NUH has been renting
30 beds at Westpoint Hospital since 2009. We have since reached
an in-principle agreement with Parkway to lease some of their beds
at Parkway East Hospital, which will ease the load at Changi General
Hospital. Patients using these leased beds will continue to be managed
by Changi General Hospital's doctors and they will pay subsidised
fees, if they were subsidised patients in Changi. My Ministry will
also be entering into a Memorandum of Understanding with Raffles
Hospital for them to take on some subsidised patients. We will continue
to explore ways to tap on private sector capacity. </p>

they faced, from the physical and mental stress of working in a
very fast pace, highly demanding environment, to the emotional stress
of caring for the very ill as well as managing the occasional difficult
patients and their family members. Yet, despite these challenges, they
remain dedicated and committed to their mission. </p>

expansions will require more such dedicated healthcare professionals.
We estimate that we will need to grow the healthcare professional
workforce, such as doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists and allied
health professionals by 50%, or about 20,000 more, by 2020.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aea702c8-5f73-4b92-9f7e-ee9eb9fa4ca7">
                  <a name="budget__id-aea702c8-5f73-4b92-9f7e-ee9eb9fa4ca7"><!--a--></a>Mr Patrick Tay, <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad
Faishal </span>and Mr Gerald Giam asked how we were going to
address our healthcare manpower needs. First, we will train more healthcare
professionals locally by expanding the intake of our schools. The
Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine will open next year with an initial
intake of 50 students and this will grow to 150 eventually. With
the third medical school, we expect to boost our locally-trained
doctors to 500 a year, across the three medical schools. We will
also be expanding the dentistry intake from 48 to 80. To train more
nurses and pharmacists, we intend to expand the annual intakes for
nursing from 1,700 to 2,700 as well as for pharmacy from 160 to
240. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-571e6411-8307-42c2-93e5-741ede0249d0">
                  <a name="budget__id-571e6411-8307-42c2-93e5-741ede0249d0"><!--a--></a>Second, even with the
increase in local training pipelines, we will still need to supplement
our workforce with foreign-trained professionals, both Singaporeans
and foreigners. We have stepped up efforts to attract back overseas-trained
Singaporeans through the pre-employment grant (PEG) for medical
students studying overseas. The response has been encouraging thus
far, with 89 grants given out since 2010. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9113c076-dfeb-4df8-a4df-18c859b9fd7e">
                  <a name="budget__id-9113c076-dfeb-4df8-a4df-18c859b9fd7e"><!--a--></a>Ms Wong Shimin is one
such recipient of the pre-employment grant. Currently studying in
the University of Glasgow, Shimin grew up aspiring to be a doctor
because of her mother's experiences as a nurse and ex-paramedic.
PEG will give her an opportunity to return and work in a public
hospital and be closer to her parents. Shimin's aspiration is to
be an A&amp;E specialist so that she can be at the frontline of
saving lives. Shimin will return later this year to start her housemanship.</p>

and others like her have decided to return and contribute to public
healthcare. To attract back more Singaporeans, we will now extend
the pre-employment grant to those studying dentistry overseas in
recognised universities. Through these efforts, we hope to build
on our current success, and attract back even more Singaporean medical
and dental students from overseas, moving forward. </p>

with an example from nursing. Over the years, nursing has developed
peaks of excellence in nursing clinical practice, leadership and
education. In the area of clinical practice, our Masters-level trained
Advanced Practice Nurses work as independent partners to the doctors in
their respective areas of expertise performing work of high complexity.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2115</p>

Advanced Practice Nurse and an Assistant Director of Nursing at
the Singapore General Hospital. With her advanced nursing training
in Neurology, Siok Bee is able to conduct care clinics for people
with Parkinson's disease. In addition, she facilitates workshops
to empower and support caregivers in looking after their loved ones.
There are more than 100 Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) in the public
sector today. Together with nursing leaders in the management and
education tracks, they are pushing the boundaries of the practice
of nursing and changing how healthcare is delivered.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-316eb059-c221-4071-805f-2e8c011564a0">

health professionals are similarly charting new frontiers in their
respective areas. As a Principal Clinical Pharmacist at the Communicable
Disease Centre (CDC) in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Ms Law Hwa Lin is
part of a multi-disciplinary team that provides holistic care to
HIV patients. As a pre-registration pharmacist volunteer with the
CDC, she saw that there was no pharmacist involvement despite the very
complex management required for HIV patients. This motivated her
to pursue a specialisation in clinical pharmacy and pharmacotherapy.
Today, Hwa Lin conducts medication adherence clinics for patients,
conducts research and teaches medical and nursing colleagues about
HIV medications.</p>

Abdul Rashid Jailani. A physiotherapist by training, Rashid headed
the Department of Physiotherapy at the Singapore General Hospital.
He specialised in cardiopulmonary physiotherapy and intensive care
when he was at the hospital, and was also an avid clinical educator.
Rashid is now with Nanyang Polytechnic as a manager and lecturer

Rashid are examples of healthcare leaders who constantly seek to
advance patient care and groom the next generation of our professionals.
We will continue to raise the capability of our public healthcare
workforce by opening new pathways for upgrading and investing in
professional development and growth. This will also help to retain
good staff by making their career more rewarding and more fulfilling.</p>

we have to ensure that the recognition and rewards are commensurate.
While pay is not everything, it is still an important factor to
retain and attract high calibre individuals to pursue careers in
the public healthcare sector. For this reason, my Ministry embarked
on a review of the healthcare professionals' pay.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1e708ead-8179-40af-8b36-8efb0ede0bee">
                  <a name="budget__id-1e708ead-8179-40af-8b36-8efb0ede0bee"><!--a--></a>Over the past year, we
gathered feedback from public sector doctors on how we could improve
recognition and rewards. Besides more competitive pay, many of them told
us that they wanted a pay system that reinforced a greater sense
of public sector ethos and values and that recognised and rewarded
doctors for looking after all patients, regardless of whether they
are subsidised or full-paying. Individual doctors also wanted greater
clarity around their diverse roles – in clinical service, education,
leadership and research – and wanted recognition for excellence
in these areas. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-496da659-13df-42ed-90ad-2e72cebd3b99">
                  <a name="budget__id-496da659-13df-42ed-90ad-2e72cebd3b99"><!--a--></a>We will therefore introduce
a new and more competitive pay framework for doctors that is aligned
with our public healthcare ethos and values. The framework will
better recognise public sector doctors for the complexity of their
clinical work, quality outcomes
and workload regardless of patient class – a point made by Mr <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Gerald Giam earlier. We</span> will
also strengthen the recognition for doctors who play crucial roles
in education, administration, leadership and research. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2116</p>

together with enhancements to the performance management system
for public sector doctors, will take time to implement, and will
be rolled out in phases over the next two years. On average, doctors
will see an increase in total compensation of around 20% by 2014.
Under Phase 1 which will start from April 2012, doctors will receive
increases depending on their job levels. For example, most Associate
Consultants in hospitals will get an increase equivalent to 20%
of base salary while Consultant Family Physicians in the polyclinics
will get an increase equivalent to 10% of base salary. House Officers
and Medical Officers will see an increase of 20%. When the new pay
framework is fully implemented by 2014, doctors will receive further increases
along the way. We will similarly adjust dentists' pay. </p>

the important contributions of our public sector nurses, pharmacists
and allied health professionals who form the core of our healthcare workforce.
They will also see a one-time base pay increase of between 4% and
17% from April 2012. In particular, senior nurses, pharmacists and
Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) will be recognised for their
experience, leadership as well as their role in training the next
generation. As an example, a nurse manager will expect to receive
between 8% and 13% of increase in base pay.</p>

will cost about $200 million in FY 2012 which will be fully funded
by the Government. These salary enhancements are part of our continuous efforts
to make healthcare career more attractive and better recognise the
critical role that our public sector healthcare professionals play.
We will continue to review pay regularly to ensure that public sector
salaries remain competitive, including healthcare support staff
who are important members of the healthcare team, as Mr Patrick
Tay highlighted just now. We will also enhance the value proposition
of public sector work and make it more fulfilling and challenging. </p>

the well-being of public healthcare staff will continue to be a key
priority of my Ministry, as <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Dr Lam Pin Min</span> has pointed out.
We will enhance their work life harmony by recruiting more manpower
and through initiatives such as five-day work week, family care
leave and part-time work arrangements. We will also protect our frontline
workers against abuse. In fact, many of our healthcare workers gave
us the feedback that what will make their day is not all these things
but simple words of appreciation from the people that they serve
and care for. And, therefore, I would like to encourage patients
and their family members to continue to show your appreciation to our
public healthcare staff for their care, professionalism and commitment.
Your simple words and gestures will go a long way to motivate them
greatly. </p>

last year, Mr Gerard Ee mentioned that the Committee had a small
secretariat of civil servants who were resource persons and helped
provide logistical and administrative support. These civil servants
supported the Committee on a part-time basis and continued with
their primary roles and duties. The Committee engaged Mercer (Singapore)
Pte Ltd to support the Committee's work with their technical expertise
on Human Resource and remuneration issues. The Committee had selected
Mercer after assessing bid proposals submitted by a total of three
companies. The total consultancy fee, including GST, paid to Mercer
was about $860,000. No other additional cost was incurred by the
Government in relation to the appointment of the Ministerial Salaries
Review Committee. </p>
