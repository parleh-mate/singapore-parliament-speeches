<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BEA 1 107."-(Mr Teong Eng Siong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

a number of voluntary organisations that serve

handicapped children. Some of them maintain homes for

such children while others run schools and training

centres. Disabled children should, wherever possible,

remain in their own homes where their families can give

them the personal care, attention and love that are very

necessary for their growth and development. Children may

be admitted into residential institutions only as a last

resort. With this view, every possible assistance is

given to encourage families to care for their disabled

children in their own homes. This includes training and

education provided by voluntary welfare organisations

and counselling and welfare for the children and their

families. In this respect, the Government helps

voluntary welfare organisations to provide those

essential services by disbursing quarterly grants to

meet administrative expenses and salaries of the

numerous teaching staff employed in the voluntary

welfare organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary organisations have very ably provided

welfare  services for the disabled, and  the  Government

will  continue  to provide support through  consultation

and  financial  assistance.  The  Government  does  not,

however, intend to duplicate the work of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



these organisations but will work more closely with them

to  achieve a more effective service for the public.  In

this connection, voluntary welfare organisations do from

time   to   time   submit  proposals  to  expand   their

facilities.  Our  Ministry  has  always  supported  such

proposals  and will continue to support any organisation

prepared to construct homes for handicapped children who

need admission into residential institutions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

before I withdraw my amendment, I would like to ask  the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary two  questions.  In  his

answer,  he said that his Ministry has always encouraged

private  charitable and welfare organisations to  expand

their  work  and will support any organisation  that  is

prepared to build homes for disabled children. This  is,

of  course,  very good and I hope that his Ministry  can

implement  this  policy  effectively.  According  to  my

information there are about 8,000 disabled children  and

they are in a very pitiful state. In view of the present

inadequate capacity of the homes to accommodate  all  of

them,  I  hope  the  Social Welfare  Department  can  do

something concrete to help such an unfortunate lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask him another question. Recently the

Social  Welfare Department has been promoting a  "Return

to  the society" campaign for the aged people living  in

institutional homes. This campaign is to encourage  them

to  go  back to their personal home environment so  that

they can enjoy their remaining years in a more congenial

atmosphere  with their families. Of course. I  agree  to

this beneficial measure. We must befriend all people and

treat  the  children  of other people  as  our  own  and

respect the elders and the aged of other people  as  our

own.  Since  we are a democratic socialist  state  which

aims  at and pays respect to virtues of a welfare state,

I  support this policy. However, I would like to ask him

for  more  details and whether he is satisfied with  its

implementation and achievement so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in

Singapore   there  are  quite  a  number  of   subnormal

children.   I   would  like  to  ask  the  Parliamentary

Secretary whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



there is any home to accommodate these retarded children

and  whether the Social Welfare Department has any  plan

to help them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Song</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for Sembawang has raised two questions.  On  the

first   question.  I  would  say  that  we  have   great

confidence   in  our  private  charitable  and   welfare

organisations  which  do  welfare  work.  I  have   full

confidence  in  their ability to deal  with  matters  of

accommodation   and   rendering  service   to   disabled

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point about respecting the elders of others

as our elders and treating the children of others as our

own  children, I would say that personally I agree  with

him  but  we  should  not expect the  Government  to  do

everything.  This  is  a national  problem  and  we  are

dealing  with  the  matter on  a  national  basis.  What

concerns  us is to provide practical measures to  tackle

this  problem, such as rendering assistance  to  private

charitable and welfare organisations in their  work.  If

they are able to provide homes we will support them, and

we  also  try to help the old folks to return  to  their

family  environment under the "Return  to  the  society"

scheme   so   that  they  can  enjoy  a  more  congenial

environment. We are doing this on an experimental basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old folks staying in these institutional homes

still feel lonely in spite of the help and services that

we  are  providing them. There have been quarrels  among

the old folks too. If we can send them back to their own

families, we  will do so. For a start, as a  Government

department we encourage them to have contacts with other

sections  of our people or to help in simple  chores  in

the  institutional homes as well as to establish contact

with  society  and ultimately returning to  society.  In

this  way  they will not feel lonely and they can  prove

themselves to be useful. If the various institutions and

members  of  the public can provide them with meaningful

activities  and  social  contact,  this  will  help   to

alleviate  their problem and it will go a  long  way  to

make our "Return to the society" scheme a success.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>





On  the question of homes for retarded children, we  are

not  establishing any as yet, as the private  sector  is

doing  quite well in catering this category of children.

As  regards  what Government has achieved in  all  these

measures  or  schemes. I would say  that  we  are  still

awaiting further developments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now the Senior

Parliamentary    Secretary    said    that    charitable

organisations cannot depend on the Government assistance

alone  and  that members of the public will have  t~  do

their part. As regards the home for retarded children, I

feel that the Government should take the lead by setting

out  some  concrete  plans,  and  not  just  stress   an

important need for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

fully agree to the points raised by my colleagues on the

care of disabled and retarded children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that both the Government and members of the

public  have  not done enough towards rendering  welfare

service  in this respect. The Member for Bras Basah  has

rightly  said that the Government should take  the  lead

and  should  not  be  content with  just  stressing  its

viewpoint only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only about 300 or 400 places available for

disabled  children  in these homes  whereas,  there  are

thousands of disabled children who cannot be well looked

after  by their families. Members of the family  usually

have to go out to work and there will be nobody left  at

home  to  look after these children. So we  cannot  just

stress  that the private sector or members of the public

should do more. On the other hand, I would suggest  that

the  Government  should take the lead and  do  something

more   positive,  in  terms  of  physical  encouragement

besides the moral one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we have the

Singapore  Association for Retarded Children which  runs

four  children's  homes. They  are  the  Lee  Kuo  Chuan

Centre, Geylang Centre, Jurong Centre and the Toa  Payoh

Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now two Members have aired their feelings and I

fully sympathise with them. Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



course,  looking after such children in their own  homes

is a problem to their families. But the question is: how

are  the children affected psychologically? And this  is

important.  It  is common to see parents  putting  their

children  in the homes and then forget about  the  whole

thing. This will lead to a situation where children once

out  of  sight  means  out of love.  In  this  way,  the

children would just dissipate away. My thinking is  that

the  parents should first have to look after  their  own

children.  It  is  only  when they  cannot  tackle  this

problem,  that  it becomes the Government's  problem  to

sort things out, as a last resort



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Sembawang could raise with us the

matter  of two cases mentioned earlier, we will consider

according  to  their  merits, the possibility  of,  say,

recommending  accommodation  for  the  children  in   an

institutional home.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary said that he hopes  the  private

sector  and members of the public could do something  to

help  the aged to "return to the society". I agree  with

him  on that suggestion. I would like to ask him whether

he  has got any concrete plan to help the private sector

to do what he has suggested.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I said that this

scheme is being experimented at the present. We have not

yet  come to any concrete solution. If the reaction from

the society is good, then we will do something more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the

detailed  explanation given by the Senior  Parliamentary

Secretary, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BEC 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that creches are established to serve

the needs of working mothers. They find it convenient to

leave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



their children in the creches while they go to work.  In

an   industrialised  society  the   need   for   creches

correspondingly increases with the need for  more  women

to  join  the  workforce.  In the  present  labour-tight

situation  in Singapore, more women are being encouraged

to  leave  their  kitchens and join the workforce.  More

creches are, therefore, needed, otherwise they cannot be

released from their household chores and their children.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was extremely surprised to learn that the

creches  in Singapore are not well patronised. In  other

words,  they are not as popular as they ought to  be.  I

wonder whether the Ministry of Social Affairs has looked

into  the  reasons  why  these  creches  are  so  poorly

patronised.  Is it due to poor management, inappropriate

location,  or  is  it  because  the  opening  hours  are

unsuitable  to them? I would suggest to the Minister  to

conduct  a  thorough  survey to  investigate  into  this

problem further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest to the Minister that a

creche  need  not  be  an elaborate  establishment.  The

ground floor of an HDB flat or a JTC flat will serve its

purpose.  In  this  connection, may I ask  the  Minister

whether his Ministry has any plans to build a creche  in

Jurong  Neighbourhood II, or better known  as  Boon  Lay

Garden? There is a creche in Jurong Neighbourhood I, but

it is miles away from Boon Lay Garden. Thus its distance

away from Boon Lay Garden is inconvenient to the working

mothers  living  in Boon Lay Garden. I met  some  of  my

constituents in Boon Lay Garden and they share  my  view

that  there  should be a creche in Neighbourhood  II  to

encourage  mothers  to  go to  work.  Can  the  Minister

enlighten this House whether he has any plans to build a

creche in Jurong Neighbourhood II?



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to support the Member for Jurong  in  asking

whether the present system of running creches is  really

suitable  for the working mothers. The present  rate  of

fees  is  very  discouraging. Firstly,  even  before  an

application is approved the working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



mother  has  to  pay the full rate of $3  per  day.  All

applicants have to wait until such time as their  actual

financial standing has been determined before  they  are

allowed the concessionary rate of 20 cents as against $3

per  day. This tends to discourage working mothers  from

putting their children in the creches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to raise is the opening

hours. The creche in Toa Payoh is open from 7.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. I think this does not take into consideration

the fact that the factories in the area operate a three-shift  system. This is another reason why  most  of  the

creches are under-utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that the Ministry review the existing

system  so  that more working mothers would be  able  to

make  use  of the creches. For those creches  which  are

under-utilised, may I suggest that they should be thrown

open  to  children in primary schools as day centres  so

that the children will not run around the streets in the

housing estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Song:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it should be

pointed   out  that  the  creche  services  are  heavily

subsidised.  Before  a  creche  is  established  in  any

particular area, the Social Welfare Department has to be

certain that there is a demand for it. The situation  is

constantly  reviewed  and where there  is  a  need  more

creches  will be built. As far as possible creches  will

be  built in the Housing Board estates within industrial

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are plans to establish more Social

Welfare  Department creches, the present  policy  is  to

encourage   and  help  the  private  sector,  especially

private  industries, and even the smaller factories,  to

set up their own creches in or near their workplaces  to

assist working mothers who have young children. The  aim

is  to encourage more women to take up employment in the

factories. The Social Welfare Department will advise and

assist  any firm that wishes to start a creche  for  its

female workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Jurong Town creche has a capacity of 100

children. However, only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



about  80 to 85 children attend the creche daily.  There

are  still vacant places in the present creche to  cater

for their needs. A second creche in Jurong will only  be

considered  if the present creche enjoys full attendance

and  if  the  demand for a second creche  is  justified.

Future  creches  to be built by the Government  will  be

small  but functional. They will be situated within  the

blocks  of Housing Board flats so as to bring the creche

services closer to the families who use them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Toa Payoh's question

about  the  opening hours and the fees  charged  by  the

creches. The creches are open from 7.00 am, to 5.00 p.m.

Some  of them close a little later if the mothers return

to  the creches late. We have a system to determine  the

fees to be charged, as follows:



<pre>

Family income of $1,200 and

   above                                 ...$3 full-day

                                            $2 half-day

Family income of $800-$1,200             ...$2 full-day

Family income of $500-$800            ...$1.20 full-day

Family income of $300-$500            ...$0.50 full-day

Family income of $300 and below       ...$0.20 full-day

Recipients of public assistance           ...No Charge.

</pre>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, this is precisely the point

that I have raised. When a working mother applies for  a

place for her child, she is charged the maximum rate  of

$3  pending the verification of the family's  income.  I

would  like  to repeat that this is a deterrent  to  the

applicants. If a working mother has an income  of  $300.

she  is  entitled  to  pay only 20  cents.  But  in  the

meantime while an investigation is being conducted,  she

has to pay $3. Moreover, the opening hours of the creche

do  not actually help the mothers, the majority of  whom

are working on a weekly shift, alternating with a day or

night shift.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary  has  mentioned that before a  creche  can  be

established, his Ministry will have to find out  whether

or  not  there is a demand for it. May I ask how is  his

Ministry going to ascertain the demand? Can he enlighten

this House in this regard?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also pointed out just now that Boon Lay Garden

is   quite  far  from  the  present  creche  in   Jurong

Neighbourhood I. In fact, it is about four  miles  away.

We  cannot, therefore, expect a working mother to travel

a  distance of four miles to the creche before going  to

work.  There is indeed an urgent need to build a  creche

in Boon Lay Garden.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Song:</b> Sir, the Member for boa Payoh has

said  that the charge of $3 has deterred working mothers

from  sending their children to the creches.  I  do  not

think  so.  So  far there has been no complaint  of  the

practice  whereby when a working mother first sends  her

child to a creche, she has to pay $3 and only after  the

family income has been ascertained that the fee will  be

adjusted  accordingly. So far we have not  received  any

complaint of this nature from the mothers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we have found out that most of the creches are

not  fully  utilised. Even the creche in Jurong  has  an

attendance  of  only 80 to 85 children. The  Member  for

Jurong has said that another creche is needed in another

neighbourhood  in  his  area. I would  suggest  that  he

conducts an investigation to establish whether there  is

really a need for it. We will not construct a creche  if

there  is no patronage, otherwise Government funds  will

just go down the drain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir; although the reply given by the

Parliamentary Secretary is not quite satisfactory, I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Hwang Soo Jin -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to give credit where credit is due, over the

years  the Social Welfare Department has been  found  to

have provided a reasonable service, notwithstanding  the

low  priority  placed on services of a  welfare  nature.

This  is  reflected by the fact that the expenditure  on

Social  Welfare takes up only 0.24% of the  Government's

total  Estimates of Expenditure for FY 76. The  practice

in  the  concept of the so-called welfare state, without

considering   the  wider  implications,   economic   and

otherwise,  has  led to the downfall of  many  political

leaderships  in  the  world  and  in  the  process   the

financial   bankruptcy  of  their   countries.   I   am,

therefore, all for careful spending on welfare services.

But  I  have  always  felt  that  this  is  an  area  of

government  service  where  inadequate  attention  would

appear  to  have  been  paid to  the  pooling  of  human

resources  and  the better coordinated use  of  existing

physical facilities. There would appear generally to  be

a reluctance between government departments to cooperate

even in areas where the services provided by them are of

a similar or complementary nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a very young population as we have today, I can

envisage an increasing need and demand for a counselling

and  advice service. Our young people need to be guided,

but  in many cases I do not think they know where or who

to turn to. Up to this point of time, I believe that the

Counselling and Advice Section is involved primarily  in

helping to settle matrimonial and other family squabbles

of  a  petty  nature. I do not think it concerns  itself

with problems of youths. Except for an office at Pearl's

Hill,  there are no other offices. I would suggest  that

the Counselling and Advice Section of the Social Welfare

Department   should  get  together  with  the   People's

Association  and  work out a scheme  whereby  the  large

staff  and  voluntary workers at the  various  community

centres,  after  suitable training,  may  act  as  para-counsellors to offer counselling and advice to those who

are  in  need  of  assistance, as part  of  a  community

service  which these community centres are  supposed  to

provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Central Narcotics Bureau is

stepping  up  its  manpower presumably  to  tackle  more

energetically the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



serious  problem of drug addiction. There  is  no  doubt

that  an  important  aspect of their work  will  involve

counselling  and  advice. There  are  other  departments

which  are also involved in work of a similar or related

nature  and  will have staff with relevant training  and

expertise, for example, the psychiatrist attached to the

Ministry  of Health. If we can pooI all these human  and

physical  resources  together  and  formulate   a   more

comprehensive scheme in counselling and advice and  with

the support of the public by way of voluntary service, I

feel sure that not only would we be able to offer better

health  to  our  young people but in  the  long  run  to

contribute  positively towards safeguarding  the  mental

health of our public.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, on

behalf  of  the Ministry. I must thank Hon. Members  for

their kind words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Social Affairs' Counselling and Advice

Section at present operates from the headquarters of the

Social  Welfare  Department  at  Pearl's  Hill.  At  its

present location, it has been well accepted. Last  year,

6,310  clients used the services of our Counselling  and

Advice  Section, not only for marital disputes but  also

for other family disputes, pre-marital counselling, help

in  tracing missing people, disputes with neighbours and

tenancy disputes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that there is a need, as the Member for

Jalan  Kayu  has pointed out, for these services  to  be

decentralised. In this connection, my Ministry has since

1st December, 1975 established a common intake unit which

has the function of receiving all inquiries and requests

for  social welfare assistance. In December 1 975 alone,

the  common  intake  unit dealt  with  574  cases  which

required  short-term help and needed reference to  other

sections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of this unit, it has become

possible  to  monitor  the  types  of  cases  that   are

received,  with a view to studying the trends of  social

welfare needs in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  Information  thus  gathered  will  help   to

indicate  not  only  whether  there  is  a  demand   for

decentralised counselling services but also the location

for  which the decentralised services should operate for

maximum effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a need is indicated, the Ministry will consider

setting  up decentralised services perhaps, as the  Hon.

Member  has suggested, at community centres. This  could

take  the  form of area social welfare centres providing

advisory  information, counselling and referral services

to  people in the community centres. These centres would

also  utilise  community resources in  their  operation.

Volunteer counsellors and advisers could be engaged from

within the community to man them, with expert assistance

from  a  small  number  of professional  social  welfare

staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the decentralisation of services and

the utilisation of community resources, the Ministry  of

Social  Affairs  is  launching the  community  probation

service  in  two constituencies. The idea is to  involve

volunteer workers at neighbourhood level to counsel  and

assist  probationers. If the scheme  is  successful,  it

will be extended to other constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I am very pleased with the

reply. But may I just draw the attention of the House to

the  fact that there are altogether only 13 staff in the

Counselling and Advice Section. If these 13 officers are

the  entire staff available to handle 6,000 cases during

the  course  of the year, then I think we must  make  an

award  to each and every officer for the very high  rate

of productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R he reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BFA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to draw the

attention  of this House, and hopefully public attention

and interest, to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



hazards  of  fire  breaking out in high-rise  flats  and

buildings.  While  it  is generally  recognised  by  the

Government  that fires in such buildings  could  rapidly

develop  into  disasters  way beyond  the  fire-fighting

capacity of the Fire department with inestimable loss to

lives and property and certainly a real shokku to public

confidence,  I  am disappointed, Sir,  at  the  lack  of

positive  action  by the Government  to  prevent  or  to

combat fires in high-rise flats and buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Singapore today, where some 50% of

the  population  are housed in Housing  and  Development

Board  flats, demands very urgent attention.  The  trend

towards building higher and higher upwards, reaching out

to  embrace  the  heavenly bodies,  must  surely  awaken

planners to the dire consequences of a towering inferno.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, large blocks of HDB flats are of 16 storeys and

above  and the present point-block flats are 25  storeys

high.  Further, private buildings vie for pride of place

in  the skies way up to 50 storeys. I understand that  a

75-storey giant is well on the planning board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been extremely lucky so far. The God of Fire

has  benevolently chosen to spare us the  agony  of  its

unholy  visitation and its almighty fury. However,  Sir,

we  cannot continue to sit back and just pray  that  our

good luck will hold out. We have seen a mini disaster at

Robinsons and we have read of awful fires in Seoul city,

in  Sao  Paulo, Latin America, and other  parts  of  the

world  where tens and sometimes even hundreds  of  lives

were  lost, people roasted to death and many more  burnt

out  of all recognition. Let us take immediate steps and

make  immediate preparations now because tomorrow  might

be too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the 1970s, buildings put up by private

enterprises  have  to  be provided with  sprinklers  and

automatic heat detector systems before planning approval

is  granted.  This is, of course, a very  sound  policy.

However,  I  cannot understand why the  Fire  department

should  continue to grant approval to the HDB  to  erect

gigantic structures, some of which house 500 units or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



more, without the minimum safeguard against fire.  Some

HDB  flats  do not even have a fire exit.  It  was  most

regrettable, Sir, that the HDB could publicly  claim  in

the  recent past that its flats are fire-safe  and  that

these flats or units are so compartmentalised that  fire

will  not spread from one unit to another. Surely we  do

not need a test case to make us realise that in case  of

fire the tenants can only pray for their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, therefore, that the Fire department

takes  a very partial attitude towards the HDB and  this

is,  wittingly or unwittingly, at the expense of  public

safety. I would be most happy if the Hon. Minister could

enlighten   this   House  regarding  the   fire-fighting

capacity of the Fire department, and to honestly  reveal

its  inadequacies, and what steps are being taken by his

Ministry  to  modernise the fire-fighting capability  of

the Fire department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, may I plead with him to start a sustained

intensive national campaign of public education  through

the  schools, community centres, commercial enterprises,

through the press, over radio and television, on the Dos

and  Don'ts  of fire prevention and fire-fighting.  Sir,

may  I ask the Hon. Minister to enlighten this House  on

the points I have raised.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Fire Brigade is

aware of the problems involved in fighting fires in high-rise  buildings. As early as 1960, the Fire Brigade  had

insisted that high-rise buildings be provided with built-in  fire-fighting  facilities and such other  preventive

measures  as are necessary for the protection  of  lives

and property. Also regular fire drills are held in high-rise buildings for members of the Brigade to familiarise

themselves with the built-in fire protection facilities.

In  addition, inspections are also made by fire officers

of  all  high-rise  buildings to ensure  that  the  fire

protection facilities are in good working order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Brigade will have no special difficulty in

fighting  a  fire, say, on the 50th floor or  above  the

16th floor of a high-rise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



building  provided the building, as I said, is  equipped

with  adequate fire protection facilities such  as  fire

lifts, wet rising mains and hose reels. When the Brigade

was   involved  in  making  recommendations   for   fire

prevention  facilities in all buildings to  ensure  that

adequate   fire   prevention  measures  were   provided,

stringent   requirements  were  imposed   on   high-rise

buildings,   including   the  provision   of   automatic

sprinklers and fire detectors, wet and dry rising mains.

protected  staircases  for escape  purposes, ventilated

lobbies  for internal fire fighting, fire lifts for  use

by  firemen in emergencies, hose reels and extinguishers

and  the  use  of non-combustible building materials  to

control the spread of fire. Since 1st August, 1973,  this

function  has  been transferred to the Building  Control

Division  of  the  Public Works Department.  However.  I

believe  that  the  high standards  of  fire  prevention

advocated  by  the  Fire Brigade  have  been  maintained

through  the Fire Precautionary Code which was  prepared

by  the  Building Control Division in consultation  with

the Singapore Fire Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fire-fighting in HDB flats would pose obvious

problems  to  the Fire Brigade, especially if  the  fire

occurs  on the upper floors. Since HDB buildings do  not

have  built-in  facilities, fire hoses and  other  fire-fighting equipment have to be manually carried up to the

affected floor level. The fire hose is then lowered down

and  connected to a fire pump in the fire  engine.  Such

difficulties  faced  by  the  Fire  Brigade   could   be

minimised  through the provision, and I  say  again,  of

rising  mains, access ways for fire engines, fire  lifts

and  fire resistant entrance doors to the flats  in  the

HDB  buildings. These provisions have been  incorporated

in  the  Safety Code of Practice which was  prepared  in

consultation with the Fire Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contingency plans have been drawn up for the Republic

of Singapore Air Force Helicopter Squadron to assist the

Fire  Brigade in the event of an extreme need to  rescue

persons  trapped on the rooftops of high-rise buildings.

These plans include



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



calling  up  of  off-duty personnel and other  essential

supporting   Government  services.   However,   I   must

emphasise that aerial evacuation will only be used as  a

last  resort in view of the great dangers involved In  a

high-rise fire, the occupants should be told to  descend

through protected staircases rather than ascend  to  the

roof-top where heat and smoke and other conditions might

make it impossible for rescue to be effected.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the point of instilling in the

public,    particularly   those   occupying    high-rise

buildings, the consciousness of never to be careless and

to prevent fire outbreaks. The Fire Brigade, in fact, is

conducting  several short courses in  fire-fighting  and

fire  prevention  for occupants of high-rise  buildings,

industrial  workers and members of the  public.  I  hope

more  people  will  take advantage of  such  educationaI

programmes  so that collectively we car help to  promote

fire safety in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, while I am satisfied that the Fire Brigade

is  making good effort to meet the new challenges  posed

by  high-rise buildings. I would like to point out  that

it  is  essential for the public to play their  part  in

helping to prevent outbreaks of fire. Although high-rise

buildings  and  residential flats may be  equipped  with

adequate  fire prevention measures, we must  not  forget

that  the  contents of the building, such as  furniture,

carpets,  curtains  and  other furnishings  are  usually

highly  combustible material. It is therefore  necessary

for  the  occupants of high-rise buildings to  inculcate

good  habits  to  ensure that they  do  not  cause  fire

through acts of carelessness and negligence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I appreciate the efforts made

by  the  Fire Brigade to ensure that we do  not  have  a

natural  disaster. However, I must say  that  the  steps

which  the  Hon. Minister has just enumerated are  still

not  sufficient. Certainly the improvements and the  new

ideas  that  they have got are far behind  the  pace  of

development  that  this  country  is  going  through.  I

suspect  that  it  is really the Finance  Ministry  that

dictates the Dos and Don'ts of his Fire department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



Nevertheless  I would plead with the Minister  that  the

real problem here is to get across to the masses. To me,

organising courses for a few hundred people to take part

is  simply insufficient. I suggest that he should  think

of a national campaign, a sustained effort, to reach out

to  each and every one, particularly to all those living

in high-rise flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very happy that he was very honest in saying

that the Housing and Development Board flats do not have

sufficient  facilities or safeguards against fire.  This

is  a point that we need to stress to get across to  the

public that they do not have adequate facilities  as  of

now and therefore they should constantly be vigilant. In

my  constituency, a fire broke out on the 9th floor just

a  few days ago. But it so happened that it broke out in

the  mid-afternoon when the tenants were in and the fire

was  put out on time. What would have happened if it had

occurred in the middle of the night and the fire  raging

on? I do not relish the thought of a towering inferno in

my constituency, and certainly not anywhere in Singapore

too.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, just one point which I have

forgotten  to mention to the Member for Kim Seng.  Every

year we have what we call a "Fire Brigade Week". This is

a  national campaign. We are having one this year where,

besides exhibitions, we have fire drills for the benefit

of  the  people  in the area in which the exhibition  is

staged  for the whole week. I hope this year we will  be

able  to  hold one in Kim Seng constituency so that  the

people in his constituency will know how to fight a fire

in a high-rise building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January last year we also formed a special team in

the  Fire  department called Search  and  Rescue  Squad,

comprising  26 officers and men. These are the  men  who

come  to the rescue in case of a high-rise fire. Members

of the Squad have completed their training, including  a

period of attachment to the Republic of Singapore's  Air

Force  and  the  Commando Unit of the Defence  Ministry.

Their specialised training will enable them to carry out

search  and  rescue work effectively in the event  of  a

high-rise fire. The Brigade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



plans  to  expand the Squad and soon a second  batch  of

fire  officers  will  be  selected  to  undergo  similar

training.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I am generally very satisfied

with  the  Minister's explanation but  with  the  simple

proviso  that  the Minister should exploit all  possible

avenues  to  prevail  upon the Housing  and  Development

Board  either  through its chairman  or,  better  still,

through  the  Minister  for  National  Development,   if

necessary take him out for lunch and persuade  him  that

these  are  really necessary measures. In  view  of  the

explanation  of  the  Hon.  Minister,  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ch'ng

Jit Koon



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (m) of subhead AAA

3020.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here. Amendment No.

(11). Haji Mohd. Ariff Suradi.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 3020.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, contributions by the Ministry of Social Affairs

to  the various welfare and charitable institutions  are

small  indeed.  I  am  sure  it  is  difficult  for  the

officials   of  these  institutions  to  implement   its

training  schemes  with such meagre  allocations.  In  a

seminar on the retarded, the Minister for Social Affairs

in  his  speech urged that the retarded should be  given

training to enable them to be usefully employed so as to

bring  them  back  to  normal community  life.  In  this

respect the Minister urged upon the firms to offer  jobs

to these retarded people who have been suitably trained.

But  I  do  not know how these people can be  given  the

necessary training if the allocation of moneys from  the

Ministry of Social Affairs is so small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is strange is that while the Minister has urged

firms  and private enterprises to employ these  retarded

people, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



Government  itself  does not employ them.  It  has  been

found  that those disabled people who have been  trained

for certain jobs have not been offered employment up  to

now.  This  matter has been referred to the Ministry  of

Labour, but only relief work has been given to them.  It

is  therefore proper for the Minister for Social Affairs

to urge all Government departments to give employment to

the  disabled. I wish to know whether the Minister  will

do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Sir, services for the disabled have

in  general  been provided by voluntary  welfare  bodies

with  Government  Support in the form of  consultations,

financial assistance, and the provision of teachers  and

instructors.  The  Government should not  duplicate  the

good  work that has been done and is being done  by  the

various associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The associations operate a comprehensive range of

facilities for the disabled, including welfare  offices,

a  training  centre,  a residential institutional  home,

school, administrative offices and an  appeals  office.

The  Government will continue to provide  assistance  to

associations  and  plans to work more closely  with  all

voluntary   welfare  organisations  for  more  effective

service to the disadvantaged group in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and the voluntary welfare sector at

present  assist the disabled to rehabilitate  themselves

and  to  attain  a productive and meaningful  life.  The

Ministry  of Labour, tile Social Welfare Department  and

some    voluntary   organisations   provide   employment

placement  service  for  the  handicapped.  The   Social

Welfare  Department also maintains  a  register  of  all

known  disabled  persons  to  assess  their  needs   for

employment and to facilitate their placement  for  jobs.

The  tour of factories for the disabled was to stimulate

greater interest among employers in their employment  of

disabled persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to involve the community in all

efforts  to  help the disabled. Prejudice and  ignorance

should be overcome and society



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



must  be made to understand that the basic needs of  the

handicapped  are  similar to  the  needs  of  all  other

people. Indeed, one voluntary organisation has taken the

initiative   rightly  by  publishing   a   brochure   on

employment opportunities for the handicapped. The Social

Welfare   Department  will  improve  its  classification

procedure  so  as to provide information  of  employable

disabled  persons  and  to assist  disabled  persons  to

remain   in  employment  through  intensive  counselling

before  employment  and  follow-up  services  after  job

placement



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974 the Social Welfare Department cooperated with

the Ministry of Finance on a survey of the employment of

handicapped  people in Government service. Arising  from

the survey, several grades of appointment to the Service

were  identified  as  suitable for handicapped  persons.

Government  departments have been urged to  employ  more

handicapped  people  wherever  possible.  There   is   a

standing procedure whereby the Social Welfare Department

will supply information on employable handicapped people

to  the Labour Exchange and the Special Committee in the

Ministry  of Labour. These handicapped people  are  then

referred  to  the  Department  for  employment  whenever

vacancies  arise. At present there are  137  handicapped

persons  employed  in  Government  and  quasi-government

bodies.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, how many

light  work such as cleaning and tidying up the  centre,

grass  cutting, and so on? At the moment it  seems  that

there  is  such  a  need. So I would  like  to  ask  the

Parliamentary Secretary whether he would consider giving

these jobs to such people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I would like to raise three

questions.  The first matter concerns hawker inspectors.

Their  ill-temper and callous attitude in  dealing  with

hawkers,  such as issuing summons at random have  caused

many  unpleasant incidents. Let me give  an  example.  A

distributor  for  aerated water in my  constituency  had

come  to me with a complaint. He said that one day  when

he  was  unloading some cases of aerated water from  his

lorry  a  hawker inspector approached and asked him  for

his  identity  card,  saying that he  had  committed  an

offence.  This  aerated  water  agent  then  asked  what

offence he had committed. The hawker inspector said that

he  was  conducting illegal hawking activity. The  agent

was taken aback and was at a loss to understand. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



explained that he was an agent for aerated water and  he

was  only unloading cases of aerated water and  that  he

was not doing anything illegal. But the hawker inspector

did not pursue the matter further to establish the truth

or  otherwise  of  the  statement and  simply  issued  a

summons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distributor complained this to me and I forwarded

the case to the Hawkers Department for an investigation.

After  careful  investigation by  the  senior  officials

there, it was ascertained that this man was, in fact, an

agent  for  aerated water. So the summons was withdrawn.

This  incident shows that if it were not for  the  slip-shod  work  of the hawker inspector, such trouble  would

not  have  happened and the time of the people concerned

would  not  have  been wasted, and unnecessary  friction

would  not  have been caused. I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  to take note of this and to take the necessary

steps to rectify the attitude of hawker inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I would like to ask is whether the

Minister  will consider giving farmers a certain  period

of  time  to sell their produce, poultry and vegetables.

This   opportunity  to  sell  will  help  their   family

livelihood to a small extent. These people are poor  and

if  they  can sell some of their vegetables or  poultry,

say,  in  the morning for a brief period, they  will  be

able  to  make some money to assist their family budget.

Would the Minister allow such a sale by the farmers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is in regard to the hawker centre

to  be  built  at Chong Pang village in Sembawang.  When

will  it  be  built, and when will it be completed?  How

many stalls will be provided in this hawker centre? What

are  the items that will be sold? How many parking  lots

will  be  provided  in the car park? I  would  like  the

Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister to answer  these

questions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang Soo Jin is not here. Mr Ho See

Beng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, the Hawkers Department does not

seem to have any proper rules and regulations as to  how

and  why  a  hawker's licence should or  should  not  be

revoked.  The  revocation of a  hawker's  licence  often

appears to be decided upon the whims and fancies of  the

Department  without  due regard to  the  fact  that  the

licence is the hawker's rice bowl.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to the incident involving a female hawker

whose licence was cancelled on a very flimsy ground.  It

was  alleged that this woman had sublet her stall for  a

fee  because she was not physically present at her stall

and  an  unauthorised  person was  seen  conducting  the

business.   But   investigations   showed   that    this

unauthorised  person  was none other  than  the  woman's

husband. When she was questioned as to why she permitted

an  unauthorised  person  to conduct  the  business  she

explained  that the man was her husband and he  used  to

stand  in  for her whenever she was unwell.  The  hawker

inspector  was  dissatisfied with  the  explanation  and

issued a notice, giving her seven days to reply, failing

which her licence would be cancelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came and sought my help and I wrote her a letter

to  see  the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry  of

the  Environment. Sir, the Hon. Member for Bukit  Timah.

who is the Parliamentary Secretary concerned, wrote me a

two-page  letter  that  smacks  of  bureaucratic   high-handedness,  stating that he received information  about

hawkers  abusing their licences by subletting  them  out

for  a  fee.  But his letter did not mention  that  this

particular woman had indeed sublet her licence. There is

no  evidence to show that she had sublet her licence and

it  is  ridiculous  to  revoke her licence  because  her

husband helped her to conduct the business whenever  she

is unwell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revocation of her licence, Sir, has created

considerable  ill  feeling against the Government  among

workers in my constituency. This is a crystal clear case

that the Hawkers Department, having failed to make out a

case  against  the hawker which had been based  on  mere

suspicion, now tries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



to  justify its unjustifiable action by saying that  she

is not in good health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit, Sir, that unless the Hawkers Department can

prove beyond any doubt that she had, in fact, sublet her

licence for a fee the licence should be restored to  the

aggrieved   woman.  I  would  also  urge   the   Hawkers

Department to refrain in future from such arbitrary  and

high-handed action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree to the

points  raised by the two Members, especially the Member

for  Sembawang. I would like to make one more  point  in

regard to the attitude of hawker inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hawkers have been a problem for a long time.

Although  we  have built markets and hawker  centres  to

accommodate the roadside hawkers, many areas  are  still

congested  with hawkers, simply because  there  are  far

more  applicants  for hawker stalls  than  accommodation

permits.  Handicapped people and some farmers also  want

to   hawk,   as   there   are  not   enough   employment

opportunities in factories and elsewhere.  That  is  why

they have to become hawkers, especially the older people

who are too weak to do heavy work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of some hawker inspectors towards

unlicensed  hawker is really deplorable. The people  who

witness  such attitudes, especially foreigners who  pass

by  here,  will  think  that Singapore  is  a  state  of

barbarism.   The   way  these  officials   treat   those

unlicensed hawkers is really inhuman. The act of hacking

and  pulling  down hawker stalls is really  horrible  to

watch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he is aware

that  those officials in the Hawkers Department have  no

consideration for other human beings. Do they  have  any

sympathy or feeling for these poor people? I would  like

to  ask  whether  it  is  the  policy  of  the  Hawker's

Department to seize the goods of every unlicensed hawker

they  can pounce upon. And if that happens, do they tell

the  hawker concerned they will issue a receipt for  all

articles  confiscated? Of course, some  vegetables  like

towgay cannot be easily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



assessed and therefore it would be difficult to issue  a

receipt.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, valuable articles, like jade and other

ornaments,  if confiscated, should be accounted  for  by

issue   of  receipts.  Otherwise  how  can  the  Hawkers

Department  assure the general public  that  the  hawker

inspectors are all honest? How can the Department ensure

that  articles confiscated are not lost in  the  end?  I

would like the Minister to give an answer in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the three Members of

Parliament   have   made   complaints   against   hawker

inspectors,  unlike some other Members who  have  spoken

earlier  in  this  debate that some of the  hawkers  are

really  well-off  and  are driving Mercedes  Benzes  and

Jaguars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these three Members now refer to the poor

hawkers  who, they allege, have been very badly  treated

by   the  hawker  inspectors  of  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment. I am not saying that all hawkers are  rich.

Neither are all of them poor. Neither are all the hawker

inspectors in the Hawkers Department bad. There may be a

few who have overstepped the mark. But generally, unless

there is proper enforcement, the hawkers will take  over

-  obstruct five-foot ways, roads, and also serve  dirty

food.   There   must  be  enforcement.  Sometimes   such

enforcement  leads  to very unpleasant  incidents.  Last

year  there  were 21 such incidents. Two incidents  were

serious  when hawker inspectors were assaulted by  these

"poor" stallholders and hawkers. I will tell this  House

about some of the incidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6th January, 1975 a hawker inspector was slashed

with  a  fruit-cutting knife on the right  side  of  the

neck.  He  was warded in the hospital for ten  days.  In

another  incident  on 20th February, 1975  an  unlicensed

hawker attempted to splash hot water on an inspector. He

was  stopped  from  doing so by Cisco  guards.  On  25th

February  1975 empty bottles were thrown at our officers

in a van, causing damage to the van. On 22nd March



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



1975  a hawker, armed with a meat chopper, charged at  a

party  of  hawker  inspectors. A timely intervention  by

Cisco guards prevented any injury. On 11th October, 1975

three  Public  Health  auxiliaries  were  assaulted   by

members  of an unlicensed hawker's family. One  of  them

suffered  a  head injury and was given four stitches  at

the Toa Payoh Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the many incidents which have taken

place  when hawker inspectors try to enforce  what  they

are  responsible for. But to each and every Member here.

I say that it is difficult for me to reply in Parliament

to  any specific allegation or any specific case.  If  a

Member  has  a complaint against a hawker inspector,  he

can send it to the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry  of

the  Environment.  And  if he  does  not  give  him  any

satisfactory answer, try the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should tell the Member for Sembawang that

any  person who sells goods in a market or public  place

without a licence is committing an offence. He mentioned

that a summons was issued, but unfortunately he did  not

say  what  the  summons  was for, whether  it  was  for

obstruction  or  for hawking without a licence.  All  he

said  was that he had been to the Ministry to raise  the

matter on behalf of his constituent and the summons  was

withdrawn.  That  is a good Member of Parliament  and  a

reasonable   Ministry,   and   we   have   a   satisfied

constituent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for farmers selling their produce at market places.

they cannot sell without a licence and, if they do, then

the  other  stallholders there would get  angry.  Either

they  would  block the place or they would say,  "it  is

unfair competition". The Member is well aware that  when

unlicensed hawkers come along, whether or not  they  are

farmers,  there is bound to be trouble.  There  will  be

trouble between hawker inspectors and hawkers, and  also

trouble  among the hawkers themselves and  sometimes  we

have to intercede.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member was asking for details about Canberra Food

Centre in his constituency. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



will  be  pleased to know that tenders have been  called

and  construction work is expected to start sometime  ii

April.  Sewerage work has already commenced. The  centre

is  expected to be completed in early 1977.  The  centre

will  have  271 stalls consisting of 164 market  produce

stalls.  35 piece and sundry goods stalls and 72  cooked

food  stalls.  The  project is estimated  to  cost  $1.7

million and will house some of the Street hawkers in the

area.  Before I pass on, perhaps I should mention  that,

without  being  personal  in any  way,  the  Member  for

Sembawang  was  at  one  time attached  to  the  Hawkers

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has grumbled about the lack

of  rules and procedures for the revocation of licences.

I  would  like to assure him that the officers  of  the

Hawkers   Department  do  not  cancel  licences  without

justification. They have to act w thin the framework  of

the  existing law, departmental policies and procedures.

Hawker  licences  may be cancelled for various  reasons,

such  as  non-payment  of licence fees,  which  is  very

essential;   and   flouting  the  law  continuously   or

subletting  of stalls or pitches. Licences may  also  be

cancelled  for allowing unauthorised persons to  conduct

business  at  the  stalls or pitches.  The  decision  to

cancel  is  only taken after careful consideration.  The

hawker  is  given  an  opportunity to  explain  why  his

licence  should  not be cancelled, and  the  licence  is

revoked only when no satisfactory reasons can be  given.

I  think  the  Member is well aware that  a  hawker  can

appeal, first to the Parliamentary Secretary for the re-instatement  of  his  licence,  and  ultimately  to  the

Minister in charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has mentioned one particular

case  where the husband was doing work for the wife  who

was  the licence holder. That is his side of the  story.

There was no such evidence. But, as I have said, this is

not  the  place nor is it the time for us  to  argue  on

particular  cases.  They are better dealt  with  in  the

Ministry.  He  says that the hawkers in his constituency

are  fed  up. The licences of six hawkers in Bras  Basah

constituency  were  revoked because it  was  found  that

instead of conducting their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



business   they   had   allowed  unauthorised   persons,

including  non-citizens, to conduct  their  business  at

their stalls at Malabar Street. Three of the six hawkers

eventually  surrendered  their licences.  The  remaining

three hawkers appealed for the return of their licences.

Two  ~f  the  appeals were granted, and  the  third  was

rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Jurong felt sore when one of

his  constituents,  who  was doing  business  without  a

licence,  had  some  of his jades  confiscated.  He  has

appealed  to  me but I could not allow the  appeal.  The

matter  was  taken  out  of  my  hands.  Where  valuable

property, like jade, has been confiscated, the matter is

thrashed out in court, and since the Magistrate has made

an order of forfeiture the Minister cannot intervene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also mentioned the question of receipts.

Sometimes when goods are being seized, everybody  around

is running hurry-scurry, and in a situation like this it

is  difficult to issue receipts. But he has made a  good

point   .-   when  valuable  property   like   jade   is

confiscated,  if  there  is an  opportunity,  a  receipt

should  be  handed over immediately. If it is not  given

immediately,  then it should be given  as  soon  as  the

hawker  inspector, who has seized the jade, has returned

to  base.  But  so  far we have not issued  receipts.  I

understand from the Hawkers Department that  it  is  not

feasible,  but  I  think there must be  cases  where  if

valuable jewellery or property is seized then a  receipt

must  be  issued. I thank the Member for his suggestion.

and  assure  him  that this matter will be  given  every

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bras Basah has made certain

criticisms against my department just now, and  although

my   Minister  has  replied  to  him  I  would  like  to

supplement his answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of revocation of licence of a hawker

in  his constituency. I would say that what he has  said

is  far  from correct. The position is that  the  hawker

first  sublet his stall to another person. Later someone

else offered a higher price for that stall. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



stallholder  quite naturally let out his  stall  to  the

second person who offered a higher price. The first "sub-tenant" then complained to the Hawkers Department saying

that the licensed stallholder possessed as many as seven

licences,  most  of  which were  hired  out  to  others,

including non-citizens just as the Minister has  pointed

out.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the case of the woman hawker whose

husband  was  issued a summons, we have established  the

fact  that someone else was renting the stall from  this

woman  hawker. On receiving a complaint,  we  sent  some

hawker  inspectors  out  to  keep  surveillance  of  the

activities  of this unauthorised hawker as well  as  the

woman  hawker. Surveillance was kept for nearly a  month

before  we  found out the truth that this  woman  hawker

actually did sublet her stall to someone. As is  usually

the  case,  when  the  hawker inspector  turned  up  one

evening and issued a summons to the unauthorised hawker,

the  husband of this woman hawker popped out and  argued

that  in  the  day  the stall was under his  management,

while at night it was managed by his wife. However,  our

hawker  inspectors knew the situation  well  enough  and

knew what was going on. So they issued this unauthorised

hawker with a summons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member helped to appeal against our decision.

We wrote back to explain in detail why we had dealt with

this  case in the manner that we did, i.e, some  of  the

licences of this family were rescinded, but the  husband

still  kept  his  licence. The Member  argued  that  our

attitude  had  not  been correct and that  we  had  been

treating  the matter unfairly. In fact, the  husband  of

that  woman  hawker is still there hawking.  So  if  the

Member  concerned wants more details. I can  supply  him

with more details later on. If the Member so desires,  I

would present the details in this Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I believe you

remember the saying that officials will always cover  up

for the acts of other officers. Of course, the hawker



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



inspector   concerned  in  reporting   to   the   Senior

Parliamentary Secretary would have given his side of the

story,  and the Parliamentary Secretary would of  course

listen to him. We can say that the years 1 974 and 1 975

were  the  years of the hawker. They found it profitable

to be hawkers. So why should they sublet their stalls to

someone else? Moreover, the Hawkers Department does  not

have  rules stipulating that the hawkers are not allowed

to  employ  or engage assistants. Therefore,  once  they

find  anyone at the stall who is not the rightful holder

of  the  licence, they jump to the conclusion  that  the

licensee  has  been subletting his stall. What  kind  of

reasoning is this? This is very wrong. This is  not  the

way to treat the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said that

the  licence of this woman's husband is still valid  and

that she is able to carry on with her business. I am not

arguing  for  the husband, but the case  of  this  woman

hawker.  So  it  seems  that  the  Senior  Parliamentary

Secretary  does not know the true picture of  the  whole

problem.  He  was  talking through his  hat.  The  woman

hawker's   licence   has   been   rescinded.   But   the

Parliamentary Secretary has not replied to my  question.

It  shows  that he does not know the situation well.  He

says  that the woman hawker had sublet her stall.  Where

is  the proof? Show me the evidence. Otherwise he should

give  her a chance and not just conveniently cancel  her

licence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  that the Member has not been listening to  me  at

all.  I  have  said that these people claimed  that  the

stall  was  managed in this way: in  the  day  time  the

business is conducted by the husband, while in the night

the  wife  takes over. But according to our observations

for  one  whole month, in the evenings the wife was  not

there at all. Instead, two other people, one of whom  is

a non citizen, were found working at that stall. If that

is  not  subletting to someone else, how is it that  for

the  whole period of one month the wife was never  there

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



evenings?  So this is very clear evidence to  show  that

someone else had been renting the stall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that the Government is

subsidising the hawker stalls. So we must be  strict  as

well  as careful in seeing that each family can own only

one  stall in a hawker centre because of the subsidy.  I

would  like to give an example. I hope the Member s  not

so  naive  as to think that the hawkers would prefer  to

rent  private stalls at $200 ~o $500 each per  month  in

private  coffee  shops.  Stalls  in  Government   hawker

centres  are not rented out. Hawkers are charged licence

fees and the licence fee for a cooked food stall is  $50

p.m, for  both  day and night sessions, and  for  other

stalls  the rate varies and it averages about  $30  p.m.

per  stall. If the Member says that our action has  been

wrong,  I  will give another illustration. In  the  case

mentioned just now about the woman hawker, her  daughter

is  working as a cashier in her own eating shop. If this

woman  is not working in her own eating shop, then where

can she be? How could she be working at the hawker stall

at  the same time? Is that not subletting? So I hope the

Member  would take note of this. The Government provides

stalls to the hawkers for them to make a living, not for

somebody else to make unfair profit out of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary has mentioned something more than what I  have

said.  I think I need a reply very badly because he  has

mentioned somebody else. It has got nothing to  do  with

the cancellation of this hawker's licence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That point has been taken. Mr Ho. I

do  it  outside, either in the Ministry or, if we cannot

come to agreement, in the

we cannot come to any conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I

withdraw my amendment, I would like the Minister to  pay

attention  to  what I am going to say.  He  himself  has

admitted  that  some of the hawker inspectors  on  their

beat  duties  have been quite ill-mannered,  unlike  our

Minister whose attitude is very proper and good. So they

should learn from our Minister not to be so ill-mannered

in their dealings with the public.

Minister's reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead CBA 8103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent drought which we experienced seems to

be  the worst in the last hundred years, so much so that

our green environment has turned to brown patches of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



dead turf and leaves. Our water stocks at the reservoirs

have  also dropped tremendously. Once again we  have  to

launch our "Save Water and Don't Waste Water" Campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago I was told that a feasibility study would

be  carried out for the building of a reservoir  at  the

Bedok  Cut Site to find out whether the soil would  hold

water. The construction of a reservoir would depend upon

the  results of the study and the soil test. May I  know

what  is  the position of the study at the moment?  What

has been the result of the soil test so far? What is the

progress  of  the work at the Bedok Cut Site?  Have  the

contractors completed the job as scheduled,  so  that  a

reservoir can be built to supplement the water stocks of

the other existing reservoirs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that by using the boring system at

the  seaside, most probably we could get water. I do not

know  whether the Ministry of the Environment has looked

into  this.  If not, I would suggest to the Minister  to

try  out this system at the seaside, because I know that

in  other countries this boring system has been used  to

get  water.  Singapore is a very small island.  We  have

tall  buildings and most probably the boring  system  is

not  feasible or dangerous. Could the Minister enlighten

the  House? We should try to use this boring  system  to

get  water. Instead of water, most probably we might get

oil. Who knows!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Hon. Member would have done better

if  he had directed his remarks to the man-in-charge who

happens to be the Minister for National Development  and

Communications and the Chairman of the Public  Utilities

Board.   But  since  he  mentioned  oil,  I  myself   am

interested tool



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the soil at Bedok can hold water but there is not

much water to be collected. It is suitable for a storage

reservoir but the catchment is small and, therefore, the

quantity  of water that can be tapped will not  be  very

significant.  The  Bedok area,  in  fact,  is  an  urban

catchment  area  and the runoff water is very  polluted,

especially  during  dry  weather.  However,  the  Public

Utilities Board is studying this problem. For  the  time

being,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



the  project  has been deferred. I understand  that  the

reliable yield is about 23,000 cubic metres or 5 million

gallons per day.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for boring, there have been studies to show that

there may be water right down under Singapore, but it is

a  costly process and nobody has been able to bore  that

far  down. Anyway, not yet but one day we will  come  to

that.  If we strike oil, let us hope that it is  not  in

the Straits of Malacca but in the Straits of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ang Nam Piau)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to draw attention to a grave social

problem  that has been receiving widespread coverage  in

recent  weeks.  I refer to the problem of the  Singapore

sex  fiend, if I may so term it. The activities  of  the

sex  fiend have been truly alarming of late, so much  so

that  it  has already been suggested in the  House  that

severe penalties be instituted to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



help  check the increasing number of sex crimes  in  the

Republic.  Little girls of three years to 1 2 years  old

have  fallen victim to sex fiends in recent  weeks,  and

parents  are understandably gravely concerned  over  the

safety  of their children, any one of whom could  become

the next victim so long as these monstrous criminals are

still at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not deny that our Police Force is efficient in

the  apprehension of these and other types of criminals,

but  what I want to point out today is the fact that  no

useful  purpose  will  have been  served  if  these  sex

criminals  are  caught and sentenced to short  terms  of

imprisonment. Once they a-e out of jail they will be  on

the prowl again in next to no time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been contended that the solution to this evil

lies  in appropriate rehabilitation and education.  This

is as the case may be, but it is a point of opinion open

to  debate.  I  would  like  to  remind  those  who  are

predisposed  to magnanimity to criminals of the  tragedy

of  our  Prison-without-gates at Pulau Senang.  The  sad

incident of Pulau Senang may be an isolated one, but  it

has  proved  that  penal servitude and education  cannot

always  effectively  change  criminal  nature.  It   may

sometimes  be  necessary in dealing  with  brutal  human

beings to adopt a tooth for a tooth principle, as in the

pre-Christian era.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall reading a book called the East West Han, in

which was narrated an incident relating to Liu Pang, the

first  Emperor  of  the  Han  Dynasty.  When  Liu   Pang

dethroned Si Huang Ti of the Ching Dynasty, he felt that

the laws existing then were very harsh and needed to  be

changed.  So  he consulted his subjects and changed  the

laws,  which afforded the Han Dynasty to rule over China

for over four hundred years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw a parallel, we in Singapore inherited the

system  of laws when we took over from the British.  But

in  our context, Sir, these British laws have proved  to

be  as  effective  as paper tigers in dealing  with  our

problems  of law and order. I suggest that  it  is  high

time these laws were updated to enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



us  to deal with offenders successfully. In this respect

I  would like to have the view of the Minister for  Home

Affairs  and  Education as to whether or not  he  thinks

that  our  existing laws are adequate and  need  not  be

changed in the present Singapore context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study the sex crime patterns in other countries,

we  will realise that it is a phenomenon connected  with

social change, urbanisation and industrialisation. It is

only  rational to expect, therefore, that as  a  country

grows and changes, its legislation keeps apace. It might

be  profitable  perhaps in this  respect  to  study  the

situation  in other countries in order to formulate  our

own  method  and principle of coping with  new  criminal

forces  that threaten to attack and undermine our  hard-won progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can feel justifiably proud that it has

achieved the highest per capita income, second  only  to

Japan in South-east Asia. But this is no consolation  if

at the same time there is no happiness and peace of mind

for  our people. Truly it has been said that man  cannot

live  on  bread  alone  and  that  material  advancement

without  spiritual insight is like a bird with  a  wing.

Side by side with improved legislation we should seek to

institute authentic research into the social problems of

our   time.  Social  research  will  give  us  a  better

understanding  of  the real causes of  the  patterns  of

crime  in  our society and will help us to  formulate  a

list  of  safeguards and deterrents  of  real  practical

value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as a short-term measure, I submit respectfully,

Sir,  that  though we may need to hit the Singapore  sex

maniac  hard, as a long term measure we should institute

sociological research into disturbed behaviour  patterns

arising  out of rapid social and economic changes.  Only

then  will  we  be  able  to adopt effective  preventive

measures  instead of relying solely on harsh  deterrents

and punitive measures.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, I would like to

question  the  Minister for Home Affairs, and  Education

regarding   the  Government's  policy   on   crime   and

punishment, especially in regard to sex



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



crimes.  Every  time  a rape takes place,  every  decent

person  is  shocked and shocked to the  extreme  if  the

victim  is a young child. We are overcome with anger  if

naked  violence  is  used  on the  victim.  Even  if  no

violence is used on the victim, the heinousness  of  the

crime  is  not lessened. Imagine the pain and  suffering

the  victim has to bear. When a victim of rape is  bound

and gagged in a secluded place or in similar environment

and  is  left to languish and die, the brutality of  the

crime  should fall within the definition of  murder  and

warrants the imposition of the death sentence. I  wonder

if the Minister for Home Affairs and Education is of the

view  that the relevant sections of the Penal Code  need

to be reviewed, in view of what I said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex offences I believe are on the increase. We know

that  in a number of cases the victims were young girls.

I  hold a strong view that sex offenders should be  more

severely  punished.  I  am of  the  view  that  corporal

punishment  and life imprisonment without  remission  of

sentence  should be meted out on violent  and  dangerous

sex   offenders  and  the  death  sentence   should   be

mandatorily  imposed on offenders who  have  caused  the

death  of the victim by whatever criminal act, including

the act of criminal negligence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, I am glad that the Member for Bras

Basah  and the Member for Kallang have brought  up  this

matter  of  increasing sex offences being  committed  in

Singapore, as it gives me the opportunity to inform  the

House  of the matters which the Ministry of Home Affairs

is considering at the moment with regard to dealing with

such offences. I am glad that the Members for Bras Basah

and  Kallang  are  in  support  of  deterrent  sentences

against such offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first refer to the address by the Member for

Bras  Basah.  He  said that since  we  have  taken  over

control   of   Singapore  from  the   British   colonial

authorities,  those British laws should be amended  from

time  to  time  in  order to cope with  the  social  and

economic  development of the Republic. May  I  say  that

since we took over, many new laws have been enacted  and

old laws amended to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



make  them  more  adequate to  deal  with  criminals  in

accordance  with  the changes in our  way  of  life  and

social  development. However, I do not think we want  to

legislate to the extent of becoming tyrannical  as  with

the Ching Dynasty's pattern of rule, as suggested by the

Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. I

did not say that we should follow the tyrannical law  of

the  Ching Dynasty. I said that the first Emperor of the

Han  Dynasty  felt  that the law was too  harsh.  So  he

consulted  his subjects and changed the law. I  did  not

suggest that we should follow his tyrannical law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I am glad that the Member for Bras

Basah has clarified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the specifics, in the case of sex offenders

the maximum punishment under our law is imprisonment for

life.  In  addition, offenders shall also be  liable  to

fine or caning. Persons guilty of outraging modesty  are

punishable with imprisonment of up to two years, or with

fine,   or  with  caning,  or  with  any  two  of   such

punishments.   Caning   is,  however,   not   mandatory.

Punishment is at the discretion of the court,  according

to the circumstances of each case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our statistics show that the number of reported rape

cases  in  1975 was 59 as compared to 76 in  1974.  This

represents a 22% decrease, contrary to popular  opinion.

Outraging of modesty cases, however, increased from  172

in  1974  to  239  in  1975. It is,  however,  debatable

whether  sex  offenders are actually on the increase  or

because the victims are now more willing to come forward

to   report  such  offences.  However,  the  Police  are

extremely   concerned  over  the   situation   and   are

monitoring the situation very carefully.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the legislation pertaining to these

offences is now being undertaken. If necessary, enhanced

punishment including



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



mandatory caning may be introduced for rape offences.  I

note  that  the  Hon.  Member  for  Bukit  Ho  Swee  has

suggested   that  rapists  should  be  castrated (*Hansard,

15th March, 1976, col. 282.)  When recommending amendments to the law on rape,  I  do  not

think we should go so far as to adopt the suggestion  of

the  Member for Bukit Ho Swee, or even propose  capital

punishment  as  suggested  by the  Member  for  Kallang.

However,   Sir,   we  are  seriously  studying   certain

legislation  which is in force in one or two  states  in

the United States whereby a convicted rapist can opt for

voluntary  axe-sexualisation or castration  in  lieu  of

sentence  of  a long term of imprisonment. This  law  is

based  on the medical grounds that the only cure  for  a

compulsive rapist is voluntary axe-sexualisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from deterrent sentences I would like to stress

the   importance  of  preventive  measures   and   early

detection. For this year there are, to-date, 1  5  cases

of  rape and 47 cases of outraging of modesty. In 10 out

of  the  1 5 cases of rape the offender is known to  the

victim. In the cases of outraging of modesty five of the

offenders are known to the victim. In 1975, cases  where

the offender is known to the victim number 36 out of  59

cases  of rape, and 14 out of 239 cases of outraging  of

modesty.  These figures are sufficient to  show  that  a

very  high proportion of offences, in particular,  rape,

could have been avoided or prevented if the victims  had

been more careful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the point that the public have a

very  important role to play in stamping out or at least

minimising  these  offences. They have  been  constantly

reminded  to be wary of strangers and to avoid  dark  or

lonely places. Parents have also been advised that  they

should   always  make  sure  that  responsible   persons

accompany  their  children to and  from  school  and  on

outings,  and to instil in their children the  evils  of

tempting offers of sweets, toys or other little  worldly

things. Regrettably, the recent spate of rape cases  and

outraging of modesty has given me cause to believe  that

some  members of the public have not taken  such  advice

seriously.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of detection of sex offences is low. Over the

last  two years this averages 35% for rape and  45%  for

outraging  of modesty. Police investigations  have  been

hampered by the skimpy description of offenders in  most

cases.  Another  serious setback is the absence  of  eye

witnesses or the reluctance of witnesses to come forward

to  give information to the Police. In the recent  cases

the Police have to painstakingly piece together bits and

pieces  of  information obtained from the young  victims

before  a composite picture could be drawn up. This  was

passed  on to the press and television, which have  been

very helpful, to appeal to the public to come forward if

they  have  any  information. I  am  informed  that  the

response has been most encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their part, the Police, with the support of the

national servicemen in the Special Constabulary and  the

Community Security Force, will intensify patrols in  the

crime prone or rape prone areas. But to what extent they

can be successful in all these will depend very much  on

the cooperation of the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1105*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past few years although there has been

some improvement in various aspects of the Police Force,

certain serious problems still exist. I feel that if the

Police  want  to give a good impression to  the  public,

these problems, so long as they exist, will give them  a

poor  image. I am referring to the very serious practice

of  Police  officers  covering up the  wrongs  of  other

Police  officers. If a Police officer has  committed  an

offence, the other officers in charge would not  try  to

rectify  the wrong but instead try to cover up for  him.

How  are  you  going  to improve the efficiency  of  the

Police  and give a good impression to the people if  you

do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



rectify  the errors and weed out evil doers? These  acts

of  covering up the wrong doings of Police officers  can

be  illustrated  by the instances that  I  am  going  to

quote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a member of the public met with a road accident

involving  a  Police  officer.  Both  sides  started  an

argument.   In  the  end,  the  policeman  resorted   to

violence. The other party then wrote a complaint to  the

Police  Commissioner. The Police Authority,  wanting  to

cut the matter short, replied that there was no evidence

to show that the Police officer had resorted to violence

against  any member of the public. The same letter  also

stated that the Police officer concerned had been warned

to  constrain his behaviour in future. How contradictory

is  that? If the complainant had no evidence on the  one

hand  and  the Police officer did nothing wrong  on  the

other,  then why warn him? In reality, knowing  it  full

well, and arising out of the desire to cover up a fellow

officer's  wrongdoings, such a letter was devised.  Have

they  ever  realised that such a letter would give  rise

to  very  unfavourable impression among the  members  of

the public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the attitude of the Police in dealing with

members  of  the  public  has  very  often  resulted  in

dissatisfaction  among the public. Some Police  officers

are  not willing to do their duty. Not only they do  not

try  to help the public in dealing with their complaints

but  will  resort  to do something that  will  adversely

affect the interest of the complainants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there have been newspaper reports of

increasing cases of molestation and rape. To  curb  this

increase, the Police should have appealed to the  public

for  cooperation. Let us see the attitude of the  Police

towards  the public in dealing with such cases:  A  girl

was  molested and she reported this to the Police.  Even

the  person who committed this offence was also  brought

to  the Police station and yet the Police persuaded  the

girl  not  to lodge an official report and told  her  to

just forget about the matter as it would cause her great

inconvenience.  This  incident  shows  how  some  Police

officers can go to such lengths



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



to  shirk their responsibility as to try to cover up the

offender by dissuading the victim from complaining.  How

then can these crimes be curbed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case a member of the public reported to the

Police  about a breach of trust involving some  loss  of

cash, but the Police officer concerned not only did  not

help but grumbled that since the amount of loss involved

was  so  small, being a few hundred dollars, why  should

the   complainant  report  such  a  trivial   loss.   We

understand that the loss of cash due to breach of  trust

is  a  serious offence according to the law. Where  does

the law stipulate that only when the loss involved is of

a larger amount then it will become a breach of trust to

take any action in respect of it? In principle, there is

no reason to reject such a complaint. Sir, this attitude

on  the part of the Police will not only discourage  the

public but also encourage more offences to be committed.

This attitude should not be tolerated at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was another case when a member of the

public  was assaulted and had to be sent to the hospital

to  be  stitched up. He also reported to the Police  but

they  only  tried  to evade their duty by  getting  both

parties  together and blaming them and warning them  for

causing  so  much trouble to the Police.  This  kind  of

treatment,  the  victim felt, was another  psychological

blow  to him in addition to the physical injury  he  had

suffered. The way the Police deal with public complaints

can only antagonise the public against the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is more serious, where complaints have been

lodged  to  the Police, they tried to avoid  trouble  by

disclosing  the  names and addresses of complainants  to

the  accused persons, which is against normal procedure,

in  the  hope that both parties would resolve the matter

between  themselves. Such a practice is likely to  deter

persons  from  making complaints to the Police  and  may

even  result  in  some danger to the complainants.  From

these  incidents, we can see that there are many serious

problems existing in the Police Force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often we hear of appeals by the Police for

cooperation from the public. However, I feel  that  they

should  first  look into themselves and try  to  improve

their  own  attitude  and  sense  of  responsibility  in

relation  to  their manner of discharging their  duties.

Only on this basis, can they give a better image to  the

public  so that the public will have more confidence  in

them to come forward to cooperate with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I could

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police Force has been very successful in

combating  crime  in  Singapore. The  inception  of  the

Vigilante  Corps has also strengthened the Police  Force

and, as a result, the citizens feel a bit secured. It is

evident that the higher penalties introduced in the past

for some offences had in a way lessened the major crimes

being  committed.  However, of late there  has  been  an

increase in the number of cases of molestation and rape,

so  much  so  that  in some housing  estates  women  and

children are afraid to move about alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of sex crimes reported to the Police is

only  a small proportion of the actual crimes committed.

Many  cases are not reported, as the victims are  afraid

of  the  publicity given to the cases when they come  up

for mention. Incidentally, the other day it was reported

that   an  all-women  firing  squad  executed  17  Cuban

soldiers  convicted  of  rape  and  murder  in  war-torn

Angola.   It  seems  that  the  women  who  were   raped

identified five of the 17 captured Cubans as their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



violators.  The  firing squad was composed  entirely  of

women. The Cubans were shot with their own guns. That is

only  an  example. In Singapore it is time  that  severe

penalties were introduced to curb the growing number  of

sex offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the CID Organised

Crime  Branch for having successfully curbed  the  crime

syndicates.  We  have seen a number of  known  criminals

tracked  and brought to book. This is a good sign.  This

Police Crime Branch has done a wonderful job. They ought

to be complimented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nowadays criminals have become sophisticated not

only in organising crimes but also in the commission  of

crime,  thanks to our TV shows. Programmes  like  Hawaii

Five-O, Ironside. Cannon, Police Woman, etc, have  in  a

way  educated  them. They also seem to  have  up-to-date

equipment  and  weapons for their  operations,  some  of

which  may  be better than the ones used by the  Police.

What  has  our Police Force done in respect  of  dealing

with this new type of equipment used by these criminals?

Are  there any funds allocated for the Police  Force  to

purchase sophisticated and scientific equipment to fight

sophisticated  criminals?  What  scientific  and  modern

equipment does the Police Force have at present to fight

this  new  type of crime? What about using  helicopters?

Last  year I also mentioned about helicopters.  Has  the

Police  Force thought of all these? Are there any  plans

or  provisions  made to purchase scientific  and  modern

equipment for our Police Force? In America, Police  cans

are  equipped with minicomputers for easy identification

of  criminals, infra-red equipment, laser guns, etc.  Is

our Police Force one step ahead or is it hoping that the

criminals will not be that sophisticated? Are our patrol

cars well-equipped with modern equipment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of Police transport, how many Police

vehicles are there? We find that some "bone shakers" are

still  being used by the Police for transport. Is  there

any provision to improve this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that some of the Police stations are

going to be resited with their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



construction based on modern architecture. Some stations

are  also  being  renovated. But then  there  are  other

Police  stations which are very old. It  is  high  time.

they  were  demolished and replaced with new  ones.  For

instance, the Paya Lebar Police Station is so  old  that

it   is   still  dependent  on  the  bucket  system   of

sanitation.  Are  there any plans to  renovate  all  the

Police stations, including the CID building?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we still have in our midst a good number of

secret   societies   threatening   our   citizens   with

extortion,  etc. May I know how many cases of  extortion

have been reported to the Police during last year? It is

time that these parasites of society were wiped out from

our  country. We cannot tolerate secret societies in our

midst.  Their  members  are unemployed  and  believe  in

getting everything through intimidation and murder.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

believe  babies and children are flowers  of  our  land.

With Government policy to limit population growth, their

worth  to  us is all the more enhanced. Even then,  Sir,

the   Ministry  blemishes  them  by  disallowing   their

registration in the names of their fathers when they are

born  out  of wedlock despite the willingness  of  their

parents  to have them so registered. Punishing  innocent

children  this way is not becoming of a wise  and  forth

right government. Imagine the unfortunate babies growing

into  adolescents with the scar of illegitimacy  clearly

printed  on  their birth certificates which need  to  be

produced  at  various important periods of their  lives;

for  example,  registration at schools, registration  at

marriage,  and so on. When will the Ministry  be  humane

enough to amend this regulation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Commissioner of Police

responsible for this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> This is administration,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first deal

with the Member for Potong Pasir? Since he has chosen to

bring  up  his point under the subhead "Commissioner  of

Police", my answer is that the Commissioner of Police is

not  in  charge  of either registering or  deregistering

illegitimate children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now deal with the points raised by the Member

for  Aljunied.  I am very glad that he  has  brought  up

these  points in this House, particularly the complaints

about  the  Police Force. It gives me an opportunity  to

put   the  issue  of  these  complaints  in  its  proper

perspective.  We do get criticisms now  and  again.  The

Member for Anson, on the other hand, has given praise to

the  Police  Force. It is not often that the Member  for

Anson gives praise instead of criticism in debating  the

Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Praising only the CID and not the

Police Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> In any case, the Member for Anson

has  praised  the CID. He has also mentioned  about  the

drop in the crime rate, which I shall deal with later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Member for Aljunied, my only regret

is that he has not brought to my attention by writing to

me earlier of the specific cases which he has mentioned.

I would have had the matter looked into and action would

have been taken against the offending Police officers if

they were found guilty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate here that there are always

two  sides  to a story. To be fair, the matter  must  be

investigated impartially and with an open  mind.  It  is

unfair to jump to conclusions one way or the other until

the   full  facts  have  been  established.  To   ensure

impartiality,  the  procedure laid down  is  that  every

complaint against a Police officer is investigated by  a

senior officer from a Police division or unit other than

the   one   in  which  the  officer  is  attached.   The

investigation  papers  are  then  scrutinised   by   the

respective Commanding Officers and the Ministry of  Home

Affairs  where the complaint is brought to the attention

of the Ministry. If an offence is disclosed, the officer

is  put  on a departmental charge and his case  will  be

heard  before  an independent board of inquiry  or  even

prosecuted  in  court.  On  the  other  hand,   if   the

allegation  is not substantiated, no action, of  course,

can  be  taken, but the complainant will be informed  of

it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there may be cases where although a complaint

has  not  been  substantiated,  in  the  course  of  the

investigation it was found that the complaint could have

been  prevented or avoided if the officer had been  more

tactful, polite and use his commonsense. In such a  case

the  officer  would  be warned to be  more  tactful  and

polite  in  his  future dealings  with  members  of  the

public. This may have been the case with the reply  from

the  Police  to  wh'ch the Member has  referred  in  his

speech.  In a case where a reply given by the Police  is

that  the  complaint is unsubstantiated, the complainant

can,  if  he  is not satisfied and, in fact, suspects  a

cover-up  by the Police, further complain to his  Memoer

of  Parliament,  or write a letter to the  Minister,  or

complain to the CPIB. The procedure in the investigation

of  complaints is thus not only impartial  but  has  the

necessary checks to ensure impartiality. I do not think,

therefore, it is fair to make a general allegation  that

Police  officers  will always protect  their  own  kind.

There are sufficient checks and very heavy penalties for

those  who  may  be foolish enough to do  so.  A  Police

officer  with  years of service and on  the  pensionable

establishment will have much to lose if he does so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will always be complaints against Police

officers.  The important thing to bear in mind  is  that

each and every case is investigated and action taken. By

the  nature of their job. Police officers often come  in

contact  and deal with criminals and antisocial elements

in  our  society. Thus, some complaints  against  police

officers  were  genuine and well founded.  But  quite  a

number of them were found to be unfounded, in fact, even

malicious or exaggerated. The record bears this out.  In

1975,  a total of 314 complaints were received from  the

public   against  Police  officers.  Forty-two  of   the

complaints  are  still  under  investigation.   Of   the

remaining  272 complaints, only 40 cases or  less,  that

is,  1 5%, were substantiated. Out of these 40 cases  20

were    for   minor   infringements   and   departmental

disciplinary action was taken against the officers. This

action  resulted in three officers being dismissed  from

the Police Force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member did raise a point that when the members of

the  public complained about any criminal offence  being

committed against him or her, such complaints  were  not

held  with  the  confidentiality that they  deserve.  It

happened  sometimes that a complaint came to the  notice

of  the accused or the person against whom the complaint

was  made.  Let  me  clarify to this  House  about  this

question   of   confidentiality   of   complaints    and

information given to the Police. With regard to a report

lodged  with the Police, it is usually done at a  Police

station. This is an open document and the accused person

mentioned in the report has the legal right to obtain  a

copy  of the report on payment of the requisite fee.  In

the  circumstances, an accused person  must  necessarily

become  aware of the complaint made against him. Perhaps

this  explains  the  case  which  the  Hon.  Member  has

mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what the Minister

has  said  about  information  being  disclosed  to  the

accused  person is to side-track the issue,  I  wish  to

clarify  that I have brought up only some  of  the  many

cases  I  know  and that the information  had  not  been

disclosed in accordance with the normal procedure  where

a copy of the report could be obtained by the accused as

mentioned by the Minister. If the Minister had  listened

carefully,  he  would know that I was referring  to  the

specific  cases  where the officers  concerned  released

information about the complainant's name and address  to

the accused person in an unofficial manner. The Minister

did not seem to understand what I was saying just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member had

given  me the particulars earlier, I could have given  a

fuller explanation. But the point I am making is that if

a  complaint is lodged against so-and-so, it is an  open

report and is not confidential. It can be made available

to the accused person on payment of a fee. However, when

members of the public give information to the Police  on

suspicious persons or activities of suspected criminals,

etc., the source and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



identity  of  the  persons giving such information  are

always  treated  with  the  strictest  confidence.  Such

information is treated as intelligence and classified as

secret  and  will not be revealed to any member  of  the

public,  much less the accused. If this case  which  the

Member  for  Aljunied has cited falls within the  second

category,  and if the information given is  revealed  to

members of the public, then it is a very serious offence

and the officer responsible has committed an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter raised is about loss of cash and

the  allegation that the Police officer has said,  "This

is  a  small  matter.  It should be  settled  mutually."

Whatever  report or complaint that has been  made  by  a

member  of  the  public against another  member  of  the

public  and  an offence has been disclosed,  the  Police

will  and must investigate it. If they do not, then they

are  failing in their duty. I would like the Member  for

Aljunied to bring this matter up to me so that it can be

investigated and if it is substantiated that the officer

has contravened the procedure, he will be dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member for Anson, he said, that it is

as  a  result of Police action - I hope he said  that  - that  the crime rate has declined. That is true  because

the  figures  will  show  that.  As  compared  to  1974,

robberies  in  1  975 dropped by 23%; housebreaking  and

theft  by  4%; theft of motor vehicles by 21% and  other

thefts  by 7.3%. As far as his comments on sex  offences

are concerned, I will not repeat what I have stated just

now.  But  may I say again that we will not hesitate  to

seek  a mandate from this House to introduce more severe

penalties if these are found necessary. However,  I  can

assure  this House that the proposal will certainly  not

be  as  drastic  as  that in Angola where  an  all-women

firing squad executed the rapists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to Police stations, may I say that

except  for  Queenstown Police Station which  was  built

only  in  1963, all the old stations will be phased  out

and  replaced. The new Police stations will not only  be

built  along new lines in architecture but will also  be

geared  towards greater operational efficiency and  will

provide a more congenial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



working environment to both the Police officers as  well

as the public who have occasion to visit the station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of Toa Payoh Police Station has begun

and  is expected to be completed some time in 1977.  The

new  site  of  the Orchard Police Station is  at  Napier

Road,  and there is also the new Jurong Police  Station.

The construction of these two Police stations will start

as soon as funds are released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Paya Lebar Police Station, we have

decided  to  resite  it  in Ang Mo  Kio  because  it  is

envisaged   that  Ang  Mo  Kio  will   have   a   larger

concentration of population, but this move will only  be

taken in about three years' time at the earliest. In the

meantime,  consideration is being given to renovate  the

present Paya Lebar Police Station and to install  modern

sanitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the CID building, there is no plan to move the

CID for the present. There is a plan to move the CID  to

the proposed Ministry of Home Affairs and Police complex

at Mount Pleasant in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked whether the Police

Force  is  equipped  to  deal  with  criminals  who  use

sophisticated  and scientific equipment. First,  let  me

assure  him  that our Police Force has yet to  encounter

criminals  resorting  to the use  of  sophisticated  and

scientific  weapons  in  the  commission  of  crimes  as

enumerated by him. However, this does not imply that  we

are taking a back seat on the matter or to use the words

of  the  Member "hoping that the criminals will  not  be

that  sophisticated".  There is a  committee  comprising

senior  officers  constantly reviewing Police  equipment

with  a view to updating and withdrawing obsolete  ones.

The  committee  is  also responsible for  examining  new

weapons  used  by  advanced  police  agencies  in  other

countries  to  see whether they could  be  acquired  for

local use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the use of helicopters, a study has been

made  on its use, but it was found to be unsuitable from

the point of view of operation. Cost-wise it is also not

justified.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



However, if and when there is a need to use helicopters,

the  relevant  body  who  has the  helicopters  will  be

approached to assist the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has already been done to upgrade the techniques

of  criminal  investigation so that we  will  always  be

ahead of the criminal. A Criminal Intelligence Unit  was

established  in  April 1973. A Scene of Crime  Unit  was

also   set   up   in   1975  to  undertake   specialised

investigations into serious crimes. It will ensure  that

there  is  a  systematic approach in the application  of

forensic  science  in Police investigations.  This  Unit

will  acquire modern and scientific equipment  including

some  of  those named by the Hon. Member, if  necessary,

and  may  also  acquire  a mobile crime  laboratory  and

evidence collection van.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for computerisation, the Police has a unit doing

research  and  planning into the  feasibility  of  using

computers for Police work. This unit is working  closely

with the Computer Services Department of the Ministry of

Finance.  If  necessary, the acquisition of  a  computer

solely  for Police use will be considered. A  start  has

already  been  made  to programme  criminal  records  on

computer. Similarly, traffic accident records have  also

been computerised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to Police vehicles, the Force has a fleet

of  313  saloon  cars comprising (a) 1 52 team  policing

cars;  (b) 67 radio patrol cars: (c) 95 general  purpose

cars. Of these, 182 were acquired in the fiscal years

1973/74  and  1974/75.  The  remaining  vehicles   which

average  four  to five years' use will  be  replaced  in

stages. Hence, although some of the Police vehicles  are

relatively old and well-worn in terms of usage, they are

not really bone-shakers in the conventional sense of the

word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards extortion, 356 cases were reported to the

Police  in  1975 as compared to 312 cases  in  1974,  an

increase of 14%. However, a breakdown of reported  cases

in  1975 shows that 100 cases of extortion and attempted

extortion were committed through the post as compared to

68  in  1974.  It  is believed that quite  a  number  of

extortion  letters were written by cranks or pranksters.

Nonetheless, the Police did not take any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



chances   and   each   case  was  fully   and   promptly

investigated;  ambushes were also set up in  appropriate

places and with successful results as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our statistics also show that only one case of

extortion  was  committed by a secret society  in  1975,

whilst there was none in 1974. These are reported cases.

However,  crimes  committed by secret  society  elements

have  decreased  significantly in the  last  two  years.

There were only 36 secret society incidents in 1974  and

30  in 1975 compared to 68 in 1971, 78 in 1972 and 75 in

1973  respectively. However, the House can rest  assured

that  there will not be any let-up in our action against

secret societies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I just raise

two  points?  First  of  all, the Minister  mentioned  a

figure  of  over  300  cases of  complaint.  I  am  just

wondering whether he could give comparative figures  for

the  last  three or five years, because I  think  it  is

necessary  and important to make sure that  there  is  a

proper  system of monitoring complaints to  see  whether

there  is,  in  fact, an improvement  in  the  standard.

Listening to the debate in this House from year to year,

one  seems  to  get  the impression that  the  same  old

complaints   are  being  aired.  Has   there   been   an

improvement?  I  am  not sure if the  Minister  has  the

figures available with him.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I am afraid I cannot give

detailed figures at the moment. If the Member for  Jalan

Kayu  were to write to me, I would give him the figures.

The  point  to  note  is  that  there  will  always   be

complaints. But what is important is whether  `they  are

major  complaints or just minor complaints. From what  I

know  of  these complaints I can say that the number  of

major  complaints has declined. I cannot speak the  same

for the minor complaints; the number may be the same  or

there  might be a slight increase or decrease.  What  is

evident is that the number of major complaints of Police

brutality and so on has gone down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> The information is needed not so much

for myself. I think it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



would  be better for the Minister to publish the figures

for public consumption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, it is best for the Member to

put  in  a Question for Oral Answer or a Written Answer,

and the figures will be published.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I withdraw

my amendment, allow me to say that what I cited just now

were  only some instances to prove that Police  officers

do  protect  their  own  kind and  that  their  attitude

towards members of the public has not been good. This is

quite  prevalent  among  Police  officers.  Perhaps  the

Minister  is  not aware of this because  those  officers

with  whom  he  comes  into  contact  are  high  ranking

officers  and can be expected to show deference  to  the

Minister  as their superior. As to the attitude  of  the

rank   and  file  towards  members  of  the  public   it

constitutes  a  serious problem which I would  like  the

Minister to be aware of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the examples I quoted just now related to a

person  who wrote to the Commissioner of Police  and  he

was  not  able to deal with the problem. If this problem

cannot  be solved by the Commissioner of Police, who  is

able  to  solve it? If one should write to the Minister,

he would likewise ask the Commissioner of Police to deal

with  it, but the Commissioner of Police would not  have

been  in  a better position than the Minister  to  solve

this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I just say, in reply to

the Member for Aljunied, that if only he had written  to

me  earlier there would have been no reason for  him  to

say  that I would not be aware. In fact, I am aware that

there   are  complaints.  What  is  important  is   that

complaints are gone into seriously and action is taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also stated that if the complainant is not

satisfied  with an answer from the Police  Commissioner,

there  are  other avenues for the complainant to  resort

to. He can write a letter to the Minister, or he can  go

to  the  CPIB,  and  so on. So there are  procedures  to

ensure  that if any Police officer attempts to cover  up

someone eIse, he will be discovered. That is all that  I

can say. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



may  or may not be cover-ups. It is not fair for  me  to

say  one  way or the other. What I say is that if  there

are cover-ups, there are procedures whereby these cover-ups  would  be  brought to the attention of  the  higher

authorities,  so  that further investigations  could  be

carried out because these are serious allegations. To be

fair  and  impartial, I say again there are avenues  for

further  investigations. I am not making excuses.  I  am

not saying that if there are cover-ups, we should not go

into  it. If there are cover-ups, we should go into  it.

If any member of the public thinks that the Commissioner

of  Police  is  not  in  a position  to  deal  with  his

complaint, he can go higher up, and it will  go.  I  can

assure  the House that it will be so because this  is  a

very  serious allegation and this should not be  in  any

case  tolerated.  I  hope the Member for  Aljunied  will

write  to  me giving me the details and I will  have  it

reinvestigated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao (Katong):</b> I an not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BDA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Traffic Police Department

whether  the  provisions of the Road Traffic (Amendment)

Act  requiring  pedestrians to use the  overhead  bridge

within a distance of 50 metres, when crossing the  road,

have   been  implemented.  These  regulations  are  very

important and should be strictly enforced, otherwise all

the pedestrian overhead bridges and subterranean subways

which cost large sums of money to build will be wasted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we have noticed, many people just ignore the

overhead  bridges  and subways and  jaywalk  across  the

road. The most obvious example of jaywalking can be seen

at   Clifford   Pier   where,   despite   airconditioned

escalators   leading   to  the  overhead   bridge,   the

pedestrians would rather walk or run across the road. We

all know that the traffic there is heavy and the road is

quite   wide.  Therefore, it  is  very  dangerous   for

pedestrians  to  walk  or run  across  the  road.  If  a

jaywalker meets with an accident, it will not only be  a

matter  of  losing his life but also  a  matter  of  his

family  losing  the  breadwinner  in  the  family,  thus

bringing about an additional social problem and  burden.

This   disregard   for   pedestrian   overhead   bridges

constitutes a source of danger to motorists and it  will

also  cause obstruction to the flow of traffic. Besides,

the  jaywalker is also setting a very bad example to our

younger  generation who are prone to imitating what  the

elders  do.  In  view of this, I hope that  the  Traffic

Police Department will tackle this problem seriously and

effectively implement such traffic regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, of course, aware that if any motorist should

infringe any traffic regulation, it is easy to book him.

But  this  is not so with pedestrians who are guilty  of

jaywalking.  This  reminds me of  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment which has been keeping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



Singapore   clean  effectively  by  enforcing   punitive

measures to deal with littering. Similarly I believe the

Traffic  Police Department should also be able  to  take

punitive  measures to prevent an infringement  of  these

traffic regulations against jaywalking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here. Mr Chua.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I agree entirely with what the

Member  for Aljunied has said with regard to jaywalking.

In  fact, jaywalking has been made an offence under  the

recent  amendment  to  the Road  Traffic  Act.  However,

before  it  can  be  enforced, a new set  of  rules  and

regulations  will  have to be made under  the  Act.  The

drafting  of  these  regulations  are  currently   being

undertaken   by   the  Ministry  of  Home   Affairs   in

consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proposed that under the new regulations it

would be an offence for any pedestrian who is within  50

metres of either side of a pedestrian crossing, be it an

overhead  bridge, a tunnel, or a zebra-crossing,  if  he

does  not  make  use  of  the  crossing.  Sir,  we  have

specified  metres  and not yards,  since  we  have  gone

metric.  It  is also proposed to exempt pedestrians  who

are  sick, physically handicapped, or over 60  years  of

age,  from  such requirements. Perhaps a  mass  campaign

against  jaywalking will be launched before the  law  is

implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

Minister's  explanation,  I beg  leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BHA 1111*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr N.Govindasamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to express the hope that additional

expenditure  to  be  incurred in this  section  for  the

Special Constabulary will result in improvement  in  the

organisation    and   achievement   of    the    Special

Constabulary. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>





myself  have  received some reports  about  the  Special

Constabulary   which   I  might  perhaps   describe   as

disquieting. These reports relate to weaknesses  in  the

system  of  allocation of duties to Special Constabulary

part-time  national servicemen. They relate to  lack  of

supervision  to  ensure that the men  actually  are  out

there  on  the  beat  that they have been  given.  These

reports  also  relate  to  lax  discipline,  even   such

activity  known  as  skiving or duty  evasion.  Specific

instances   illustrating  these  weaknesses  have   been

brought  to my attention. I am sure the Minister  is  as

well aware as I am of these faults.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one development which I think

deserves special encouragement and praise, and  the  re-examination of its implication as to its more  universal

applicability in the Special Constabulary as a whole.  I

am  referring  to a small experimental scheme  that  has

been  started  in  the G Division  under  which  my  own

constituency comes. This scheme involves the sending out

of  teams  composed  of  Special  Constabulary  national

servicemen  and  regulars to neighbourhoods,  especially

housing estates, to identify and strike up relationships

with  groups  of idle youth. These young people  may  be

noticed horsing around, playing football where they  are

not  supposed to, making a noise with guitars and  other

ways   of  noise-making,  and  causing  a  nuisance   of

themselves.  If  left  too long  to  themselves,  it  is

possible  that these little groups of idle young  people

might  turn to petty or more serious crime. Most of  the

members of these groups are unemployed and have time  on

their hands. The Special Constabulary teams make,  I  am

told,  patient  overtures to these  groups  and  try  to

direct   their  attention  and  energies  towards   more

meaningful activities. Some success has been achieved in

that  many of these boys have voluntarily turned  up  at

Police stations to play games against Police teams; they

have  been  found jobs and their social  attitudes  have

gradually  changed  towards  one  less  apprehensive  of

authority   and   more   cooperative   towards   society

generally. An extension of this scheme has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



been   contrived  to  involve  some  work  in   my   own

constituency  and  I  am looking forward  to  successful

results which I am told may be in the offing.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kind of work that many of our young

Special  Constabulary national servicemen would like  to

be  involved in. Many of these national servicemen  have

groused  against meaningless activities which they  have

been  forced to perform. Here is one area admittedly  of

experiment  but if successful, other kinds of  similarly

useful  socially orientated activities could be planned,

possibly  with  the  collaboration of  the  Ministry  of

Social  Affairs.  I  would certainly  recommend  greater

support for this kind of work that is being done by  the

Ministry of Home Affairs.



<br><br>6.02 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, beat duty is

by   its   nature  monotonous.  Many  of  our   national

servicemen  who  are performing their  national  service

obligation   as   part-time  special   constables,   and

Vigilante  Corps members as well, look upon such  duties

as uncreative and unproductive. This kind of attitude is

especially   evident  amongst  the  so-called   educated

national  servicemen.  Some of the  so-called  educated,

amongst   whom   are   included   some   graduates   and

professional  men,  look  upon  their  national  service

obligations as a way of surveying the streets looking at

men and life on the roads with a philosophic eye. Can we

really  blame them for such an attitude? What  programme

has  the  Ministry of Home Affairs instituted to  remove

such  feelings  of  despondency?  What  plans  does  the

Ministry of Home Affairs have to instil in most  of  our

part-time  constables an awareness  that  they  have  an

important  role  to  play  as  special  constables   and

Vigilante Corps members, and not just to let them  loose

in  uniforms  because  the law requires  that  all  male

citizens  should  do  national service?  Many  part-time

special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



constables, after making a desultory round of their beat

areas,  sit  in  back lanes and dark corners  of  public

parks  waiting for their four-hour stint to be  over  so

that  they  can go back to their stations to  sign  off.

This is bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased to hear that some Vigilante Corps

members and special constables have been recruited  into

the  Community  Security Force which is a special  squad

performing  anti-crime  duties Some  special  constables

too, I am told, have been recruited into a Task Force of

anti-crime   squads  to  do  mobile  duties   in   crime

prevention. The vertical policing duties are also a much

more  interesting  activity  than  doing  ordinary  beat

duties.  Unfortunately, it appears that not all  special

constables  could be utilised in these  special  squads.

More  can  be done along this line to make beat  duty  a

more  creative  one as it is being done to  some  extent

with  the  special constables who are  being  taught  to

operate and use walkie-talkies. In such ways, the Police

Force  can make more effective use of the enthusiasm  of

these  young men to counteract the adverse influence  of

regulars who are cynical about special constables  doing

Police work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that some dental surgeons who are doing

national  service  in  the  Special  Constabulary   have

contributed  financially in setting up a  dental  clinic

with two dental chairs in the Police Academy. As part of

their  duties, the dental surgeons man this clinic which

provides  dental  treatment to other part-time  national

servicemen  and  some  regulars  as  well.  The   dental

surgeons   should   be   commended   for   their   civic

responsibility. Their professional training is also  put

to  profitable use. A wider use of professional training

amongst our special constables should be encouraged  and

developed.  Limited use is made of doctors  and  legally

trained men amongst the special constables. I suggest  a

full   study   of  the  trained  professional   manpower

available  among  the  ranks of special  constables  and

their  training be put to maximum use. I am  told  there

are  a  number of lawyers whose expertise is very little

made  use of during their duty hours that they are  able

to  sit in Police stations feeling bored and doing their

own studies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of serious discontent is that they are

tied to part-time national service for eight years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> 12 years.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> That makes it even worse. As more

and  more  part-time national servicemen join the  ranks

year  after year, the number of part-timers will  be  so

large  that  the Ministry of Home Affairs will  find  it

difficult to put them to beneficial use.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I do not think so.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Well, we will see what plans the

Ministry  has  for  them. The Ministry  must  study  the

possibility  of  reducing  part-time  national   service

obligation  to, say, four to five years  or  so.  After

this,  just as full-time national servicemen, they could

be  called up for annual in-camp training, etc., to keep

them up to-date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  Members for Katong and Telok Blangah,  let  me  say

that  I am very keenly aware of the shortcomings of  the

special   constables  which  the   Hon.   Members   have

mentioned. In fact, I had referred to some of them in my

address at the annual dinner of the Special Constabulary

in  November last year. At that dinner, I announced  the

appointment of a Special Constabulary Planning Committee

under  the  chairmanship  of my Parliamentary  Secretary

with the following terms of reference:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To review the role and system of deployment of

part-time  national  servicemen and  volunteers  in  the

Special Constabulary;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To formulate plans, guidelines and new roles from

time to time for more effective and efficient deployment

of the Special Constabulary and through greater interest

and motivation in the work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then a series of remedial measures have been

taken  and  new  schemes  introduced  as  part  of   the

reorganisation of the Special Constabulary which is  now

going on. This should pull the Special Constabulary  out

of  the present malaise. Examples of the measures  taken

are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Neighbourhood Policing Scheme. The Special

Constabulary part-time national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



servicemen  will  soon  be  deployed  at  all  the  land

divisions  under  a  new Neighbourhood  Policing  Scheme

whereby  each  unit of 120 national servicemen  will  be

assigned  to  specific responsibility  of  patrolling  a

fixed  area  within  the Housing and  Development  Board

estates every night. This will offer each patrol team  a

more  clear-cut  role  and area of responsibility.  They

will as far as possible be deployed in the neighbourhood

where  they  live. Their familiarity with the  areas  of

operation will help to enhance their effectiveness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Change of Unit Structure. In the past, special

constables  were  divided into units of  150  men,  each

comprising   one  ASP,  four  Inspectors,  one   Station

Inspector,  eight Sergeants and 136 special  constables.

This  Unit  Structure has been found  unsatisfactory  in

that  the  span  of  control was too wide.  As  national

service  officers,  like other special  constables,  are

required   to  perform  their  duties  in  the   Special

Constabulary  only once in 10 days, national  servicemen

in the unit were often left without supervisory officers

of  the rank of inspector. This has resulted in national

servicemen not being properly briefed and supervised and

hence  the  complaints which Members have enumerated.  A

new  Unit Structure which is smaller and comprising more

supervisory  officers has been introduced.  This  should

ensure  closer  supervision and  better  deployment  and

leadership on the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Utilisation of better educated national servicemen

like  the  professionals. The one result of the creation

of more supervisory posts of sergeants and inspectors to

man  the  Unit  Structure is that  there  are  now  more

opportunities  for  professional  men  and  those   with

tertiary   educational  qualifications  with  leadership

qualities in the Special Constabulary to be deployed  in

supervisory roles instead of having to do beat duties. I

hope  our  professional men in the Special  Constabulary

will  rise to the challenge and take on these leadership

roles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with regard to the rest of the professional

men  in  the Special Constabulary, various schemes  have

been implemented and others are under study to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>





give them more meaningful roles as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The dentists in the Special Constabulary have been

organised  to run dental clinics to service our  special

constables:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Most of the veterinary surgeons have also been

deployed  to  exercise their skills at  the  Police  Dog

Unit;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) More recently, a scheme has been introduced for

doctors, social  scientists  and  psychologists  to  be

utilised   to  provide  rehabilitative  and  counselling

service to drug addicts admitted to and discharged  from

the Drug Rehabilitation Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) National servicemen in the legal profession will

also  be  selected  to man the supervisory  posts  in  a

proposed Provost Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other schemes include the establishment of the

following special units and squads:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Research Unit:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Education and Indoctrination Unit;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Publication and Publicity Unit;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Drug Detection Squad;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Task Force responsible for intelligence

gathering,  special  anti-crime  rounds   and   other

special duties which have also been mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our policy, as far as possible, that

professional  men  in the Special Constabulary  will  be

utilised  in  their professional capacity.  However,  it

must  be  recognised  that it is  not  possible  in  the

context  of Police service to utilise all these national

servicemen   in   roles  strictly  relevant   to   their

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the reorganisation and the various

measures,  which I have mentioned since the  appointment

of  the Planning Committee some 5� months ago, there are

now  signs  of  improvement in the Special Constabulary.

Discipline  for  one has been tightened.  Prior  to  the

reorganisation   the   Special  Constabulary's   average

absentee rate in all the eight Divisions was 9.32% as at

August  1975. This has dropped to 5.64% as  at  February

1976.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Constabulary patrol teams are subject to

surprise  checks  by their supervisory  officers  during

their tours of duty to ensure that they are carrying out

their  patrol  duties in accordance with the  deployment

plan.  This arrangement, which has already been employed

by the regular force, has been found to be satisfactory.

As  I  have  mentioned before, the Special  Constabulary

Provost  Unit  will  soon be set up to  tighten  further

disciplinary control over these men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Member for Katong has mentioned

about  the pilot project in the Joo Chiat Division which

involved  some Katong boys. A pilot project on  detached

youth work was introduced in the Housing and Development

Board  estate in the G Division, that is the  Joo  Chiat

Division, in September 1 975. This project was aimed  at

achieving two objectives. The first objective was to win

over  the  detached youths in this area and to inculcate

in  them  the  value of social discipline by  organising

games and activities and finding jobs for those who  are

jobless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective was to involve the families of

these  youths  in  crime  prevention  and  other  police

projects  within the housing estate. To-date a total  of

60   police   personnel  comprising  regulars,   special

constables.  S.C, volunteers and special  constables  in

the  national service are involved in the projects.  The

number  of  youths  participating  in  the  projects  is

approximately 130. In March this year a similar  project

was  launched in the Jalan Batu housing estate with  the

assistance  of the community centre there, and  perhaps

with  the  encouragement of the Member for  Katong.  The

response so far has been very encouraging. This  project

is  being  evaluated  and, if  successful,  it  will  be

extended to all the other housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I refer to the suggestion by the Member

for Telok Blangah that instead of the 12-year period  of

part-time national service we should shorten it to  four

or  five  years. Firstly, the Member for  Telok  Blangah

need  not  be unduly worried that the Ministry  of  Home

Affairs will not be able to put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



increasing  numbers of national servicemen to  perform

meaningful roles. Most of them are doing so  now  with

the  reorganisation  that is being implemented.  Under

the  present  system  of 12 years' part-time  national

service,  the  part-time national  servicemen  perform

duties  comprising three hours per week or  six  hours

per  fortnight or 12 hours per month, plus seven  days

in-camp training or for a period not exceeding in  the

aggregate 40 days annually. If the liability for part-time  service is to be reduced to four or five  years,

as   has  been  suggested  by  the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah, all part-time national servicemen will  have

to  perform duties more frequently per month.  Instead

of  the  usual  frequency of once in 10 days  or  four

hours  per session, they would be required to  perform

duties  several  times  a week. This  would  certainly

disrupt  their employment and will cause  difficulties

for themselves, and the employers. It may also not  be

good for our economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Minister has set a

specific number of hours and he says. "Well, if they

do their part-time national service in 12 years they

will  have  to do so many hours of work, and  if  we

reduce it to five years, then they must perform  the

same  number  of hours of duties." This  would  mean

that  they have to go for duty practically everyday.

When  the number of years of duty is reduced, it  is

also  possible  to  reduce the number  of  hours  of

duties  which  a  person has to perform  during  his

national service. It does not necessarily mean  that

the number of hours which the Ministry has specified

for  part-time national servicemen must be  complied

with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I say that when we

impose .the burden of duty on the part-time national

servicemen, we have also to be fair to the full-time

national servicemen who are doing 2� years of  full-time   national  service.  In  fact,  the  part-time

national  serviceman  has  already  been   given   a

concession.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> But if they are full-time --



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> No. If they are fulltime, we would

have taken them as full-time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



national  servicemen.  They  are  the  youths  who  have

applied for deferment of full-time national service, and

they  are  therefore, put on part-time National Service.

They   have   already  been  given  a  concession   and.

therefore,  we  have  got to be fair  to  the  full-time

national servicemen. We just cannot reduce the number of

hours of duty for the part-time national servicemen  and

cannot  similarly reduce the period of service  for  the

full-time national servicemen.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, is the Minister not aware that

once  a youth is called up for national service, he  has

no  choice?  Some  of our youths do  ask  for  part-time

national  service, upon being called  up  for  full-time

national  service. But there are many other  youths  who

have  no choice at all. They are just taken in for part-time national service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, that is a supplementary point.

The  point I wish to make is that we have got to be fair

to both the part-time and full-time national servicemen.

If  a  concession  is  made to  the  part-time  national

servicemen,  then it is unfair not to make a  concession

to the full-time national servicemen. As far as the full-time  national servicemen are concerned, the  period  of

service  is 2� years. Therefore, those who do  part-time

national service must do it for a longer period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, after listening to the debate,

I  have the impression that it is not so much a question

of  length  of service as the work they are involved  in

that  is meaningful. The complaints I have received  are

that   they  feel  that  they  are  not  doing  anything

meaningful. As described to me by a number of the  part-time  national  servicemen, the in-camp training  is  no

more than a high school picnic. There is nothing much to

do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I also take this opportunity to ask the Minister

for  an  assurance  that those doing part-time  national

service,  who are working people are assigned  to  camps

nearest  their homes? Last month two cases  came  to  my

notice.  Part-time national servicemen who -are  staying

in  Yio  Chu Kang were sent to Chua Chu Kang. I  am  not

jumping to any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



conclusion, but it is possible that someone has got  Yio

Chu Kang and Chua Chu Kang mixed up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member for

Jalan  Kayu  that  we should try to  give  them  a  more

meaningful role. That is the reason why, as I have said,

5�  months ago I have appointed a committee to look into

this   matter.  In  fact,  measures  have  already  been

implemented to give them a more meaningful role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the two part-time national servicemen who

were  sent to Chua Chu Kang instead of Yio Chu Kang, as

pointed  out by the Member for Jalan Kayu. I  will  take

note  of  that. As far as possible, for the  benefit  of

everyone,  national  servicemen  will  be  given  duties

nearest their homes. I have already stated that  in  the

Neighbourhood   Policing  Scheme,   we   are   assigning

personnel to units and groups nearest their homes as far

as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead DAA 1109*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr P. Govindaswamy and Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today in Singapore there are still a fair number

of  Singapore  citizens whose wives, being non-citizens,

are  permitted to stay on temporary visas  renewable  at

three-  to six-monthly intervals. Sir, the sad thing  is

that many of these non-citizens have been married to our

citizens for a great number of years and have even given

birth  to children in Singapore. But every three or  six

months   they  still  have  to  go  to  the  Immigration

Department  to  have their visas renewed.  Each  renewal

costs  $15.  This may be a small sum of  money  to  some

people  but  to the average working man it is  an  added

burden, not  to  mention  the inconvenience  and  extra

expenses incurred in travelling from their homes to  the

Immigration Department and back again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these non-citizen housewives have applied for

permanent  residence status but, as far as I know,  very

few  have  been successful. As a result, the  impression

they have gained is that in the existing arrangement the

Government  finds  a  convenient way  to  generate  more

revenue.  I  certainly hope that this is not  the  case.

Would  the Minister grant permanent residence status  to

all  these cases? I cannot see any good reason why these

people should be left in a state of uncertainty.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, lately the Immigration

Department has been extremely strict in renewing  visas.

In  the  past, the practice was to grant visas  for  six

months.  But  owing to certain problems the  period  has

been  reduced to three months, with extensions only  for

special cases. But lately it is difficult to obtain even

a  week's extension after the period of three months has

expired, even though the person applying it  has  valid

reasons. I wonder what are the criteria for granting  an

extension?  Could  the  Minister  relax  this  condition

because  most  of  our  Singapore  citizens  have  their

families  and  relatives abroad and they wish  to  bring

them to Singapore for social visits, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Immigration Officers, particularly at the

Woodlands check-point, do not give special consideration

for  emergency cases. There was a case of a 11-year  old

Malaysian boy whose restricted passport was incorporated

in his father's passport. His father had gone abroad for

some personal reasons. One Sunday, in an emergency,  the

boy  and  his mother came all the way down from Ipoh  to

attend  the  funeral  of a relative  in  Singapore.  The

Immigration  Authorities  at our  end  refused  the  boy

permission to enter, even though the mother produced his

birth  certificate.  She was told to  get  a  letter  of

identification    from   the   Malaysian    authorities.

Unfortunately, being a Sunday, the mother had difficulty

getting  this letter. Thus he was refused entry and  had

to  miss  the funeral of his relative. I wonder why  our

officials  had  refused entry for this  boy  though  the

mother was able to produce the birth certificate of  the

boy to prove his case. Could the officials



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>

not  use some discretion in this case and allow the  boy

entry into Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know how many illegal

immigrants were found in Singapore during the  last  one

year.  Are our entry points properly guarded? It appears

that  a number of illegal immigrants have been found  in

Singapore. Some have families and some of them are  even

employed in construction work. Why is this so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you produce a letter from a Minister or an MP, the

Immigration  officers will say. `Why do you  bring  this

letter? Had you come straight to me, I would have  given

you three months' extension." And if you produce such  a

letter, they will say. "No" to your application  for  an

extension. They even shout in a public place like  that.

One  day  a  person came along with a  letter  from  the

Minister  for Foreign Affairs. They said,  "Why  do  you

want  to bring a letter from the Minister? Had you  come

direct  to  me  I  would have given  you  three  months'

extension."



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Is that so?



<br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes. What is the Immigration

Department  doing? They have the authority to  grant  an

extension  as  well as the authority to  refuse.  It  is

unfair.  There was the case of a pregnant woman who  had

undergone an operation. Her doctor gave her a letter  to

support  her application for an extension of  stay.  But

the  Immigration  Department  refused  to  give  her  an

extension  and said. "You must go." The poor  woman  was

sick  and  suffering. What sort of sympathy is there  in

Singapore? Foreigners say that Singapore is a very  good

country.  There  is no doubt that we  have  a  good  and

strict   Government.  But  it  is  regretted  that   the

Immigration  Department did not grant  an  extension  of

stay   to   the  pregnant  woman  whose  case   deserves

sympathetic consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister should give this matter some thought

and inform the Immigration Department not to do this  as

it  is  very  bad  for the image of our  country.  These

people came



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



here with money and they only want an extension of three

months.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of the sentiments expressed by the Members  for

Jalan Kayu and Anson During our meet-the-people sessions

we  come  across numerous cases week in and week-out  of

problems    with   Immigration   Department    regarding

applications for extension of stay in Singapore. I would

like   to   ask   the  Hon.  Minister   what   are   the

considerations of the Immigration Department in granting

a  non-citizen  wife a two-week stay in  Singapore, and

what  are the considerations in extending this to  three

months or six months? We have numerous examples of a non-citizen  wife  who  has been on a three-month  visa  for

umpteen years. Surely at some point the camel's back has

got to break. I think some reasonable explanation should

be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I would like therefore to ask the Hon.

Minister  what  are  the criteria that  the  Immigration

Department  use for awarding permanent residence  status

to  these  people. Similarly, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister:  are the same considerations used with  regard

to non-citizen husbands of Singaporeans?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I hope the Minister could elaborate

concerns  the possibility of travel and travel documents

for  the numerous people in Singapore who are stateless.

Can  these stateless residents apply for and be  granted

travel  documents  to  enable  them  to  travel  out  of

Singapore, many of whom have very good reasons  such  as

for business, for family affairs, and so forth?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, we all know that the Singapore

Government  grants permanent stay to a foreigner  if  he

can  pay $250,000 And moreover his family is also  given

permanent residence The other day, in the debate on  the

Budget Statement, the Finance Minister said that our per

capita  Gross National Product is about S6.000 So  if  a

non-citizen  wife or husband happens to be in  Singapore

for  10 years, then that person has actually contributed

$600,000. I do not see any good reason for refusing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



permanent  stay to an applicant. I am fully in agreement

with  the Member for Jalan Kayu who said that apart from

wasting  time and money in renewing visas, the important

thing  that  we  should consider is the anxiety  of  the

applicant. They do not know when they will be  asked  to

leave Singapore. Sir, these people already have children

in  Singapore and there is no question of the bona fides

of  their marriage I think the Minister has to make some

ruling  in  respect  of these people  who  have  already

stayed  here  for more than 10 years and who  are  still

unable  to get permanent residence. Besides they do  not

have identity cards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I answer the Member for

Jalan  Kayu  first? As in the case of  citizenship,  the

grant  of  permanent residence is not a matter of  right

but  a privilege. This is the case in most countries  of

the  world  and Singapore is no exception. It stands  to

reason  that Singapore with a small land are~  which  is

already about the most densely populated country in  the

world   should  be  particularly  strict   in   granting

permanent residence to foreigners, even though they have

become wives of Singapore citizens. After much strenuous

effort  we  have been able to bring down our birth  rate

and  our  population growth. Let us not negate  this  by

relaxing   our   immigration   controls   on   permanent

residence, thus putting a strain on our housing, social

and other services



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizens may submit applications for

permanent   residence  for  their  foreign   wives   and

dependent  children.  But each  case  is  processed  and

decided  on  its  merits. Among the  number  of  factors

considered  is  whether  the  husband  is  well  able  I

emphasise  "well able" to support his wife and  children

such  that they are unlikely to become a burden  to  the

State. However, if an application has been refused,  the

wife  and  children  of a Singapore  citizen  are  still

allowed  to stay in Singapore on a visit pass which  can

be  extended every three to six months. If  at  a  later

stage the applicants circumstances change and could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



meet  the  requirements of the Immigration  Department's

policy, their application can be reviewed for approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It rarely happens that a visit pass of a foreign wife

and  children of a Singapore citizen is extended for one

or  two  weeks as has been mentioned. This is important.

This  restrictive `criterion for the grant of  permanent

residence to foreign wives is to discourage our citizens

who  can  barely support a wife and children to marry  a

foreign  wife,  thereby  giving  extra  burden  to   our

Republic.  It is quite clear that we are not  trying  to

raise   revenue   by  this  six-month   or   three-month

extension.  As  far as the Ministry of Home  Affairs  is

concerned,  we  have  no  interest  in  the  raising  of

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member for Anson. The Immigration

Department  issues various types of passes to foreigners

of  varying periods of validity. Passes for purposes  of

employment  or for study in our educational institutions

normally  exceed six months. However, passes for  social

visits  are normally for a duration of two weeks in  the

first  instance and renewable for periods not  exceeding

three months. That is for social visits A foreigner  who

seeks  further  extension of his stay for another  three

months in the Republic, either as a tourist or to  visit

relatives,  approval for such extension will  depend  on

the  merits of each case In the case of a foreigner  who

is a relative of a Singapore citizen, he may be given  a

stay  of  more  than  three months  at  a  time.  It  is

considered  that  the  extension  o'  three  months   is

adequate  for staying as a tourist or for social  visits

to  relatives.  This policy of periodic  extensions  for

social  visits, each subsequent extension  being  for  a

shorter  duration, is necessary to discourage foreigners

from  taking advantage of long periods of stay to pursue

activities  other  than  as a tourist  or  as  a  social

visitor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has quoted the case of a

Malaysian  boy  who could not come into Singapore.  This

boy  carried a passport which was issued to his  father,

with the boy's name incorporated in it, and he tried  to

enter  Singapore  without his father. The  international

immigration practice, this is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



only the practice in Singapore, that a minor should  not

be allowed entry into a country unless he is accompanied

by  an  adult  who is the minor's legal  guardian  under

whose  passport  the  minor is  travelling,  since  such

passport does not constitute a valid travel document for

the  minor. If the minor is unaccompanied by  the  legal

guardian under whose passport he is travelling, then  in

this  particular  case it raises  a  doubt  whether  the

father has consented to his son travelling to Singapore.

However, in spite of this doubt, the Immigration  check-point  was  prepared  to admit the  boy  if  documentary

evidence   could   he   produced  from   the   Malaysian

authorities  as  the boy is a Malaysian  -  it  is  just

across  the Causeway - - to ensure that he would  return

to  Malaysia after his visit to Singapore and that he is

not stranded in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a total of 1,043 illegal immigrants were arrested

during   the  year  1975  in  spite  of  our  stepped-up

enforcement.  This represents a significant  decline  as

compared  to 2,223 arrested in 1973 and 1,365  in  1974.

Our  check-points are adequately manned, to reassure the

Member for Anson. But our coastline is easily accessible

to  small craft carrying illegal immigrants to  land  at

unauthorised entry points. The Marine Police is  getting

more boats to patrol our waters and this should help  to

keep  our  coastline less accessible to traffickers.  No

effort  has  been  spared by the Immigration  Department

intelligence  unit  and  the  Police  in  tracking  down

traffickers,  checking  on worksites  and  other  places

where  illegal immigrants could find temporary work.  In

1975, no less than 19 traffickers were arrested, charged

and  convicted in court. In the same year, 278 employers

and  108  harbourers  of illegal  immigrants  were  also

prosecuted   in  court.  Under  an  amendment   to   the

Immigration  Act,  longer  terms  of  imprisonment  plus

caning have been meted out to the traffickers. This  has

accounted for a further decline in the number of illegal

immigrants in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Member for Kim Seng, he asked about

the  application  for permanent residence.  Non-citizens

who wish to apply for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



permanent residence can submit entry permit applications

on  a prescribed form to the Entry Permit Section of the

Immigration   Department.  The  prescribed   forms   are

obtainable   there.  The  Schedule  to  the  Immigration

Prohibition  and Entry Order, 1973, allows a non-citizen

wife  to  apply  for permanent residence if  her  lawful

husband is a Singapore citizen and if they have  not  at

any one time after their marriage been living separately

from  each other for more than five years There  are  no

provisions in the Order for the grant of permanent  stay

to  the  husband  of a Singapore citizen.  However, the

husband  may apply for permanent residence  on  his  own

merits  under the Professional Skilled Personnel  Scheme

or the $250,000 economic investment scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those cases, if both the husband and wife are not

permanent  residents, the husband  can  also  apply  for

permanent  residence  on his own  merit  under  the  two

schemes  I  have  just mentioned. Once  the  husband  is

granted  permanent  residence, his wife  .will  also  be

considered favourably for permanent residence.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his other queries, I think I have

covered them in my answers to the queries from the other

Members of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member for Bras Basah, he made some

computation



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Computation from the Minister for

Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The Minister for Finance said

something and he computed from that. He says that  if  a

wife  has  been  here  for  ten  years  she  would  have

contributed  $600,000  to  the  State.  That   is   just

superficial  arithmetic.  I would  like  ~o  remind  the

Member  for Bras Basah that she would also have consumed

social services and so on to the tune of that amount  or

even more.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, regarding the restriction of

visas,  if  a  non-citizen wife of a  Singapore  citizen

wants to stay here for six months, what is the objection

on that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding illegal immigration, can the Immigration

Department  check on all illegal immigrants?  There  are

more  than  two  million people in  Singapore, and  the

Department  has  to check each and every  identity  card

holder  before  it  can find out who  are  tile  illegal

immigrants.  I  was  told  there  are  500.000   illegal

immigrants. They have no passports or identity cards.  I

do not know how they have come into Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I find the answers given by

the Minister are not very satisfactory. He has said that

the essential considerations were that "the husband must

be  well  able  to support the family" and  that  "these

individuals  will not be a burden on society".  I  would

certainly like further definition of these two terms. To

me,   without  any  clearer  definition,  it  gives  the

Immigration Department tremendous arbitrary powers to do

as  and when it thinks fit, I would certainly hope  that

the  Minister could give much clearer guidelines to this

House  so that we can on our part do our little  bit  in

explaining to the applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also asked for his advice with regard to how visit

passes could be extended from two weeks to three months,

and from three months to six months, and subsequently to

permanent residence. I maintain there are (lute a number

of  non-citizen wives who are on a two-week visit passes

and  that  their  applications for  extension  to  three

months have been rejected on grounds which we are unable

to   find   out.   Certainly  there  must   be   certain

considerations  here, and could the  Minister  let  this

House  know?  I am aware of the case of a lady  who  has

been married to a Singapore-citizen husband for about 20

years now. They have four children. She is still on a $1

5-visa fee plus the inconvenience of having to travel to

and from Johore Bahru. The Minister has not answered  my

third  point,  that  is,  on  the  stateless  people  in

Singapore and how they may apply for travel documents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister has

got  any leg to stand on in his argument that they  were

the cause of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



high  population density. Does he not know that many  of

them   have   already  been  in  Singapore  before   our

population reached 2 2 million? However, they being here

before  or after the population reached that figure  has

got  nothing to do with our population density. This  is

the point



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, as far as I am concerned, the

answer  from  the Minister is totally disappointing.  It

has  a very familiar ring. It reminds me of one of those

official  replies one gets from a Government department,

"Here are the rules arid regulations".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point has been very rightly made by the Member for

Bras Basah. The fact that these wives have been here all

this  length of time, does that not in itself prove that

their  husbands  are financially able to  support  them?

That in itself already proves the point, does it not? So

where   is   this  question  of  financial  ability   or

inability?  It  simply shows that the  officers  in  the

department  could not he bothered to try  and  find  out

more. They are totally unsympathetic, the way I see it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that the $15-visa fee is not

important. If that is the case, may I suggest that it be

reduced to a nominal sum of $2? If it costs S15  to  the

Government  just to put a rubber chop on  the  passport,

the rate of productivity must be terrible!



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, if I may just make an

observation. I am not contributing to this  debate.  The

Member  for Bras Basah quoted the income per  capita  of

S6,000 a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> National income per capital!



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Whatever he calls it, he says it is

$6,000  a year. So multiplying $6,000 by 10, he came  to

the figure of

$600,000 for 10 years. I do not know how he came to that

figure.  It  should be $60,000 However, he succeeded  in

misleading the Minister into replying, but both based on

wrong  arithmetic.  I  cannot  blame  the  Ministry   of

Education  this  time  for the bad  performance  in  the

numeracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Thank you for pointing it out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, we are not here to debate on

arithmetic skill. We are here to debate on a policy  and

the facts of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say again that it is not a case of the

Immigration Department being arbitrary. They have a task

to  perform  and it is no doubt an unpleasant  task.  We

have  to be strict in our immigration policy. As far  as

possible  we should not allow more people to  come  into

Singapore. We have to keep to a very strict policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Member for Kim Seng's queries are

concerned,  I have already answered them, no  doubt, in

general policy terms. What is most important is that  we

have  to decide not only whether or not we should  grant

permanent  residence to the non-citizen  wife  but  also

decide  on  the  criteria whether the husband  can  well

support  his wife. Maybe he can support a wife!  But  we

must also take into consideration that his circumstances

may  change.  What  happens when he cannot  support  his

wife? Then, on humanitarian and sympathetic grounds, he

becomes a burden to the State. The consideration is  not

only  that  he  can  support her but that  he  can  well

support  her  to  the extent that, if his  circumstances

change  for the worse, there is no likelihood  that  his

wife  will become a burden to the State. We have certain

income criteria too, but it is no point of mine to state

specifically the income criteria because there are other

factors,  like ownership of property. So each case  must

be taken on its own merit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about population. That we are doing

all  this is because we will not want to negate all  our

efforts to restrict our population growth. This  is  not

just  a  superficial attitude towards population growth.

If, for example, we make it easy for our people to take

foreign  wives,  give  their wives permanent  residence,

then  not  only  are  we encouraging  the  present  non-permanent residents who are living here to get permanent

residence and later become a burden to the State, but we

are also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



encouraging other people from outside Singapore to  come

in. So the policy must be such that we have not only  to

deal with the wives who are already here but also to see

that other foreigners may not be encouraged to marry our

citizens because, as I said, more foreign wives may mean

extra burden to the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng brought up the point about a

lady  who has been given a two-week pass. I think  there

is  no point in airing this matter here because we  will

be hearing cursory facts of the case, and I do not think

we  can  do  justice to the case because to  do  so  all

factors  will have to be considered. I therefore  invite

the  Member  for  Kim Seng to write  to  me  or  to  the

Controller of Immigration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to stateless persons, if they are

stateless  it  means that they are not citizens  of  any

country.  Therefore,  if they have  occasion  to  travel

abroad  on business or to visit a relative, they  cannot

get  any  travel document except in Singapore, in  which

event they can only apply for a certificate of identity.

In  fact,  there  are stateless persons  who  have  been

granted  certificates of identity. But if they  can  get

travel documents from elsewhere, then the need to  apply

for a certificate of identity does not arise.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has mentioned something about the

Immigration officers being very unsympathetic, rude  and

so  on.  I would invite him to give particulars  of  the

case  because,  as far as the Immigration Department  is

concerned, the officers no doubt have a difficult job to

do.  But  there  is no reason for them to  be  rude  and

unsympathetic. I hope I have answered all the questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, the Minister is trying to cloud

the  issue.  He  said that if we were to  allow  foreign

wives  a  permanent stay here, we would  be  encouraging

foreign  girls  to marry Singapore boys.  However, this

question does not arise at all after the introduction of

the new rule on 1st July, 1973 which says that after that

date any foreign woman who wants to marry a Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



citizen  has  to  obtain  the  prior  approval  of   the

Commissioner  for  Employment.  His  argument  therefore

cannot be right at all. -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Labour can better answer the question.

But  I  think  that applies only to those who  are  work

permit  holders. Whereas in this case they are stateless

persons who are not work permit holders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still do

not  find  the Minister's answer convincing at  all.  He

seems  to  give the impression that by not giving  these

people  permanent residence status we  can  assume  that

they  are  simply  not here. They seem  to  be  doing  a

disappearing  trick! As the Member for  Bras  Basah  has

rightly   pointed  out,  insofar  as  discouraging   our

citizens  from  marrying non-citizens is  concerned,  we

have  a policy which has made it quite clear that  if  a

Singapore youth wants to marry a non-citizen he  or  she

will have to get approval, otherwise he or she could not

be registered in the Registry of Marriages here. That is

a  fact. Is the Minister now saying that this is not the

policy of the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

it is not true because they can always marry abroad.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I have no intention of joining

in.  The  problem  here is riot a question  of  marrying

abroad  or in Singapore. The problem is still  faced  by

people who were married in Singapore. There is the  case

of a woman who has been married here for eight years and

has  four  children all living here in a  Housing  Board

flat.   To   all  intents  and  purposes,  whether   the

Department charges $15 for three months or $50 for three

months,  she  has got to be here because her  family  is

here. There are many such cases of people who have their

roots  here. I have written to three different Ministers

in  charge  of Immigration and I have given up  hope.  I

used to talk on this topic but for the last few years  I

have  stopped  talking about it. I do not  know  if  the

Minister has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



said  earlier  on  that "the policy is being  constantly

reviewed".  This is another official phrase.  I  do  not

know  whether  or not it has been used  today.  I  am  a

little uncomfortable when I hear this phrase.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I did not use it.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Perhaps when the Minister replies

he will want to use it. Sir, the woman has been here for

eight  years. She was married in the Singapore  Registry

of  Marriages. Four children were born in Singapore  and

they are now living in a Housing Board flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said earlier that the Department

would  have to consider whether the husband would  still

be  able  to  maintain  his wife  and  children  if  his

circumstances   change.  My  point  is   even   if   his

circumstances change, his wife is not going to take  her

four  children back to Malaysia or to the  country  from

which  she came because she just cannot leave Singapore.

Therefore, to all intents and purposes whether or not we

give  her permanent status, she is here to stay and  she

will always be here with her family.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah

said  that he had brought up this point again and again.

My  reply is, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no point in my

repeating it again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has  also said just now that the husband has got to look

after  his  wife. Nowadays we see many wives  are  being

employed.  They can support themselves.  What  does  the

Minister say to that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I just clarify. When I say

that the husband must support his wife, I am just making

a  general  statement. If the wife  can  also  work  and

contribute   to  the  family  income,  of  course, the

situation will be different.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> The Minister did not say that just

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Well, the Member for Bras Basah did

not bring it up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I must say that I am still

disappointed with the Minister's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



reply.  Very  strong sentiments have been  expressed  on

this side of the House. We have expressed our views very

clearly. We are talking of people whose roots are  here.

They  have  been  here  for  umpteen  years.  They  have

children  who  are Singapore citizens. But  somehow  the

Minister  seems  to think that they are not  here.  This

beats  me.  The very least the Minister  can  do  is  to

promise us that he will look into the matter. That  will

at  least keep us happy. But he is not prepared  to  say

even that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I think the situation is

getting  from bad to worse. We on the Backbenches  plead

with  the  Minister,  since he is a man  with  feelings,

emotions  and,  we hope, with sympathy. We  are  dealing

with  a  situation where these people have  been  living

here  for umpteen years. They have families here.  Their

husbands  and children are here. Some of them even  have

their  grandchildren here. It would,  therefore,  appear

that  to  all intents and purposes, although they  might

not  be  citizens,  the  fact is  that  they  are  here.

Therefore, there is no way in which one could  think  of

really  kicking them across the Straits of Johore.  They

are  here to stay whether he likes it or not, or whether

he  grants them citizenship status or let them remain as

non-citizens.  But since they are here,  why  not  grant

them permanent residence status? Let us not keep this as

another  skeleton  in  our  cupboard,  and  continue  to

maintain  a posture which to me is oblivious of reality.

I   hope   the  Minister  will  be  very  obliging   and

humanitarian  enough to look at the facts  and  consider

them with sympathy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, of course, if I can please

Hon.  Members, I will certainly do so. Of course, it  is

very  easy  to say things which are popular. It  is  not

that  we  do not consider these matters sympathetically.

But  facts  are  facts.  We are an  over-crowded  island

Republic  and  we  cannot encourage people  to  come  in

numbers  more than we can manage. That is  why  we  have

very strenuously been trying to keep down the population

growth in Singapore. It is not that we are unsympathetic

to human plights and humanity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saying goes, charity begins at home. First of

all,  the responsibility of the Singapore Government  is

to  look after the livelihood and the future of the vast

majority of the citizens of Singapore. I do not want  to

indulge  in  emotional appeals.  But  let  me  say  that

sometimes,  in  order to protect the  interests  of  the

majority of our citizens and of Singapore, we have to be

quite strict in the application of our policies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, as the saying goes, if you

cannot  oblige you can always say things obligingly.  In

view  of the fact that the Minister does seem a bit more

obliging, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead EAA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt that the Community Security

Force   of   the  Vigilante  Corps  comprising  national

servicemen  has  done a great deal for our  people.  Its

service has been immensely valuable. With a strength  of

40,000  it constitutes a very strong peacekeeping force.

Its  members  have been deployed to patrol  the  various

areas  in the Republic every night. Ever since  the  CSF

was  formed, there has been a marked improvement in  the

standard of our security. The crime rate has gone  down.

Generally   speaking,   a  more  secure   and   peaceful

environment has been created for the people. Our  people

have been favourably impressed by their services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although by and large these CSF men have acquitted

themselves well, there are still some defects within the

Corps. I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity

to raise two points. Firstly, is the Minister aware that

absenteeism is still evident in the Vigilante  Corps?  I

understand that the absenteeism usually begins with  the

platoon  leaders. At present the VC members  are  formed

into platoons of four or six members each. Having signed

their  attendance at the Area Office, they would  go  to

the  designated  areas to perform beat duties.  However,

some platoon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



leaders  would  absent themselves under one  pretext  or

another  and, thus, leave the members to perform  patrol

duties  themselves  Being left alone  by  their  platoon

leaders, the VC members would also stay away from  their

own  duties.  This is a very sorry state of  affairs,  I

would, therefore, like the Minister to take note of this

situation and take the necessary measures to remedy  it.

The  platoon  leaders and the Corps members involved  in

such misdeeds should be severely dealt with. The platoon

leaders should be more severely dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, would the Minister consider making

arrangements for the VC members to become part-time lift

attendants  in the Housing Board estates? We have  often

heard of robberies and women being molested in the lifts

by evil elements. If the VC members could be assigned to

look after these lifts, such crimes will be reduced;  at

the  same  time, the lifts can also be looked after  and

kept clean. There is no point in getting other people to

do  this  work because there are 40,000 members  in  the

Vigilante  Corps at the moment. Therefore, there  is  an

adequate supply of manpower available.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

must  thank  the  Member for Sembawang for  paying  high

tribute to the Community Security Force of the Vigilante

Corps.  It  is going to be an annual affair, but  it  is

welcomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Security Force is indeed performing a

very  useful  role  in the policing of housing  estates.

Their  presence  in housing estates is a good  deterrent

against  crime. Since the scheme was put into  operation

in  1  974 the incidence of crime between 7 p.m, and  11

p.m, has  been  reduced  significantly  in  the  areas

selected  for  CSF  policing service.  Since  July  1975

residents  of  these areas have been able  to  enjoy  an

average of 29 crime-free nights a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vigilante Corps members performing community security

service are grouped into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



patrol  teams  of five men each. A leader is  appointed

in  each team and he is, among other things, responsible

for  the  conduct  and discipline of  his  team  members

during the tour of duty. Regular and spot checks on  the

CSF  patrol  teams  are  also  carried  out  nightly  by

supervisory officers to ensure that they are  performing

their duties properly. This will be supplemented by  the

efforts  of the Provost Unit which will be set up  under

the Police (National Service) Command.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the Force is 6.409 officers and men as

on  31st January, 1976. They are posted to a total of 229

sectors spread out throughout the Republic. For  such  a

strength  and coverage it is to be expected  that  there

will  be  a  few  black  sheep and  defaulters.  It  is.

however,   encouraging   to  note   that   the   average

absenteeism rate has been very low, It was 3.9% in  1974

and this dropped to 2.8% in 1975. This is calculated  on

man-time  basis. As for the monthly average bad absentee

rate  of  the Vigilante Corps as a whole it was  0.0015%

for the period September 1975 to February this year. The

term  "bad  absentee"  refers to a  VC  member  who  has

absented himself from training or duties up to a maximum

of four times a year either consecutively or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of 39,771 national servicemen in the

Vigilante  Corps as on 31st January, 1976. Besides  this,

6,409 are in the CSF. 6,101 are under training, and  the

remainder  are deployed in the Civil Defence Units,  the

Auxiliary  Fire Units and the Deployment and Specialised

Units The Vigilante Corps members perform their national

service  duties for four hours each time from 7.00  p.m.

to  11.00  p.m. The majority of the men report for  duty

thrice  a  month.  Their deployment  must  therefore  be

carefully  planned  and it must be consistent  with  the

national service objectives of the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Vigilante Corps national servicemen have been given

other  more  meaningful roles to play, it  is  regretted

that  the  lift  service as proposed by the  Member  for

Sembawang cannot be included in the deployment  plan  of

the  Corps.  I am sure many Members will agree  with  me

that service as lift attendants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



cannot  by  any stretch of the imagination be considered

as  a meaningful role for our young and dynamic national

servicemen in the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do not quite

agree  with  the  Parliamentary Secretary  that  looking

after  the lifts is not a meaningful job. It is a useful

job. Some of the Backbenchers have said that if they are

deployed  to  do beat duty, they will be just  strolling

about surveying the road and it will be very monotonous,

But  if they are deployed to look after the lifts,  they

will  see  that  the  lifts are  safe  for  use  by  the

residents.  They will thus be contributing to  the  safe

use of the lifts in addition to keeping the lifts clean.

They will also help to keep away those bad elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are as many HDB flats in the Parliamentary

Secretary's Constituency of Bukit Merah as there are  in

the  many  Housing Board estates elsewhere.  Many  other

housing  estates will also benefit from  the  scheme  to

deploy  Vigilante Corps members to look  after  the  HDB

lifts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo:</b> Sir, I regret that I cannot agree

with the Member for Sembawang. But I must thank him  for

expressing  deep  concern  for  the  residents   in   my

constituency instead of his own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that very soon there will be about

2,000  blocks of HDB flats in the whole of  the  island.

This  means that in time to come there will be more than

2,000  lifts in HDB housing estates. If each lift is  to

be   looked   after  by  a  Vigilante   Corps   national

serviceman, and there are two lifts in each block on the

average, then the manpower requirement will be somewhere

around  40.000. Has the Member forgotten that at present

there  are  only 40,000 national servicemen in  the  CSF

Vigilante  Corps? Does it mean that the whole  Vigilante

Corps will be turned into an army of lift attendants!  I

do  not  think the national servicemen, including  those

from  Sembawang constituency, would support  this  fancy

idea.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there is no

problem of manpower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



recruitment. We have 40,000 national servicemen  in  the

Vigilante  Corps  at  the  moment,  but  next  year  the

strength  will increase to 50,000 and it increases  year

by year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2,000 lifts in Housing Board estates, the men

can be deployed on a part-time basis, say, at four hours

each night. Therefore, there will be only one shift  for

each lift. There is no need to have two or three shifts;

that  is unnecessary. They need only to carry out  their

duties at night. It is therefore not correct to say that

there  is a shortage of manpower because every  year  we

have new members joining the Vigilante Corps. If we have

one  shift of men to look after the lifts, there  is  no

question of manpower shortage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo:</b> Sir, I have to clarify that the

manpower projection made by me just now is based on  the

calculation that there will be only one shift  duty  for

the Vigilante Corps members and not two or three shifts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member is so persistent in his proposal, I

may  as  well repeat what I have said just  now.  It  is

regretted  that  his proposal cannot be implemented  and

included in the deployment plan of the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can I help

resolve  this situation? Before the Member for Sembawang

makes  this  proposal, I would suggest that  he  himself

goes  on  a lift-attending stint and then come back  and

advise  this  House as to whether it is  pleasurable  or

otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel that

this  is a decent or honourable type of job. It  is  not

without  any  meaning. If the Member  for  Kim  Seng  is

willing to go. I would like to accompany him to  have  a

look-round.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I have never suggested that it

is pleasurable. But since he is so persistent, he should

go  for a stint for a month and come back and report  to

us. We will then cheer him all the way, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we

should  end  this debate on lift attendants. The  Member

for  Sembawang has totally missed the objectives of  the

Vigilante Corps.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am fully,

aware of the tasks and duties of the Vigilante Corps. Of

course,  they  could be deployed to  do  other  jobs  in

addition to looking after the lifts, This could be  part

of  their  work.  They  could perform  other  duties.  I

entirely  agree.  I  do not mean  that  they  should  be

deployed  to  look after the lifts only and neglect  the

other duties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Even if we concede that lift-attending is one of the roles, it is not possible to man

all  the 2.000 lifts. If we are not able to man all  the

2,000  lifts,  which  housing  estate  should  we  begin

manning  the lifts . . Redhill, MacPherson, Kim Seng  or

Sembawang, if there are lifts there?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is enough debate on this. The stand

is quite clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I

withdraw my amendment. I would like to ask him this.  If

there  is  sufficient manpower, would he  consider  this

proposal?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the answer is no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since the

Minister does not want to consider this proposal. I  beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead FAA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the last one year penalties for the

trafficking of drugs have increased to include the death

sentence.  Yet the problem of drug-taking  in  Singapore

remains  acute. Otherwise, there would be less cases  of

trafficking  of drugs into the island. There  are  still

many  people addicted to drugs. Numerous cases  of  drug

addiction are being reported in our daily press. Why  is

this  so?  The  root of the problem is drug trafficking.

What  about  the  persons  who consume  drugs?  Can  the

Minister supply facts and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



figures  on  the  number of drug  traffickers  and  drug

addicts who were prosecuted since the new Act came  into

force?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Central Narcotics Bureau cad do very

little to control the number of persons taking drugs.  I

feel  that the officials of the Central Narcotics Bureau

should   make   frequent  spot  checks   on   factories.

construction    sites,   housing    estates,    schools,

institutions of higher learning, and offices,  to  track

down  those addicts or traffickers in drugs. They should

act  on  information, as this can be one of the ways  to

deter  those  persons  from  consuming  and  trafficking

drugs.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the problem of drug abuse is a

global  one.  Many countries in the world are  grappling

with  an increasing drug problem. In particular,  heroin

abuse  is  predominant in neighbouring  countries  where

there  are  illicit  heroin laboratories.  Singapore  is

therefore  right in the midst of a region which  appears

to   be  the  chief  supplier  of  the  world's  illicit

narcotics.  As such, the spillover effects of  what  was

originally a drug that was merely trafficked through  is

now  being  felt, that is, an increasing number  of  our

people are now consuming and taking heroin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supply and demand of drugs and abuse are both equally

important factors to be considered in combating the drug

problem.  In  Singapore,  the  availability  of   heroin

supplies  and the very fast turning-on process  peculiar

to  heroin abuse has contributed to a phenomenal  heroin

abuse.  Last  year,  2.263  persons  were  arrested  for

suspected  offences related to heroin alone.  Since  the

Misuse  of Drugs (Amendment) Act, 1975, which introduced

the  death penalty was passed in December last  year,  a

total  of 33 persons were prosecuted for trafficking  in

morphine  and  heroin and 12 persons for trafficking  in

opium and cannabis. In the same period, 262 abusers were

charged  for  possession of or consuming various  drugs.

But  out of the 33 persons arrested, seven will face the

death penalty when they are brought to trial.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old established drug trafficking syndicates have

all  been  broken  up by the use of  the  provisions  of

detention  under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)

Act.  However, there are persons who are always  willing

to  take  the risk for quick money. Of the 3,048 persons

arrested for suspected drug offences last year, 73% were

under  30  years  of age; many were, in fact,  under  20

years.   For   this  age  group,  drug   education   and

rehabilitation  is important to prevent  the  spread  of

drug  abuse. This is a long-term preventive measure  and

the results will take some time to be seen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug addicts are now sent to the Drug Rehabilitation

Centre  for  varying periods of six to nine  months.  If

necessary,  the period may be increased  to  a  year  or

more. While undergoing rehabilitation at the Centre, the

addicts are given replacement therapy. However, we  have

come  to the conclusion that this soft approach has  not

been  very  effective and the recidivism rate among  the

addicts has been high. We are now proposing to introduce

the  "cold  turkey" treatment whereby the  addicts  will

undergo   withdrawal  without  being  given  replacement

drugs.  Compulsory  aftercare may  also  be  introduced.

These measures should help to reduce the recidivism rate

among  addicts  who are subsequently released  from  the

Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Narcotics Bureau carries out an average of

72  raids  per month last year. I can assure the  Member

for  Anson  that  several of their  notable  trafficking

cases  were  obtained  as the result  of  intensive  and

painstaking  investigations and undercover work  over  a

protracted  period of weeks and sometimes  even  months.

The  Bureau also carries out routine raids on  suspected

drug haunts.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead GAA 1111.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Haji Mohd, Ariff, amendment (8).



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff bin Suradi:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead HAA 1111*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr P. Govindaswamy and Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this amendment, I would like to raise two

questions  to  the  Minister, First,  will  he  consider

relaxing the conditions for the approval of applications

for citizenship?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many people have applied for citizenship

for  many  years without any success. I  would  like  to

quote  two  practical instances. There was a person  who

was  born  in  Singapore  but  his  name  on  the  birth

certificate  happened  to be  similar  to  the  name  of

another  person.  So  his  birth  certificate  was   not

accepted by the authority concerned and as a result  his

pink  identity  card  was changed  to  a  blue  one.  He

therefore had to apply for citizenship. Three years have

already gone by, and he is still awaiting for news.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, it is regrettable for

him to have been born here during the Shonan-to era. His

name  was  mixed  up  in the registration  for  a  birth

certificate. Members of his family like his parents  and

brothers can prove that he was born here. His neighbours

can  also certify that he was born in Singapore. But the

Department concerned would not accept this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second instance is about an applicant who was born

on  13th June, 1935 in Singapore, and he lost his  birth

certificate during the Japanese occupation. But  he  has

lived in Singapore since birth and he had cast his votes

in  every  general election, including the 1972  general

elections. However, after the last general elections his

pink  identity card was withdrawn and he was issued with

a blue card. Thus he lost his citizenship



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



status.  He  has three children who were  also  born  in

Singapore. In view of the fact that he is not a  citizen

he  has  to  pay more in terms of school fees and  other

charges, thus increasing his financial burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the two examples I have quoted, I feel that the

Registry  of  Citizenship should give  more  sympathetic

consideration  to their applications because  they  were

both   born  here  but  happened  to  have  their  birth

certificates mixed up and lost during the Shonan-to era,

resulting in their citizenship being revoked.  For  this

kind   of  application  for  citizenship,  more  liberal

consideration and speedier approval should be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next question, I would like to ask the

Minister in the past one year how many applications  for

citizenship  have been approved and how many  have  been

rejected, and what were the reasons for such rejections?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know

that the granting of citizenship is a privilege and  not

a  right.  The  basis  of granting  it  is  whether  the

applicant  will  be  a national asset  or  a  liability.

Citizenship  is a very common issue. There are  hundreds

of  people waiting to become citizens of Singapore.  Yet

there  are others who came to the Republic by virtue  of

their  qualifications  and are being  requested  by  the

authorities  at short notice to become citizens  of  our

country.  Why is citizenship granted to people who  come

in here simply because they are qualified and are needed

here and their loyalty has not been tested in any way at

all?  In  fact, some cases can be questionable.  On  the

other  hand, there are many people staying here  for  so

many   years,  where  their  loyalty  to  Singapore   is

unquestioned  but  because  of  some  small  mistake  in

timing,  through  negligence or through ignorance,  they

cannot  become  citizens, and their  attempt  to  become

citizens is a failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many old people who have good financial

backing  of their children. They have lived in Singapore

for a long time but their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



applications  have either been rejected or  still  under

consideration.  Why  deprive  them  the   privilege   of

becoming citizens of our country? After all these people

have  their children to look after them. They are in  no

way  a burden to the State. The Registry would not grant

them  citizenship,  but it is willing  to  consider  the

applications of persons who are suitably qualified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the case of a boy who was born in

Singapore  and  due to a mistake by his parents  he  was

issued with a blue identity card. This boy had completed

national service and had applied for citizenship but his

application is still under consideration. In  the  first

place, if the authorities had not recognised this boy as

a  Singapore citizen, then why call him up for  national

service?  I hope the Minister will look into the  matter

and give early consideration to such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to know how many applications for

citizenship  have  been  granted, how  many  have  been

rejected, and  how  many are still under  consideration

during the last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some applicants whose family roots are

in  Singapore. The father was born in Singapore;  mother

was  also born in Singapore; even the children were born

in  Singapore. They have been staying here  for  a  long

time and yet they have not been able to get citizenship.

But  there are cases of foreigners who have been granted

citizenship after only five years' stay in Singapore.  I

am  very  surprised at this. There are people  who  have

been  staying  here for 10 years. 15 years  or  even  20

years,  and  they  still  cannot get  citizenship.  Some

people  who  have stayed here for five years  are  given

citizenship. This is very funny. How did they get  their

citizenship? I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I have tabled this amendment

knowing  full  well  the futility of entering  into  any

rational  discussion on the conditions  for  citizenship

approval. However, I would like to take this opportunity

to  ask  the  Hon. Minister if he could  enlighten  this

House  as  regards  the total number of  applicants  for

Singapore citizenship today and, secondly, if  he  could

give us the latest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



figures  of  the last few years of the total  number  of

applicants who have been given Singapore citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a remark, I just wonder how the Citizenship

Registry  with just one Division I officer could  manage

to   process   the   thousands   of   applications   for

citizenship.  I  wonder  also  whether  this,  in  fact,

reflects  the concern that we as a Government have  over

the  thousands  upon  thousands  who  look  forward   to

approval of their applications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for

Sembawang  has  in  his  speech  repeatedly   used   the

expression  "Shonan  era", This is  not  an  appropriate

expression  to use and I would like him to  withdraw  it

arid  instead to use "the period of Japanese occupation"

which  is  more  appropriate. I  state  this  with  good

reason.  If  I  remember correctly, Shonan  was  a  term

imposed by the Japanese in reference to Singapore during

their  occupation. "Shonan-to". In those days if  anyone

in  Singapore did not refer Singapore as Shonan-to would

be  scolded or slapped in the face. So I would  r,equest

him to withdraw this shameful term.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree with the

Member  for Jurong. I feel that the Member for Sembawang

ought  to  withdraw the expression "Shonan". To  us  the

invasion  of Singapore by the Japanese is a memory  that

brings  back  the  feeling  of  traumatic  wounds.   Any

reference  to  Singapore as "Shonan" which  was  a  term

imposed  on  the Singapore people by the Japanese  would

reopen  the  wound.  I  wonder  if  he  understands  the

feelings of the Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think there is no need in belabouring

the  point.  Shonan  is  a period which  Singapore  went

through. It is part of our history. So by whatever  name

we  call  it, we know what it is. We will leave  it  at

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, thank you very much, We can go

on to citizenship after the debate on Shonan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Sembawang, let me state

that  in the interest of the citizens of Singapore as  a

whole, it is extremely unwise to liberalise the grant of

citizenship.   The   Government's   basic   policy    on

citizenship, that is, grant of citizenship, should be  a

privilege  and  not  as a right,  and  there  should  be

restriction  in  the granting of citizenship  by  taking

into  account  the social and economic problems  of  the

Republic.  Further,  citizenship  must  be  regarded  as

something  of great value. We cannot give it to  anybody

who  applies  for  it, just because he applies  for  it.

However, the Government has more recently speeded up the

processing  and  granting  of  citizenship.   This   has

resulted in more persons being granted citizenship  last

year.  A total of 6.347 applications were approved  last

year compared to only 3,989 in 1974. I am sure this will

gladden  the heart of the Member for Sembawang, although

in principle nothing has been liberalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has quoted cases of two of

his  constituents who are unable to obtain  citizenship.

If  he  had  given me the full facts of these two  cases

earlier.  I  would be able to give him the full  reasons

now.  However,  from the scanty facts he has  given,  it

would  appear  that  both of them  do  not  qualify  for

citizenship since in the first case the applicant  could

not  produce satisfactory documentary evidence of  birth

or  stay in Singapore, and in the second case, the birth

certificate  produced was not genuine. May  I  tell  the

Member  for Sembawang that being allowed to vote  during

the  general  elections by mistake does not qualify  the

person for citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng asked several questions. May I

just  reply  to  him.  The total number  of  citizenship

applications received in 1972 to 1975 was 33.666  or  an

average  of 8.420 per year. Many of these were  actually

re-applications  after  previous applications  had  been

rejected. In the same period,

1  8.559  applications  were approved  and  5.070  cases

rejected.  Others  are still being  processed  or  under

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member referred to the fact that there is only one

Division  I post in the Registry of Citizens.  According

to him, this does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



reflect the importance which the Government attached  on

citizenship matters. I would like to state here that the

Registry has an approved establishment of 57 posts, some

are  mainly  involved in the processing of applications,

interviewing  applicants  and  so  on.  But  citizenship

policy matters, besides being handled by the Registry of

Citizens,  are dealt with by the senior officers  of  my

Ministry   headquarters.  Many  applications  are   also

considered by the headquarters staff and decided by  me.

Some cases even go up to the Cabinet for a decision. The

Member  can  therefore be assured that  the  subject  of

citizenship is accorded the importance and consideration

which it deserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the Member for Anson. I am glad that

the  Member  for  Anson  agrees  that  the  granting  of

citizenship is a privilege and not a right and that  the

main basis of grant of citizenship is that the applicant

will be a national asset and not a liability. Length  of

residence  is  but only one criterion.  Loyalty  to  the

State  is expected of the citizen. However, if later  he

proves  to  be  disloyal to the State in  any  way,  his

citizenship will be revoked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question whether old people should

not be granted citizenship when their children are in  a

good  financial position to support them, my  answer  is

that  each  case should be treated on its own merit.  In

such  cases we have to be careful to ascertain that  the

children are not only able to support them but they will

also,  in  fact, do so in the future. They may say  that

they  are  in  a  financial position  to  support  their

parents now, but in future they may not be able  to.  We

must  therefore  be  satisfied, for instance, that  the

motive  of grant of citizenship is not to make  the  old

parents after having been granted citizenship, to become

eligible for admission to one of our homes for the aged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member quoted the case of a boy who is doing

national service and who has yet to acquire citizenship.

As I have mentioned earlier, serving national service is

one  of  the, criteria for grant of citizenship. If  the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



could supply me with particulars of the case. I will

look into it,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of applications approved and refused in

1975  was  6,347  and  2,053 respectively.  Applications

pending  as  at 31st December, 1975 stood at  30.097  but

three-quarters  of  these  are actually  re-applications

after their previous applications had been refused.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, if a financial guarantee is

given, will he get his citizenship?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> That will be one of the factors to

be considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, having heard the reply from the Minister concerned,

I notice that the answer is about the same as given last

year except that there has been some improvement in  the

number  of  cases approved. So I feel that the  Registry

has already improved its efficiency in their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the two cases I have mentioned, the

applicants'  qualifications have been accepted  for  the

application in question. The question now is not whether

they  are  eligible to apply because their  applications

have  already  been accepted for consideration.  Here  I

have the two relevant letters which I propose to send to

the  Minister  concerned tomorrow for his  consideration

and approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by $10 in respect of item (b) of subhead BAA 2090.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao is not here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $144,961,430 for Head U ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $21,152,000 for Head U ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Hon. Members, since it is only five

minutes to Moment of Interruption,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



with your consent, I suggest that we invite the Minister

to report progress now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report that the Committee of Supply has made further

progress on the Main and Development Estimates for the

financial year 1st April, 1976 to 31st March, 1977, and
