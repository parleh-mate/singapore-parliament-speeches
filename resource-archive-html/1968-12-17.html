<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Defence  to  what extent the People's Association  has

encouraged the organisation of residents' associations

in Housing and Development Board housing estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  organising residents' associations  in

Housing and Development Board housing estates is not a

function  of  the  People's  Association  whose   main

objective  is  the  organisation  and  development  of

community  centres  in all the constituencies  in  the

Republic. The People's Association, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



liaison with the management committees of the various

community  centres,  initiates  and  supervises   the

activities  in the centres. However, where  residents

in   Housing  and  Development  Board  estates   have

problems  to  raise with the Housing and  Development

Board  authorities, they  can  make  representations

through the Citizens' Consultative Committee in their

estates.  Incidentally,  the  Citizens'  Consultative

Committees  come  under the portfolio  of  the  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, there has been close and successful

liaison  through the C.C.C, between the  Housing  and

Development  Board  and residents  in  the  following

estates,  namely,  Henderson Road, Bukit  Merah,  Toa

Payoh, Kallang, Kampong Java and Tiong Bahru estates.

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Defence  (a)  what has been the total  enrolment  for

1968  in the kindergarten classes run by the People's

Association;  (b) what are the media of  instruction:

and  (c)  whether he is satisfied with  the  progress

made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, when the People's Association

first organised kindergarten classes in community cen

tres  in  January 1964, there were only eight centres

providing this service. However, by the end of  1968,

138  community  centres were conducting  kindergarten

classes  and 390 such classes were organised  with  a

total  enrolment  of  11,190  children.  Of  the  390

classes, 15 of them with a student population of  445

are taught in Malay. 35 with a student population  of

1.125 in English and the rest in Mandarin, i.e..  339

classes with 9,620 children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above classification, Mr

Speaker, Sir, a second language is also taught in all

classes once a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory progress has been made by the People's

Association   in  the  or~anisation  of  kindergarten

classes as a service to the community. Furthermore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



the standard of instruction provided in these classes

is  comparable to that of other kindergarten  classes

in the Republic.

<div align="center"><b>(Applications for transfer to Singapore Armed Forces)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister

for  Defence  (a)  how  many Singapore  Citizens  had

enlisted  in  the Malaysian Armed Forces  during  the

time when Singapore was in Malaysia: and (b) how many

of  them have applied to the Ministry of the Interior

and  Defence  for  transfer to  the  Singapore  Armed

Forces.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot answer

the first part of the question because we do not have

figures  showing  how  many  Singapore  citizens  are

serving  in  the Malaysian Armed Forces. The  records

are with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of the question, to date

there  have been 46 applications for transfer to  the

Singapore  Armed Forces from Singapore  citizens  who

were  enlisted  as  members of  the  Malaysian  Armed

Forces outside Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, can the Minister say how many Singapore

citizens have been transferred to the Singapore Armed

Forces?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, out of the 46. 21 were

rejected  on  grounds  of  unsuitable  vocation,  had

record or due to lack of proof of citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

will  the Government accept the transfer of Singapore

citizens  now in the Malaysian Armed Forces into  the

Republic's Armed Forces with no loss in seniority  or

status?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I cannot give an assurance that

there will be no loss in seniority or status, because

the  training and the service that is required by  us

might  be  different  from  what  the  man  has  been

accustomed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, can the Minister say

what  is  the  official attitude  of  the  Government

towards  Singapore citizens serving in foreign  armed

forces including the Malaysian Armed Forces?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a supplementary question

whether  he proposes to take steps to prevent teenage

children  from  selling evening  newspapers  carrying

results of big sweep draws (Mahpiewpo) at major  road

junctions as this practice not only causes danger  to

the children themselves, but also impedes the flow of

vehicular traffic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the police has

taken   action  to  prevent  teenagers  from  selling

Mahpiewpo  at  busy traffic junctions  and  at  known

places where they congregate. I think there have been

less  of  them,  but we would like  to  prevent  them

altogether.  I can assure the Member for  Mountbatten

that  action has been taken and will be taken to  see

that   these   people   do  not   hold   up   traffic

unnecessarily  and, at the same time, endanger  their

lives.

proper police station at the Toa Payoh Housing Estate

to  replace  the present Police Post located  on  the

ground  floor  of one of the blocks of flats  in  the

Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, there is a proposal to build a

police  station  at  Toa Payoh  for  which  there  is

provision in the 1969 Estimates. A 3½ acre  site  has

been selected in Toa Payoh Housing

<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Defence

(a)  how many persons who were arrested for detention

under   the   Criminal  Law  (Temporary   Provisions)

Ordinance,  1955,  were thereafter soon  charged  and

prosecuted  in court during the period  1st  January,

arrested during the period 1st January, 1967, to 30th

June,  1968. Of this number, 438 persons were charged

<div align="center"><b>SOCIAL ESCORT SERVICES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Defence  whether the Police have deemed it  necessary

to  look  into the matter of the growing  number  of'

agencies   offering   social   escort   services   in

Singapore;  and whether he considers any' legislation

necessary in this regard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the police are always looking

into  illegal  activities.  I  do  not  know  whether

tourist  agencies  are  largely  engaged  in  illegal

activities, but the police have kept an eye  on  them

and,  up to date, my information is that they suspect

hat some of them are up to no good. There are 106  of

these  firms registered and where they are  suspected

of carrying on activities which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Katong has in mind, the Anti-Vice  Branch

will take appropriate action.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, I had in mind the

regulations  administered by  the  Tourist  Promotion

Board. If I may just quote from the Tourist Promotion

(Certification  and  Control of Guides)  Regulations,

1964:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No person, other than a person whose name is on the

Register  and  who  has  been  issued  a  letter   of

authority  under the provisions of sub-paragraph  (b)

of   paragraph   (1)  of  regulation   7   of   these

Regulations,  shall be entitled to act as  a  tourist

guide for remuneration:'.



<br><br>If I may just add, Sir, many of these escort services

purport to offer tourist services and, as such,  they

may  be infringing the Regulations. Will the Minister

consider  taking  action if there is infringement  of

these Regulations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I have never made use of this

escort  service. Personally, I cannot say that  I  am

aware of this state of affairs. But where there is an

infringement of the Regulations, I can assure Members

that the police will take appropriate action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee) (for the Minister for Culture):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total amount of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question, the

National Art Gallery and the Academy of Arts  project

is one of the projects of the Singapore Arts Council,

which  is  a  registered  society.  It  is  for   the

Singapore  Arts Council to determine the schedule  of

construction of the building. This will  depend  both

on  preparations for specifications based on a  study

of  the  actual  requirements in detail  as  well  as

availability of further funds both for the capital as

well as for the running costs.

<div align="center"><b>(Professional and non-professional staff)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Culture

(a)  by  what  standards does  the  National  Library

decide  on  the proportion of professional  and  non-

professional  staff; and (b) why do some professional

staff in the National Library have to spend much time

in  non-professional work, such as stamping,  issuing

and  shelving books, and whether steps will be  taken

to remedy the situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee (for the Minister for Culture):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in developed countries, the proportion

of  professional staff to non-professional  staff  is

usually  one  to three, excluding manual  staff.  The

National Library at present has a total establishment

of  142  staff, excluding daily-rated staff.  Out  of

this  total, 45 are professional staff, including  25

who are qualified librarians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the present proportion of professional

staff  to  non-professional  staff  in  the  National

Library  closely approximates that of more  developed

countries, libraries in these countries have  a  very

high degree of mechanisation of library routines. The

National  Library  is,  therefore,  working   towards

achieving  a  higher proportion of  non-professional

staff,  i.e., to have one-fourth instead of one-third

professional staff in order that the non-professional

duties may be carried out entirely by non-professional

staff.

(a)  how  many officers of the National Library  have

accorded  to the officers for the professional  quali

either by resignation or by transfer, and the reasons

<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee (for the Minister for Culture):</b>

Sir,  the  number  of  officers  sent  overseas   for

<pre>

        from 1959 to 1961 - nil

                     1962 -   3

                            ===

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers who have acquired professional training

are   required   to   perform  a  wide   variety   of

professional duties, including book selection, reader

guidance,    answering   of   reference    inquiries,

compilation   of   book  lists  and   bibliographies,

promotion   of   reading  through  book  exhibitions,

displays,  book  talks, radio and  television  talks,

story  telling,  visits to schools  and  cataloguing,

classifying  and indexing of library materials  which

include   books,   periodicals,   music,   pamphlets,

newspapers, microfilms, maps and others. Officers who

have acquired professional qualifications receive two

additional increments and are eligible for  promotion

posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of posts in the library service is

now 56, including 11. Of this number , one was an

American who returned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



to the United States of America. One left for Britain

on  marriage, one was a Malaysian citizen who took up

a  post  in  Malaysia, six took  up  posts  in  other

libraries  in  the Republic, one took up  a  teaching

post  and  one  was a married woman who  resigned  in

order that she can take care of her family affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the National Library had two more

officers whose qualifications were not recognised and

who  resigned to take up appointments in other  Singapore libraries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No officer left the National Library on transfer.

(a) if he will give the numbers of members of the

National Library grouped according to their interest

in Malay, Chinese. Tamil or English material as at

15th November.1968; and (b) how many books, giving

separate figures for Malay, Chinese, Tamil and

English books, have been purchased by the Library

between 1st January, 1967, and 15th November, 1968.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee (for the Minister for Culture):</b>

Sir, it is not possible for us to give the number  of

members of the National Library as requested  in  the

question, because many readers borrow hooks  in  more

than  one language. An indication of the interest  in

Malay,  Chinese,  Tamil or English  material  can  be

obtained  from  the figures for the number  of  books

borrowed in these languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the National Library has lent over one

million  books a year since 1966, statistics  of  the

breakdown of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



number  of  books borrowed in the four languages  are

kept only for the Library Extension Section, that  is

to  say,  the two part-time branches and  the  mobile

library  points. In 1967, out of a total  of  268.626

books  borrowed by some 24,660 members of the Library

Extension  Section,  63,249 were Malay,  56,006  were

Chinese,  8,091 were Tamil and 141,280 were  English.

From  January  to October 1968, the total  number  of

books  borrowed by some 28,000 members of the Library

Extension  Section was 213,455, of which 39,923  were

Malay,  50,746  were Chinese, 8,166  were  Tamil  and

114,620 were English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the number of books purchased in the

four  languages between 1st January. 1967,  and  15th

November, 1968, the breakdown figures are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0701 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (12), Mr Rodrigo.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  yesterday  I  was  engaged  in  the  topic   of

principals  of  schools before we were terrorised  by

the  Environmental Public Health Bill. I was  calling

upon   the  principals  of  schools  to  make   their

contribution  to  education in a  form  beyond  their

administrative  duties as heads  of  schools.  I  was

calling upon them to apply their minds to problems in

education  relevant  to the times  and,  especially,.

relevant  perhaps to their respective localities  and

schools  and  to  put  this  thinking  on  paper  for

submission to the Ministry of Education and  also  to

be  published and sorted out for the benefit  of  the

teaching profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the heads of schools, having stored up that

much experience and ability to merit their appointments  as  heads  of  schools  by  the  Public

Service  Commission,  should gladly  undertake  these

duties   without  insistence  on  the  part  of   the

Ministry, and I certainly would look forward to  such

responses  from principals of schools. But they  also

have hard times these days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer the Minister to the last

appointment  of principals of primary schools.  I  do

not  know whether this may be within the ambit of the

Public Service Commission. If it is, the Minister can

still  do  something to remedy what  I  think  is  an

undesirable situation. The appointment of the  princi

pals of primary schools was last made on the basis of

a  circular  to the schools calling for  applications

for this appointment and the indication was that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



appointment   was   meant   to   be   a   substantive

appointment.  A  number  of applications  were  made.

Subsequent  interviews  followed,  and  then   short-listing, and eventually the appointment was  made  in

two  categories. One was a category of appointees who

were   appointed   substantively   with   the   usual

probationary period.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other category was a category of appointees who

were  informed  that  they  were  rejected  for   the

substantive  appointments but that they  were  to  be

appointed  in an acting capacity until one year  from

the  date  of the appointment or until the  incumbent

for  the  post  arrived. This would  mean  that  this

second   category  of  appointees  would  revert   to

teaching and they would suffer some embarrassment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is alarming is that when some of these

appointees  approached the officials in the  Ministry

and  indicated that this was something for which they

had  not bargained, and when they asked whether  they

could  refuse  the  second type  of  appointment,  it

appeared  that  they were informed that  they  could,

provided they signed certain documents to the  effect

that  they  reject the appointment on condition  that

they    are    prepared   to   forfeit    promotional

opportunities which may come their way in the future.

If  this  is  so,  I think this is a very  iniquitous

practice on the part of the Ministry, it is unfair to

these applicants. It is just like inviting a guest to

your  house  for a cocktail party and as soon  as  he

gets  into your house, you grab him by the scruff  of

his neck and drag him to the backyard to clean up the

mess,  perhaps in preparation for the "Keep Singapore

Clean"  campaign! And when he protests, you  threaten

to  blow  off his brains with a blunderbuss. I  think

this situation ought to be resolved somehow or other,

because I understand that they have been informed  by

the  Ministry  that their appointments would  proceed

until  further  notice  - in  other  words,  until  a

further  one  year from the date on which  they  were

last  notified or until the incumbent came  along  to

displace them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into this situation

with a view to remedying an undesirable situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  prior to the setting up of the Harvey  Salaries

Commission   by  our  Government,  the  Ministry   of

Education  administered numerous  salary  scales  for

various   categories  of  teachers   with   resultant

anomalies  and injustices. It was hoped by  all  that

with   the  publication  of  the  findings   of   the

Commission,  comprehensive  and  effective   measures

would  be adopted to do away with, once and for  all,

the   innumerable  ramifications  of  the  prevailing

anomalies  and that a unified salary structure  would

be drawn up. It is true that some anomalies have been

rectified,  but the overall position in the  Ministry

of Education remains as unsatisfactory as before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of issues which were considered

not only by the unions representing the employees but

also  the Ministry of Education and: the Treasury  to

be  in  dire need of an equitable rectification.  But

the Harvey Commission appeared to have overlooked the

representations made by the Ministry of Education  as

well as by the unions representing the teachers. I am

sure  it  is  not too late to rectify  the  anomalies

since  both  parties - the Ministry of Education  and

the  unions  representing the teachers -  agree  that

there is a need for rectification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, there are two outstanding issues that

should  be  resolved without any further delay:  one,

remuneration to the senior assistants and two, salary

scales  for  promotion  posts  in  the  Ministry   of

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1950's, all schools that operated two

sessions had one principal for each session. However,

with   the  intensification  of  the  school-building

programme,  the  shortage of senior  and  experienced

teachers for promotion as principals became so  acute

that,  as  a  temporary  measure,  the  practice   of

appointing   one  principal  for  both  morning   and

afternoon  sessions was adopted. Unfortunately,  this

temporary measure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



became, with the passage of time, a permanent  policy

of  the  Ministry of Education and,  at  the  moment,

there is only one principal for both the morning  and

afternoon   sessions.  Where  principals  cannot   be

present   throughout  the  whole  of  the   afternoon

session,  senior  assistants are  then  appointed  to

manage   the  school  for  and  on  behalf   of   the

principals.  These senior assistants  are  not  given

additional  remuneration although they  are  made  to

shoulder  additional responsibilities. After repeated

representations  by  the  unions,  the  Ministry   of

Education  agreed  with the unions  that  it  was  an

inequitable  situation which had to be rectified  and

that a recommendation to this effect would be made by

the  Ministry to the Harvey Salaries Commission.  But

it  appears  that the Harvey Salaries Commission  has

not  given  any  consideration to this recommendation

made by both the unions and the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is the only Government

department  where  promotion  posts  do   not   carry

different  salary  scales but only  allowances.  This

practice  is  still continuing in spite of  the  fact

that  the Ministry of Education as well as the unions

have  agreed  on numerous occasions that  it  creates

injustices in many ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the circumstances which I have just set

out, I hope the Minister for Education will take  the

necessary   action  to  remove  these  anomalies   by

entering  into negotiations with the unions in  order

to  bring  about an amicable and equitable settlement

of the issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the Harvey Salaries Commission

has  recommended in paragraph 198 of its Report  that

the  structure and reorganisation of the Ministry  of

Education must be looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, at the same time, congratulate the Ministry of Education on being far- sighted and willing to rectify mistakes made by the Harvey Salaries Comniission. I refer to a newspaper report yesterday that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of  Education had entered into negotiations

with  the  Malay  Teachers' Union on the  unduly  and

unreasonably  depressed salary scales recommended  by

the Harvey Salaries Commission for religious teachers

in Singapore. Sir, we recognise that no one, not even

a commission of eminent persons, is infallible. It is

quite  obvious  that  the Harvey Salaries  Commission

has,   unintentionally  or  unwittingly,  made   some

recommendations  which are not in  keeping  with  the

aspirations   of  our  Republic  and  or   with   the

recommendations of the various Government departments

and the employees' unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commendable that the Government has accepted

the  Commission's recommendations with some  modifica

tions. There is scope for further adjustments of  the

recommendations as the negotiations going on  at  the

moment  between  the Ministry of  Education  and  the

Malay Teachers' Union clearly indicate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I enquire from the Minister if further

negotiations  will be conducted between the  Ministry

of  Education  and other categories  of  teachers  on

similar  findings  of  the Commission  which  do  not

appear to have taken into adequate consideration  the

recommendations made by the Government, as well as by

the employees' unions? Sir, in the private sector, if

both  the employers' and employees' unions agree that

a  certain  category  of  posts  can  and  should  be

considered   as   promotion  posts,   the   resultant

negotiations  conducted by the parties  involved  are

confined to the quantum of remuneration for  the  pro

motion posts. In other words, the dispute centres  on

the  fair and equitable remuneration that is  payable

to  the holders of the promotion posts. The terms  of

the  negotiated settlement are then incorporated into

a  collective  agreement which sets  out  the  salary

scales  for  such posts and it is duly certified  and

registered  by the Industrial Arbitration  Court~  In

the Ministry of Education, there are two issues which

merit similar treatment and yet the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



Harvey Salaries Commission has somehow overlooked the

recommendations made by the employers as well  as  by

the employees' unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, although written papers on  particular

educational  problems have not been  submitted  on  a

formal   basis  by  principals  of  schools  to   the

administration,  the  views of  principals  are  made

known  to senior officers of the Ministry at  regular

meetings  of  principals  of  schools.  However,  the

Member  for Serangoon Gardens has suggested that  the

principals  should  put their  minds  to  educational

problems, especially those which are related to their

own  schools and that they should submit  papers  for

further  study.  This  is  a constructive  suggestion

which  I shall take up in due course. Certainly,  the

experience of principals accumulated over a period of

years should not be left untapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 24 pure vacancies on 9th September, 1967

-  that was the date on which the results of the last

promotion  exercise of principals of primary  schools

were  announced.  All  these 24 pure  vacancies  were

filled  by officers in a substantive capacity without

a period of probation. However, in that exercise, the

Public Service Commission also selected some officers

for appointment as acting principals for a period  of

one   year  or  until  the  incumbents  resume  duty,

whichever  is  the earlier. This is unavoidable.  The

selected officers are not filling pure vacancies,  as

the  substantive incumbents are away on  scholarships

or are either acting or officiating in higher posts.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be possible to consider these acting

principals  for  promotion in a substantive  capacity

only  when a promotion exercise is conducted to  fill

the vacancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah raised certain matters

regarding the salaries of teachers and principals.  I

think  he  is  aware  that  the  whole  question   of

teachers' salaries, post allowances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



for  principals and so on is a very complicated  one.

It  dates  back  almost 20 years. The problem  is  so

complicated  that the Harvey Salaries Commission  was

afraid  to  delve  into the whole question.  It  has,

therefore, suggested a separate commission to go into

the  matter in detail. I do not think it is  possible

for  me  to  give  an  offhand  answer,  because  the

Education  Ministry is not the sole employer  in  the

Government.  There is such a person as the  Exchequer

or  the Minister for Finance who is in charge of  the

finances of the state. Until I have sought the  views

of the Finance Minister on whether there should be  a

separate commission to go into the whole question  of

the salaries of teachers and principals, I am not  in

a  position  to  give a satisfactory  answer  to  the

Member  for Telok Blangah. I agree with him  that  it

was  the  Ministry's  view that  there  should  be  a

separate  salary scale - call it a promotion  scale

if you like - for principals and that there should be

full-time assistant principals instead of the present

senior assistants. These views were submitted to  the

Harvey Salaries Commission but no firm recommendation

was  made. As I said just now, until I have consulted

the  Minister for Finance, I am not in a position  to

give a positive answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member  for  Serangoon Gardens  brought  up  the

question of getting the principals to make a  greater

contribution  towards  their  professional  work   in

education.  I agree with him in principle  that  this

suggestion is highly desirable. But my fear was  well

founded,  as  has  been  proved  just  now   by   the

Minister's  reply. The Minister said that he  readily

agreed  to such a suggestion and that he would follow

it  up. However, at this juncture the principals will

be  asked again to do something which I think is quite

beyond  them.  I  may  have to  repeat  what  I  said

yesterday   about   the  question   of   over-loading

principals  and  teachers with unprofessional  duties

with  the  result that they are unable to  contribute

very significantly to their professional work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of principals making a contribution

towards  educational matters, I do not want to  sound

too professional here. But I would like to quote just

one  example  of  teachers  in  other  countries.  In

America,  for  example, after a number  of  years  of

service,  teachers  are given six  months'  full-pay,

what  they call Sabbatical leave. The purpose  is  to

enable  them to go to other countries and  study  for

themselves the educational system there and  also  do

some research work. I am not making a comparison  and

saying  that we should do likewise. The point I  want

to stress is this. For professional people to be able

to   make   a  substantial  contribution   to   their

professional work, the one essential element  is  the

time  factor. There should be opportunities for these

people  to  have  the time to study and  do  research

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of teachers, they should also be given

time to travel and see things for themselves and make

comparisons  with different educational  systems.  Of

course,  I  think the Minister knows the  answer.  In

Singapore it is quite difficult for teachers  to  get

this  sort  of  leave,  more so  for  principals.  At

present,  the principals are less fortunate than  the

teachers.  Although teachers are supposed  to  get  a

three-term holiday, they are expected to go to school

and do a lot of things. But principals have got to be

in school even during the holidays to carry out their

duties.  The  question of leave  for  principals  has

never  been  settled.  I am not  here  to  raise  the

question of the conditions of service of teachers.  I

just  want  to point out to the Member for  Serangoon

Gardens this one obstacle which principals will  have

to   encounter   before  they  can  carry   out   his

suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also to understand that the nature of the

duties  and  the  type  of  responsibilities  of  the

principals have considerably increased since the last

decade.  As the Member for Telok Blangah has  pointed

out,  a  principal now has to look after two schools.

Due  to the shortage of school buildings, two schools

are being run under one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



building.  Now  very conveniently  the  Ministry  has

called  them two sessions of one school~ But when  we

compare   the  structure  of  the  schools   in   our

neighbour,  Malaysia, with our own, we  are  in  fact

having  two  schools  in  one  school  building.  The

principal's responsibility is to look after these two

schools. This is one additional responsibility  which

he has had to undertake since the last decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said yesterday, we have made significant and

impressive  progress in our educational  development.

We  have  introduced integrated schools. At one  time

principals  had  to  look after only  one  stream  of

education.  Now they have to look after two  or  even

sometimes  three streams of education. It is  not  so

much  the size or the number of classes as the nature

of  the  responsibility  that  is  the  problem.  The

educational   system  i'n  the  Chinese   stream   is

different  from  that  in the English  stream.  As  a

result,  the timetables for the two different streams

of education, with all the attendant problems arising

from integration, have to be fitted in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to integration, we now have the multi-

purpose  school,  which  is a sort  of  comprehensive

school. If you talk about comprehensive education  in

England, and compare it with the type of schools that

we  have, the strength of their staff would be two or

three times greater than that of our schools. As  the

Minister for Finance has said, Singapore is an island

of  224  square miles at low tide. We  are  short  of

land. Therefore, school buildings have to go upwards.

I  believe  that in some of the schools in  Singapore

they  have  as many as 48 classrooms in  one  school.

There  is  no  playing field. These are some  of  the

problems  which  have come within the  responsibility

and duties of principals in the past few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned yesterday the lack of co-operation

on the part of parents. Not only do they not show any

special  interest  in  their  children's  welfare  in

education,  but  sometimes  they  even  obstruct  the

principals and teachers in the performance  of  their

duties. One



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



very common occurrence these days is for the children

to complain to their parents on the slightest excuse.

These  complaints are readily accepted,  and  at  one

time  almost  welcomed, by the Ministry of  Education

and  an immediate investigation would then be carried

out.  The poor principals and teachers would have  to

answer all these complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the types of problems which principals and

teachers  have  to worry about and attend  to.  After

grappling with them, I wonder how they can  have  the

mental  capacity, if at all they have  the  time,  to

make  any  significant contribution towards improving

their  professional work. Nevertheless, some  efforts

have  been made towards this end. I can only say that

from  my  association  with the  Singapore  Teachers'

Union,  some  modest efforts have been  made  towards

professional improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives from principals and teachers have

met  together and have drawn up a code of ethics.  We

have  occasionally  produced journals  in  connection

with  our  profession. We have also  met  to  discuss

matters of professional interest. We have on numerous

occasions  made representations to the  Minister  and

the  Ministry  officials on matters  of  professional

interest.  The  Education  Ministry  did  organise  a

seminar for principals. The Singapore Teachers' Union

also  made  an  effort to follow up that  seminar  by

offering  to organise seminars for teachers. However,

we  were told that the Education Ministry itself  was

following this up with further seminars for teachers.

I  must say that the Education Ministry has, in fact,

organised  refresher courses and re-training  courses

for teachers. I think the teachers are today spending

a  great  deal  of their time outside teaching  hours

trying  to  improve  themselves  by  attending  these

courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I have much to say at this juncture.

I  am  not really trying to be too pessimistic  about

the contributions from principals and teachers. I can

confidently say that the teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



would   be   more   than  willing   to   make   their

contribution,  not only by spending  extra  hours  in

teaching or taking part in extramural activities, but

also  in  producing papers on matters of professional

interest  to  education. But  like  people  in  other

professions,  principals and teachers need  one  very

important  element  if they are to  make  any  contri

bution towards their profession, and that is peace of

mind.  There  should be less interruptions  in  their

professional  duties.  They  should  be   given   the

opportunity to do research work and thus  make  their

contribution in the field of education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot agree

more  with  the Member for Moulmein when he suggested

that  principals  should  be given  periodically  six

months'  full-pay  Sabbatical  leave,  provided,   of

course, we have the necessary financial resources  to

do  so.  I  am sure the Ministers on this side,  too,

would  like  to have six months' full-pay  Sabbatical

leave. However, I think the Public Service Commission

has  a  number of scholarships and fellowships  which

are available annually to anyone who is interested in

further studies abroad. I am quite prepared to  grant

liberally  no-pay leave to any principal  or  teacher

who  likes to advance his knowledge abroad, provided,

as I said, it is no pay leave.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that, as a result of running two sessions

with one principal, the promotion opportunities for a

large   number   of  teachers  have   been   somewhat

restricted.  While  we  cannot  afford  to  have  one

principal for one session, I think it is possible  to

consider a principal for one session and an assistant

principal  for the other session in the same  school.

It  is  a  compromise proposal which  I  thought  was

feasible and that is why the suggestion was  made  to

the  Harvey  Salaries  Commission.  I  am  not  in  a

position, at the moment, to give a positive reply  on

this  matter. But if the time is appropriate, I  will

take up this matter again.

(15)*

* Amendment(15) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1159.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, in as much as it takes two to do

the   tango   gracefully,  it  takes   the   teaching

profession  and  the administration  in  a  huge  co-

ordinated  exercise to make our new education  system

succeed.  I  have previously spoken of the  responses

from  the administration which are necessary,  and  I

now  wish  to speak of the responses which. I  think,

are required from the teachers. Generally speaking, I

believe   the  teachers  attempt  their  best   under

reasonably  harsh conditions, having to contend  with

excessively  large  classes, a voluminous  curriculum

and extensive extracurricular activities ranging from

art  clubs to volley ball. No doubt the duties of the

teachers today are onerous. But there is, however,  a

small  negligible segment of the profession  to  whom

the  profession  has lost all appeal, whose  teaching

responsiveness  has long atrophied into  the  callous

principle of doing the least for the maximum benefit.

I  must speak out against this segment of teachers. I

think they had better make up their minds whether  to

be  in  or  out of the profession, and they would  be

sparing  themselves  if  they  left  the  profession,

because  I do not think one can be half committed  if

one is in the teaching profession. One either teaches

or  one  misteaches,  and we certainly  do  not  want

teachers who misteach.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move into the next decade and after having

gone  through a series of educational changes in  the

previous one and having finally set our system, there

is  need  for  the teachers today to  assimilate  the

trend and the progress of the times in the country if

they are to contribute their utmost. At this stage of

our educational development, Sir, we need - as I have

said  before  and I do not think this  can  be  over-emphasised a positive awakening of teaching power. We

need  a  tremendous  teaching zeal,  founded  upon  a

precise  understanding of the aims  and  purposes  of

education in the context of our national growth.  And

what is supremely important, a vocation to teach.  It

means  that the teachers need continually to  improve

upon   their  own  capability  by  perusing  material

relevant   to  the  profession  and  thinking   about

problems relating to education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, it was suggested to me that one

indictment against the teaching profession is that  a

journal  called  the Teachers World Today  cannot  be

sold  in Singapore for want of purchasers. It may  be

so.  I  remember some years ago when the  agents  for

this periodical made quite a business. But it appears

that they have relinquished their agency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no half-way measures in teaching and it

is  imperative  that teachers today be conscious  all

the  time of the fact that they are teaching, because

if  they  are  not,  as I elaborated  yesterday,  the

danger  of  falling  into the rut of  instructing  is

always present. Theirs is a difficult task of finding

the  time  and  the opportunity, in addition  to  the

curriculum,  to  educate their pupils for  character,

for  social cohesion, for citizenship, for democratic

living,  for  critical  inquiry,  for  respect,   for

dignity  in work, for racial and religious tolerance,

for   community   development  and  for   intelligent

leisure. They must undertake all these if we  are  to

have educated school-leavers. Such needs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



require teachers to involve their professional selves

with  the aspirations of the country and fully commit

their professional expertise to the aims and purposes

of education today. For the sake of our country, Sir,

I   call   for  these  responses  from  the  teaching

profession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

that  calls  for a reply from me, because  I  do  not

think  anyone  will  disagree  with  the  Member  for

Serangoon Gardens on what a teacher should be. I must

admit there are not many teachers who can measure  up

to  his expectations. It is mainly the result of  the

large and rapid expansion in education over the  last

ten  years. Many of the existing teachers who  should

not,  in fact, be teachers have got into the teaching

profession   due  to  the  lack  of   more   suitable

candidates.  I think the problem is how  to  identify

those   teachers   who  are  indifferent   to   their

profession  and  to take appropriate  action  against

them.  I  have been in the Ministry of Education  for

more  than  four years and I have yet to come  across

any  principal  who is prepared to inform  me  or  my

Director  that such and such a teacher in his  school

should  not  remain in the service  but  should  seek

alternative  employment elsewhere. Therefore,  it  is

very difficult for the officials in the Ministry  and

for me to identify this small category of black sheep

in the teaching profession and weed them out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sia, we must get on because we

have 27 amendments to go through. Can you be very

brief, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Yes, Sir. The Member for

Serangoon Gardens has said that there can be no half-

way measures in teaching. I cannot agree with him

more that that is an educational ideal. But the

problem is how to apply that ideal in the Singapore

situation. I also agree with the Minister who has

said that there are black sheep among the teachers,

but that the problem is how to spot them out. Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir, there are also many teachers who  want

to play their role but who face certain difficulties.

To   be   good   teachers,  there  must  be   certain

environmental conditions favourable for the  teachers

to  carry  out  their  responsibilities.  As  I  have

mentioned  earlier, in certain schools  they  do  not

even  have a field for teachers to train students  to

be  more  rugged. There is the problem of  getting  a

proper  field  and facilities for physical  education

exercises.  There are a host of other problems,  such

as teachers getting transferred every so often.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to enlighten the Minister on why no

principals would bring to his notice or to the notice

of  his  officials certain cases of bad  teachers,  I

think  this  is  the position and  I  will  quote  an

example which is causing this situation. There  is  a

principal who is very energetic and keen to see  that

the  educational standard in his school is maintained

and  that the teachers maintain certain standards  of

professional proficiency and conducts. One teacher in

his  school persistently misbehaved himself  and  the

principal brought up the matter with the inspector of

schools concerned.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a series of investigations, but finally

it  appears that the principal was not doing his  job

because he did not fulfil certain requirements.  This

news passed around, resulting in a feeling among  the

principals that they should not try to overdo  things

because, instead of putting things right, they  would

find themselves in serious trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if my memory serves me right, the Minister for

English  schools taking Mandarin as a second language

will  be  taught  Civics and History  in  the  second

language,  that is, Mandarin. In this  way,  students

will be more proficient in the second language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know from the Minister whether

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1159.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1160.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns domestic science

teachers. The domestic science teacher, as I see her,

is  one  who, apart from teaching her pupils  cookery

and   sewing,  should  also  be  teaching  them  home

economics. In addition, there is a need to  introduce

to  these  pupils  subjects  like  the  rudiments  of

sociology,  the structure of society, the family  and

the  individual,  parental  responsibilities  of  the

family to society and the country, factors and habits

which  disintegrate the family and how to  avoid  and

correct  them. I think these are subjects  which  the

pupils  studying  domestic science ought  to  concern

themselves with, apart from cookery and sewing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I observe with some anxiety the ease

with which family cohesion today in our society tends

to  dissolve  as we proceed towards urbanisation.  My

impression  today  is  that the  ordinary  hawker  is

already becoming so much an integral feature  of  our

life  that  for many families, lunch or dinner  would

mean the mother or father giving 30 cents or 40 cents

to their children who would disperse for their choice

meals. There are no longer opportunities to cohere in

the  family.  I think these are tendencies  which  we

ought  to try to avert now, and the domestic  science

teachers  can  start doing that by instructing  their

pupils in all these subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister enlighten the House on whether the

officer  in  charge of syllabuses is  aware  of  such

tendencies and whether or not there is an attempt  or

a  trend  to  embody  these  subjects  which  I  have

mentioned in the curriculum for domestic science?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the syllabuses

economics,  the  rudiments  of  sociology  and  other

subjects. Of course, the Member is also aware  of  my

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that at the present juncture in our

nation  building we need not only sufficient teachers

but  also teachers who are dedicated to the cause  of

education. In other words, our efforts must not  only

be  directed at quantitative improvement but also  at

qualitative    improvement   in    our    educational

endeavours.  Judging from the courses and re-training

conducted by the Teachers' Training College, it seems

that  the  question  of  quantity  has  been  solved,

particularly in regard to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



primary school teachers. What is urgently required at

the present juncture is sufficient technical teachers

to man our technical and vocational schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th December, the Minister for Education said in

this House and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To provide the necessary teachers for the swing

towards  technical education, a massive training  and

retraining scheme is already under way. The  training

programme will move into top gear next year with  the

expansion  of  the  technical wing of  the  Teachers'

Training College.'



<br><br>This is really a very heartening move on the part  of

the  Ministry. But, on the other hand,  we  must  not

forget   that  we  should  also  aim  at  qualitative

improvement  in  our  education.  The  retraining  of

qualified  teachers, viewed from certain  angles,  is

aimed at enhancing the quality of teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to say a few words on the re-training

programme and the attitude of the teachers towards re

training.  Care should be exercised in  making  long-

term  plans for such re-training courses. Let me take

as  an  example the syllabus of Chinese as  a  second

language,  which  is  one of the  important  training

courses, the success of teaching Chinese as a  second

language, and the policy of bilingualism in  schools.

What  preparations have been made  by  the  Teachers'

Training College or the Ministry before these courses

are  conducted? How many experts are  there  in  this

particular  field?  How are we  going  to  train  the

lecturers  who  will in turn train  the  teachers  to

teach  Chinese  as a second language  in  non-Chinese

schools? There are many teachers who want to  improve

themselves and are willing to learn, but whether they

have adopted the correct attitude is questionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago some lucrative monetary incentives

were  given  to  those attending  certain  in-service

courses. However, such monetary incentives have  been

abolished  and  yet the response to  the  re-training

courses has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



been  very  good.  I can give two reasons  for  this.

Firstly, the reason for the good response shows  that

the  teachers  are eager to learn and want  to  equip

themselves with the latest methods so that  they  can

accept   the   challenge  of   educating   our   next

generation.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the negative sense, this shows that our

teachers  want  to  safeguard their  jobs.  In  other

words,  they  want  to  protect their  rice-bowl.  Un

fortunately, most of those teachers who responded  to

the re-training courses were motivated by the need or

anxiety to secure their employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to note that the majority of teachers

regard teaching as an ordinary profession and not  as

a  special profession. I am a teacher and I can there

fore  speak  from my own experience. I will  describe

briefly   the   actual  position  in   the   schools,

especially  with  regard to the attitude  of  certain

teachers to the teaching profession. They are  scared

of  their colleagues. They fear that their colleagues

may  make  reports  to the principals  and  that  the

principals in turn will make adverse reports  to  the

Ministry.  Many  teachers  are  also  scared  of  the

inspectors and officials from the Ministry. This goes

to  show  that  the relationship among the  teachers,

principals and officials of the Ministry  is  one  of

mutual  distrust and suspicion, with the result  that

the  teachers  are content to do only what  they  are

required to do. They regard their jobs as a means  of

livelihood  and  they  do  not  display  professional

ethics in their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the Teachers' Training College

which  plays  an important role in teacher  training.

Teacher training should not be undertaken by the  Tea

chers'   Training  College  alone.  The   inspectors.

principals and senior teachers also have  a  role  to

play  in  teacher training. Of course, the  Teachers'

Training  College  is  directly  involved  with   the

training of teachers. The curriculum of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



the  Teachers'  Training College is composed  of  two

sections, namely, professional subjects and  academic

subjects.  The professional subjects are  educational

theory, educational psychology and other methods  of

teaching,  and  the  academic  subjects  are   mainly

concerned with the contents of the academic subjects.

The   trainees  are  mostly  from  the  primary   and

secondary schools. It is regrettable that not  enough

has  been done to instil professional ethics into the

teachers. I feel that the Teachers' Training  College

should lay more stress on professional ethics courses

for  the  teachers. It should also  provide  training

courses    in    school    administration.     School

administration is one of the subjects taught  in  the

universities.  In this way, we hope to have  teachers

of   good   quality   and  learned  principals   with

administrative  skill. Of course, it is  not  exactly

the  intention  that  teachers  should  learn  school

administration  with a view to their being  appointed

as  principals, but it is the duty of the teachers to

have  an  inkling of school administration.  If  they

have  a basic knowledge of school administration,  it

is  possible that they can become principals  in  the

future  and put their knowledge to good use.  But  if

they  have  to  start  from  scratch  when  they  are

appointed as principals, they will find themselves in

a mess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to refer to kindergarten

education.  Children  in  kindergarten  classes   can

easily cultivate attitudes and habits. Therefore,  we

should  pay much attention to their social  behaviour

and  physical  health in order to  prepare  them  for

academic  studies  in  later  years.  Formal  lessons

should   not  be  conducted  in  kindergartens.   The

children  should enjoy indoor and outdoor  activities

in  pleasant  surroundings. They should  be  provided

with  toys and play-things. In addition, they  should

be   taught  educative  and  creative  subjects  like

drawing, story-telling, singing and dancing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, perhaps I can begin my

observations  by asking what the schemes  of  teacher

training  are which are currently being conducted  in

the Teachers' Training College today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality teaching comes from quality teachers, and

quality  teachers  are  found and  developed  in  the

Teachers'  Training College. This brings  me  to  the

basis  of selection for teacher training these  days.

For years now, teacher training selection has been on

the  basis of academic merits which has been accepted

as  an indicator of suitability for the teaching  pro

fession.  This  has  been necessary  because  of  the

exigencies of the times which have demanded  a  rapid

expansion in education. Today, however, we  begin  to

emphasise  "qualitative"  education  which,   in   my

opinion,  is  a  supertlous  adjective,  because   if

education   is  education,  then  it  is  qualitative

already, if it is not, it is mis-education. But if we

are to initiate a qualitative revolution in education

now,  I  suggest  that  we  start  in  the  Teachers'

Training  College  and  we re-do  the  basis  of  our

teacher training selection in order that we may recog

nise  teaching as a vocation, although that  vocation

may  repose  in the bosom of an applicant without  an

impressive academic achievement. The inquiry into the

selection  of  applicants  should  be  of  sufficient

breadth and depth. It should probe for some signs  of

an  impulsion  to  teach. Then it should  survey  the

applicant's character and look for what I would  call

the intangibles - the undefinable traits which go  to

make up the character of the individual - not so much

by  a  reference to the conduct columns in  a  school

report  book,  but by ranging over the  intellectual,

social and cultural experiences of the applicant  and

the moral or immoral persuasions to which he had been

subjected in his childhood or adolescence.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was when applicants for the teaching profession

came from middle-class homes. That practice no longer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



obtains  today - and I say this without any intention

of  casting a reflection on, any one class. But  they

did have a certain amount of moral upbringing imposed

upon  them  by conservative parents, with the  result

that  when they recruited for the teaching profession

they had in them what could be termed a moral content

and they were, therefore, suitable to appear before a

class  of  40 students to teach. But after  the  war,

education was brought to the people at large so  that

we  gradually got the person who appeared before  the

selection   board   with   the   requisite   academic

qualifications.  But  I maintain  that  that  is  not

sufficient alone to qualify him, to appear  before  a

class  of  40 students to teach. I think the  inquiry

should  go beyond that. As I have said, it should  go

into all the moral persuasions that go to make up his

character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of boys and girls will pass through the

influence of teachers. These teachers cannot and will

not  teach no matter how intelligent they are if they

are  amoral;  they can only instruct. In that  light,

what   are  the  content  courses  in  the  Teachers'

Training  College  today?  Are  they  courses   which

instruct  and  equip student teachers  to  carry  out

teaching for social cohesion? One innovation which  I

may  suggest  is that the Teachers' Training  College

may  consider  courses to instruct  trainees  in  the

mechanics  of  learning, so that they  may  not  only

teach  the  teachers what to learn but how  to  learn

effectively.  I  wonder what is the  extent  of  such

training  in  the Teachers' Training College  in  the

complexities of present-day living. I think a student

has to go through quite a lot of reading material  in

one  day, and if he is a slow reader, he is going  to

be  greatly  handicapped. I refer  to  subjects  like

speed reading and comprehension. I wonder what is the

extent  of  such  training in the Teachers'  Training

College. There is so much for the pupils to  take  in

and absorb in the course of their school life.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it should be obvious that one way of going

about it is to teach them





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



how  to  absorb  the material read  effectively.  Has

there   been   research   on   speed   reading    and

comprehension, memory utilisation and so  on  in  the

Teachers' Training College?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I am pleased to say that I have come across

Vol. 1, No. 1 of Teacher Today by the Teachers' Train

ing  College which contains educational articles. But

I  wish  to express one regret about this volume  and

its  contents.  The views and opinions  on  education

expressed  in  this journal are excluded  from  being

representative of the College or the thinking of  the

Ministry.  They are impressive articles by impressive

writers.  But, at the same time, paragraph 2  on  the

second  page  says, "Any opinions which  the  writers

have expressed or implied in this publication do  not

necessarily  reflect the views of the College  or  of

the Ministry of Education."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think we need - at least I for one need - to

be  able to assist the Minister and his Parliamentary

Secretary is to have articles on education which  are

representative of the views of the Ministry  and  the T.T.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much of what

the  Member  for Paya Lebar said just  now,  has,  in

fact,   already  been  covered  by  the  Member   for

Serangoon  Gardens.  The Member  for  Paya  Lebar  is

doubtful  about the benefit of many of the in-service

courses organised by the Ministry. In his view,  many

of  the  teachers  who responded to these  in-service

courses  either did so because of the  attraction  of

the  increment in the salary scale, or  because  they

wanted  to ensure their security of tenure. In  fact,

they  had  very  little interest  in  the  in-service

courses.  One  can  only hope that the  teachers  who

attended many of the in-service courses organised for

them  are genuinely interested in the profession  and

want to improve themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also suggested that school administration

should be one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



the   subjects  taught  in  the  Teachers'   Training

College,  in  addition to the professional  subjects.

There  is nothing objectionable to this in principle.

But  I  am  not  so  sure whether  time  permits  the

inclusion of this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the kindergarten classes are concerned,

the Ministry does not have the financial resources to

supervise this aspect of the child's education. It is

undoubtedly desirable if we have the financial  means

to  run  the kindergarten classes ourselves. However,

what  the  Ministry seeks to do is to  draw  up  some

guidance  for  the  organisers  of  the  kindergarten

classes.  In  conjunction with  the  Adult  Education

Board,  the Ministry is now organising a kindergarten

teachers'  course  for  principals  and  teachers  of

existing   registered   kindergarten   schools.    In

addition,  the  Adult  Education  Board,   with   the

assistance  of  the  Education  Ministry,  will  also

organise  a  crash  programme  for  the  training  of

teachers  in  kindergarten classes organised  by  the

People's Association and other interested parties. It

is  our  view that trained kindergarten teachers  are

better  than  the  untrained  teachers  who  are  now

conducting  these classes. As far as the Ministry  is

concerned, the cost of running these classes will not

be prohibitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has raised the

question  of the selection of candidates for training

as  teachers. He says that proper care should be exer

cised  in  their  selection.  As  he  is  aware,  all

teachers  in  training were selected  by  the  Public

Service  Commission. I am sure they would have  taken

all  the  relevant  factors into  consideration  when

selecting candidates for the teaching service. It  is

true that because of the rapid expansion and the need

for large numbers of teachers, it has not always been

possible  to  pay  due regard to factors  other  than

academic  performances. However, the expansion  phase

in  education is now over. Henceforth, I think it  is

possible  to  pay  regard  to  what  the  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens has referred to as the  intangible

factors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T.T.C. is only responsible for the selection of

students  for  full-time teacher  training.  In  this

respect,   the  following  factors  are  taken   into

account:

academic  qualifications, extracurricular activities,

spoken language, including a test in oral reading and

comprehension, personality, aptitude and general know

ledge.  In  so far as full-time teacher  training  is

concerned,  academic qualifications,  therefore,  are

not  the sole criterion for selection of students  by

the T.T.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has been made that in the past teachers were

recruited  mainly  from middle class  families,  and,

therefore, they had a higher moral standing. I am not

so sure that this was necessarily the case. I think a

fairly large proportion of families in the middle and

well-to-do  classes did not measure up  to  the  high

moral  standards expected of them. On the other hand,

there  are,  from the working class families,  people

with  moral  fibre comparable to, if not even  better

than,  those from the middle class families. However,

I  agree  with the Member that now that the expansion

phase is over, more attention should be paid to  such

intangible  factors  as  the  character   and   moral

standards of the candidates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am quite satisfied

with  the  Minister's explanation. But there  is  one

point  - perhaps I was too much in a hurry in raising

it in my speech - he has not answered. If Mr Speaker

will  allow me, I would like to repeat this question.

Are  there  enough lecturers to teach  Chinese  as  a

second  language?  If  there  are  not  enough,  what

programme  has the T.T.C, in mind to train  lecturers

in the teaching of Chinese as a second language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the teaching of

Chinese as a second language is one of those subjects

in which very little research has been carried out in

Singapore. This is not the case with the teaching  of

English  as  a  second language where  we  have  many

experts whom we can consult. I am afraid that in  the

field of teaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



Chinese as a second language, we have to do the  best

we can. We have specialist teachers and inspectors in

Chinese. I think in Nanyang University there are also

lecturers  who specialise in the teaching of  Chinese

as a second language. In the immediate future, we may

have  to make use of their services to teach not only

teachers  in  Chinese as a second language  but  also

teacher educators.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the Minister

for his explanation. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is purely to seek

information  on  the  functions  of  the  educational

television service.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the principal object of educational

television? Is it to supplement classroom teaching or

is it to replace classroom teaching in some subjects?

Is  there  no  scope  for innovation  in  educational

television  like  education in the responsibility  of

the  home,  in beneficial leisure, or general  health

education,  or education in sports? In  other  words,

instead of limiting educational television to  formal

classroom   subjects,  what  scope   is   there   for

educational television in education other than formal

classroom subjects?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The objective of the educational

television   service   is  to  supplement   classroom

teaching  in certain subjects and not to replace  it.

The   suggestion  that  the  educational   television

service  should  be  extended to  cover  non-academic

subjects  is  a  good one, but its implementation  is

dependent upon availability of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two programmes were transmitted in1968 during the

second  term in the civic series in Chinese  on  Good

Health and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



Health  in the Community. Each programme was repeated

eight  times a week. In 1969, it is proposed  that  a

series of five programmes in health education in  the

four  languages will be transmitted. The English  and

Malay versions will be transmitted in the first  term

and  the  Chinese and Tamil versions  in  the  second

term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more funds are available, more non-academic

subjects will be introduced.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Principal of the Junior College has said in

the press that the pupils who will be admitted to the

College  will be the elite students from  schools  in

the  four  language streams. This is the best  method

and  is  in  line  with  the Government's  policy  on

education.   But  I  understand  the   languages   of

instruction in this College are English and Mandarin.

As  pupils  will be selected from the  four  language

streams,  how  can the students from  the  Malay  and

Tamil  streams  compete  with  the  pupils  from  the

English  and  Chinese streams? The  pupils  from  the

Malay  and Tamil streams may have Credits in all  the

subjects, but they are weak in English as it is their

second  language. If they obtain a Pass  in  English,

how  are they to be admitted to this College? And  if

they  are admitted, how can they adapt themselves  to

the subjects to be taught in the College?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my queries under this

subhead have been raised to some extent by the Member

for Kampong Kembangan. Perhaps I could start off with

the  aims  and purposes of the College. What  factors

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



determine  the  selection of  students  applying  for

seats  in  the  College? Will  the  students  in  the

College  receive  a  kind of education  substantially

different from that in the pre-university classes  in

secondary schools? How is the education system in the

College  to  produce the kind of  graduate  that  the

College intends to produce? Is there not a danger  of

developing  a  psychological complex in the  students

who  are  in  pre-university classes but out  of  the

College?   I  think  they  will  consider  themselves

academically qualified for admission to the College.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I have at no time used the

term  "elite"  nor has the Principal  of  the  Junior

College used such a term. Therefore, I think it  will

create  a  wrong impression in using this  term  when

referring to this College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Junior College is being set up to provide better

facilities  and  conditions than  would  normally  be

available in existing secondary schools for the  pre-

university type of education. At the end of the  two-

year  course,  pupils will sit for the Higher  School

Certificate Examination either in English or Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection for admission to the College is based

mainly   on   academic  performance,  extracurricular

activities and proficiency in a second language.  The

personality and character of the applicant will  also

be  taken  into consideration. Besides  studying  the

usual   academic  subjects  for  the  Higher   School

Certificate  Examination,  pupils  will  continue  to

study  a second language. Every pupil is expected  to

take  part  in extracurricular activities,  including

participation   in   College  societies   or   clubs.

Participation in community work will also be part  of

the training of pupils, in social responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The College aims at providing an all-round education

and  training  for its, pupils, at the end  of  which

they  will  not only have attained the necessary  aca

demic qualifications for further studies and training

in tertiary institutions, but will also be physically

and mentally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



alert,  civic minded and will have developed a  sense

of  understanding and tolerance. It is also  intended

to  develop  among the pupils qualities of  self-reli

ance,   adaptability   and  leadership.   And,   most

important  of  all,  it aims at  inculcating  in  the

pupils  a  spirit  of  loyalty  to  the  nation   and

commitment  to  the  task  of  nation  building.  The

attributes  that I have just mentioned are  essential

for  those of our young citizens who, in due  course,

are likely to play an active role in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils from the Malay and Tamil streams are also

eligible for admission to the Junior College provided

they can follow instruction in English, if necessary,

those  pupils  who are selected will be  given  extra

lessons  to improve their proficiency in the  English

language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

arising from what the Minister has just said, I  take

it  that the Junior College will not be the only  one

in Singapore. Perhaps there are plans to build others

elsewhere?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the original proposal was to

have  four Junior Colleges and, if possible, all  the

pre-university classes existing at the  moment  would

be   centralised  in  these  four  Junior   Colleges.

However, in view of limited funds, we can only launch

this  one Junior College. We hope it will not be  the

only one, but we can never be certain.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

this    point   merely   to   help   dispel   certain

misconceptions  that are being held by  people  about

the purpose of the Junior College.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Although final arrangements have

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (29) .



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2106.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran

Dewasa,  it  has made valuable contributions  to  the

community  and the state, in addition to  giving  com

mercial   education  in  subjects   like   shorthand,

typewriting and accounting. It also conducts  courses

in orchid growing, photography and so on. The biggest

contribution  by  the  Adult Education  Board  is  to

accommodate students who fail in the Cambridge School

Certificate  Examination, the  Federation  of  Malaya

Certificate   Examination,  or   the   Secondary   IV

examination. The majority of students who  failed  in

such  examinations are admitted to classes  conducted

by  the Board and some of them have passed the Higher

School Certificate Examination and have been admitted

to the universities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe more and more pupils will be admitted to

these classes next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice from the Estimates that the sum allocated

to  the Board for 1968 is $2 million, whereas the sum

allocated for the next financial year 1969-70 is only

$1,875,000. Sir, I wish to know



whether  the Malay pupils who have been removed  from

these   classes   will  continue  to   receive   free

education, like those who have been removed from  the

technical and academic schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

I  wish to thank the Member for Kampong Kembangan for

his tribute to the work of the Adult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



Education Board. The Member is quite right in  saying

that  the  activities of the Board will be  increased

next  year.  In  fact, there are many projects  which

will be implemented next year. Unfortunately, in view

of  the increased defence expenditure, economy has to

be practised in many items of social expenditure, and

the  Adult Education Board is one of those which will

be  affected adversely. But with our vast experience,

we  feel  that we can manage even with this reduction

in grants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, speaking for myself, I would definitely welcome

a  $2«  million grant rather than $1.8  million,  but

these  are  the  hard facts of life. However,  I  can

assure  the Member that the services provided by  the

Board  will not be affected by this decrease  in  the

vote.  This  will  be met partly by  a  reduction  in

remuneration to part-time teachers and, in  part,  by

an upward revision of some of the fees chargeable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Malay students who are Singapore

citizens or children of Singapore citizens, they will

be  granted a concession in that they need  only  pay

half the rate of tuition fees, and for those who  are

attending  special classes, they will be granted  the

same exemption.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The Parliamentary

Secretary has said that the remuneration of part-time

teachers  will be reduced. This means that they  will

receive  less remuneration than what they  have  been

receiving heretofore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the present remuneration of

part-time teachers is unreasonably high, and we  have

to  rectify  it and put it on the same basis  as  and

comparable  with  that  of  the  full-time   teachers

engaged in the education service.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2110.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead concerns free textbooks and stationery

for pupils. I understand there is an extensive scheme

for  free textbooks and stationery for pupils. Is the

officer in charge of school textbooks in the Ministry

of   Education   also  concerned  with   the   school

curriculum?  If so, to what extent, if  any,  is  the

accumulation of free textbooks and their availability

to  the schools a factor which determines changes  in

the  curriculum of schools? In fact, in view  of  the

stringent  budget of the Ministry of  Education,  one

might  be  tempted to say that one  has  got  a  vast

accumulation of old textbooks so one will not  change

one's  curriculum and therefore make use of  the  old

free  textbooks,  when  perhaps  there  need  to   be

progressive tendencies in curriculum changes  at  the

same  time.  May  I  know, also,  when  and  in  what

circumstances are curriculum changes made and on what

basis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what becomes of the free textbooks which

are no longer required for issue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the distribution of free

textbooks   does  not  in  any  way   determine   the

curriculum  changes.  These  changes  are  determined

mainly by changes in educational policy. The Ministry

does  not  directly purchase textbooks and distribute

them  to  schools.  Each school  is  given  a  yearly

allocation  of  a certain sum from the  central  free

textbooks vote, and if the allocated sum is not fully

utilised  for the purchase of textbooks, the  balance

is   returned  to  the  Ministry  and  re-distributed

amongst  other schools requiring further allocations.

As such, there is no possibility of accumulating vast

stocks  of  free textbooks. When these books  are  no

longer  required, they are transferred to the  school

libraries  for  reference and  lending  purposes  and

those  which  are  too  old  and  unserviceable   are

disposed  of. Therefore, the possibility of the  free

textbooks  scheme  affecting the  curriculum  changes

will not arise.

<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr L.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(31) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what moves me to make this amendment is purely

curiosity.  I see from the Estimates that  "Rent  and

Maintenance of Playing Fields" for 1968 is  $400  and

for the extending financial year of 15 months, it  is

$250.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I may be informed how this small sum of $250

can  accommodate the rent and maintenance of  playing

fields of our schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hitherto, the

vote was for two purposes: first, to pay the rent  of

a field belonging to the British Army which was, used

by  the  Clementi School: and, secondly, to  maintain

the  Shenton Way field for the use of Gan  Eng  Seng,

Telok Ayer, Peck Seah, Ai Tong, Trafalgar, Yong  Seng

and  Umar  Palavar Schools. Both these uses have  now

ceased.  Clementi  School  is  now  using  the  Pasir

Panjang  Primary School field, while the Shenton  Way

field is now occupied by the N.T.U.C. ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Speaker, Sir, for 1969, this vote will  not  be used

for  payment  of  rent but, will  be  used  to maintain

the field in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

2123.



<br><br>This subhead deals with "Substitute Relief Teachers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the amount voted for is $1,287,500.

This  is  quite  a substantial amount  of  money  for

relief  teachers.  If  I  may  formulate  my  queries

immediately, may I be informed how many such teachers

are there, why are they required whom do they relieve

and to what basic duties are they assigned?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, relief

teachers  are  short-time replacements for  permanent

teachers.   The   scheme  of  relief   teachers   was

originally  introduced to supply  short-term  replace

ments  for  permanent teachers who  go  on  maternity

leave  or medical leave exceeding four weeks. It  has

been subsequently extended to a few vacancies at  the

beginning   of  this  year  pending  recruitment   of

teachers  and also to cover replacements for teachers

who are called up for national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifications of the relief teachers will

depend on the qualifications of the teachers for whom

they  stand  in.  The qualifications of  the  various

grades  of relief teachers are as follows.  The  grad

uate  teachers  are  of  two types  -  the  qualified

teachers   and  the  under-qualified  teachers.   The

qualified teachers are those graduates with a Diploma

in   Education   and   those  non-graduates   holding

recognised   teacher   qualifications.   The   under-

qualified  teachers are university graduates  without

teaching  qualifications or  holders  of  the  School

Certificate,   Senior  Middle   III   or   Government

Secondary  IV  qualifications  with  three   Credits,

including a Credit in a language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As relief teachers are appointed as short-term

replacements for the permanent ones, their duties are

identical  with those of the permanent teachers.  For

1968, we have a total of 1,319 appointments of relief

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have now and again stated that the vote for education has been cut for the sake of defence. But I notice in the Estimates that a provision has been made for "Bonuses for Language Examinations". To whom are these bonuses given?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the bonuses in

question  are payable to non-Malay teachers who  pass

the  Standard  II  and Standard III of  the  National

Language  Examinations conducted by the Ministry  and

the Permanent Examinations Board. The amounts payable

to  each teacher are $200 and $500 respectively.  The

award  of  these  bonuses is to  encourage  non-Malay

teachers to study the national language.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): How many teachers have

received such bonuses up to now'?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2128.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns "Vocational Guidance Expenses". My

queries  are  as  follows.  What  is  the  extent  of

vocational guidance in the schools today? What consti

tute the activities of vocational guidance bodies  in

the  schools? Is vocational guidance in schools  also

an attempt to recognise aptitudes for careers and pro

fessions and to offer the necessary guidance?  Or  is

it  merely  the effort of informing students  of  the

various careers and professions so that they  may  be

convinced  that  they are suitable for  a  particular

career  or profession? Vocational guidance in schools

these  days  is necessarily limited to informing  the

student  body of the kind of professions  or  careers

available to them with their relevant qualifications.

I think vocational guidance should go beyond that. It

should  try  to  devise  a scheme  to  ascertain  the

aptitudes  of  the  pupils and  inform  them  of  the

aptitudes   which   would  be  conducive   to   their

professions or careers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Serangoon  Gardens  is correct  in  saying  that  the

Vocational Guidance Unit should extend its activities

beyond  that  of just counselling the pupils  on  job

opportunities. I think the Member is aware that  each

school has a teacher responsible for the students'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



guidance  on  careers. The activities of  this~  unit

involve  the dissemination of information on  careers

and  job  opportunities by news-letters, film slides,

tapes,  books, talks, etc. This is only part  of  its

activities.  The Vocational Guidance  Unit  has  four

types    of    services:   information,    diagnosis,

orientation and counselling. The Vocational  Guidance

Unit  will  organise aptitude tests to ascertain  the

aptitudes  of the Secondary II students as  to  their

suitability  for  channelling into the  technical  or

academic  streams  or  into the  Industrial  Training

Centre in 1970. A pilot project has been planned  and

will  start  operation in 1969  to  conduct  aptitude

tests on pupils selected at random.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the names  of Mr P. Govindaswamy and Madam Chan Choy Siong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been debating on the vote for the Education Ministry yesterday and this afternoon. Many Members have mentioned the quality, character and profession of the teachers. It is not because I am a teacher myself that I want to say something good about them. But, generally speaking,

they  have been called the engineers of the souls  of

human  beings. Some people describe them as  creators

of  future  society. They generally have a high  esti

mation  of  teachers.  We, of  course,  as  teachers,

understand our duties and position. We appreciate the

expectations  which the public have of us.  In  fact,

the majority of teachers regard teaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



as   their  profession.  They  understand  that,   as

teachers, they must have self-discipline and set good

examples to the students. They must have integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the officials of the Education

Ministry.  There should be good personal relationship

between the Ministry and the teachers. As the  Member

for  Serangoon  Gardens has said, under  the  present

education system, teachers are in a passive position.

They  have to comply with the instructions issued  by

the  Ministry of Education just like employees taking

instructions from their employers - in order to  safe

guard  their jobs. As the Member for Paya  Lebar  has

said  just  now, officials of the Education  Ministry

are  regarded  as  important  persons.  The  Ministry

itself  is  regarded as an employer. If  one  or  two

teachers  err,  the whole teaching  profession  comes

under the whip of the Education Ministry. There  are,

of course, black sheep in all professional bodies. We

must not blame the whole profession because of one or

two  black  sheep. The majority of the teachers  have

been  blamed  because  of the  misbehaviour  of  some

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Ministry recently issued orders that

teachers should not go to bars, dance halls or engage

in  gambling.  This would give people the  impression

that  they  generally  indulge in  these  activities.

Although  I  am not against such orders  -  for  this

would  exercise  some disciplinary control  over  the

teachers  -  it should not be done at the expense  of

the  good  reputation of the teachers in  general.  I

hope  the  Minister  will deal  carefully  with  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask him how many school

principals  and  teachers have been sacked  or  given

warnings this year because of their bad behaviour  or

negligence in their duties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member   for  Jurong  should  be  aware   that   when

Backbenchers  or I criticise the teachers  for  their

lack



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



of dedication and other shortcomings, we always refer

to the minority group of teachers. We have at no time

referred  to  the  whole teaching profession  and  he

should  not be unduly worried about it. But  I  would

suggest   that   the  best  way  of  preserving   the

respectability   of  the  profession   is   for   the

professional  bodies, such as the  teachers'  unions,

principals  and  members of the teaching  profession,

like  the Member for Jurong, to single out the  black

sheep  so  that  appropriate action  could  be  taken

against  them  and so that the vast majority  of  the

teachers  will  not  be  adversely  affected  by  the

conduct of this small number of teachers.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong seeks certain figures about

the  number of teachers dismissed. In 1968, only  one

principal and two teachers were dismissed because  of

their  misconduct.  In addition,  one  principal  and

seven teachers had their services terminated also  on

grounds of misconduct.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I wanted to speak on many

matters  under this amendment but my colleagues  have

spoken on most of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, however, to draw the attention of the

Minister  to the large crowd of school children  from

afternoon schools waiting at bus stands as late as  7

p.m, in  the evening. It is a pitiful sight  to  see

young   children,  particularly  young  girls,   from

schools  in  the rural areas waiting  for  buses  and

having to walk in dark lonely streets after alighting

from  a bus, sometimes as late as 7.30 p.m. Will  the

Minister   consider  approaching  the  Minister   for

Communications and requesting him to arrange  for  an

adequate number of buses for school children so  that

they  do not have to wait so late at night for  their

buses?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does any other Member want to speak on

transport for school children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

aware of this problem. I think the provision of

school buses will help to solve this perennial

problem of a good many parents to find suitable

transport for their children who are attending school

and will also relieve their anxiety for the safety of

their children. My Ministry is already looking into

this problem and the possibility of encouraging

schools to run a school bus service of their own. A

number of Chinese schools in Singapore already have

school buses of their own to provide transportation

for their pupils. It is hoped that the example of

these Chinese schools will be followed and that

eventually more schools will succeed in having their

own bus service.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I notice there has been some reduction

in  the expenditure of the Ministry of Education.  We

know  a  newly  emergent nation must  place  economy,

education and culture on an equal basis. That is  the

proper way to do things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, a youth forum was conducted over

T.V.  Singapura  and the topic was  whether  economic

construction   is   more  important   than   cultural

construction in nation building. The outcome  of  the

debate  was that cultural construction was considered

to  be more important than economic construction.  So

we  can  say  that education is within the  ambit  of

culture.  Therefore, we must attach great  importance

to   education  in  so  far  as  nation  building  is

concerned.   Children  start  learning   from   their

parents.  After  that, they must be  given  classroom

education in addition to education at home. Each time

we  emphasise the establishment of a rugged  society,

we  must  not  forget the important  role  played  by

education in bringing up the next generation to  take

over from the present generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in terms of total expenditure for the

Ministry  of  Education, it is  my  view  that  there

should  be an increase instead of a decrease, because

it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



is  inconceivable that when our education  system  is

going  through  a  change, we  should  curtail   the

expenditure for education. In switching from academic

to  technical education, we have to carry out a great

deal  of innovations and other changes. It means that

money  is  involved. In my view, if  the  expenditure

allotted  to  the  Ministry  of  Education   is   not

increased,  I  do  not think we  can  carry  out  the

various  changes  and  reforms within  a  very  tight

budget  unless we reduce the number of schools.  This

will mean a change of policy in view of this decrease

in expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wish to ask the Minister several

questions. Firstly, in terms of expenditure, does  it

mean that the policy of free primary education may be

varied?  In  other words, there will be only  partial

free  education  in the primary stage  instead  of  a

comprehensive free primary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether there is any intention

to  implement  a  scheme  to  scrap  school  building

programmes  which are already in the planning  stages

because  of  the reduction in expenditure.  In  other

words,  are we trying to channel some of our students

into private schools instead of Government schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Chinese community leaders made great

contributions to education by giving financial aid to

private  schools.  In those days,  they  were  rather

chauvinistic  and  so  they  spent  their  money   in

promoting   Chinese   education.  However,   although

Chinese  chauvinism does not exist now, contributions

from  Chinese leaders are not so readily forthcoming.

Is  it  the  policy of the Ministry of  Education  to

encourage these people to contribute towards national

education?  In  my  view, if  such  encouragement  is

given, it may be possible for us to continue building

more  schools  and to continue with our free  primary

education policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, as I explained in my speech

on  the  12th December, although this is a standstill

budget,  nevertheless  we  have  adequate  funds   to

provide for the expansion in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



technical education. It is true that, as a result  of

this  standstill  budget,  the  funds  available  for

general   education  are  not  as  much  as   before.

Nevertheless,  we  have been  able  to  maintain  the

existing  level of expenditure and are able to  carry

out most of the programmes of activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question of discontinuing with the six-

year free primary education in Singapore. Even with a

standstill budget, we are able to continue  with  it.

What  I am not able to say is whether we are able  to

allow  each primary school pupil the maximum of eight

years  to finish his primary education. Hitherto,  we

have  been  able to provide six years'  free  primary

education  plus  two  further opportunities  for  the

pupils  to  finish  their primary education.  If  our

financial  resources  should be  further  restricted,

4hen we may cut down the number of years available to

a  student  in a primary school rather than  do  away

with the six-year free primary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have also explained before, the primary school

building   programme  and,  for  that   matter,   the

secondary  school  programme, in  fact,  ceased  last

year.  However,  we  still  have  enough  places   in

Singapore   to  cater  for  primary  school   pupils.

However,  because of the population shift, there  are

shortages here and there. But if parents are  not  so

particular  about  their  children  being  posted  to

schools  nearest their homes, there would  be  places

for their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our economy in social expenditure,

there  is more reason for the Government to encourage

private   support   in  educational   ventures.   The

Government will welcome any private individual who is

keen  to assist in our school-building programme.  In

fact,  in  Toa  Payoh  for  instance,  we  are  quite

prepared  to  release  some of our  school  sites  to

private  organisations  or individuals  if  they  are

prepared to build primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $198,712,470 for Head 0701 ordered to

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications is a newly

established  Ministry. On the one  hand,  this  shows

that  the  Government is placing great importance  on

the development of communications. On the other hand,

it   signifies  that  there  are  more  communication

problems  to  be faced. Under the able leadership  of

the  Minister,  the  Ministry of  Communications  has

started  a series of new measures. For instance,  the

one  way traffic system has been implemented many  of

the   busy  roads,  and  at  cross-roads,  pedestrian

crossings have been marked out. A Transport  Advisory

Board  has  also  been set up to advise  on  problems

relating to transportation, and two advisers from the

United Kingdom have been invited to Singapore to give

assistance  and  make  their  recommendations.  These

measures undertaken by the Ministry are encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still many car accidents on the

road.  According  to  the police,  290  persons  were

killed as a result of car accidents during the  first

11 months of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of public transportation, there are

two  aspects. Firstly, there is a shortage of  public

service vehicles, and secondly, the problem of  heavy

traffic. I think our capable Minister will be able to

solve  these problems and thereby improve our  public

transport system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the two experts from the United

Kingdom  have  recommended that public  transport  in

Singapore  should  be nationalised.  I  do  not  know

whether  the Minister has considered this suggestion.

At the same time, I wish to know the work done so far

by the Transport Advisory Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to raise a question on the shortage

of  taxis. According to unofficial statistics,  there

are about 15,000 to 20,000 taxi-drivers but there are

only  4,000 taxis. Will the Minister consider issuing

more  licences  in  order to solve  the  unemployment

problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out that the administration of

public  transport  is in a mess.  For  instance,  the

Registry  of Vehicles is responsible for the  control

of vehicles while the police deals with pirate taxis.

Other  matters relating to public transport are under

the  charge of other offices. The Car Parks  Division

has marked out parking lots along many roads and,  as

a  result, the roads have become narrower. On the one

hand, the Transport Advisory Board is trying to widen

the  roads to ease the traffic problem, but,  on  the

other  hand,  the Car Parks Division  is  making  the

roads  narrower. I would therefore suggest  that  all

matters  of  public transport should come  under  one

Ministry, that is, the Ministry of Communications. In

this way, we can improve public transport, reduce the

number of car accidents and also safeguard the  lives

of our people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is rather embarrassing to

answer what I would say the kudos that has been given

to  me,  whereas it is actually my other  Ministerial

colleagues  who have been responsible  for  the  good

work  that  has  been mentioned  by  the  Member  for

Sembawang. I would like to draw his attention to  the

fact  that if he sees new roads and extensions  being

made, new ped~strian crossings being marked out,  and

new  flyovers  being  built,  the  credit  for  these

projects is rightly due to my colleague, the Minister

for National Development. I do not therefore wish  to

take credit for them all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang covered considerable ground

in  his speech -some of his remarks are for and  some

are  against my Ministry - and he ended up by  making

certain suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I touch upon the points raised by the

Member?  The  decision to appoint two  advisers  from

London to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



survey  the possibility of mass transit for Singapore

had  been  taken  before  I assumed'  office  in  the

Ministry   of  Communications.  Unfortunately,   this

report  is,  at  the moment, still confidential.  The

Government  is studying the impact of their  proposal

which  recommends that Singapore should consider  the

possibility  of  what  is  known  as  an  underground

transport service in Singapore. This matter  has  got

to  be studied because of the financial implications.

I will not disclose the exact figures, but it is more

than a few hundred million dollars. This means that I

will be competing with my colleague, the Minister for

Defence, who requires over $300 million per annum. So

I  do  not think Singapore, at this stage,  is  in  a

position  to  consider such a proposal,  but  we  are

studying the various aspects of this problem. At  the

present moment, I am afraid I am not able to say more

than  this,  because  the  Minister  for  Finance  is

looking into the economic implications of such a  proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Transport Advisory Board, it was

formed  in August 1968. The Chairman of the Board  is

my  Parliamentary  Secretary. I  believe  an  interim

report has been prepared, but I have not received  it

and I am again not in a position to inform the Member

for  Sembawang what those recommendations  would  be.

Perhaps  it  will be possible to do so  at  the  next

sitting  of  Parliament and I  hope  that  after  the

festive  season  we will be able to  settle  down  to

study seriously the proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that the number of accidents

and  deaths which occur on the roads in Singapore  is

on the high side, although there is a National Safety

First   Council   which  is  fairly  active,   having

instituted a number of road safety campaigns. It will

be  remembered  that a few days ago  the  Member  for

Katong  did  raise the same question and I  indicated

that the Ministry of Communications would institute a

sustained campaign for road safety next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang then went on to deal with

the problem of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



public  transport  in Singapore  and  mentioned  that

there  is  indeed  a  tremendous shortage  of  public

service  vehicles. Here again, I would  not  like  to

anticipate  what  the Transport Advisory  Board  will

recommend,  but I can endorse what the  Member  said,

that  there  is  a  shortage of such  public  service

vehicles. I understand that bus companies have placed

an  order for 150 new buses which they hope to put on

the  road by next year. As for taxis, there  are,  at

present, 3,800 taxis and not 4,000 taxis as stated by

the  Member.  This comes again within  the  terms  of

reference of the Transport Advisory Board. I  believe

there is a move afoot which will help to resolve this

problem,  although what it is I am not in a  position

to disclose today.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Sembawang has criticised the

collection of licence fees and so on in the  Registry

of Vehicles. There is congestion in Middle Road where

the  Registry has to deal with hundreds of  thousands

of  licence holders. It has been stated in this House

that  we  shall  be decentralising the collection  of

licence  fees for next year by making use of  the  40

odd  post  offices  which are  found  throughout  the

island.  We shall also be using an electric  computer

for this purpose. We do hope to see an improvement in

the situation next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of pirate taxis has again cropped up,

and  mention has been made of the Car Parks  Division

using more and more public roads for the purposes  of

car  parks  and the collection of fees  thereon.  The

problem  of  pirate taxis, however, comes within  the

province  of  the  Ministry of Defence  which  is  in

charge  of the Traffic Police. The Car Parks Division

comes  under the Ministry of National Development.  I

think the Member for Sembawang ended his speech  with

quite  a good suggestion that the Traffic Police  and

the  Car Parks Division should be transferred to  the

Ministry  of  Communications. I am very grateful  for

this  suggestion, but I prefer not to be saddled with

more departments than I can handle.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



It  is  true  that  it  will be easier  if  both  the

departments  are  consolidated into one.  However,  I

think  it is a suggestion which can be considered  by

the  two  Ministers concerned rather than for  me  to

agree  with  it. I would prefer that they keep  those

departments to themselves.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1051.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not only my personal experience but that

of  many travellers who pass through Paya Lebar Inter

national Airport that the handling of luggage is very

slow  indeed. There were occasions when it took about

45  minutes for passengers to get their bags from the

conveyor  belt. The few luggage porters who  happened

to be around adopted a couldn't-care-less attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the wake of our extensive campaign to woo

tourists and develop our tourist industry, I hope the

Minister  will look into this matter and improve  the

existing  facilities immediately. I am sure that  any

costs incurred in so doing will be very negligible as

compared  with the ever-increasing invisible earnings

that our economy will benefit by this industry



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I find it a little

difficult to answer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



the   sweeping  statement  made  by  the  Member  for

Havelock  that it is the general experience  of  most

people who arrive at Paya Lebar International Airport

that the handling of luggage is on the slow side - as

long as 45 minutes by conveyor belt. I think this can

happen  even  at the best of airports.  Sometimes,  a

passenger arrives at Airport A and finds that he will

not get his luggage because it has gone to Airport B.

It  will  then not be delayed for 45 minutes  but  45

days!  I  believe  one of our Members  of  Parliament

found  that he had no luggage when he arrived in  New

York and he was recompensed. Later on, he did get his

luggage  after having been recompensed by the airline

company concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unless the Member for Havelock is able to give me

specific  instances, it will be  very  difficult  not

only  for  me but also for the department to  try  to

investigate the problem and deal with it. But I  will

accept  his statement that it is possible that  these

incidents have taken place and that it should be  our

endeavour  to  give  satisfactory service,  not  only

because tourists are coming to Singapore, but because

this  service  is  also expected of  any  airport  or

airline company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, first of all, say that at the present moment

certain airlines are responsible for the handling  of

their  own luggage and that other airlines have asked

the  Department  of Civil Aviation  to  handle  their

luggage  for  a  fee. So if it is  possible  for  the

Member for Havelock to state which particular airline

was  at fault, then we can dig into the matter. I see

that  he  is  on  the  point  of  giving  me  certain

information, so I will sit down for him to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, the Minister can look into

the  handling  of  luggage by  porters  of  Malaysia-

Singapore Airlines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I would have preferred him to say

so  in the first place. Unfortunately, Malaysia-Singapore  Airlines,  which  is a  joint  enterprise  with

Malaysia, has been receiving a lot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



of complaints. I can say categorically that Malaysia-

Singapore   Airlines   is  at  the   present   moment

undergoing a stage of reorganisation right  from  the

top. We are now negotiating for the appointment of  a

new  General  Manager  and a Secretary.  Now  that  a

specific  complaint has been made, I can  assure  the

Member for Havelock that I will look further into his

complaint regarding the handling of luggage by M.S.A.

at  Paya Lebar Airport and I think I can put it right

in quick time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Minister wants more people to support the Member  for

Havelock, I wish to be the first to come forward.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On M.S.A.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> No, not on M.S.A, but on the

need  to  do  something about the  clearance  in  the

arrival  channels  at our airport.  I  have  personal

experience of not only leaving Singapore Airport  for

other countries, but also of making regular visits to

the  airport  to  receive  international  guests.  My

observations confirm the fact that there are signs of

congestion  and  delay in clearance  at  the  arrival

channels particularly during certain periods of heavy

air  traffic.  I  think sometimes the passengers  and

those  whom I receive do feel a bit irritated because

of  the  delay  in  clearance. This  is  quite  under

standable because after having travelled for 10 or 20

hours,  they  are extremely tired and therefore  they

need a quick clearance service so that they can go to

their  hotels as quickly as possible. I  do  not  say

that  the  arrival channels in our  airport  are  not

adequate to meet the present demands. There  must  be

certain occasions when there is a heavy flow  of  air

traffic. I am thinking in terms of the development of

our tourist trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the present flow of air traffic and

the  number  of passengers arriving at  the  airport.

there should be a considerable increase in the number

of passengers moving in and out of the airport. As  a

result,  we  see  signs of congestion  and  delay.  I

wonder



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



whether the situation will not be aggravated  to  the

extent  that it will become extremely intolerable.  I

admit  there  are  occasions when I feel  proud  that

Singapore has a very efficient airport. There was one

occasion in particular when I felt extremely proud of

our  airport  and  that  was  when  I  arrived  at  a

neighbouring   airport  where  the   facilities   and

conditions were atrocious. I said to myself  that  we

in  Singapore are living in heaven. Our airport is  a

place  where  we  even go to spend  our  recreational

hours  because  of  the  very  pleasant  surroundings

there. But I have reason to feel a little small  when

I compare the facilities in our airport with those of

other  international airports. I agree that we should

not  make a comparison because we are a small country

with limited resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, if we place emphasis on the

importance of air traffic, particularly in Singapore,

we  should  think in terms of making  our  airport  a

truly  international airport, even to the  extent  of

catering for the jumbo jets. We should also think  in

terms  of  cashing in on the tourist trade. One  very

important  factor  has  also to  be  considered.  Our

airport  facilities  should be in  keeping  with  the

standards  that  we  intend  to  set  for  our  hotel

industry,  taxi  service and shops, because  I  think

travellers are usually irritable after a long flight.

Sometimes  the four arrival channels in  our  airport

cannot  meet  the  demands of a  heavy  flow  of  air

traffic,  and  I  see a need for an increase  in  the

number  of  arrival  channels  in  the  near  future.

Similarly,  there is a need for quicker clearance  of

the passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Minister for Communications should look into these essential matters, not so much in terms of meeting the present intolerable position but of meeting a position that will arrive in the very near future. I am beginning to see signs of strain at the airport with the number

of passengers coming in and going out. We should take

heed  of  these signs and take the necessary remedial

measures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am glad that the Member for

Moulmein  has come out in full support of the  Member

for  Havelock, that it was his experience  also  that

there  is delay in the clearance not only of  luggage

but  also of passengers at our airport. But in saying

so  he  did  mention  that this happens  only  during

certain hours. That is the peculiar situation  of  an

airport.  At our airport, more planes would  land  or

take  off  during certain hours of the day  or  night

than  at  other  times. Especially between  8.00  and 11.00  a.m,

and from 4.00 to 9.00 p.m., more  planes

would come in or take off. It is during these periods

that one gets the impression of congestion and delay.

Whereas  if  a  plane lands or takes off  during  the

other hours, it is very simple for passengers to pass

through the various gates and go straight on  to  the

aircraft. These are problems which have to  be  faced

not  only in this airport but also airports all  over

the  world.  For some curious reason, passengers  who

travel by air like to choose a convenient hour.  Most

airlines  try  to  oblige passengers and,  therefore,

they  get  more  passengers if they  take  off, say,

around  eight  in the morning so that the  passengers

need not have to wake up at five in the morning, have

a  quick  shave  and  rush  to  the  airport, it  is

possible,  therefore, for a particular  passenger  to

proceed  to  the  airport as if he is  attending  his

office.  He  has his breakfast, reads his  newspapers

and then turns up at the airport at a very convenient

hour, which is about eight o'clock in the morning. So

every  airline will try to take off their  planes  at

about  the same period; that is, at 8.00, 8.15, 8.30,

9.00  or  9.15 in the morning. Or when the passengers

leave the other side of the world and come here - if,

for  example, it is an overnight flight -they  prefer

to  arrive  here at a convenient hour in the  evening

before  taking off. So these are problems created  by

the  airlines themselves, because they  all  want  to

crowd  into what are known as popular periods.  Hence

the congestion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that we are planning for the

future. In fact, we do know that the jumbo jets  will

be  using  Singapore Airport in 1971. The  Australian

Airline,  Qantas, has placed orders for a  few  jumbo

jets.  Survey  teams  have  come  to  Singapore   for

discussions.  They  intend to start  a  service  from

Sydney  to  London. The plane will stop at  Singapore

and  Bahrain before going on to London, it  is  true

that if a jumbo jet lands at Singapore and if all the

passengers  disembark, they can easily  fill  up  one

hotel.  Although a jumbo jet can hold 490 passengers,

travelling  economy class, most airlines  will  carry

only 360 passengers, because they will have about  50

passengers, first-class and the remaining 310 will be

passengers travelling economy class. Yet we will have

quite  a  problem to process 360 passengers once  the

plane  lands.  This is a problem which is  exercising

not  only  our  minds  but also the  minds  of  other

airports which are likely to handle jumbo jets. It is

because of this that we have frozen certain plans for

extensions to the Paya Lebar Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before yesterday, the Member for Serangoon

Gardens  asked what steps were being taken to develop

our  airport for the future. I indicated in my  reply

that  we  had employed a firm of consultants to  look

into  the expansion plans of our airport up to  1990.

For  the time being, although we have plans to extend

the   facilities   at   the  airport   for   handling

passengers,  cargoes  and so on,  we  have  found  it

necessary  to  freeze  the  plans  till  we  get   an

assessment  from  this firm of consultants.  We  hope

that  when  this report is ready sometime next  year,

Government  will  be  able to  make  firm  plans  for

extensions  or  make provision for  facilities  which

will assist in easing the so-called congestion at the

airport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank

do  not  know  the  problem  faced  by  the  ordinary

traveller. The Minister has asked me to be  specific.

All I have to say is that if he would delegate one of

his officials or his Parliamentary Secretary to go to

the  airport, he would see that the luggage clearance

is  slow.  Of  course, the loss of  a  baggage  could

happen  even in the best of airports. Even in  Tokyo,

the  busiest airport in Asia, it took us no less than

20  minutes  to  have our luggage  cleared.  When  we

compare  standards, Sir, I take it  that  we  compare

ours with only the best and not with those which  are

not  up  to  our  standards.  Sir,  in  view  of  the

Minister's assurances to look into this matter ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, before you ask for leave to

withdraw your amendment, may I ask the Minister if he

wants to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I think I should reply to

the Member for Have-lock. There is plenty of time  to

do  so.  The guillotine is a long way off. I think  I

had  better give the Member for Havelock his  money's

worth!  I  agree  with  him that  we  should  compare

ourselves  with the best available and not  take  the

poor  services  of  other  airports  as  a  basis  of

comparison.  That is why we do not have to  say  that

because  we  are  wooing tourists, we must  therefore

improve  our  airport service. I  think  our  service

should be good even without the tourists. That is the

test, and our staff at the airport should be made  to

realise  what we expect them to do. I agree with  the

Member  for  Havelock, too, that I go to  the  V.I.P.

lounge or room, but he must not assume that I am  not

aware  of the situation. When I visit the airport  in

the  course of my duties, I do go to rooms other than

the V.I.P, lounge. Of course, the staff may have been

alerted to put things right when I am around.  But  I

can  assure the Member for Havelock that I  generally

ask  to see things that are not arranged. It is  only

on  specific complaints, rather than, on just a  wide

sweeping statement, that I can look into the  matter.

I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



not have to send one of my officials to accompany the

Member  for  Have-lock there, since  he  has  already

stated  the sources of his grievance. I can say  that

in   my  overall  supervision  of  Malaysia-Singapore

Airlines,  this  is  an aspect of  the  work  at  the

airport  which  I  will  now  follow  with  assiduous

persistence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, I withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0803 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1081.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns the Airport Fire Officer and the

Airport  services.  I  have been  informed  that  the

Airport fire station, as it is now sited, is in a dis

advantageous position in that it does not  command  a

panoramic  view  of the runway. With  the  impressive

lengthening of the runway which is to come  about  to

take  in such huge aircraft as the jumbo jets, I  can

well  imagine that the present disadvantage  will  be

enhanced.  Since this is a matter which concerns  the

security of passengers, I hope it will be attended to

in  detail, lf this is the fact of the case - I  have

reason  to believe that it is so - I will be  obliged

if  the  Minister will assure the House that he  will

look into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

assure  the  Member for Serangoon  Gardens  that  the

siting of this particular fire station is not Out  of

the  way but is in a central position. I visited  the

runway of the airfield and I know exactly where it is

located. They gave me an exhibition of how they would

tackle  a  fire  in  case it  breaks  out.  With  the

extended  runway, the extra 2,000 feet -  the  runway

has  been  extended from 9,000 to 11,000  feet  -  is

quite  close  to  the fire station  at  the  Airport.

Unless the Member's information is not quite right, I

can assure him that even with the arrival



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



of the jumbo jets, the fire station is quite in order

where  it  is.  Of  course,  what  we  need  is  more

equipment  so that in case of a catastrophe  we  will

have  more  fire  engines  and  so  on  to  meet  the

situation. In this connection, my reply to the Member

for  Serangoon  Gardens yesterday  was  that  we  had

ordered  a high capacity foam tender which should  be

available very soon to augment the equipment we  have

at the present time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have brought the

matter  to the attention of the Minister as a  result

of  a  discourse  which  I had  with  a  professional

source. The opinion is that it is preferable to  have

the  siting of the fire station on the other side  of

the  runway - on some high ground - which would  enable

it  to  command a thorough and comprehensive view  of

the  runway. As the fire fighting unit is at  present

sited,  it  is  on  the  near side  of  the  terminal

building.  In  the view of the fire officers  in  the

unit, the intended extension of the terminal building

might perhaps cause a blockage.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, since the Member for

Serangoon  Gardens has asserted that  he  understands

from  a  reliable source that the site  of  the  fire

station  is not in an ideal position. I want  to  say

that  my  brief  coming from the  Director  of  Civil

Aviation - unless he does not know his job - is  that

the  existing site of the fire station is  a  central

one where attendance to any part of the runway can be

made  in the shortest possible time. I have also been

to   that  particular  fire  station.  The  point  is

probably one of perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He did not know it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> May I say that even if we wish to

make a change in the site, we are freezing it pending

a  report  from  the  firm of  consultants  which  is

looking into the possibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



of having a second runway. There is now one runway in

Paya  Lebar Airport. It may be necessary to  build  a

second  runway, if the second runway is  built,  this

particular  fire station will be right in the  middle

of  the two runways. The Member thinks that the  fire

station  is  a little out of place, and I  say  that,

from  the  brief obtained from my top civil  aviation

official, it is in a central position. We can  go  on

arguing  about this. But can we just wait  until  the

firm of consultants has decided on how the airport is

to  be  expanded and then perhaps a new fire  station

may  be  built,  or it could be just  that  the  fire

station will have an extra tower built on top of  the

present  building? I do not know. Perhaps it is  best

to leave it at that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, that will satisfy me and I beg

leave to withdraw the amendment. But in doing so  and

in order to satisfy the non-participant in the debate

who said perhaps I did not know this myself, this was

confirmed by my visit to the airport for purposes  of

recreation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0803 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1245.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns good conduct allowance for

constables, and what moves me to make this  amendment

is the unusual nature of this allowance. I would have

thought   that  constables,  security   officers   or

whatever  personnel are entitled  to  this  allowance

would  be  expected to show good conduct.  I  do  not

think  there  should be incentives for them  to  show

good  conduct  and receive monetary  benefit  for  so

showing. Perhaps the Minister will explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I agree with the Member for

Serangoon  Gardens that we expect good  conduct  from

our  officers  and, therefore, an allowance  of  this

nature  is probably not necessary. I understand  that

the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



regulations  permit the payment  of  a  good  conduct

allowance if the officials justify such payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulation 12 of the Auxiliary Police Singapore

Airport  Regulations, 1964, provides that members  of

the Singapore Airport Auxiliary Police Force shall be

eligible for the same allowances subject to the  same

conditions  as are payable to members  of  the  Polis

Repoblik  Singapura  who  are  of  equivalent   rank.

Perhaps  my colleague, the Minister for Defence  will

probably  want  to  look into the matter.  The  Polis

Repoblik Singapura pays its personnel up to the  rank

of  sergeant a good conduct allowance of $3 per month

for every three years' service up to a maximum of $21

per month. It is a question of a precedent being set.

Somebody  does  it and the others ask  for  the  same

privileges.  Hence provision has  been  made  in  the

Department  of Civil Aviation's vote for the  payment

of this allowance to members of the Singapore Airport

Auxiliary Police Force of equivalent rank who qualify

for this allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more little comment which unfortunately

is  not  too  good.  To  date,  no  payment  of  this

allowance  has  been made. No Airport police  officer

has qualified for it. Too bad!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

But  in  so doing, it appears that this discreditable

source is now located in the Ministry of the Interior

and Defence.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo, if you look at subhead

1687 on page 254, in the Estimates you will find  the

corresponding item under Police personal emoluments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Yes, Sir. In fact, I got that marked

down here also. But I did not send in an amendment to

that subhead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the source must be located somewhere. I think

now   that  the  matter  has  been  raised,   perhaps

appropriate   attention  could  be   paid   in   that

direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,042,410 for Head 0803 ordered to stand

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0805 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead I 0{) 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to know from the Minister how many

vacancies  for clerks and postmen for 1968  have  not

been  filled and the reasons for not filling all  the

vacancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to know whether the recruitment of

additional  staff  as provided in the  Estimates  for

1969  will  be  carried out next year;  and,  if  so,

around  which  part  of the year does  he  intend  to

initiate the recruitment exercise?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may be aware that the Postal Department

have  to  deal with parcel bags and mail  bags  which

have been stored in the holds of ships and which  are

usually  very  dusty.  The  post  offices  are   also

frequented  by the public and tourists. I  understand

that the standard practice is to whitewash Government

buildings once every five years. In the light of  the

above,  may I know from the Minister whether he  will

consider whitewashing post office buildings  once  in

three years instead?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the

Member  for Anson has asked questions which  are  too

much  in detail for me to be able to provide him with

answers;  for  instance,  questions  like  how   many

vacancies are to be filled and so on. I can only  say

that  there  are  a few vacancies for  postal  clerks

(timescale) and postmen (timescale) to be filled  and

that  all  these vacancies are being filled  by  mass

recruitment through the Public Service Commission. It

is  a case of how quickly we can chase the P.S.C, to

get  on with the job. I presume that it will be  done

as  soon  as possible and the vacancies will then  be

filled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's other question about the

dustiness of the Parcel Bags



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



Division in the General Post Office, this is a matter

which  I  noticed  when I visited  the  General  Post

Office during the course of my duties and I found, to

my  horror,  that  some of the  ventilation  ducts  -

suction pumps - had gone out of order and nothing had

been  done. I am glad to say that this has  been  put

right. It has also been agreed with the Public  Works

Department to get a few more suction pumps to improve

the situation for next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whitewashing of post offices, I

think  it is a general rule that Government buildings

will  get  a  new coat of paint every five  years.  I

agree  with  the Member for Anson that it  should  be

made  every  three years; in fact, as  and  when  the

buildings  get dirty. I have seen some  post  offices

which  are very dirty and should be cleaned up.  What

with the present "Keep Singapore Clean" campaign, the

roads  are  probably looking cleaner  than  the  post

offices!  But  it  is not what we want.  It  is  what

Treasury  is able to provide funds for. That  is  our

difficulty, in view of the fact that the  Member  for

Anson  has  raised this point, I shall  ask  my  Post

master-General to make a strong plea for the  dirtier

post   offices  to  get  more  frequent  whitewashing

instead  of  waiting  for the five-year  periodbefore

they do get a spring cleaning.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I agree with the

Minister's  statement.  But  he  should   insist   on

Treasury  to  provide  funds  for  whitewashing  post

offices once in three years, because post offices are

frequented by the public and should not be treated on

the  same  basis  as other Government buildings.  The

Postal   Department   is  the  dirtiest   department.

Therefore,  we  must  clean it every  now  and  then.

Otherwise  the  people working in the department  may

get  T.B. I urge the Minister to put up a strong case

to Treasury for the whitewashing of post offices once

in three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that it was in January 1966 that the

Government took over Cable and Wireless Limited.  The

integration  exercise has since been in  progress.  I

wonder whether the Minister will inform the House  of

the  progress made so far in the integration exercise

and, particularly, I shall be pleased if the Minister

will answer the following queries:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Is it not true that there are undue delays in

the  integration exercise? If so, what are the causes

of the delay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is it not true that the union representing the

workers in the Telecommunications Department has been

refused    permission    by    the    Director     of

Telecommunications to be present even as observers in

such  integration exercise on the flimsy excuse  that

the discussions do not concern them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Is it not true that offers have been made to the

staff who were former employees of Cable and Wireless

Limited  that  might put the staff  of  the  original

Telecommunications Department in a very  unfavourable

position?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In view of the foregoing, can the Minister say

that  he  is satisfied that the integration talks  do

not  concern  members  of  the  Singapore  Government

Technical  Services Union and, therefore,  they  need

not be represented at such talks?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Can the Minister say when this integration

exercise will be completed and whether delays in this

exercise have caused any loss to public funds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I hope the Member for Toa

Payoh  does  not expect me to be a magician  who  can

anticipate  what he has asked and to  give  him  full

answers. I will try my best, although the query is on

the   personal   emoluments  of   the   Director   of

Telecommunications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable and Wireless Limited was taken over by the

Government in January 1966 and I came on the scene in

April 1968. During the last eight months I have  been

slowly  trying  to  pick up the threads.  I  have  to

answer  to  the best of my ability the five questions

put by the Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, whether there has been any undue delay in the

integration  of  Cable and Wireless  staff  with  the

Telecommunications   Department.   Speaking   as   an

individual,  I think there has been a  lot  of  delay

because  it  has been going on for almost two  years.

There   might   have   been   difficulties   in   the

negotiations, but I do not think I am in  a  position

to comment favourably or unfavourably on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's next question is about the union and

although  he did not mention its name, I believe  the

union  that  he has in mind is the Telecommunications

Technicians   Union.  There  are  two   unions:   one

represents ex-Cable and Wireless staff known  as  the

Singapore Telecommunications Workers' Union, and  the

other is a smaller union which represents workers  in

the   Telecommunications  Department  in   Government

service. When the Member makes the statement that the

Telecommunications Technicians Union has been refused

attendance  at  the negotiations, I presume  what  he

says must be correct, otherwise he will not have  put

this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the staff of the original

Telecommunications   Department   are   put   in   an

unfavourable position as a result of the integration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



of   former  Cable  and  Wireless  employees  in  the

Telecommunications Department. I think  the  exercise

is  really how to integrate Cable and Wireless  Union

staff  into Government service. They were part  of  a

commercial organisation, and when the Government paid

$10  million  to take over the assets and liabilities

of Cable and Wireless Ltd., they had to look into the

question  of integrating 500 staff in Cable and  Wire

less  into Government service. I do not think  anyone

should suffer as a result of the take-over. The delay

in  the  discussions and negotiations must be due  to

the difficulty in marrying the terms of service in  a

commercial organisation with the terms of service  in

a  Government institution. This has been going on for

the   last  two  years.  The  Member's  question   of

integration  and  its effect on those  in  Government

service who are members of the Technicians Union are,

I  am  afraid,  part of the cause  of  the  so-called

unhappiness of those in Government service at  seeing

people  who  are  probably getting better  pay  in  a

commercial  organisation coming into  the  Government

service  and having to learn how to adjust themselves

in this situation. I understand that the negotiations

for  the integration of the 500 staff from the former

Cable and Wireless into Government service are almost

completed except for very minor matters like hours of

work  and  so forth. I would hate to pass comment  at

this  stage  when the negotiations are  about  to  be

completed  on  how to resolve the little difficulties

which are to be found in all negotiations. Nobody  is

ever happy about his salary scale. Even those who get

an increment complain that they deserve more. This is

part and parcel of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the matter can be resolved provided the

Ministry  of  Finance will relent  in  its  attitude,

because  in  all  these negotiations, representatives

from  the Ministry of Finance will be there to ensure

that a fair deal is given to the new employees. I  do

not think I can go further than that.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, I would like to talk about the horns of

motor  vehicles.  I think the horn is  used  to  warn

pedestrians but, at present, we can hear  the  sounds

of  multi-tone horns and we do not know  whether  the

children  are meddling with the horns or whether  the

sound actually comes from the car. Some horns produce

a  sound like that of a dog barking, some sound  like

music  and some even produce the sounds of the  siren

of  an  ambulance, a fire engine or a  police  patrol

car.  I  do  not  know whether such horns  have  been

approved  by  the Registry of Vehicles. I  am  afraid

that  if  the horns in use on motor vehicles are  not

standardised,  then  it will  not  be  safe  for  the

pedestrians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about the obnoxious smoke emitted

by  motor  vehicles. I understand that such smoke  is

dangerous  and  harmful  to  health.  It  is  usually

emitted  from public vehicles and sometimes  also  by

private  cars. What measures have been taken  by  the

Registry of Vehicles to deal with it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about the cleanliness in public

buses. It seems that less attention is being paid  to

this  matter  and most of the buses are  very  dirty,

both inside and outside. They are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



properly washed. The Registry of Vehicles should take

steps to improve this situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the point  I  wish  to  raise

concerns  the auction of old vehicles confiscated  by

the   Government.  During  the  auctions,  many  old,

dilapidated and unserviceable vehicles are sold. As a

result,  the  public have been able to  buy  some  of

these vehicles at the lowest possible price and  they

can  use  them  as  pirate taxis. We  therefore  very

frequently see such pirate taxis on the road. So  the

measures taken against pirate taxis are more or  less

offset  by the auction of confiscated vehicles  which

are eventually put back on the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether in future

auctions   of   confiscated   vehicles,   all   those

unserviceable  vehicles will be condemned,  and  what

steps will be taken to ensure that auctioned vehicles

will not be used as pirate taxis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I would like to take the opportunity to ask  the

Minister   whether   he  will  consider   introducing

legislation requiring all vehicles that have been  on

the  road  for,  say, 10 years, to  undergo  a  road-

worthiness  test annually. I am quite  sure  a  great

number  of  accidents are caused  by  faulty  brakes,

steering   and   poor  mechanical  maintenance.   The

breakdown  of  such vehicles very often  causes  road

congestion. I think this is one aspect into which  we

should look.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> In reply to the Member for Delta,

I  would like to say that it is an offence to install

what  are  known as multi-tone horns. It will  be  of

great  assistance  if those who do come  across  such

cases are able to report



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



the registration numbers of the vehicles concerned to

the  Registry  of Vehicles so that a summons  can  be

issued to the owners of such vehicles and action  can

be taken against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that the owners of 388 vehicles were

summoned   by  the  Registry  of  Vehicles   for   an

inspection of their cars from January to November  of

this  year and that 203 cases were compounded by  the

Traffic  Police  for $20 each. So the  implementation

falls  on another Ministry - the Ministry of Defence.

It  is felt that perhaps this fine of $20 is much too

lenient  and  that consideration can be given  to  an

increase in the fine in the future. However, this  is

a  matter which will have to be left in the hands  of

my colleague, the Minister for Defence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> The

Minister for Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is now up to the Minister for

Law  to  consider whether a higher fine will be  more

effective  to  deter  musical-minded  motorists  from

installing multi-tone horns in their cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies to vehicles which emit exhaust

smoke.  May  I  say that they are largely  cars  with

diesel  engines.  This  is a  fairly  serious  matter

because,  from  the  health point  of  view,  unburnt

petrol  gas is known to be carcinogenic, which  means

that it can help to produce cancer in the lungs.  The

campaign  against vehicles which emit  exhaust  smoke

commenced  in  April 1967, it may be of  interest  to

Members  of  this  House  that  5,337  vehicles  were

summoned  to the Registry of Vehicles for  mechanical

inspection during the last II months of this year. Of

this  number,  3,848  cases were  compounded  by  the

Traffic  Police,  again at a cost  of  $20  each.  So

perhaps  if the fine is raised to $200 each,  we  may

see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>





a  reduction  in  the  number of  cars  going  around

emitting  exhaust smoke. In the present  regulations,

there  is  a section which says that the penalty  for

the  first offence is a fine not exceeding $400,  and

for  a  second  or  subsequent offences  a  fine  not

exceeding  $1,000  or imprisonment  for  a  term  not

exceeding  three months. So I think we  already  have

rather heavy penalties in the law. I think I will try

to  persuade my colleague, the Minister for  Defence,

to  be  a little hard on his Traffic Police and order

them  not  to agree to compound an offence  for  just

$20.  There  is this harsh regulation  which  can  be

applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the buses are not looking as clean as

they  should.  Unfortunately, even  after  the  "Keep

Singapore  Clean" campaign - I think the Ministry  of

Communications  has  given its full  support  to  the

Ministry  of Health in this regard - there  are  some

buses  which are very unclean and therefore the atten

tion of the bus companies should be drawn to the fact

that  they are expected to keep their buses clean.  I

will instruct the Registrar of Vehicles to issue  the

notices accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru spoke on a subject which

more  or less moves away from the Ministry of Communi

cations  to  another Ministry - the  confiscation  of

vehicles which are presumed to be pirate taxis. Until

very  recently, the seizure of pirate taxis could  be

done  by  the  police  -  and that  comes  under  the

Ministry of Defence! But we have asked for powers  to

seize such vehicles next year. For the time being, in

view  of  the Member's question, I will say  that  as

this matter is in the hands of the police, it will be

left  to the Ministry of the Interior and Defence  to

deal  with.  It  would  appear that  all  confiscated

vehicles are auctioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> By the Ministry of Defence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it looks as if it goes round

and  round - once it is not in our hands, it goes  to

somebody



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



else and it ends up by becoming a problem. I do agree

that  steps should be taken to see that old  vehicles

should  not be auctioned but should be condemned  and

sold  as scrap iron to National Iron and Steel  Mills

Ltd.  It  is useless to auction ramshackle  cars  for

just  a  few hundred dollars and then overnight  they

appear  on the road as pirate taxis awaiting  capture

again for the second and third time. I myself support

the  proposal of the Member for Tiong Bahru that this

matter  be given serious consideration. This ties  up

with the suggestion of the Member for Jalan Kayu that

steps should be taken to consider the possibility  of

not permitting motor vehicles which are more than ten

years  old to be on the road. I think this suggestion

has merit except that those who are in possession  of

cars  which  are more than ten years old may  include

some Members of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I did not suggest that we condemn

old cars. I suggest that old cars should pass a road-

worthiness test once a year. If they do not pass such

a test, they should be condemned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful

to the Member for Jalan Kayu for his clarification. I

thought he had suggested something stiffer on which I

was  going to support him. Now he prefers to  be  lax

and  so  I  shall  not be hard. I will  consider  his

suggestion  for possible implementation  as  soon  as

possible,  that  all cars which  are  ten  years  old

should  be  subjected to a road-worthiness  test  and

that  those  cars  which fail the test  will  not  be

permitted to be on the road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  raise  some points on safety  measures  for

haulage vehicles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not an uncommon sight nowadays to see goods-

carrying vehicles flouting safety regulations with im

punity.  For  instance, take the lorries that  convey

materials such as steel rods, concrete beams and  oil

drums  along the public roads. Some of these concrete

beams and steel rods are nearly twice as long as  the

lorry  itself.  I  am  sure that this  constitutes  a

safety  hazard.  There  are also  vehicles  that  are

licensed  to  carry  goods up to a  certain  tonnage,

depending  on  the size and capacity of the  vehicle.

Some   of   the  transport  contractors  have   taken

advantage of this regulation and they pile  up  goods

several  feet high on their lorries. To make  matters

worse,  the  attendants sit on top of the goods.  Two

months  ago,  in Jurong, I noticed a lorry  conveying

four  large  crates of knocked-down car  units  which

were  not  secured  with rope, and while  rounding  a

circus,  one of the crates fell on the road.  It  was

fortunate that there were no vehicles around at  that

time,  otherwise it could have caused a very  serious

accident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor contributing to accidents is the

traffic-indicators on lorries and buses. Many lorries

--particularly earth-carrying lorries -  are  covered

with  mud and some of them have no lenses. So no  one

will  know whether the lights are red or white. There

is  also the position of the indicators. Some of them

are  hidden  below the rear fenders of the  vehicles.

They  are very difficult to see until one is two feet

away from the vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that the Ministry look into this

matter  and  ensure that goods of exceptional  length

are  conveyed in trailers, unless the vehicle so used

is  of sufficient length to accommodate at least two-

thirds of the length of such materials.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am grateful to the Member for

Toa Payoh for his suggestions to improve road safety.

He has spoken on certain road hazards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



such  as lorries carrying steel rods which are twice

the length of the lorry itself, lorries

carrying  numerous drums which are not  secured  with

rope, and lorries laden with goods

which  are  very  much heavier  than  what  they  are

licensed  to  carry. I think these are matters  which

impinge on certain technicalities and I am not  in  a

position  to  answer them straight off.  But  I  will

bring them up to the correct authority who will  look

into the matter. It can be the Registrar of Vehicles.

It can be the -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Ministry of Defence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I myself do not know where it

ends  up.  Sometimes it is the Ministry  of  Defence;

sometimes it is my Ministry and sometimes it  is  the

P.W.D.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is quite a common occurrence to see

attendants sitting on top of lorries ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> They are acrobats!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is not an acrobatic matter.

Unfortunately,  if there are some overhanging  trees,

the poor attendants will be swept off the lorries and

they  will  end  up  in  the emergency  ward  of  the

hospital!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think traffic indicators and their positions are

technical  matters  which are probably  being  looked

after  by my Registry of Vehicles. If it is so,  they

will  certainly look into the matter further.  I  can

assure  the Member - as promised yesterday - that  it

is the intention of the Ministry of Communications to

institute   a  campaign  on  road  safety   and   the

observance of traffic regulations, etc, next year. We

hope  to be able to improve the situation and to draw

the attention of members of the public to the dangers

which now prevail on our roads.

satisfied with the Minister's reply. I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,712,990 for Head 0807 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I go on to the next head, may I

just  refer  to  one matter which  the  Minister  for

Communications  raised. I do not think  it  is  quite

fair  for Members to expect accurate and satisfactory

answers on matters of minute detail in the discussion

of  the  Estimates.  So  for  the  remainder  of  the

Estimates, I hope they will bear that in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr

Ch'ng Jit Koon, Mr Lim Cheng Lock and Madam Chan

Choy Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon and Mr Lim Cheng Lock have indicated to me they are

not moving this amendment. Madam Chan Choy Siong.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, the Ministry of Defence is the most important establishment in a country. It is in charge of national defence and the security of the people. When Singapore achieved its independence, a Ministry of Defence was set up. Since then it has achieved much in the direction of

national defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very short time, however, this Ministry will

have to face an even more onerous task. From 1969  up

till  1971,  there  will be a  phased  withdrawal  of

British  military troops from Singapore. Within  this

short space of time the Ministry of Defence will have

to tackle all the problems relating to the security



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



of our people and the defence of our country. I would

like to ask the Minister for Defence these questions.

When  the British troops are completely withdrawn  in

the  l970s, will concrete measures be taken  to  fill

the   vacuum   created   by  the   British   military

withdrawal?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this. At present countries like

Australia  and New Zealand are also assisting  us  in

our defence. I would like to ask the Minister whether

Australian troops will be stationed in Singapore  for

a long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. In view of the British

military withdrawal from Singapore, will the national

service  scheme envisage a reduction in  the  age  of

recruits? If so, this should also apply to  women.  I

understand that at present there is a women's defence

force  serving under the Ministry of Defence. I would

like  to know whether it is intended to increase  the

strength  of this women's defence force. If so,  what

will  be the conditions of service? Will they be  the

same as those of the men?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When I asked a

question  for oral answer, I was given to  understand

that  we  are going to celebrate the sesquicentennial

of  Singapore. But there is no provision for such  an

occasion. Provision for celebrations of this  nature,

for   example,  the  National  Day  celebration,   is

normally   entered  under  Head  0901   for   defence

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister why there is no

provision under this head for the celebration of  the

150th anniversary of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I remember I

raised  a  question  on the People's  Defence  Force.

Everyone  of the members of this force received  only

one set of uniform. Even at the moment they have only

one set of uniform. The second point is that they are

not  given  a transport allowance, whereas  Vigilante

Corps members do receive it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the

attention of the Minister to a trend that is  perhaps

relevant  to  this  subject.  I  am  not  making   an

allegation  or accusation of any sort, because  I  do

understand that it will be largely conjecture  on  my

part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is quite aware of the fact that there is written into our Constitution a provision that an accused who is apprehended or arrested can be detained for only 24 hours in a police station, after which he must be brought before the court except for certain exceptional circumstances, for instance, when

an  accused  is arrested on a Saturday. At  the  same

time,  we  have detention laws in our country.  These

detention  laws  are exceptional laws,  because  they

empower   the   authorities  to   detain   a   person

apprehended without trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did submit a question to the Minister to answer in

respect of the number of detentions. I found  that  a

substantial number of persons who were detained under

the  detention laws were subsequently charged  before

the  court. The Minister is aware that if the  police

authorities  proceed under the detention  laws,  they

would  be empowered to detain the persons apprehended

beyond 24 hours. Of course, if this tendency is real,

then  there  is  an evasion of an important  constitu

tional  protection. By making use  of  the  detention

laws,  the police authorities would be able to detain

the  apprehended person for more than  24  hours  and

then  subsequently have him charged before the court.

Constitutionally speaking, he ought  to  be  released

within  24  hours  if  he is not charged  before  the

court.  My  question to the Minister also did  reveal

that  in  a number of cases where detention was  made

under   the   Criminal  Law  (Temporary   Provisions)

Ordinance,  such  persons were  subsequently  charged

before the court.
