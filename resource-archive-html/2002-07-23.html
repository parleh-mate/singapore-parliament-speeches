<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs, with reference

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>

to  the meetings held in Kuala Lumpur on 1st and 2nd July

2002,  if  he  will  inform the House  of  the  state  of

progress of talks with Malaysia on the outstanding issues

as well as comment on the recent remarks by the Malaysian

Foreign  Minister on their proposed price of water  under

the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S.

Jayakumar):   Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome this opportunity

to  inform  the  House  of  the  state  of  play  in  our

negotiations  with  Malaysia after our  last  meeting  in

Putrajaya on 1st and 2nd July 2002.  It has been  a  long

road.  Our discussions on 1st and 2nd July were part of a

process  that  has been on-going at various levels  since

1998.   There have also been several exchanges of letters

setting out different proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not recap every last twist-and-turn of this

process.   There is still some way to go before we  reach

agreement.  So neither is it appropriate for me to reveal

every last detail of what is still being negotiated.  But

there   have  been  many  media  statements   about   the

negotiations  which  may  have resulted  in  some  public

confusion.   I  will  therefore try to  be  as  clear  as

possible where we are at this point of time.  I will also

set  out  clearly Singapore's consistent approach towards

the negotiations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our negotiations in Putrajaya in July were preceded

by  an exchange of letters at the highest level.  On  4th

March  2002, Prime Minister Mahathir wrote to us  setting

out  certain proposals.  These proposals were  completely

new and different from what had been discussed during the

meetings  between Senior Minister Lee  Kuan  Yew  and  Dr

Mahathir  in  September 2001.  On 11th April 2002,  Prime

Minister  Goh Chok Tong replied, setting out our  various

counter-proposals.  This exchange of letters  established

the basic framework for our discussions recently in July.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussions are on a package of issues. Prime

Minister Mahathir's letter of 4th March dealt with water,

railway, a proposed bridge to replace the Causeway,  CIQ,

CPF and airspace; Prime Minister

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>

Goh's reply of 11th April dealt with the same issues.  By

establishing  the  basic framework for our  negotiations,

this exchange of letters also defined the package.  By  a

package,   we   mean  that  nothing  is  resolved   until

everything  is resolved and that there can be  trade-offs

between  the  issues  to satisfy the  interests  of  both

parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on the specific issues which were

discussed during our meetings on 1st and 2nd July.

<br><br><i>Water</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three aspects to the water issue:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the observance of the existing Water

Agreements of 1961 and 1962.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the price of water supplied under possible

new  agreements  after the expiry of the  1961  and  1962

Agreements in 2011 and 2061 respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Malaysia's proposal to invoke the price

review clauses of the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with each of these aspects in turn.

Existing Agreements

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's consistent and firm position is, and

remains,  that  the  1961 and 1962 Water  Agreements  are

valid and legally binding agreements, enshrined under the

<br><br>1965&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separation  Agreement, and must be  honoured.   The

terms  of  the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements  cannot  be

unilaterally  changed.  This is a  fundamental  and  non-negotiable point.  Whether or not we agree on the  supply

of  water after the expiry of these two agreements  is  a

completely separate matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a formal statement on 1st July, the Malaysian

side assured us that Malaysia would "honour the 1961  and

<br><br>1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Agreements until their expiry in 2011 and 2061

respectively".  Malaysia was also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>

clear that it does not propose to amend the terms of  the

1961 and 1962 Agreements.  We welcome these assurances.

<br><br><i>New Agreements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th April 2002, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong

explained to this House why Singapore wants to reduce our

dependence  on Malaysian water. Prime Minister  Goh  said

that  it  was not healthy for our countries to be  always

locked in disputes over water and to allow this one issue

to   sour   bilateral  relations  and  prevent  us   from

cooperating in strategic areas of mutual benefit. By next

year,  our  Bedok and Kranji NEWater plants  will  be  in

operation.   By 2011, two more NEWater plants in  Seletar

and Ulu Pandan will be ready.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can allow the 1961 Agreement to lapse in 2011. It

is  within  our  means  to produce  sufficient  water  to

replace  the water from the 1961 Agreement.  However,  we

are  still prepared to buy some water from Malaysia after

the expiry of the 1961 Agreement.  But the price must  be

right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 2061, when the 1962 Agreement expires, it only

makes economic sense for us to continue to buy additional

water  from Malaysia, if the cost of that water  is  less

than  the water we can produce ourselves.  The price must

be competitive in relation to the cost of our alternative

sources of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent talks, we have briefed the Malaysians

about  our plans to develop alternative sources of  water

by increasing our catchment areas and through NEWater and

desalination.   The  Malaysians now have  understood  our

position.  They  agree that the price of  water  must  be

market-competitive.   But we have  yet  to  agree  on  an

acceptable basis for a competitive price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st July, the Malaysians proposed a price

formula.   On  2nd  July,  they told  us  they  are  also

considering  benchmarking the price, among other  things,

against  the China-Hong Kong model and other models.   We

have explained to the Malaysians why the China-Hong Kong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>

model is not relevant. But we will study their proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's proposal is that the price of any

treated  water  that we may buy from Malaysia  after  the

expiry of the current Agreements should be pegged  to  an

agreed  percentage  of Singapore's  cost  of  alternative

sources  of  water which is NEWater.  Such a formula  can

withstand  the  test of time.  Singapore  is  willing  to

disclose  independently audited accounts of our  cost  of

NEWater to work out the price mechanism.

<br><br><i>Price Review</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent negotiations, Malaysia informed us

that it wanted to invoke the price review clauses of  the

1961  and 1962 Water Agreements.  The 1961 and 1962 Water

Agreements do provide for a review after 25 years.  Under

the terms of these Agreements, if Malaysia wanted a price

review,  this  should have been undertaken  in  1986  and

1987.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is 15 to 16 years late, we have informed

the Malaysians that in the interest of making progress in

our  talks,  Singapore is prepared to consider Malaysia's

request  to invoke the price review clauses of  the  1961

and 1962 Agreements as part of the package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also stressed that any such review must be in

accordance  with the express provisions  of  the  clauses

contained  in  the  1961 and 1962 Water  Agreements.   In

particular:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the price review must be only on the basis of

factors explicitly mentioned in the clauses contained  in

the  1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.  In other words,  it

must  not be a re-negotiation of the existing agreements.

The  Malaysian side has agreed that any price review must

be   "consistent   with  the  provisions   of   the   two

Agreements."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as specified in the 1961 and 1962 Water

Agreements, the review must cover both the price  of  the

raw water supplied by Malaysia to Singapore and the price

of the treated water supplied by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  to  Malaysia.   The Malaysian  side  has  also

agreed to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the price review cannot be retroactive. If

we  agree  to it, it will take effect only from the  time

that  the revision is agreed upon.  This is in accordance

with  the provisions of the price review clauses  in  the

1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make a final point on the price of water to

clear  up  any  possible confusion.  In  September  2001,

there  was an in-principle agreement on the price  of  60

sen  per  thousand gallons for future raw  water,  to  be

reviewed  every five years for inflation, for  100  years

after the expiry of the 1962 Agreement in 2061.  Although

we  were not legally obliged to do so, we also offered to

pay  45  sen per thousand gallons for raw water currently

purchased  under the 1961/1962 Agreements as part  of  an

overall package deal that took into account our interests

on  other  issues in the package and the  concessions  we

were  making.  However, the Malaysians have now  advanced

completely  new  and  different proposals,  taking  their

earlier offer off the table.

<br><br><i>POA, KTM Station/Lands in Singapore and CIQ</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia informed us that it has decided to relocate

its rail CIQ from Tanjong Pagar back to Johor.  There was

no   substantial  discussion  on  this   or   the   joint

development of KTM lands in accordance with the  POA.   I

expect this to be taken up at the next meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consistent position is that the POA is a legally

binding  agreement and its provisions must  be  observed.

Under  the  POA, the KTM station is to move from  Tanjong

Pagar  to  Bukit Timah.  However, as part of the package,

as I have told the House before, Singapore is prepared to

vary the POA to allow the KTM station to shift to Kranji,

which  the  Malaysians  had  requested,  and  to  include

additional  railway  lands for 60-40% joint  development.

These  are concessions which Singapore will make only  as

part of the package.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our negotiations in July, the Malaysian side

assured  us  that  Malaysia is not  disputing  the  legal

validity  of the POA.  Singapore welcomes this assurance.

But  as  part of the package discussions, Malaysia wanted

Singapore to agree to include more KTM lands.

<br><br><i>Bridge</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also discussed Malaysia's proposal to replace the

Causeway with a road bridge.  Malaysia briefed us on  its

proposal.   The Malaysians told us that their  preference

was  for  a  full bridge, but if there was no  agreement,

they will proceed with a half bridge on their side of the

Causeway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We informed the Malaysians that Singapore sees no

compelling  need  to  replace the  Causeway.   But  since

Malaysia  is  eager to replace the Causeway  with  a  new

bridge,  we  are prepared to consider jointly building  a

new  bridge  as  part  of  the package.   Many  important

details  have  yet  to  be worked  out,  among  them  the

location of the waterway and the clearance height for the

passage  of  vessels  and so on.  We  will  continue  our

discussion  on the bridge at the next meeting.   We  said

that  we  can  also go along with Malaysia's proposal  to

build  a railway swing bridge but on this too, there  are

details to be sorted out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many media reports that Malaysia

does  not  consider  its proposal for  a  new  bridge  to

replace the Causeway as part of the package and wants  it

discussed separately.  Let me say that Singapore has made

it  clear that the bridge will be considered only as part

of the package because:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Dr Mahathir's letter of 4th March 2002

clearly set out the proposal for a bridge as one  of  the

issues in the package; so did Prime Minister Goh's  reply

of 11th April 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we see no compelling reason to replace the

Causeway with a new bridge.  Building our side of  a  new

bridge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>

will  cost  a lot of money. It makes no sense for  us  to

incur  this significant expenditure if the bridge is  not

part   of  the  package.   Singapore  can  justify   this

expenditure  only  if  there is agreement  on  the  other

issues in the package.

<br><br><i>Airspace and CPF</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues were not discussed in detail at the

last  round. We will continue our discussions on airspace

and CPF at the next meeting.

<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may conclude by alluding to what Dr Ong Chit

Chung also asked about various press comments.  After the

1st  to  2nd July negotiations, there has indeed  been  a

flurry  of comments based on often inaccurate reports  in

the  Malaysian  media.  Some have said  the  ball  is  in

Singapore's   court  and  accused   us   of   being   the

unreasonable  party.  This is part of a familiar  pattern

to make us appear in the wrong with their people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not be confused by such reports. As I

said in this House before on 16th May 2002, such comments

constitute  a  form of psy-war to weaken our  morale  and

soften  our  position on matters under  negotiation.   We

will  calmly and politely state the facts and  have  them

stand  the test of time, when truth will out.  We  should

only   pay   serious  attention  to  what  the  Malaysian

government  had  said during the actual negotiations  and

the proposals they had presented on the record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to approach the talks

constructively so that both countries can reach a win-win

solution  on  the  package of issues.   There  is  really

nothing to be gained by negotiating through the media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told my colleague, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid,

and his delegation, Singapore is making concessions which

we  are  not legally obliged to do.  We are not  obliged,

for  example, to agree to their bridge proposal;  we  are

not obliged to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>

agree  to  any variation to the POA; and we are also  not

obliged  to allow premature withdrawals of CPF monies  by

West  Malaysian  workers.  Likewise,  we  recognise  that

Malaysia is not legally obliged to supply water after the

1961 and 1962 Agreements expire.  Nor is Malaysia legally

obliged to restore the use of airspace for the RSAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for a deal to be reached, clearly, there

has  to  be  give and take.  This is why I emphasised  to

Foreign  Minister Syed Hamid that all the issues have  to

be  considered  as a package.  One cannot  look  at  each

issue  in isolation and see if one side got more or less.

If  each side were only to focus on the concessions it is

making on one particular item without taking into account

the  concessions  it  receives on other  aspects  of  the

package,  then I think it will be impossible to reach  an

agreement.    Both  sides  must  be  prepared   to   make

concessions.  Both sides must look at the balance of  the

total package, and I think this is the only way forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues are complex. I do not think it will

be  easy  to  reach an agreement just after  one  or  two

meetings.  But with political will and a spirit  of  give

and take on both sides, I think it is possible for us  to

conclude  a  package.  I have informed  Foreign  Minister

Syed Hamid that Singapore would be happy to host the next

meeting  here.  We are now in the process of working  out

the  dates  for  the Second Ministerial  meeting  on  the

package of issues to be held in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, I want to ask the

Minister whether he would care to comment on the reported

Malaysian  proposal  to  raise  the  price  of  water  to

Malaysian 60 sen per thousand gallons, and then to RM3.00

after  2007,  and  whether  the Minister  considers  such

proposals outrageous and arbitrary.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I do not think I need to use

any  adjectives to describe the proposals,  but,  indeed,

these  figures  were in Dr Mahathir's  letter  to  Senior

Minister on 4th March.  And they were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>

also in the first proposal by the Malaysian delegation on

1st July.  In other words, Malaysian 60 sen from 2002  to

2006, backdated to 1986 and 1987, and RM3.00 from 2007 to

2011.   And  they  wanted  a supplementary  agreement  to

reflect this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could not accept this proposal as, in effect, it

would  have  meant  renegotiation and  amendment  of  the

existing  two  Water Agreements.  We stated our  position

that  it  was  not  acceptable.   Later,  the  Malaysians

informed   us  that  they  were  no  longer   seeking   a

supplementary  agreement for that  purpose,  and  instead

they  would  have  recourse to the price  review  clauses

under the 1961 and 1962 Agreements, and they would do  so

consistent with the provisions of the two Agreements.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I wish to ask the Minister

whether in points of international law, do the Malaysians

have  any right to backdate any revisions after  so  many

years when they did not do so earlier.  And, whether they

have the right to act on it or backdate any revision.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I think the lawyers will have a

very  interesting time debating this.  I think this is  a

highly  arguable point.  But the position we  have  taken

is,  regardless  of the legal ability,  as  part  of  the

package,  in  order to advance and make progress  in  the

discussions,  we are prepared to look at  their  request.

But it must be part of the package.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the Malaysians have

repeatedly  talked  about the Hong Kong  model  of  water

agreement.  I wonder whether the Minister would  care  to

comment on the difference between the Hong Kong model and

our existing Water Agreements.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I have said in my main answer

that  we informed the Malaysians that the Hong Kong model

is  not relevant.  And prior to this, we have made public

statements,  through  the Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,

setting out the position.  It is not relevant because, in

the  case  of  Hong  Kong  and  China,  China  bears  the

infrastructural and operational costs of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>

supplying  raw  water to Hong Kong.  Hong Kong  does  not

bear   any   of   these  costs.   So,  the   analogy   is

inapplicable.   In  our  case,  over  the  years,  it  is

Singapore    which   has   borne   the   infrastructural,

operational  and  maintenance costs, such  as  pipelines,

building  of  dams, and so on.  This comes up  to  be  an

astronomical  figure.   So, it is  really  not  comparing

apples with apples.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I wish to ask the Minister

whether  Singapore  has proposed any formula  for  future

water negotiations and,  likewise, whether the Malaysians

made any such proposals on their own.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Can I clarify? Is Dr Ong referring

to the price of water for the future, after the expiry of

the two Agreements?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Yes. As I have said, both sides

have discussed various proposals.  I think both sides now

agree  that  the  price  for future  water  under  a  new

agreement  to  replace the existing two Agreements,  upon

expiry,  must  be competitive.  But what  is  the  agreed

competitive price has yet to be worked out.   As  I  have

said  just  now,  we have put forward  a  proposal.   Our

proposal  is  that  it must be pegged  to  the  price  of

alternative sources, which is NEWater.  The thrust of our

proposal is that we should avoid situations where we have

constant  disputes  over the price of water.   Therefore,

the proposal that we have tabled would stand the test  of

time.   We  will  give  them all the  figures  about  how

NEWater pricing is worked out - the cost and so on.   And

it  makes economic sense for us to agree to a price  that

must  be  less than what it costs us to produce  NEWater.

Otherwise, it does not make any economic sense.   So,  it

has  to  be an agreed percentage of the cost of producing

NEWater.   The  details will have to be worked  out.   We

have  already  given them a briefing.   So  that  is  the

essence, a formula that can stand the test of time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>

that  would not perennially lead to disputes, and it must

be competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysians have also presented a formula on the

first  day,  which involves factors such as the  existing

water tariffs, inflation, consumer price index and so on.

But  Members would have read their public statements that

they  have  said  that they would have  to  rework  their

figures.  On 2nd July, they had revised a proposal  where

they  have said that the price will have to be determined

later by agreement.  It has to be competitive.  But  they

have  said  that they want to consider benchmarking  with

the Hong Kong model or other models.  So, we will have to

await for their final proposal.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, as the Minister is aware

that over a period of time, Singapore as well as Malaysia

agreed  to  negotiate  on  a  package  of  issues.   But,

recently, Malaysia changed its tack and said it wanted to

take the water agreement negotiation outside this package

of issues.  Will Singapore adhere to our position that we

want to negotiate all the issues under a total package of

issues?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, that continues to be our

position,   and  that  is  the  position,  guideline   or

direction  which  the  two  leaders  have  given  to  the

negotiating  Ministers and officials - that these  issues

have to be resolved as a package.  In fact, if we can  go

back to the origins of this, it was to be considered as a

package  because both leaders recognised that these  were

outstanding issues, and it is best to clear the decks for

future  relations  by  resolving  these  issues  as   one

package.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND AND RELATED CHANGES</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on the Deputy Prime Minister

and Minister for Finance's Statement [22nd July 2002].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br>12.59 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity   to

participate in the present debate on the proposed changes

to  the Central Provident Fund.  Sir, this is a difficult

time  for  Singaporeans.  It is  not  easy  to  strike  a

balance  between taking care of the welfare and emotional

well  being  of Singaporeans, and dealing with  the  hard

facts of the economic realities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note the comprehensiveness of the

measures  proposed and announced by DPM Lee yesterday  at

ensuring  that  our economy remains competitive  and  our

workers  remain  employable in a  highly  gloablised  and

competitive world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been talked about the group of older

workers  whose  employers'  CPF  contribution  has   been

proposed  to  remain at 16% when the full restoration  of

CPF  rates  takes  place.   Essentially,  they  will   be

experiencing a 4% cut in their salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember when I was doing research on the

elderly population, there was the classification  of  the

young  old  - those aged 60-75, and the old-old  -  those

aged  75  and  above.  The classification is often  times

based  on  their  level of economic and social  activity.

The proposal involving the 50-55 age group seems to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>

suggest  a  need to classify another group of  "elderly".

Perhaps we need to call them the "younger old", or  maybe

"the  not so young", or maybe "the not so old".  Whatever

we call them, they seem to be a new group of workers that

we  are  concerned about since their age is a determinant

in the present debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the unemployment figures, especially those

involving this group of workers, are a cause for concern.

The  profile  of  unemployed persons  as  at  June  2001,

documented  in  a  Report on Labour Force  2001  by  MOM,

showed  that although workers aged 50 and above  make  up

only  14%  of  the unemployed, which is proportionate  to

their proportion in the population, they take the longest

time  to  regain  employment.   The  median  duration  of

unemployment for this group of workers is 14 weeks.  They

were   also  found  to  be  more  vulnerable  to   under-employment.   It was also reported that job seekers  with

primary  education  and below took the  longest  time  to

regain employment.  Thus, it can be extrapolated that the

older  workers with lower educational qualifications  are

the most vulnerable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is thus understandable to see the measure as

a  way  of  reducing the cost of employing older workers.

It  is  based on the assumption that wages of the workers

are  a  key inhibitor for them to regain employment.   We

first  need to understand how the cost of employing these

workers  has  risen.  Many speakers  in  the  House  have

spoken  of  the  seniority  wage  system,  ie,  with  the

seniority  comes  the  practice  wisdom  that  they  have

acquired  all  these years.  This practice  wisdom  would

then  be  the  value-add that they bring along  to  their

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one would hope that the wages of the workers

are  pegged to their performance or productivity,  taking

into  consideration the practice wisdom and the value-add

that  they bring along.  However, we have heard arguments

from  the  employers that they can find  younger  workers

doing  similar  jobs  done by older workers  at  a  lower

price.  Is this really so?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>

If  this  is  so, the issue is thus to look at  the  wage

system,  ie,  ensuring  that  the  wages  are  based   on

performance and not age.  Yes, perhaps we have  inherited

a  wage  system that has structurally created a stumbling

block  to  our economic system.  We need to replace  this

stumbling  block  to something that is small,  agile  and

flexible,  to  ensure  that  age  is  not  a  factor   in

determining wages, but rather performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the proposed changes in the employers'

CPF  contribution of workers aged 50-55 suggest that  the

wages   of  this  group  of  workers  are  a  significant

inhibitor  to gaining employment, I wonder  if  it  is  a

valid assumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report on Wages in Singapore 2001, published by

the  Ministry  of Manpower, showed that the  relationship

between age and wages is mediated by the skills level  of

the  workers.  It noted, and I quote: "The pace  of  wage

increase  with  age is more pronounced with  the  highest

skilled  workers  as  their work is  generally  knowledge

intensive."   For  example,  the  median  gross  wage  of

managers  aged  30-35 was $3,930 compared to  $5,005  for

managers  aged 50-55, a 40% difference in favour  of  the

older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report, however, continued, and I quote: "The

impact  of  age  on  wages is less  among  lower  skilled

workers.  Here, wages generally peaked earlier."  In June

2001,  the median wage of cleaners, labourers and related

workers  aged 30-35, for example, was $1,582 compared  to

$1,298 for workers aged 50-54 years old, a difference  of

18%  in favour of the younger workers.  Another group  of

lowly skilled workers are the plant and machine operators

and assemblers.  There is little difference in the median

age  of  the  young and older workers in this group  with

those  aged 30-35 earning a median income of $1,878,  and

those in the 50-54 age group earning $1,810, a very, very

small difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we evaluate these statistics and the earlier

figures on the profile of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>

unemployed, with specific reference to the workers in the

50-54 age group, we can infer that perhaps wages are  not

a  significant  factor  in  their  ability  to  seek  re-employment.   The wages of the older workers  with  lower

skills and education are already lower than the wages  of

their younger counterparts.  Lowering the employers'  CPF

contribution  rate  may not be the solution  to  ensuring

their employability.  Indeed, it is their skills set  and

its  relevance  to the available jobs that are  critical.

However, Sir, a 4% reduction in salary may mean a lot  to

this  group  of workers.  I would like to thus  echo  the

call made by Mr Ravindran yesterday for this reduction to

be  a  temporary measure, and for it to be restored  when

the economic situation improves for this group of workers

with their improved skills set.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Government will

extend  the People-for-Job Traineeship Programme and  the

SRP  as  these  programmes will serve the needs  of  this

group  of  workers.   The challenge is  to  entice  these

workers to take advantage of these programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think much has been asked of the workers - from wage restraint to wage cuts to now, cuts in CPF

contributions  -  all in the name of staying  competitive

and  keeping costs low.  However, what are we asking  the

employers  to do?  What have we done to educate employers

to  play  their  part in ensuring the  employment  market

remains buoyant?  Employers have been given much handouts

in the recent Budget, especially with regard to tax cuts,

etc.   However,  it is rather surprising  to  note  their

attitude towards issues related to the employment market.

Yesterday,  Mdm Halimah shared with the House  that  only

4.8%  of  companies have implemented the monthly variable

component  in the wage system.  It was rather  surprising

to  me  to  find out, Sir, from the Report  on  Wages  in

Singapore 2001 survey that 64% of firms studied indicated

that  they had no wish to introduce the MVC in their wage

system.   This is despite efforts by the labour  movement

in  encouraging  them to do so.  I  wonder  what  is  the

proportion of these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>

firms  which currently use a performance-based  appraisal

system in deciding remuneration for their employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such blatant attitudes of the employers will

continue to plague the already harsh employment landscape

for our workers.  We will continuously have to return  to

the  workers to make the adjustments and, of course,  the

CPF  will  end  up  being the easiest  target.   I  would

encourage   the  Government  to  introduce  measures   to

encourage  employers  to  move  into  the  flexible  wage

system,  perhaps starting with some incentives,  if  not,

some  legislative measures may be necessary.  I  am  glad

that  as  an employer, the Government has set an  example

for  the  private sector to follow.  But I would  suggest

that the Government also study why such examples are hard

to follow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one can say that this is a chicken-and-egg

issue.   But the proposed cut in the CPF rates for  older

workers has got a deeper implication.  We need to look at

the  issue  beyond  the economic consideration.   Sir,  I

believe  the  economic productivity of these  workers  is

also dependent on their emotional and psychological well-being.   The current economic gloom will certainly affect

the  psychological  and  emotional  well-being  of  these

workers.   If  we  keep  asking the workers  to  continue

sacrificing  their  salary, it will  continue  to  dampen

their spirit.  At the same time, while I acknowledge that

our  society  is aging, we need not hasten  the  pace  by

confirming that the 50-54 age group is indeed a new group

of  elderly people.  I think they have much to offer  and

reducing  the  CPF  rate  may perhaps  send  a  different

message to them.  We should try to remain as youthful  as

we  can  for a longer period of time, perhaps  we  should

classify  them  as  the  "older young",  instead  of  the

"younger old", still up and about, and certainly able  to

contribute to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we recognise that changing the CPF rate is

not  the only solution to the problem.  Indeed, there are

larger  issues,  eg,  ensuring that the  wages  of  these

workers are commensurate to their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>

productivity, regardless of their age or gender, going by

yesterday's session on Questions for Oral Answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, one perception that exists,

following the recommendations put forth by the  ERC  sub-committee that the employers' CPF contribution for  these

workers  be  reduced, is the underlying value that  older

workers have lower economic value as they grow older.   I

think  no  matter what we say, we cannot deny  that  such

actions  can  lead to such perceptions.  Age  has  always

been  equated to wisdom and productivity with the  caveat

of  the presence of the relevant skills set.  We need  to

ensure  that  we are not accused of ageism.  I  recognise

that  the  argument can be raised that  we  have  already

lowered  the  CPF rates for workers aged  55  and  above.

This  was  more palatable as it was pegged  to  the  then

retirement age of 55.  But palatable or not, the  current

measure, I think, is just as equally, if not more, bitter

in  taste.  Perhaps it is not the right medicine for  the

sickness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to evaluate the value behind our

treatment of age and economic value and viability.  These

two should not be equated - ideal as it may be - just  as

other  demographic  factors like  gender,  ethnic  group,

should  not be linked to economic productivity  and  thus

wages.  Sir, it is a frightening thought to be told on my

50th   birthday that I am too expensive and  my  economic

value  has  dropped by 4%.  I would ask if my performance

had  not  deteriorated, why should my salary be  reduced.

The  statistics I quoted earlier have shown that in  some

sectors,  older workers are already earning lower  wages,

and I believe it is not due to their age but rather their

skills set and productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any reduction in CPF contribution from

employers  is  a  reduction in the total  income  of  the

individual worker.  To the lower skilled worker, it would

be  significant.   This is even more critical  if  he  is

taking  a loan with a bank to mortgage his HDB flat.   He

may  be  one  who falls into the category of  HDB  market

interest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>

rate  loan.   I  would  like  to  address  some  of   the

implications of the new initiative announced by  DPM  Lee

yesterday on the intended target group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the new policy applies to the new

loans  or refinanced loans, we should study the potential

effect using the experiences of the current group of home

owners who would fall into the target group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask DPM Lee or HDB what is the

proportion of the current group of home owners who  would

have  been affected by the new policy.  From the  records

of  HDB,  what  is the proportion of this group  of  home

owners who have a history of defaulting payment on  their

mortgages?   What is the profile of this  group  of  home

owners?   Were  they also defaulters of  other  payments,

like utilities and other bills?  How many of them are  on

the verge of being declared bankrupt following failure to

meet  their  financial commitments  to  other  creditors?

These  latter  creditors are likely to be the  commercial

banks   who   we  intend  to  send  them  to   with   the

implementation of the new policy.  These  are  the  cases

that  we  have  seen  in  our individual  constituencies.

Today,  they  come  to us for assistance  in  negotiating

instalment  plans, tomorrow they will come to us  looking

for  a  roof  over their heads for themselves  and  their

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I see the need to make Singaporeans more

responsible for themselves and for the Government to  let

go  some of the hand-holding, there is a need to do  this

incrementally.    Sir,  behavioural  changes   are   best

achieved incrementally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that if we can study the trends of

what  happened to this group in this economic crisis,  it

will  help  us  prepare for eventualities  when  the  new

policy sets in.  We have to accept that there will be  no

more  safety nets for this group of people.  Should  they

default,  and by our previous experience, many will,  and

should the flats be repossessed, we will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>

have  a problem in our hands.  Sir, I do acknowledge that

we cannot save everyone nor should we protect them.  They

should  be  responsible for their own actions.   But  the

current  economic crisis tells us that there is  a  group

that ends up in a difficult situation due to no fault  of

theirs  - they are structurally unemployed and need  time

to  upgrade themselves to regain employment.  The HDB has

used    its   own   discretion   and   exercised    moral

responsibility  in extending different  schemes  to  this

group  to help them tide over difficult times.   But  the

commercial  banks will not care.  They will look  at  the

bottom-line.  Also, what will happen to those who already

have  problems  with their creditworthiness?   What  will

happen  to  them  if the banks refuse to grant  them  the

loan?    Sir,  we  need  to  study  this  further  before

implementing it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the recommendations put forth by

the ERC sub-committee and endorsed by the Government have

the interest of the people at heart.  We are indeed going

through   rough   times  and  major  shifts   have   been

recommended.  For Singaporeans to be convinced that these

measures  are for their good, we need to give  them  hope

and  direction.   I seek the Government's  indulgence  in

looking  at some of the issues that the other Members  of

the  House and myself have raised as we work together  to

give  Singaporeans  this ray of  hope  that  things  will

indeed get better for us.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.  I would

like  to join my parliamentary colleagues in speaking  up

for the workers in the 50-55 age group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has accepted the ERC's proposal to

lower the CPF rate for workers in the 50-55 age group  to

16%.   This  is  the  current  rate  for  the  employers'

contribution for all employees, lowered from 20%  due  to

the  current  economic  condition.   Although  there   is

presently no difference between the CPF contributions for

workers in this age group and those below 50, there  will

be  a 4% difference in the CPF rate once the full 20%  is

restored.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>

This has been causing unhappiness and concern among those

affected.   These workers fear that housing payments  may

be  affected  as  well  as their retirement  funds  being

reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to balance the harsh economic

solutions to help our companies survive with the  welfare

of our workers.  It must balance companies' cost of doing

business  with  the retirement needs of our  older,  less

well-off employees.  In my view, the Government  can  and

must  chip  in  and help bridge the gap between  the  two

competing needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Government helped the lower income

group  through  the  various rebates - asset  enhancement

schemes,  New Singapore Shares and generous  one-off  CPF

contributions.   This helps narrow the disparity  between

our high income earners and the less fortunate.  However,

we  need to adopt a more targeted approach towards  those

affected  by the Government's own measures.  We  do  this

for  the GST increase and we should also do this for  the

CPF  reduction.  This is not only fair but will also show

that  we  still  care for our workers from  the  previous

generation who have contributed to Singapore's success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I agree that lowering the

employers'  CPF  contribution  for  older  workers  would

enhance  their employment opportunities, I do  not  think

that we should lower the total monthly CPF savings of the

lower  paid workers.  Therefore, my proposal is  for  the

Government  to subsidise or pay for part of the  CPF  for

older  workers below certain income levels to  help  them

remain employed.  This measure can be put in place for  a

limited period of, say, five years.  This should be  long

enough   for  other  younger  workers  to  adjust   their

financial and retirement plans.  As an example,  affected

workers  earning up to $1,200 per month can have  the  4%

cut  in  the employers' CPF contribution be made good  by

the  Government.  Those earning more will enjoy the  same

benefits  of  those earning $1,200.  In my  calculations,

this will work out to approximately $60 million

per  year  when  the CPF rates are fully  restored.   The

affected workers will then have up to $2,880 restored  to

their  CPF  balances when they reach 55 years old.   This

sum may be small to those who are well off, but will mean

a  great  deal  to  those  in the lower  income  bracket,

struggling to make ends meet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has decided to compensate the

civil  servants  in  the  50-55  age  group  through  the

transitional CPF top-up.  My question is:  why  not  also

extend this to other Singaporeans?  Sir, I hope that  the

Government  will consider the merits of my proposal  when

implementing the measures proposed by the ERC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon

Heng):   Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me bring us back  to

fundamentals.  What does the CPF mean to each person?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, Government Ministers have

consistently  stated  that the basic  objectives  of  the

Central  Provident Fund (CPF) are savings for retirement,

medical treatment and housing.  But what is at the top of

each  person's  mind?  Last week, NTUC conducted  several

discussions  with  union leaders.   After  attending  the

discussions,  one of my colleagues, in her early  30s,  a

graduate,  married  with  two  children,  sent  me   this

observation, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At different stages of our life, we have different

expectations of CPF.  For me - and my cohort - CPF is for

housing.   Which is why most of us do not  really  bother

about the Minimum Sum or Medisave retention sum, but more

concerned  on  how much is left from my Ordinary  Account

(OA) for housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those in the late 40s, they could have grown-up

kids.  The working group may have slightly better savings

and  income, and therefore may aspire to upgrade.  So CPF

for housing again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why in the dialogue sessions over the last

few  days, we do not hear people complaining that the  4%

freeze  will affect their retirement income, but that  it

will  affect their mortgage loans.  Which shows most  are

committing almost the maximum of their OA into housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgency to save for healthcare needs will come at a

later  stage.   Children will want to use their  Medisave

for their parents, so that their parents can draw out the

excess from their CPF when they retire.  I do that for my

parents, and I understand most of my friends do that too.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those not married, they should have more savings

relatively - as they have less to spend on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, though not many have achieved the Medisave

Minimum  Sum,  with  MediShield,  it  may  not  be   that

inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think insurance would serve as a good source of

income  for  many retirees in future, to  complement  CPF

savings.   The  reach may not be that  extensive  in  the

past,  but  personally I think it is  a  good  scheme  of

forced savings with protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, retirement income should be financed with

individual   savings,  insurance,  and   subsidies   from

children, if any."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my colleague knows a single mother who

worked  hard to raise eight children, but they  seem  too

caught  up with their own families now, giving her little

support,  if any.  I told my colleague that I  have  seen

tears  well  up  in  the  eyes of 70-year  old  residents

seeking help at meet-the-people sessions when I ask  them

how many children they have.  They know the next question

I  would be asking is: How much support do they give  you

each  month?   Voice breaking, the answer would  be  "Not

much."   And yet they would defend their children  saying

that life is hard for them too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is a disconnect between Government and

people, it is because people look at the immediate  while

the  Government  takes a holistic view.  Any  unhappiness

that  people  express is understandable  because  changes

affected  their immediate needs.  The CPF  is  for  their

needs over a lifetime, especially their retirement needs.

What  we  should  take  care  to  do  is  make  sure  the

adjustments  we  make  do not cause  undue  hardship.   I

believe the ERC's recommendations that the Government has

accepted,  have done that.  It will squeeze some  people,

but not unduly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC has restated the principle of the CPF.

That  is important.  We did not have such a clear set  of

principles before, so the CPF had become different things

to  different  people,  and I have illustrated  from  the

comments  of my colleague, for many people,  CPF  is  for

housing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the ERC has clearly stated that the CPF is for

the  broad  majority of Singaporeans -  those  above  the

lowest  10% and below the top 20% by income.  The  lowest

10%  will  need help through other means.   The  top  20%

should be able to plan for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the broad middle 70%, what does the CPF provide?

Retirement  expenditure, healthcare and home ownership  - at  the  basic level.  At the basic level, I think  is  a

point  that  should be highlighted, so that we  will  not

continue  to  have misconceptions of what  the  CPF  will

provide for us.  Perhaps, it would be better if we define

even  more clearly what we mean by basics.  Because basic

housing  differs  from  one  person  to  another.   Basic

medical  care also differs from one person to the  other.

And  if  we  can define what is basic, then we will  know

that   beyond   the   basics,  it   is   our   individual

responsibility  to plan and save for what  we  desire  to

have.  Then perhaps like what my colleague does, take  up

insurance-linked investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not everybody is like my colleague. I regard

her  as belonging to the top 20%.  For the broad majority

of  Singaporeans,  their CPF savings provide  them  their

basic  needs  in retirement.  For more than  the  basics,

they should save what they can, and their children should

support them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should all remind ourselves that pensions

have a history of about 150 years.  Our CPF has a history

of  barely  50  years.  Before pensions and CPF,  parents

raise  their children, and children support their parents

when they grow old.  This cycle has not changed.  For the

broad majority of people, CPF supplements the traditional

compact  between  parents  and  children.   Without   it,

demographic  changes  will put  the  traditional  compact

under severe strain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for a long time now, the CPF, working with the

HDB,   has  been  more  of  a  housing  society  to  most

Singaporeans   than   a   fund  for   retirement.    With

Singapore's   rapid   growth,   it   has   allowed   many

Singaporeans to upgrade their homes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, more than 90% own their homes. The quality

of  our  housing is already high by world standards.   We

cannot  expect  the  same  fast  pace  of  upgrading   to

continue.  What happens to the Swiss standard of  living?

The  Swiss are blessed with more land, and great  natural

beauty.   Many Swiss live on landed property.  For  those

who  live  in  Swiss cities, surely we  do  not  see  the

majority  living in fenced-in condominiums complete  with

swimming  pools!  That is why I said, by world standards,

the  kind  of  accommodation that Singaporeans  have  now

achieved equals the best around the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total CPF contribution rate will be 40% up

to  the  age of 50 years.  It means the CPF will continue

to  help each one buy his first property.  Those who wish

to  upgrade  will have to plan and save separately.   The

Ordinary Account will be less, most likely not enough for

upgrading  without other savings.  Beyond the age  of  50

years, the CPF will concentrate on helping the individual

save for retirement spending and healthcare.  The prudent

valuation limit on use of CPF funds for mortgage payments

will  prevent  the erosion of hard earned savings.   This

will contribute to a more stable property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will not prevent bubble-like price rises in

the future.  However, the swings may not be as wide as in

the  past.   And future leaders will do well to  remember

that  in  dealing with such situations, they  should  not

cause demand to rise further as that would merely pump up

prices.   The property price index chart, on  page  4  of

Business  Times  today,  is instructive.   The  chart  is

similar  to  the one that Members can find  in  the  Cost

Review  Committee Report of 1996.  Any measure  that  has

increased demand has merely pushed up prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the feedback I get from my colleagues in

the   NTUC   and   my   grassroots,   after   yesterday's

announcement, is why are we allowing 10% cash payment and

10%  from the CPF for private housing, because that would

create  demand.  And they asked me why is it that  we  do

not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>

have  other complementary measures to prevent  the  over-consumption  of  housing.  For  example,  should  we  not

institute  a rule on how much of the monthly wage  should

go  towards mortgage payment?  People would then be  able

to  cope  with  the payment over the life  of  the  loan,

knowing the changes that may happen in the economy  which

may  even cause some of them to be out of work from  time

to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that they told me was that we should

not  allow  the so-called ballooning schemes that  became

popular in the early 1990s.  These are schemes where  one

does  not  pay  the principal sum; one only services  the

interest  payments.  They feel that this is a trap  which

we  should  not allow our people to get into.  These  are

prudent  suggestions which the banks and other  financial

institutions, when they issue housing loans, should  bear

in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I hope it is now a bit clearer

what  the  CPF will do for people at different stages  of

life.   In the early years, it would be to help  them  to

buy  their  first property, as well as save up  some  for

their  retirement  and medical needs, the  principal  one

being for housing.  But, in the later years, it would  be

to  save up for retirement spending and healthcare.  Seen

in  this  light, the change in the long-term contribution

rate for those in the 50-55 age group cannot be described

as  discrimination against them.  And we should never use

the term "ageism" lightly.

<br><br><i>Addressing the seniority-based wage system</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our wage system is seniority-based. As my

colleague,  Matthias Yao, said yesterday, our  system  is

uncommon.   I studied wage systems in different countries

in  the 1980s.  So I know our seniority-based wage system

is  inherently flawed.  I knew then that it was uncommon,

because  other countries used a different principle.   My

younger colleagues in the unions did not take my word for

it.  They checked for themselves, as Mr Matthias Yao said

yesterday, and confirmed what I found out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>

almost  20 years ago - that the prevalent system  applied

elsewhere was one based on job rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Japanese have a seniority-based system

similar to ours.  From the late 1980s, Japanese companies

have  had to change it.  The Japanese MNCs knew  after  a

period  of time that the average wage costs go  up  under

that system and they become uncompetitive.  They tried to

change, progress was slow.  But they have persisted.  Let

me   quote  from  the  article  "The  Death  of  Lifetime

Employment" in the publication Look Japan, August 2002:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second mainstay of the customary employment

system  in Japan, seniority-based pay, has also  changed.

An  aging  society  with fewer children  is  one  of  the

underlying  factors.  A salary curve that  rises  sharply

along  with  employees' age was acceptable in times  when

there  were a greater number of young people.  The  total

personnel  costs  could be suppressed during  times  like

that,  because a greater number of people are paid  lower

wages.   But in an aging society, it has become necessary

to  revise the seniority-based salary, to keep down total

personnel costs.  An increasing number of enterprises are

raising the proportion of performance-based wages  as  an

incentive for higher performance."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the Japanese realised that and they have been

making changes.  And, as Mr Matthias Yao said, the  right

way is the job rate.  We have pushed that since 1986.  At

least,  I have pushed for it since 1986.  Although  years

of  modification has narrowed the gap between  commencing

and  maximum salaries, on average, an office clerk in the

age  group of 50-55 is now paid 60% more than one in  the

early  20s doing the same work; an electrician, 40% more;

and  managers,  200%  more.   These  are  from  the  same

statistics that Dr Maliki mentioned earlier.  With  these

gaps,   the   4-percentage  points  less  in   employer's

contribution  means they will still  be  paid  more  than

those  with shorter service.  So I do not think this  can

therefore  be  described  as discriminating  against  the

young-old or the not-so-young, as Dr Maliki has described

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki was right in pointing out that in some

other classifications, eg, cleaners, the increase in wage

levels across the age profile is very minor.  In fact, we

can find

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>

somewhere the wage level actually drops.  But we have  to

understand  why  this  is the case.   In  many  cases  of

production, the length of work of the employees is short.

And there are not so many in the older age group.  In the

case of cleaners, there are not so many in the young  age

group.  Most of them are in the older age group.  So,  we

have to understand why that is the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But working with the unions, we know what is

provided  for  in  collective agreements and,  typically,

there  is a salary scale, with a commencing salary and  a

maximum point.  We know the people are paid according  to

length of service, still very much so.  Not as much as it

used  to  be, but still there is a very significant  gap.

If  I  were  operating a hospital and  all  my  employees

belong  to the mature group or have been working  a  long

time,  then I know that if a new hospital were to set  up

and  employ  young  people  under  our  system,  the  new

hospital  is  going to be more competitive than  the  old

hospital.   That  is why we have got to  restructure  our

wage  system  to  that  based on  the  job  rate  and  on

performance.

<br><br><i>Helping older employees avoid structural unemployment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been another good reason for the reduction

in  employer's contribution to CPF, ie, to help employees

in  this  age group.  They may not see it as  such.   But

retrenchment  figures  show that a higher  proportion  of

them  are  laid  off  when  companies  restructure.    Mr

Matthias  Yao  gave  some figures yesterday.   We  expect

restructuring to continue.  So, why should we place  them

at higher risk, especially when they also find it hardest

to  find re-employment?  Ministry of Manpower data  shows

that  workers  above  40 years take longer  to  find  re-employment.   Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon  informed   Members

yesterday of the experience of South West CDC, where  the

workers  looking for jobs, and having a  hard  time,  are

those aged 40 and above.  Members can get a good idea  of

the problem, if they spend time in their CDCs helping

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>

those  looking for jobs.  Age, not educational level,  is

the  key  factor,  as  what the  Ministry  of  Manpower's

information tells us.  So, is it age discrimination?   Or

is it the seniority-based wage system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A separate 4-year Department of Statistics (DOS)

study  of 14,000 workers retrenched from October 1997  to

September 1998, during the Asian financial crisis,  shows

that  a  significant number are now not working -  almost

30%.   It is a sign that we have structural unemployment.

And, unfortunately, we must expect more to come.  The DOS

findings for those who found re-employment were sobering.

More  than  half  had wage cuts; one in seven  had  their

earnings  halved;  another  one  in  five  suffered  cuts

between  25% and 50%.  Those who suffered wage cuts  were

the  older  ones,  aged 40 and above.   Again,  age,  not

education, was the key factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to help them avoid the trap of structural

unemployment, we have to do several things.  Bring  their

wage levels closer to their productivity, so they stay in

their jobs.  Altering our seniority-based wage system  to

pay  by  performance is the way forward, but it  takes  a

long time.  Not restoring the employer's contribution  to

CPF  will  help, at least right now.   Mr  Gan  Kim  Yong

disagreed  yesterday, saying that cutting CPF  for  older

employees  will  only  entrench the seniority-based  wage

system.  But employer's contribution to CPF is also  part

of  total wages.  Lowering it will narrow the gap between

top-end wages and commencing salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, adjusting wage costs is not enough. I

fully  agree.   In addition, we should retrain  them  and

redesign  jobs  to raise productivity.  The  unions  have

pushed  for  it.   They say employers are not  retraining

enough.   I  hope  that  Members who  are  in  management

positions   in  their  respective  companies  will   give

retraining  of their employees a greater push,  and  they

will  be  the  ones  who can make the difference  in  the

redesign  of  jobs so that their employees  can  be  more

productive  and paid more.  So, I am saying that  Members

can make a difference.  Do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>

leave it to the unions and union leaders to push.  If the

Members  of  Parliament do their part in their respective

companies, I think we can make more progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC's recommendations, therefore, address

several  long-term  issues, and they  help  workers  over

their  lifetime.  Certainly, to some workers,  the  small

changes  may  hurt.   The effects can be  mitigated,  and

employers would do well to make transitional payments  to

those immediately affected when CPF is restored for those

below   50   years.   For  those  working  in   unionised

companies,  I  am  sure they will get their  transitional

payments.   Others have said it is unfair to  some  older

workers  who are value for money and, therefore,  unfair,

because  the  CPF will not be restored.   Here,  I  fully

agree  with my colleagues from the unions that  employers

are free to pay them in cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me just make a note that the report in

today's Straits Times about the TCTC may give people  the

misunderstanding that it will be a top-up into  the  CPF.

I  do not think it is intended to be a top-up to the CPF,

but  rather  a top-up where the employees, in this  case,

the civil servants, will get it in cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me highlight another recommendation

that  has not attracted much debate, that the CPF  should

be used as a counter-cyclical tool only as a last resort.

Twice  the CPF has been used to help us out of recession.

Each  time,  we have devised new, flexible elements  into

our  wage  system,  learning from the experience  of  the

recessions.   This statement in the ERC's recommendations

means  that  in future recessions, employers  should  not

expect  the employers' contribution to CPF to be cut,  at

least  not so readily as in the last two times. And  they

would  have to work out the wage structure for their  own

companies to cope with the cycles of business.   The  CPF

will  now  focus  on  providing  the  broad  majority  of

Singaporeans with their basic needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I thank you

for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite what the Minister has said, I would

like to speak on the issue of the non-restoration of  CPF

for  the  older  workers.   I  also,  like  many  of   my

colleagues here, feel for the older workers.   They  have

given  their best years to build Singapore to what it  is

today.   I think it is very unfair of the Government  not

to give them their due in respect of their CPF.  I do not

think  the 4-percentage point savings on the part of  the

employers will be an incentive to the employers  to  want

to  employ older workers if they do not need them in  the

first  place.  Employers employ  any  worker  if  he  can

contribute   to  the  bottom  line  of  their  companies,

regardless  of  his age.  More importantly,  I  think  to

deliberately  cut  older workers' CPF,  which  is  really

their  salary,  is  a  wrong  move.   By  doing  so,  the

Government  is sending the wrong signal to  the  business

community. The Government is really telling the employers

that  it  is  all  right  to discriminate  against  older

workers regardless of whether they can do the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think that, from the legal point of view,

this cut in salary is quite unconstitutional.  Article 12

of  the  Constitution  says that all  persons  are  equal

before  the  law.  By cutting the CPF, the Government  is

making  the  law discriminate against older  workers.   I

think the unions should look into this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older workers do realise that in these difficult

times,  when they get retrenched, and if they are offered

an alternative job, they will most probably be offered  a

lower  pay.   Most  of these older workers  accept  that.

However, with the cut in CPF, as pointed out yesterday, I

believe,  by Mr Sin Boon Ann, they shall suffer a  double

penalty.  They will get a lower pay as well as their  CPF

will be taken away from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> have made many credible suggestions and

I  do  not  think it is wise of me to repeat  them.   The

Government  and unions should explore them.  Whatever  it

is, I think it is wrong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>

not to restore the CPF of the workers between the age  of

50-55.   I hope that the ERC shall rethink this issue  in

the  meantime  before the restoration of CPF  comes  into

effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is strange that I should be speaking, as an

Opposition, for the restoration or non-cutting of the CPF

because,  as far as I can remember, it was the Opposition

in the early days, when the CPF was as high as 50% of the

workers' salary, that we, at that time, were asking for a

cut of the CPF.  Times have now changed.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the changes to the CPF rules announced yesterday signal a

fundamental  change  in the social  compact  between  the

Government and the people in some important aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time now, the Government has been

described  as  an over-protective nanny.  The  Government

looks  after  the  people in almost all aspects  and  the

people  trust  the  Government  to  look  out  for  their

interests, almost unquestioningly.  This is especially so

when   it  comes  to  planning  for  their  housing   and

retirement needs.   Now it seems that the Government  has

taken out the scissors to cut some apron strings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the principle of encouraging greater

personal responsibility which is behind some of the  CPF-related  changes  announced yesterday.  The  question  is

whether  the  people are ready for it  and  whether  they

understand why this is necessary at this particular time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been so many major changes announced in

quick succession, a whole slew of them, and this has left

many  workers, especially the less-skilled and the  older

workers, reeling with confusion and anxiety. They do  not

know  what  to make of the changes, or how to  adjust  to

them.   They  certainly do not understand the term  "bank

origination".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to simplify its explanations

and pitch it at the average

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>

Singaporean.   It needs to assure the public  that  these

changes   are  necessary  at  this  time  and  that   the

Government will help them through this transition period,

holding  their  hands  merely for  a  while  more  before

leaving  them on the other side of the busy  street.  And

that   the  Government  would  put  in  place  pedestrian

crossings and covered linkways so that they can go  about

their own way, come rain or shine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the changes to the use of the CPF for

property purchases and the divestment of HDB market  rate

loans  to  banks.  This will take effect on  1st  January

2003 at the same time as the GST increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially concerned about the impact on HDB

flat  owners  who  had over-invested in their  properties

during  the  boom  years.  Often, I  meet  residents  who

continue to live in five-room or executive HDB flats when

they  cannot afford to do so, and often because they have

been hit by the economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many residents have come to see me to write to the

HDB  to  defer  payment  of  their  mortgage  loans.   An

increasing  number  has sought help  to  downgrade  to  a

smaller  flat  or a rental flat. Some are  divorcees  who

have  just sold their matrimonial flat or widows  who  no

longer need a big flat.  They want to live more prudently

in  a  smaller flat.  Some just want to cut their  losses

earlier after realising that the burden is too heavy  for

them and they want to sell their flat before the required

five-year period for minimum occupation is due.  But  HDB

has strict laws on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked them why they sought to buy such big

flats in the first place, they often replied that it  was

because  the  Government had encouraged them to  upgrade,

and  also  because they thought they could rely on  their

CPF  for  most of the payment. They took the Government's

word on this with simple faith.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with the new changes, HDB flat owners who want

to downgrade, can no longer go to the HDB for market rate

loans and they can no longer enjoy the flexibility of the

HDB  in deferring payments.  They now have to go to banks

for loans and need to pay 10% of their 20% downpayment in

cash  before they can buy a flat, when before they  could

pay  the  20% downpayment entirely from their CPF.   This

may  well  be the knock-out blow to Singaporeans  hit  by

hard times and who are forced to downgrade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their options for rental housing are presently

limited.   To qualify for HDB rental flats, the applicant

must  have a combined income of less than $800  a  month.

In addition, the applicant must not have sold an HDB flat

within 30 months at the point of rental application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to review the HDB rental

policies  and  to  also  look at how  the  non-subsidised

rental  housing market in Singapore can be encouraged  to

provide rental housing for a wide range of income groups,

especially the lower income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I am aware that we also have to examine

the  larger  implications of this.  In Singapore,  it  is

almost a sacred tenet that each Singaporean should own  a

home  to  give him a stake in the country.  But  in  many

other  developed  countries,  such  as  America  however,

renting is a lifestyle decision for many Americans who do

not want to be burdened with mortgage payments.  Some  of

them  would  rather save the money for investing  in  new

businesses  and to give them greater mobility  to  travel

abroad to work in different cities and countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the changes announced which

worries  me is whether our banks are up to the  challenge

of  providing  loans to the lower middle-income  and  the

lower-income  groups. The buzzwords for banks  today  are

profitability  and efficiency.  I am not sure  how  ready

they  will  be  to cater to the lower-income  individuals

affected by the changes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the change to allow banks to have their

first-charge  on mortgage loans, I am not  confident  how

readily  they can listen to the lower-income's pleas  for

compassion.   Perhaps,  it is time  for  us  to  look  at

encouraging  the  establishment  of  non-profit   housing

cooperatives.   These  cooperatives  would  be  able   to

negotiate a better deal with the banks on behalf of their

tenants and to also safeguard their interest as a group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in Canada, non-profit housing

cooperatives  receive money from the Government  to  help

the  cooperatives subsidise a certain number  of  housing

units or apartments. The housing charged for this unit is

adjusted  to the income of the household.  If a household

qualifies for a subsidy, their rent is usually set at 30%

of  the household income plus charges for utilities.   It

is a model worth looking at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change which troubles me is the CPF cut for

workers  above  50.  I understand the  rationale  of  the

Government   and   support  its  aim  to   increase   the

employability of the older workers.  I also  applaud  the

move of the civil service to take the lead in giving back

cash  to its older workers, part of what they would  have

to forgo because of the CPF changes.  However, I question

if  this  is the best way to go about it.  I have  argued

against  cutting the CPF of older workers in  the  Budget

debate at length, so I will not repeat my points.  But  I

just  want  to add one more point.  So far, the proposals

introduced to help older workers stay employed are  often

piecemeal  and ad-hoc, introduced separately,  one  at  a

time, without an overarching framework.  Seen separately,

it can send a wrong message to the public.  For instance,

the  CPF freeze for workers above 50 can be read by  many

as a move to make life harder for the older workers.  And

it  is  no  surprise that people look at  the  policy  in

isolation  and question if it is effective in encouraging

employers to hire older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it is introduced together with other measures

directed at employers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>

to  change  their mindset towards the older  workers  and

with  legislation to protect older workers, it would give

a  more accurate signal of the Government's intent, which

is to help them stay employed and that the Government has

their interests at heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower Ministry, on its part, has put in extra

effort to help older workers but I must say that this  is

often lost on the public.  It has put in place very  good

programmes  like  providing higher level funding  support

for  the  training of older workers.  I  would  urge  the

Government to pull together all these schemes and to  set

up  a  comprehensive national programme for older workers

to address the problem of unemployed older workers and to

send the signal that they are valued as assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Finland has done with some success.

Finland  is  one of the rare countries to  have  taken  a

comprehensive grip on age policy.  It launched a national

programme  for  older  workers  in  1997  and   this   is

implemented  in  cooperation with various Ministries  and

its  social  partners.  It serves as a  good  example  of

Finnish tripartite cooperation.  The partners have  tried

to  improve  the  position  of  older  workers  at  their

workplace and there has been extensive commitment to this

goal  on  the  employers as well as the employees'  side.

The  goal  of the programme was to improve the employment

rate among older workers as well as to influence people's

attitude towards aging and older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures of this national programme are focused

on  helping to solve the problems of unemployment through

training, information and legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, we are going through a period of

rapid  change.    And there is a danger that  our  social

compact  that has been built between the people  and  the

Government through the many decades may be fraying.  Even

as  it  is  being restructured, I urge the Government  to

take  steps to strengthen this social compact, and  build

on the trust that the people have on the Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a union leader for the past 26 years.

All these years, my top-most priority is job preservation

and  creation.   Hence, it pains me when  I  see  workers

retrenched.  The pain gets worse when retrenched  workers

are  unable to find new jobs.  Older workers are  hardest

hit.   In my own union experience, especially in the past

few  years, I have noticed that older retrenched  workers

have  greater difficulties in finding new  jobs.   In  my

experience,  the challenges we face now on  the  economic

front  and  job market are the most severe.  As  a  union

leader,  I am equally concerned of the other basic  needs

of workers, ie, adequate housing, healthcare and a decent

living standard in retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing these concerns, I welcome the Economic

Restructuring Committee's recommendations on  changes  to

the  CPF system.  Its objective of refocusing the CPF  is

timely  and  necessary.  I welcome the  intent  that  the

changes to the CPF will be gradual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to express these views on the proposed

CPF  changes.   First, the raising of the employees'  CPF

contribution  wage band to $500-$750.   This  means  that

workers  earning  within this wage band and  below  would

have  a higher take-home pay from now on.  It is also  an

incentive   to   encourage  those  who  are  economically

inactive  to enter the job market.  Relatively,  it  will

help the lower income households more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But raising the CPF band alone will not solve the

problem.   We should find ways to redesign jobs that  are

currently  done  by  foreign workers to  make  them  more

attractive to our local workers.  There is also an urgent

need to educate our local workers not to shun these jobs,

through  the  media  or grassroots organisations.   Other

than  the CPF changes, the Government should implement  a

complete  set  of  packages  to  reconcile  the  housing,

medical and retirement needs of the lower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>

income  workers  and their families.  This  would  ensure

that they are not worse off in the longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now, I would like to touch on the

recommendation to freeze the employer's CPF  contribution

at  16%  for those in the 50-55 age group.  In the debate

yesterday,  25 MPs spoke.  In today's debate, Dr  Maliki,

Ms  Irene Ng and Mr Chiam See Tong also spoke on it.   It

may  seem to the outside observer that the NTUC  MPs  are

for  the freeze, and everyone else is against it.  I  too

support  the  freeze.  Why do we support it?   The  other

solutions proposed by the MPs are all very good solutions

-   retraining,  upgrading of skills, more   productivity

and  value added merit-based wages.  These are all  sound

solutions  and  proposals.  They  have  been  around  for

years.  They are not new proposals.  But let me ask  hon.

Members:  how  many  employers  send  their  workers  for

retraining,  not  just  for their  present  jobs  but  to

prepare  them  for  long-term  employability?   How  many

employers have implemented base-up wage system, which was

proposed by the labour movement in 1986?  The reason  why

we  need to introduce a freeze now is not because  we  do

not  know  the  solution.  It is that  those  who  should

implement the solution are slow and reluctant to  do  so.

This   freeze  should  achieve  the  desired  effect   of

retaining   older  workers,  improving  their  employment

prospects,  and  I agree that these measures  to  achieve

greater wage flexibility would help preserve jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can choose to do nothing about it and let

events  unfold.  Mr Chiam has mentioned that a couple  of

years ago, the Opposition had called for a cut in CPF.  I

was  one  of  them who objected to the proposal.   He  is

right  -  time has changed.  Of course, time has  changed

right  now.  And we are calling for this freeze  because,

as  trade unionists, day to day, we have to help  workers

who are unable to find jobs, and for those who are out of

the  job  market, to bring them back into the  workforce.

These are the difficulties we face today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As responsible trade unionists, we have to do

something.   Of course, any freeze will hurt,  but  there

are  other measures to help them, which I will touch upon

later.   But  doing nothing will actually put  the  older

workers  into a greater pain and, without jobs,  actually

there  is  no  CPF at all.  They and their  families  are

going  to  go through a great extent of suffering.   Each

day, when retrenched workers approach us, especially  the

older  ones, we have great difficulty to find them  jobs.

Of   course,  I  do  agree  that  employers  should   not

discriminate against older workers.  But we  just  cannot

live with statements without doing anything.  So, we need

to  do  something concrete, and we hope these steps  will

help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has changed. Time has changed. With

globalisation and competition from the region  and  other

newer economies emerging, there are greater difficulties,

especially older workers face more difficulties.  So,  we

believe  that  with this freeze, and with other  measures

which are in place, it would definitely help them to  get

back  their jobs.  But if that is not sufficient, then  I

think the Government should monitor the situation and, as

Members  have suggested, if necessary, we can incentivise

good  employers  and disincentivise bad  employers.   If,

eventually,  legislation is needed, then we  can  explore

it.  But right now, we need to immediately introduce some

measures, and this measure of freezing the CPF for  those

aged 50-55, we believe, will help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly urge employers not to treat these

measures as a cost-cutting exercise.  They must take  the

ERC  recommendation seriously and pass back part  of  the

savings  to  deserving employees, either in the  form  of

bonus  or monthly variable payments.  I am glad that  the

Government  as an employer will be setting an example.  I

urge  private sector employers to do the same.  Forms  of

payment  can  be flexible depending on the  company.   As

this is a recommendation, there may be employers who  are

doing  well  and yet keep all the savings to  themselves.

If this happens, it will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>

unfair to this age group of workers.  Hence, I call  upon

the  Government  to  set  up a  tripartite  committee  to

monitor   the  situation  and,  if  necessary,  introduce

appropriate measures against such bad employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the move to freeze employer's CPF contribution

at  16%  for  those aged 50-55 years old will cause  some

hardship.   These older workers have made sacrifices  and

contributed significantly to our nation's early years  of

economic  development and nation building.  Many  workers

in  this  age  group  have skills and  experience.   They

should  not be made to feel useless.  Their concerns  are

real and they rightfully deserve more help.  Will they be

able  to  service their mortgage loans?  Will  they  have

sufficient  funds  for  their  retirement?    These   are

fundamental questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our nation has built up considerable strengths,

capabilities  and resources in the past  30  years.   The

older workers have contributed to these achievements  and

resources.   I  urge  the Government to  provide  special

assistance  to  them.   Earlier  on,  Dr  John  Chen  has

mentioned  that the Government could top up  the  CPF  of

such  older  workers,  and  I  support  his  call.    The

Government should explore topping up, if not in full,  at

least in part, to help such workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a specific request for DPM to consider.

Yes,  reducing the employee's CPF contribution for  those

aged  50-55  years old by 4% will enhance their  spending

power,  but it will also erode their CPF savings  in  the

long  term.  They may have to pay higher taxes  and  lose

out in the CPF interest of their savings.  Sir, I suggest

that  the  Government consider giving an  option  to  the

employee either to take the cash or let it remain in  his

CPF account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to stress an

important  point  which  Mr Lim  Boon  Heng  had  earlier

touched on.  CPF cuts have been used in the past to  pull

us  out  of recession.  Every cut is painful for workers.

Employers should not expect

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>

another  CPF cut if a recession occurs.  It is time  that

employers  built  up  the flexible  component  of  wages,

especially MVC without any further delay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has accepted the CPF

recommendations  and it has announced  some  measures  to

help  workers,  especially  the  older  ones.   This   is

encouraging.    As  the  CPF  recommendations   will   be

implemented gradually, I urge the Government  to  monitor

the  situation closely, as it has many implications,  and

do more, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the changes to the CPF system

announced by the Deputy Prime Minister.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for

allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt that the CPF system has

served us well over the years.  It has become an icon  of

Singapore.  However, the world has changed.  It is now  a

globalised   economy   with  intense   competition   from

countries  like  China.   And  the  Singapore  population

profile and economy have also changed.  The population is

greying  and  Singaporeans are living  longer.   We  need

therefore to provide more for old age and retirement.  As

the environment has changed, so must CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF system ain't broke, but we can modify it to

maximise  its  usefulness  and  effectiveness   for   the

individuals  as  well  as for the economy.   I  therefore

support the new measures, as announced.  Nevertheless,  I

wish to raise some points of concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, one area of concern is the reduction in CPF

rates  for  the older workers aged 50 to 55.   In  truth,

these  older workers will suffer a potential pay  cut  or

stagnation.   There  is already a bias against  employing

older  workers.   The  new  move  is  intended,  in  this

context, to lessen the seniority-based system and to make

older workers more employable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I wonder if it will work that way in practice.

Those  who do not wish to employ or retain older  workers

may,  in practice, not be moved by such measures at  all.

Will  it not instead perpetuate the view that this  group

of older workers is less useful or less relevant?  I hope

not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some circumstances, those aged between 50

and  55, give of their best, contribute significantly  to

the economy over many years, drawing upon their wealth of

experience,  their  wide  networking  and  their   tested

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some older workers will also suffer from the

drop in CPF payable from $6,000 to $5,000 per month.   It

will therefore be a double hit.  With the decline in  the

CPF portion, which is tax exempt, and the increase in the

cash  portion, their taxable income or tax liability will

also  go  up.  In this context, I urge the Government  to

launch  a  public  education programme to  emphasise  the

merits  of  employing  older workers,  and  provide  more

funding  and  avenues for the training and retraining  of

these older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of their relative decline in CPF

contributions,  I urge employers to reward  good  workers

from  this  group  through bonuses and  monthly  variable

components.   The private sector should,  in  particular,

walk the talk and join the public sector as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other area of concern is the related move

by  HDB  to get more HDB home buyers to go to the  market

and  borrow  from the banks, instead of  relying  on  HDB

financing  and mortgages.  This is good news  indeed  for

the  banks.   But, HDB interest rates are very reasonably

priced  for the HDB home owners, whereas market  interest

rates  from  banks are expected to be higher,  especially

over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has so far been quite liberal in giving loans to

potential HDB buyers.  In the new situation, what happens

if  the  banks refuse to give loans to some  HDB  buyers,

looking closely at their credibility

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>

or  creditworthiness?   HDB is  quite  understanding  and

friendly on mortgage default cases, whereas the banks are

likely   to   be   commercial-driven   and   tougher   in

enforcement.  When residents come to see us at the  meet-the-people sessions, we, as Members of Parliament,  could

write  to HDB and appeal for more time, leniency,  easier

payment terms, ballooning scheme, delayed payment, and so

on.   HDB,  I  must  say, is rather obliging  and  rather

helpful in all these appeal cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in this new situation, it will be impractical

for  us to write to the banks or to pressurise the  banks

in any way, and the commercial-driven banks are likely to

be   tougher   and  adopt  a  no-nonsense   profit-driven

approach, as they should be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard my colleague, Ms Irene Ng, talking about

cooperatives,  and  I know there is  the  NTUC  Loan  and

Thrift  Cooperative.   Maybe the  NTUC  Loan  and  Thrift

Cooperative  can play a more significant role,  a  higher

profile, in helping out some of the HDB residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB Home Ownership Scheme and mortgages have

been  part and parcel of Singaporeans' way of  life.   We

have  got  used  to  it.  It is an important  channel  of

bonding between the Government and the people.  Will  the

change or emphasis to commercial bank loans diminish this

very   vital  bonding  or  social  compact  between   the

Government and the people?  I hope not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, for those who, for one reason or another,

are  not  able  to  buy  or own an  HDB  flat,  will  the

Government  provide  more  HDB rental  housing  for  this

category of people?  As we all know, currently, there are

very few HDB rental housing available, and the conditions

are very stringent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CPF holders can use the CPF for purchase of

company  shares from the Stock Exchange.  Many have  lost

their hard-earned CPF money on speculation in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>

shares  as most individuals are not market-savvy or  have

no  time  or  skills to keep track of  movements  in  the

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, therefore, to ask if it would be better to

confine  the purchase of shares through unit  trusts  or,

better  still,  just  allow investments  in  the  private

pension  funds where there are professional  managers  to

keep track and manage the funds or the unit trusts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the new measures.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.  I

have a few points to highlight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a need to better communicate the

intentions  and the objectives of the policy shifts  that

are being proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed CPF and HDB loan changes have far-reaching consequences. It signals a fundamental shift in

the  way individuals base their decisions as well as  how

institutions, especially the financial institutions, have

to adjust to the new rules of the game, ie, be it tapping

into the CPF market or HDB loan market.  To this end,  we

have heard that the vested parties, meaning the banks and

the  fund managers, have been actively exploring and  re-modelling their business plans in order to maximise their

gains  and  minimise their losses in the sea  of  change.

But, what about the individuals?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many individuals I spoke to appear to be quite

nonchalant  about some of the proposed  changes.   Except

issues with immediate or obvious impact, many people paid

little  attention  to  the rest of the  proposed  changes

either  because  they  did not  understand  or  feel  the

impact,  or  were not aware of the issues  at  hand.   As

such,  I  would  like  to  urge the  Government  and  the

relevant  authority to consider mounting an  "inform  and

educate" campaign to better inform Singaporeans of:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the intentions or the rationale behind the

proposed changes, so as to achieve a greater buy-in;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the changes and their related consequences,

whether they are immediate or long-term; and,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) what are some of the coping mechanisms

available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes proposed may have genuinely good

intentions.   However,  given the  current  public  mood,

which  is  somewhat  sceptical  and  negative,  any  good

intentions  may be wrongfully misinterpreted  and  suffer

dire  consequences.  Like a good father who does what  is

right  for his children, our Government must do  more  to

communicate and achieve a greater buy-in from the people.

United, we stand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, who are the intended beneficiaries of

the  proposed changes?  Ultimately, I believe it must  be

the  people - our Singaporeans.  But, no one policy would

satisfy  all.   Hence,  it is believed  that  with  these

changes, the economy will become more competitive and our

people will benefit in the long term.  However, to  quote

the  famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, "In the  long

term, we are all dead."  Hence, while we make changes for

long-term  benefit, we must also urge our  Government  to

intervene  to provide short-term and medium-term  reliefs

and stimulus.  To this end, our Government has done so in

the economic arena.  However, our economy is built on our

people  and,  therefore, we should  also  then  turn  our

attention to the people, and focus on the group of people

who  are  most  immediately affected  by  these  proposed

changes.  These people would include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the 50-55 years old or, in fact, when the policy

kicks in in about three years' time, the 48-51 years  old

today;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the group of people who are also affected by the

lowering of the income ceiling for CPF contribution; and,

of course

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) the group of people who are hit by this double

whammy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask: who are these people? Has

there been a detailed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>

profiling of these people who would be affected by  these

changes?   Can we commission a study to enable  a  better

understanding of their needs, and how to help them?  Some

quick areas of concern would be:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) what is their average income?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) what is their average loan repayment per month - whether it is mortgage or car loans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) what is their consumption pattern like; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) what is the average age of their children - are

their  children financially independent or  are  they  of

school  or university-going age where financial resources

are most needed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when we can better understand the demands and

profile of these affected cohorts of people, can we  then

design help that is relevant and helpful and effective to

them.   Hence, since the intended beneficiaries  are  our

fellow  Singaporeans,  let us hear  them,  see  them  and

better understand their needs from a human angle, and not

just mere statistics on a Government chart.

<br><br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Es - Empower, Enhance and Enable

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I think there is also a need not just to

empower  the  people  but  to  enable  and  enhance   the

individuals' ability to look after themselves,  at  least

financially.  I am in full agreement with the  spirit  of

empowering  the  people  and moving  the  decision-making

process  to  individuals.  With the proposed lowering  of

the   income  ceiling  from  $6,000  to  $5,000  for  CPF

contribution and the raising of the income floor for  CPF

contributions  from between $200-$363  to  between  $500-$750,  there will be an increase in the disposable income

of  the  people, as we put more cash in the hands of  the

individuals.  This is a good move, only IF we can  safely

assume that people are generally financially savvy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare my interest here. As a

financial  consultant who has seen  clients  directly  as

well  as trained hundreds of financial advisers,  I  find

the  financial literacy rate in Singapore  to  be  rather

low,  despite our high income.  Perhaps over  the  years,

we,  as a nation and as individuals, have acquired income

and  wealth at an accelerated pace, and we have not  paid

much  attention to financial education to help us  better

manage our hard-earned resources.  Sir, man has two legs,

but  the creature called "money" has four legs, two wings

and  perhaps, in the IT age, a super-jet as well.  Hence,

unless  we learn to better manage our resources, we  will

always   be  giving  endless  chase  to  money  and   the

increasing cost of living.  For some, they will always be

in the phenomenon called "Money No Enough".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for Singaporeans who are affected by the

lowering  of the CPF contribution at age 50-55 and  those

whose mortgage loan repayment quantum may be affected  by

the  proposed  changes, they may not even  get  over  the

transition  phase  that DPM Lee spoke about  yesterday  - unless conscious efforts are there to help them make wise

adjustments   in  financial  decisions,   some   may   be

permanently stuck.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we must go beyond empowerment of the

individuals    to    enable   the    people    to    make

choices/decisions whose consequence or desired outcome is

congruent  with  the action they are about  to  take.   I

would like to advocate that the Government put in place a

comprehensive  system  to  help educate  Singaporeans  on

financial  decisions,  and  this  should  not   be   mere

financial calculations alone, but also take into  account

individual's financial goals and objectives.  Sir,  I  am

advocating  that the 3 Es - empowerment, enhancement  and

enablement - be tackled holistically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the move from HDB origination market rate

loans to bank origination market rate loans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who move to bank loans currently, they may

enjoy  a  lower  interest rate.  As  such,  many  people,

especially   those  who  are  suffering  from   financial

hardship now, may be tempted to switch to a lower monthly

instalment  payment.  However, in the  larger  scheme  of

things,  as  many  of  my parliamentary  colleagues  have

spoken, banks are driven by commercial motives and do not

have  a  social obligation to mortgagors.  The HDB versus

private  banks'  treatment of  default  cases  is  vastly

different.   HDB has frequently exercised compassion  and

put  in  place many schemes to help hardship  cases,  for

example,  the  reduced or delayed repayment  system,  re-calibration of loans, no penalty interest-only repayment,

so  on  and so forth.  My fear is genuine hardship  cases

may  not  enjoy  the same privileges as those  under  HDB

loans and be forced out of their homes more easily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some may say this policy may affect only a

minority, the question is: should people unwittingly fall

into  this  negative financial situation and banks  force

sell  their HDB flats, is there any measure put in  place

to  help  provide  a roof over their  heads?   Given  the

nucleus  family criterion that HDB imposes, many of  them

will  need a roof over an entire family's head to  ensure

that  the  grandparents  are not  left  on  the  streets,

children  can continue schooling and the adults can  also

focus   their  energy  and  effort  at  correcting  their

financial  situation, so as to prevent it from  spreading

to become a family and a social problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if we move HDB loans into the free

market,  are  we  also ready to liberalise  some  of  the

current  HDB restrictions and move the guidelines  closer

to the free market?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the loan restriction from 150% to 120%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I echo Minister Lim Boon Heng's point on this scheme

sounding a little bit like the balloon scheme.   I  think

it  is  a  very  good  move  to  restrict  loan  quantum.

However, to put the payment and the burden of the payment

at the back end itself does sound

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>

and  remind me of the balloon car loan scheme  where  the

cash  upfront  is minimal but the back end or  the  later

part of the loan will eventually catch up with the debtor

in  due  course,  especially if one  has  not  made  wise

calculations  of his ability to pay, or has miscalculated

and  thought that he is going to be selling the  property

in 10 years, or has not properly invested the money saved

upfront  for  later repayment.  This is made  worse  when

there  is  asset devaluation, or when loan interest  rate

catches up.  One may then be forced to repay the loan  in

cash sooner than the original calculation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, the relaxation of the 20% cash

downpayment on housing loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk about over investment in

the  property  market and how CPF was used  to  fuel  all

these  bubbles, and talks about how escalating land  cost

has made Singapore uncompetitive.  This liberalisation of

10%  downpayment in cash and 10% downpayment in CPF sends

a  mixed signal to the market and the people.  Is there a

need to cushion the impact of the changes on the property

market?   Already there is a suspension of the  16th  May

1996 anti-speculation capital gains tax on property.  Who

are  we  helping  in this exercise of  lowering  the  20%

downpayment   in  cash?   I  hope  the  Government   will

seriously reconsider this proposed change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, I would like to register that

the CPF changes, on the whole, will benefit Singapore  in

the  long term.  I hope that the Government would  better

communicate  with the public, and also look  after  those

people who are directly affected, especially in the short

and medium term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the recommendations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the proposed changes to the CPF

system, as described in the Ministerial speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since its inception, the CPF system has been

part and parcel of the working

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>

lives  of all Singaporean workers.  The success  of  this

system  is  greatly due to the fact that we  believe  its

principles  and  concept.  It is a good system.   It  has

served  us  well. It is one of the basic  tenets  of  our

social  security system.  As opposed to the  common  pool

retirement   fund  systems  that  exist  in  many   other

countries,   our  CPF  system  is  based  on   individual

compulsory  savings  for  retirement  for  every  worker.

Through  CPF Board facilitation, thousands of our workers

and their families are able to benefit from the fruits of

their labours during their twilight years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when there were hints that the system was going

to  be  reviewed, many were worried.  Understandably  so,

because  we  are comfortable with it and many  depend  on

their CPF savings to purchase property and some use their

CPF accounts to invest in stocks.  Naturally, the idea of

the Government tampering with something that works and is

not broken is unnerving and disturbing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also understand times have changed. We have

just  gotten through the worst economic recession of  our

short history and we are still not out of the woods.  The

world  and the regional economic landscape have  changed.

Tight  labour  market and full employment  that  we  have

enjoyed  for  many years are no longer the order  of  the

day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a relief that after lots of speculations,

discussions and consultations that have taken place, here

we are and the ERC has spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic, Sir, is very important and it touches

across  the  whole strata of our population.   I  believe

that  it  has been handled very, very well and it  speaks

very  well for ERC.  It has managed to get the  views  of

the    stakeholders   and   the   masses    before    the

recommendations  are made.  I believe  that  the  workers

understand  that some of these changes are necessary  and

that  we have to do it, no matter how painful it is going

to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I can assure you that there are many out

there who still do not understand how these changes  will

have an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>

impact  on  their  lives.   Many  are  just  hoping  that

positive  change will come about.  We should continue  to

engage  the  people  and  get their  views  because  this

process of communications and consultations will minimise

misunderstanding.   Naturally,  there  will   always   be

disgruntled  people  who will be bitter  and  cynical  of

whatever effort that we intend to do, or change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we ponder upon the means and

ways  to  make these changes and adapt, there are several

issues  which,  I believe, I can highlight which  deserve

some attention from the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our older workers are constantly grappling with

rapid  changes  and the need to acquire  new  skills  and

knowledge.  Many of them are struggling and some of  them

are  resisting these changes.  Now, we are  telling  them

that their CPF is going to be affected.  How then can  we

assist  them to manage this change?  Can we be sure  that

the  proposed  CPF  change will  help  them  to  be  more

employable?  As it is, Sir, many have tried to re-profile

themselves  and  acquire new skills, but yet  they  still

struggle  to get new jobs.  We know that it is not  going

to  be easy to assess how effective this measure is going

to  be,  but  we are surely going to be judged  for  this

decision.  So let us not make it more painful and  assure

those  who fall under the age bracket of 50-55 years  and

are  directly affected by this change that, if they  need

help, the help is there for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard for many years now that there

needs  to be a change in mindset towards the way  we  pay

our  workers,  that  is, we should  move  away  from  the

seniority-based  wage system and move towards  the  task-based and performance-based system, irrespective of  age.

The  progress  has  been slow.  Many  Members,  union  or

otherwise, have lamented in this Chamber of the slow take-up  rate  from the private sector.  I believe  we  should

seriously look into how this could be changed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the seniority-based wage system is

so  entrenched and rooted in our economy that, I believe,

maybe evolution is not enough, but rather a revolution is

what we should start.  May I be bold to suggest that  the

civil  service, as the largest employer, should lead  the

way  and revamp its wage system, rather than making minor

changes here and there?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the initiative to allow CPF members to invest

in  approved  private pension funds  is  laudable.   This

gives  the  workers opportunity to decide on  alternative

schemes.  They should be responsible for their retirement

and  if they feel that the returns from the pension funds

are better and thus enhancing their safety net, so be it.

My  only concern is for the workers to be informed of the

pros  and  cons of such schemes.  Let them make  informed

choices and be responsible for their choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the move to fine-tune

the  CPF  system, and I believe that it is  necessary  to

prepare ourselves for future challenges.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for allowing me to join in the debate on the  motion

before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new CPF measures for workers above 50 years of

age  will  surely have the effect of flattening the  wage

pyramid  for  employers,  as many  are  still  using  the

seniority-based   system  for  a  variety   of   reasons.

Although  many  may say that this is but a small  gesture

and  that few jobs will actually be saved, I think we are

making  an  important signal to investors  and  employers

that  Singapore  is  serious about remaining  competitive

when addressing total wage cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Matthias Yao yesterday brought up statistics to

show that it was the older workers who are more likely to

be retrenched as companies restructure to face lean times

ahead.   So this measure is about helping to ensure  that

older workers will be able to keep their jobs for as long

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>

as  possible while pursuing retraining, a second  career,

or  new business of their own.  We want our people to  be

prepared  to  be entrepreneurs.  But if we ask,  we  find

that  many of them would only have assets, the HDB  flat.

We  may then need to be prepared to provide large amounts

of  rental  housing again, if Singaporeans,  having  lost

their flats through business failure, are not to be  left

to  fend  for  themselves  in  the  streets.   I  support

suggestions  that  will reduce the amounts  available  to

service housing loans through the CPF, and that is a good

thing, because there is currently a temptation to upgrade

to  a  housing unit that one can ill afford.   This  move

towards  making commercial loans for those who  have  had

two  or  more subsidised housing opportunities  from  HDB

would  force people to consider carefully if  they  could

really  afford  their fancy new home, or their  expensive

renovation loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans are having smaller families and

the  traditional  support system based  on  the  extended

family  can  no longer be relied on.  We have  been  told

that  many  Singaporeans will be retiring with less  than

half the recommended Minimum Sum of $80,000 in their  CPF

accounts  and this situation will certainly continue  for

many  years.  For many of these Singaporeans, their  main

asset  in old age is the HDB flat.  I hope the Government

would  consider revising some of the HDB policies, as  Ms

Irene  Ng  has said, so that these people will  not  face

unnecessary  obstacles in monetising the  last  asset  to

support themselves in their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote you an example. I recently met a 73-year old man at one of our meet-the-people sessions. He

told me that he had been trying, without success, to sell

his  4-room flat for the last two years.  He had  been  a

skilled  workman,  had led a frugal  lifestyle,  but  had

exhausted  his  CPF  savings in  helping  to  look  after

himself  and  two  elderly and sickly siblings.   As  the

siblings  have bought a 4-room flat less than five  years

ago,  they would be ineligible for rental flat  had  they

sold the flat, and they would also not have been able  to

buy a resale 3-room flat on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>

open  market  after  paying back  HDB  for  their  rental

arrears.   These people were desperate because there  was

no  way  that these three 70-year-old people  would  have

gotten a commercial loan.  They also had less than $1,000

left in their CPF at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would need to consider making reverse

mortgages  on HDB flats and easier option, or furthermore

to   tweak   policies   meant  to   discourage   property

speculation,  such that they would not pose problems  for

elderly   people  such  as  these.   The   move   towards

commercial  loans  for third time HDB flat  buyers  would

initially  not affect the majority of HDB flat  dwellers.

But,  I  think, as many Members do, the commercial  banks

will  never  be as generous as HDB in dealing with  those

who  have  difficulty in servicing their  housing  loans.

Perhaps, HDB would need to revisit again this business of

providing   basic   rental   housing,   whether   heavily

subsidised or not, to those people who need to  cash  out

their  flats due to inadequate CPF savings, or  to  those

who  have  lost  their  flats  due  to  retrenchment,  or

business failure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is that the Government should also not

forget  those who have very little by way of CPF  because

they  are petty traders, or they are self-employed,  like

taxi  drivers.  Some of these people have come to see  me

saying  that as they did not even have enough spare  cash

to  put  into  their  Medisave accounts  and  keep  their

contributions  up  to  date,  they  faced  difficulty  in

renewing their licences to operate as petty traders.  For

these  people,  surely we must find a way  to  help  them

because if they, at this point in time, do not even  have

the  means  to pursue their trades and their occupations,

they really feel that they are at their road's end.   For

this  group  of people, how can the current CPF  measures

help  them?  I hope that the ERC and the Government  will

also  consider the plight of these low wage  earners  and

those  who  have  really no business in their  shops  and

stores.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>

proposed  changes in the Deputy Prime Minister's  speech.

However, like some of my colleagues before me, I wish  to

express  some concerns, specifically in relation  to  the

market rate loans for HDB flats.  Some of my points  have

been raised by my colleagues earlier, but I still wish to

reiterate one or two salient points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, among those people who wish to take market

rate loans in the purchase of HDB flats, many of them are

fully aware of the implications and ramifications of bank

loans.  Many, I believe, are not fully aware of the terms

with regard to forced closure, how and when they operate.

Many are not aware that banks normally have the right  to

utilise the accounts of the borrowers held in the lending

banks.   Many also are not fully aware of the quantum  of

principal  and  interest  in their  monthly  instalments,

coming to an unpleasant surprise whenever they come to  a

stage when they wish to redeem the loans.  There will  be

those  who  will  find  themselves  in  these  unpleasant

situations, and the problem is that when they come to  it

they are not prepared for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is another group of people who, even

if  they are aware of these terms and conditions, do  not

have  the  financial nimbleness or capacity  to  overcome

them.   We can say that they have a choice - if they  are

fully  aware of the pitfalls of bank loans, then  do  not

take bank loans, do not buy a flat.  This is not really a

choice, for owning an HDB flat is really almost akin,  at

least in Singapore, to the basic need of having a shelter

for  one's family and oneself.  For this group of people,

it  is  not exactly a real choice to say, "Do not  borrow

from  a  bank."   These are also the same  ones  who  are

hardest  hit  during  a  macro economic  downturn  or  an

individual financial setback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what happens when they default on their housing

payments?   This  brings me to my third  point,  ie,  the

readiness  of banks to meet financial hardship defaulters

halfway.   This  point  has been raised  by  some  of  my

colleagues earlier.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>

Let  me  just reiterate my agreement with it,  especially

the  difference  in  approach,  attitude  and  philosophy

between  the  HDB as a lender, and banks as lenders.   It

can be argued that the right of the bank to foreclose, to

take  legal action, is the same as the rights of the  HDB

presently.   Therefore, the argument is that the  rights,

duties and obligations of HDB flat owners, ie, borrowers,

vis-a-vis  the  banks  after 2003 are  the  same  as  the

rights, duties and obligations of HDB flat owners now vis-a-vis the HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legally, that is correct. But only legally,

because,  actually, it is different.  The difference  has

been   enunciated  quite  eloquently  by  my   colleagues

earlier,  but  the main difference arises from  the  fact

that  the  HDB  has a social mission.  In my  very  short

stint  in  this  House, I have heard the  Minister  state

clearly  that  the  role  and function  of  the  HDB  is,

primarily,  to provide basic housing to all  Singaporeans

at  affordable  prices.  And even  when  HDB  acts  as  a

lender,   we   see  this  reflected  in  their   actions.

Therefore,  when we have defaulters as  a  result  of  an

economic  downturn,  we have the HDB  bending  backwards,

sideways,   forwards,   in  all   directions,   to   help

accommodate the awkward positions that the HDB flat owner

is in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine, even as I speak now, one HDB officer

paying  attention to a HDB flat owner, trying to  give  a

proposal  that would work out for him, either a deferment

of  monthly  payments or an extension of  housing  loans,

thereby  reducing monthly quantum sums.  Try as  I  might

very hard, it is quite difficult for me to imagine a bank

officer  doing the same thing.  This is not  to  put  any

blame on the banks.  It is in the nature of banks to  run

on a commercial basis, and a purely commercial one.  They

have  to answer to their shareholders.  Profit making  is

their  bottom  line.  If there are loan defaulters,  bank

officers will have to answer to their shareholders, "What

actions  have  you  taken?"  There is,  therefore,  great

pressure  on  banks, in the case of defaulters,  to  take

action, file writs of summonses, enter judgments, enforce

judgments, ie, to foreclose.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I appreciate the rationale for

the  changes  that are proposed by the Hon. Deputy  Prime

Minister, one of which is to enable the HDB to  focus  on

its  core role.  I also understand that these changes are

in line with the desire to allow commercial transactions,

including property loans, to be governed more and more by

the  forces  of the free market.  This also accords  with

the  need  to  prepare Singaporeans for the new  economy.

The  changes  also  would jolt ordinary  Singaporeans  to

realise  that, ultimately, they cannot rely on  statutory

boards as another safety net or source of security.   But

we, Singaporeans, ourselves, have to plan and prepare for

our own future and security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree with these changes, in view of

the concerns that I have raised, I would like to urge the

Government  to  consider embarking  on  a  very  thorough

public education programme on the changes - not only what

they  are,  but  what  they imply, the  ramifications  of

loans,  as I mentioned earlier - what they actually  mean

to  those people who take loans, eg, the usual terms that

banks   would   normally  apply.   I  believe   my   hon.

colleagues, Ms Irene Ng and Miss Penny Low, have  alluded

to this prior to my speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would also urge the Government to consider

allowing some of these buyers to still obtain market-rate

loans  from the HDB after 2003.  There can be  a  cap  on

their income or a cap on the amount of loan that they can

take,  in  order to prevent abuse.  Perhaps, we can  also

put  a cap on this break period, say, until 2006 or 2008.

The  idea  is  to  soften the otherwise  abrupt  learning

curve.  I think this would go a long way to help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, save for the concerns I have mentioned, I

support the proposed changes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  my opinion, the title of the just-released report  by

the  ERC  Sub-Committee on CPF and  Wages  is  most  apt.

"Refocusing the CPF system" is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>

a  bold call for the system to return to its basics.   It

was  originally  conceived  as  a  compulsory  retirement

savings  scheme.  Requiring both employers and  employees

to   participate   helps  the  workers   accelerate   the

accumulation  of  retirement  resources,  and  make   the

employer an indispensable part of the workers' retirement

plans.   The  CPF  system  has served  the  nation  well.

However,   over   the  years,  the   system   has   grown

considerably in complexity, as its role crept outwards to

include housing, healthcare, and even as a macro economic

management  tool.  It is time for the CPF to strip  clean

of the clutter accumulated over the years and re-focus on

its  core  objectives.   In some ways,  for  the  average

workers, the CPF system is also a deferred social  safety

net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated goals of the refocusing exercise are:

ensuring    adequate   retirement   resources,   reducing

excessive   consumption,  and  promoting  labour   market

flexibility.  The unstated goals, as some observers  have

pointed  out,  seem  to  be that of  encouraging  greater

personal  choice.  An increasingly capitalistic  approach

is  being  taken.   The  safety  nets  are  being  slowly

removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the principle of personal choice and

accountability,  but would urge that  this  principle  be

tempered by special consideration of the lowest 10th  or,

indeed, perhaps even the lowest 20th income percentile of

the  population who are more vulnerable and who are  less

able  to  make the best choices for themselves.  We  need

capitalism,  doused with a great deal of  compassion  for

the less able.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, whilst I support the spirit and

essence  of  taking the CPF back to basics,  I  urge  the

Government  to apply a gentle hand and move gradually  in

implementing the changes to the system.  I note that this

is  indeed the tone of the Government's response  to  the

report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to three areas of the ERC report and

the Minister's response which I wish to comment on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Retirement adequacy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support raising of the Minimum Sum, higher

contributions  to the Special Account, Medisave  Account,

and the need to take a long-term view of CPF, instead  of

relying  on  it  as  a  counter-cyclical  macro  economic

stabilisation tool.  In so far as property investment  is

concerned, I am pleased to note that the report offers  a

very  balanced and circumspect view.  While pointing  out

the  dangers  of  over-consumption, it  does  not  vilify

property investment per se.  I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is rational and sensible for Singaporeans to

invest  in  property.  Not only does this  provide  their

families  a roof over their heads, it also gives  them  a

substantial asset that offers added financial security in

retirement."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this statement rightly puts in perspective the

fact  that property investment per se is not the  villain

it  is  made  out  to  be for our  current  woes,  as  is

fashionable to allude to nowadays.  On the positive side,

many  economists  have recently pointed out  that  rising

house  prices  in the US and Europe are helping  to  keep

their  economies afloat after the battering  their  stock

markets have received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, it is really our greed, our

oftentimes  misplaced optimism, "irrational  exuberance",

that  property prices will keep heading north  that  have

caused  many  to  over-invest in property.   Indeed,  the

stock market is more famously irrationally exuberant than

property.   It is true, however, that current  CPF  rules

have exacerbated the problem, and the recommendations  of

the  Sub-Committee and the Government's response will  go

some way to reverse the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report points out - correctly in my view - the need to have more flexibility to be able to convert

the  property asset into cash during a person's  twilight

years.   Like the authors of the report, I would like  to

urge the Government to explore more exhaustively ways and

means to monetise a person's housing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>

assets,  to  enable  that person to enjoy  as  reasonably

comfortable a retirement as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least three possibilities have been mentioned in

the  report,  which I wish to comment  on  briefly.   The

basic  point  I wish to make is that, presently,  various

obstacles     hinder    monetisation    through     these

possibilities, and several HDB rules will have to be  re-evaluated  and changed for the possibilities  highlighted

to be workable.

<br><br><i>Subletting</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, subletting of the entire HDB flat by

elderly  lessees to augment their retirement  savings  is

subject to various criteria, which are that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the lessees must be aged 65 years and above;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) they must be living in a 3-room or smaller flat;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) they must have occupied their flat for at least

25 years; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) they must have no outstanding mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel these restrictions are stringent and

seriously  inhibit  the  ability of  elderly  lessees  to

sublet   their  entire  flat  for  additional  retirement

income.  Based on the current set of restrictions, only a

handful  of  retirees will be able to make  use  of  this

avenue to augment their retirement income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the current retirement age is 60 years,

as  well  as the fact that more may be forced  to  retire

early  due to structural unemployment, we should consider

lowering  the minimum age requirement from 65  years  to,

say, 60 or 55 years old.  Furthermore, subletting of  the

entire  flat  should  not  be allowed  only  for  elderly

lessees of 3-room or smaller flats.  Rather, it should be

open  to  all retirees, whether they live in a 3-room  or

bigger flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for a start, to prevent abuse, this could

be liberalised to include both

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>

3-  and 4-room flats.  As the scheme stabilises, it could

be  extended  to  bigger flat types.   This  would  allow

retirees  greater  and freer choice in  monetising  their

assets for old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the objective is to allow retirees to augment

their  income by subletting their HDB flat,  if  they  so

wish,  the  restriction that they must have occupied  the

flat  for  at least 25 years and that they must  have  no

outstanding mortgage loan are not only onerous  but  also

appear  superfluous.  The rationale for  these  stringent

conditions appears to be a concern that public  funds  to

build subsidised flats for their owners are being used to

help  lessees  generate income.  Since  subletting  of  a

whole  flat is, in this case, only allowed for  retirees,

the worry of such a public outcry is unfounded.

<br><br><i>Reverse mortgage</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, reverse mortgage. In concept, reverse

mortgage is a useful device.  However, there are risks to

the  financial institutions offering it.  Properties with

an  ageing lease will be hard to dispose of in the  event

of  default,  especially given that CPF itself  currently

does  not  allow withdrawals for properties  with  leases

shorter  than  60  years.  Pricing those  risks  properly

would  imply  a relatively high interest rate,  but  this

means  a double whammy - low valuation plus high cost  of

servicing the loan through lower annuity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the reason why reverse mortgage

remains  unpopular,  with only NTUC Income  offering  the

scheme  for  private  properties  and  with  few  takers.

Furthermore, current reverse mortgage proposals are for a

fixed  term  of,  say,  10 years.  This  means  that  the

property  owner faces the risk of losing his property  if

he  is  unable  to  pay the reverse  mortgage  loan  with

interest  at  the end of the term.  This is a significant

drawback of reverse mortgage today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, in view of the need to allow more ways

for  retirees to monetise their assets, the  Ministry  of

National Development could and should explore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>

various  reverse  mortgage  schemes  together  with   the

financial institutions for the benefit of HDB lessees.

<br><br><i>Downgrading</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elderly HDB flat lessees could also monetise the

value of their HDB flat by downgrading either to a rental

or  to  a  smaller  flat.  However, there  are  currently

several impediments for them to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, current HDB rules only allow low-income

families  with  a household income of $800  or  less  per

month  to rent HDB flats.  This rule for rental HDB flats

would   have  to  be  relaxed  to  accommodate  a   wider

population of elderly lessees to rent a flat, instead  of

purchasing  a smaller flat.  Renting is pure  consumption

and  for  the  elderly, this should not  be  a  cause  of

concern for policy makers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC report notes that presently, every two out

of  three  elderly households live in 3-room  or  smaller

flats and have no smaller accommodation to downgrade  to.

This  would limit the number of elderly HDB flat  lessees

who  can  sell  their existing flat and  downgrade  to  a

smaller flat.  Such residents could perhaps downgrade  to

studio  apartments. To facilitate this avenue for elderly

flat  lessees  to  monetise their properties,  HDB  could

consider building more studio apartments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the ERC report notes that only 3.6% of

elderly  living in HDB flats have downgraded  to  smaller

flats and hence, downgrading by the elderly to unlock the

value   of  their  assets  could  require  a  significant

behavourial  change.   Indeed,  most  elderly  do   value

stability more than many other things.  Familiarity  with

the  ground, community ties painstakingly built  up  over

the years are especially hard to break.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own experience with collective sales of older

properties  bears  this out, with some elderly  residents

saying  that  they would rather die in their  matrimonial

home  or  from where they have lived most of their  life,

than to become a multi-millionaire.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also know of a colleague whose widowed mother is

living all alone in a 5-room HDB flat and refuses to move

out  to  a smaller flat despite repeated advice from  her

children.   One  way to mitigate this  problem  and  make

downgrading  more attractive to elderly  residents  would

perhaps be to build more studio apartments in areas where

there  are  high concentrations of the elderly,  so  that

they  would at least be able to move to another  flat  in

the same neighbourhood which they are familiar with.

<br><br><i>Home ownership</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise is the impact of

the ERC Sub-Committee's recommendation on home ownership.

There  has  been  a chorus of concerns  about  the  over-investment  problem  and fears that  retirement  adequacy

will be compromised by it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure to curb this is the 150% valuation limit

on   the  use  of  CPF  funds  for  purchase  of  private

properties  and  HDB  flats with  bank-originated  loans.

Over  a  period of five years, this will gradually reduce

to 120%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has revealed that even at 120%, most

home  buyers should still be able to use their CPF  funds

without  having  to  resort to cash top-up  for  some  19

years.   Enough  has already been said by the  media  and

market  watchers to lead me to conclude  that  this  will

have  minimal impact on the property market in the short-term and that it will help to prevent over-investment  in

properties.  Notwithstanding this, the Senior Minister of

State  for  Trade and Industry has noted  that  this  cap

could be further reduced in the future.  I would urge the

Government to carefully assess the ramifications  of  any

further future cuts before implementation in order not to

unduly destabilise the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to briefly comment on the

Minister's  announcement that from next  year,  HDB  flat

purchasers  who  are  not  eligible  for  HDB  subsidised

interest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>

rate  loans  would  have to obtain their  financing  from

banks.   Again,  this seems to be a case  of  encouraging

greater  personal  choice and accountability  by  pulling

back  some  of  the  safety nets put  in  place  earlier.

However well meaning as these changes are intended to be,

they  would  bring considerable anxiety to purchasers  of

HDB  flats  who  are  not eligible for subsidised  loans.

This is because they will fear that the commercial banks,

who  are  bottom  line  driven,  will  not  hesitate   to

foreclose  on the flat, if they are delinquent  in  their

debt servicing.  For many, the HDB flat could be the only

roof over their heads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues have alluded to, HDB currently has

a  number of assistance schemes, such as deferred payment

and  temporary reduction of debt service to help HDB flat

lessees affected by the economic downturn.  On the  other

hand, commercial banks are under no compulsion to provide

such assistance, nor are they expected to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I agree with the broad principle that HDB

should focus only on basic housing needs and there should

be  more  personal  responsibility  of  one's  investment

decision,   it  is  important  that  this   be   properly

communicated to the broad population and their  anxieties

allayed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks, for instance, could be asked to give

assurance  that  for HDB purchasers, they  would  provide

adequate moratorium periods and/or some deferred  payment

schemes  for  a  period  of time  if  the  borrower  were

affected  by  an  economic downturn and the  property  is

their only home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the HDB could further assure the

public  that the home ownership policy is not compromised

by  offering to step in, as the lessor, to work with  the

banks to assist affected homeowners in such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could also set up a special relief fund to

assist such homeowners. This could be for a transitionary

period of,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>

say,  3 years until HDB flat buyers are more astute  with

financial  planning and discipline and able to  do  their

sums and adapt to the change.

<br><br><i>Enhancing labour market flexibility</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC's proposal to cut employer's and employee's

CPF contribution rate to 16% each for the age group of 50-55  years has, as many of my colleagues before me  noted,

brought on the loudest chorus of anguished protests among

workers.   It  is understandable, given that  many  feel,

rightly  or  wrongly, that it is an indictment  of  their

economic  worth.   Many  are  also  skeptical  about  how

effective  the CPF cuts could be in helping  to  preserve

jobs, as well as open new ones for this age group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worry, to paraphrase the Minister of State, Dr

Ng  Eng Hen, is not that the elderly have lost all  their

value, but that their value is deemed diminished by  such

a move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is despite repeated assurances from Ministers

and  the unions that the cut is not to be seen as a  wage

reduction, or that their value is diminished, but  rather

as  a means to inject some labour market flexibility  and

is  only one amongst many measures aimed at improving the

employability of older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the bid to improve the overall

employability of older workers in the face of  persistent

structural  unemployment.  In fact,  after  Minister  Lim

Boon Heng's eloquent explanation of the rationale for the

CPF  cut  for  this age group, I think it  will  be  very

difficult  for  me  to  argue  otherwise.   However,  the

concerns  and  arguments of this group  are  not  without

merit and should be addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate these concerns, suggestions have already

been made to give older workers special treatment in  the

next wealth-sharing exercise, as well as paying deserving

older workers special bonuses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>

or introducing a monthly variable component in their wage

package.  Sir, I fervently support these proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I am also heartened to note that the

civil  service  has  taken  the  lead  by  introducing  a

Transitional CPF Top-up Component for this age group when

the new rates are effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also join in the call for employers to move

towards   a  more  flexible  wage  system.   And   again,

following  the  call of Minister Lim Boon Heng,  I  would

like  to urge the Government and the statutory boards  to

take  the lead in this instance and introduce the base-up

wage  system  wherever possible.  My fellow  MP  and  the

Deputy  Secretary-General of the NTUC, Mr  Matthias  Yao,

hit  the  nail  on  the head when he said  in  Parliament

yesterday, "The real issue is not the CPF, and the  long-term  solution is not in the CPF."  Indeed, the  mindsets

of  both  employers and employees must change to mitigate

the problem of structural unemployment.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore applaud the ERC's well-thought out

and   carefully  crafted  set  of  recommendations  which

attempt  to remodel the CPF system and shed the  excesses

and  clutter  it  had accumulated over  the  years.   The

practical phased-in approach of the implementation  which

allows people and institutions time to appreciate,  adapt

and accept the change is welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the specifics of the report and the

Government's  response,  lie  a  gradual  but  deliberate

shrinking of the social safety net.  One ultimate  intent

appears to be that of creating a more entrepreneurial and

self-dependent culture, necessary for survival in the new

world  order. This is indeed a worthwhile goal, but  will

no  doubt engender anxiety and disorientation among  many

ordinary citizens already reeling from the shock  of  one

of  Singapore's worst recessions and painful  adjustments

in jobs and cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to again urge the

Government to be even-handed in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>

the  implementation of the proposed changes, as  well  as

refine  and  modify some of the proposals to address  the

concerns  raised.  Public servants at the front  desk  of

the various Government agencies, policy makers, my fellow

MPs  and  I  myself would need to exercise  patience  and

balanced  judgement to hear the ground and take  time  to

carefully  communicate these changes and their rationale.

In  particular, I agree with my colleagues before me that

there  is a need to mount a public education campaign  of

all these changes and their implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these, I support the Government's response

to the ERC's recommendations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the break

now.  I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again

at 3.35 pm.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND AND RELATED CHANGES</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as we debate on the changes  to  the  CPF

system,  we  should ask: are we looking at the  immediate

effects  or the long-term benefits?  During the last  two

days, the bulk of the debate was on the immediate effects

of the proposed changes.  Many Members spoke about the 4%

reduction  of CPF contributions for those between  50-55.

To  me,  this cut is necessary. However, if the companies

feel  that this is unnecessary, then please pass  on  the

savings  to the workers as a variable component of  their

salaries, or as bonuses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Chiam See Tong remarked that it

appeared very strange to him because in the past  it  was

always  the  Opposition  that  was  asking  for  the  CPF

contribution  rates  to  be  cut,  and  now  it  is   the

Government asking for the cut.  This is indeed a "turn of

the tides".  Everything seems to have changed, but he has

not  changed.  In fact, just some two months ago, he  was

debating  with me as to whether the CPF reduction  should

be  exercised.  I told him that the most important  thing

was  to keep the job.  If you have no job, why talk about

CPF.   I  think we have to look at the long-term benefits

of  the  proposed changes to the CPF system  rather  than

their immediate effects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, this recommendation by the Economic

Review Committee can be described as wei min licai,  fang

yan jianglai (minding the people's wealth, and looking at

the  future).  What are our concerns?  We are looking  at

an  aging  population.  Do we have enough to provide  for

our  retirement?  Do we have enough funds for our medical

expenses? If the Minimum Sum is not enough, then how much

is enough?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, many of our people are buying properties

beyond   their  means.  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang   mentioned

yesterday that he agreed with the Government's policy  of

gradually adjusting the CPF scheme.  In Parliament,  most

of  the  time,  I could not agree with the arguments  put

forward  by  Mr Low.  But on this occasion, I agree  with

him. I feel that he is speaking more and more like a  PAP

Member, and I begin to wonder who the Opposition is now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Special Account, the proposal is to change

from the 4-6-8% formula to a 5-7-9% formula. Mr Low wants

to  propose a further change to 7-9-9-6, making it  a  4-digit formula.  Inspiration for the 4-D punters!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the financial crisis in 1997, many people

thought  they  could  strike it rich  by  speculating  on

property.   Now they get their fingers burnt,  and  their

property  becomes a negative asset.  It is said  that  if

you speculate on property, you become

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>

a  landlord because you cannot dispose of it and have  to

hold  it.  Likewise, if you speculate on shares  and  get

caught  by a downturn in the share market, you  hold  the

shares and become a "share-holder".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may remember the "Hello Kitty" incident in

Singapore some years ago.  Many people thought that  they

could  make  a lot of money by buying up all these  Hello

Kitty  toys offered by a fast-food chain.  They ended  up

spending a lot of money buying stacks of hamburgers which

they  could not consume, and even landed up in court  for

disorderly behaviour while queueing up to purchase  these

valueless toys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, indeed, there are a lot of people in Singapore

who have a lot of money but do not know how to mind their

wealth.   When  the  CPF  Board  relaxed  the  rules  for

withdrawal, they just spent their savings as though  they

were  not  their own money. They say it is gong  ji  jin,

therefore it is money accumulated by the Government.  Let

us spend them all while they are available to us. They do

not  realise that they are actually spending  away  their

own  money.   Some  may say, "I have  so  much  money  in

Medisave,  why  not  stay  in a  luxury  ward  and  enjoy

myself?"   They do not realise that money in the Medisave

account  is meant for medical care in their old age,  and

as  you grow older, you would need more money for medical

expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember the multi-billionaire,

Mr  Li  Ka  Shing  of Hong Kong once said,  "I  may  have

donated  millions to charity, but if I  see  a  five-cent

coin  on  the ground, I would bend down to pick  it  up."

Although he may have billions, the 5 cents still count to

him.   I  think Singaporeans are losing their  virtue  of

thrift.   Many people want to make maximum use  of  their

funds  in the Ordinary Account.  The Government now wants

to increase the contribution to the Special Account.  The

reason  is to make sure that people have enough funds  in

their  savings for old age.  You may not realise it.   If

you  cook  a little handful less of rice every  meal,  in

three  years' time, you would have saved a whole tank  of

rice.   I  think Singaporeans have forgotten  how  to  be

thrifty.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, fellow Member, Ms Penny Low, said

Singaporeans  did not know how to mind their  wealth  and

complained of "Money not enough!".  I must say that  they

should  know  that the CPF money is not enough.   In  the

United States there is a best-seller entitled, "Rich Dad,

Poor  Dad".  Perhaps our Government should publish a book

entitled,  "Rich Government, Poor Government" to  explain

why  we  must  have a rich reserve.  This  is  a  way  to

educate  our people, and we may be looking at yet another

best-seller!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people feel that these changes proposed by the

ERC  are  some sort of interference in their  lives.   No

matter  how they look at it, it is a good thing that  the

Government  has done, and we must commend the  Government

for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look at the long-term effects, we can see

that,  to a large extent, there is some problem with  our

existing seniority-based salary system, because  many  of

these  older  workers will be the first to be  retrenched

whenever  there is a retrenchment exercise.  We  must  do

something to help them.  Mr Low Thia Khiang said that  we

should  look  after  them.  I can  assure  him  that  the

Government is looking after them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many colleagues have also asked whether this 4%

reduction  in  CPF contribution rate would guarantee  job

security.  Of course, it is not as simple as that.  There

are  many  other things to do.  We have to look into  the

training  of  the  workers.  Last year alone,  among  the

500,000  training places, 20% were run by  NTUC  and  the

trade  unions.  We must train our workers  so  that  they

have  the right attitude, the right skills, so that  they

have good employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we create a balance sheet for

our  workers, on the assets side, you would have tangible

fixed  assets  such as the HDB flat or  private  property

which hopefully is not a negative asset.  And, these  are

current assets, CPF Minimum Sum, Medisave, etc.  The NTUC

has  also created for the workers some intangible assets,

such as the skills, the knowledge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>

and  their  work attitude.  These intangible assets  will

help  them  find a job.  There are many workers  who  are

choosy and they are not prepared to take on the jobs that

are  offered  to them.  I think we have to  change  their

mindset.   We  must train them in such a  way  that  they

would  not only have skills and good attitude,  but  also

goodwill.  So, in this respect, we must work very hard to

build up the goodwill of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this Committee headed by Dr Vivian

Balakrishnan  will look into not only remaking  Singapore

but  also  remaking the people, to change their  mindset.

Many  people  are saying, "Well, I have been working  the

whole  life and now you want me to start all over again."

It  is  just like I have been drinking PUB-supplied water

all my life and now we have to drink a new type of water.

We  have  to learn to drink this NEWater.  So,  everybody

has  to  learn.   We  must adapt  to  changes  and  start

drinking  NEWater and prepare ourselves for many  changes

to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Lee announced the

Government's acceptance of the Economic Review  Committee

Work  Group's  recommendations on Central Provident  Fund

and  related  issues.  Since then, 38 hon.  Members  have

spoken

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>

mostly  in support and also, at the same time,  to  raise

valid  and important points to reflect public concern  on

these  changes.       Sir,  I would  like  to  take  this

opportunity to respond to Members' queries and  concerns.

But  before  I  go  into the specific  issues  raised  by

individual  hon.  Members I would like to  say  something

about the employment market to provide a backdrop for the

Government's    acceptance    of    these    wide-ranging

recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to talk about the changes in the

external  environment  and the employment  market.   From

1990   to   1997,  Singapore's  economy  grew   strongly.

Employment  creation rose by 413,200 jobs in  total,  and

that  did  not  include jobs that  were  created  by  the

construction  sector.  Members will remember  those  were

the  boom  years, and the construction sector  was  going

great  guns.  So if we took those out, in effect, we  are

talking about creating about 52,000 jobs a year.  That is

more  than  the  average  cohort  of  young  Singaporeans

entering  the  workforce.  The result is full  employment

for many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much has changed in the last five years.

The  1997  Asian financial crisis caused  a  downturn  in

1998.   Then, after a brief recovery, we were hit by  the

global economic slowdown in 2001.  These are some of  the

shifts.  Some of these are cyclical trends which come and

go.   More  importantly, over and  above  these  cyclical

changes, we also have to face structural challenges ahead

of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of new players bigger and better

endowed  than Singapore is rapidly reshaping our business

environment.   Multi-nationals are on the  prowl  looking

for   locations   which   can  offer   more   comparative

advantages.   That is why Singapore and many other  ASEAN

countries   face  strong  competition  from   China   for

investments  and  job  creation.   In  the  manufacturing

industry, China's vast resources of land, labour and  the

sheer  enormity  of  its  domestic  market  give   it   a

comparative  advantage way ahead of us.  Furthermore,  we

are not only competing against countries like China.   In

the higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>

value-added industries, Singapore faces competition  from

the  mature  developed countries such as the Netherlands,

Ireland,  Denmark  and  Finland.   These  countries  have

highly   trained,  highly  skilled,  very  creative   and

innovative workers much needed by the knowledge economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of intense economic competition, and the

rapid  pace  of  corporate restructuring, our  employment

patterns  will change.  Instead of secure jobs in  stable

companies, the future will see frequent job creation  and

job  destruction  at  the same  time.   This  is  already

happening in countries such as the US, when many jobs are

being  replaced or lost, while new jobs are being created

in  different  industries.  So, how  will  these  changes

affect us here in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot compete on low cost manufacturing in

the  years  ahead  of us.  This is not where  we  have  a

comparative  advantage.   Instead,  we  must  shift  into

higher value-added production and services over the years

in  the  future.  A decade ago, investments in  Singapore

amounted   to  S$3.3  billion  (based  on  1990  prices),

creating  18,000  jobs.   33% of  these  jobs  were  jobs

requiring  people  with  at least  NTC-2  qualifications.

Last  year, investment commitments were more than doubled

at  S$8.3 billion.  But these investments will result  in

only  24,000 jobs.  However, three-quarters of these jobs

will be skilled jobs.  So, for every investment dollar in

future,  fewer jobs are going to be created, but more  of

these   jobs  will  be  skilled  ones  requiring  skilled

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, we are also experiencing more job

turnovers  in  Singapore.  Singaporeans of all  ages  and

educational  qualifications have  been  affected  in  the

process of economic restructuring.  Even when the economy

was  growing strongly in the years between 1991 and 1996,

the  number  of workers retrenched rose at an  annualised

rate  of  17%.   Whilst  we were enjoying  good  economic

growth,  some  years 6-8% growth, we  were  still  seeing

increased  number of workers being laid off purely  as  a

result of the retrenchment from structural changes taking

place in the company.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>

Whilst new jobs are being created, the demand will be for

more skilled and knowledge workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, older workers will be hard

hit  by  this  changing environment.   This  is  in  part

because  a  significant proportion of our  older  workers

have  only  secondary  and below qualifications.   Hence,

they  do  not have the skills necessary for the new  jobs

that  are being created.  But, even for some of the older

workers  with higher educational qualifications, on-going

restructuring is creating difficulties for them, and they

face greater job competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, the unemployment rate of

residents  aged  50  to  55  years  was  4.6%.   This  is

significantly higher than the 4.1% for workers aged 40 to

49  and  the 3.9% for workers in the 30 to 39 age  group.

However, it is still lower than the unemployment rate for

young  workers below 30, which stood at 5.5%.   Recently,

the  media and yesterday several Members in this House  - as  pointed out to me by my Minister of State, Dr Ng  Eng

Hen - had mentioned that the unemployment rate for the 50-55  stood  at 11%.  I think this was a mistake.  Somehow,

it has crept in.  People have got this impression that it

was  11%.   Let  me say that this was a mistake.   It  is

wrong.   It  is  not the right figure.  We  do  not  have

double-digit unemployment rate in Singapore, not even for

the  older  workers.  But this is no cause  for  comfort.

When  an  older worker is retrenched, he or she tends  to

remain  jobless  for a longer period.   As  Deputy  Prime

Minister Lee pointed out yesterday, last year, older  job

seekers  aged 50 to 55 experienced a median  duration  of

unemployment of 21 weeks, compared to 14 weeks and  below

for  younger workers.  The re-employment rate for workers

above 50 was 37% compared to 56% for younger workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are jobs available in Singapore, and most

of these older workers are able to do these jobs.  But it

may  be  a  different job, in a different  sector,  which

requires the older workers to make an effort to  learn  a

new skill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>

Otherwise, older workers will have to accept lower  wage.

And,  in  fact,  older workers above  50  who  found  re-employment  were already likely to earn less than  before

their  retrenchment, as mentioned by DPM  Lee  yesterday.

Clearly,  what  is happening is that we are  experiencing

growing  structural unemployment and  older  workers  are

facing the greatest risk of prolonged unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with growing global competition, changing

corporate  structures and the emergence of new employment

trends,  we  have  to  examine our existing  systems  and

structures to identify whether they will still  serve  us

well  in  the  new  operating  environment.   It  is  the

recognition  of  these new trends and growing  threat  of

structural  unemployment that has prompted Government  to

accept   the   ERC   Work  Group's   recommendations   to

restructure the CPF system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the CPF is concerned, this institution has

stood  the  test  of  time.  As both Senior  Minister  of

State,  Mr  Tharman, and DPM Lee had said,  the  CPF  has

served us well and is in no danger of a collapse.   Going

forward, we are confident that it will continue to  serve

us  well, provided we refine and retune the system for  a

more competitive environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not dwell on the core areas of

retirement,  housing and health care.   These  have  been

more than adequately addressed and explained by DPM Lee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In refining the CPF system, we must take care not to

add  to  or  reinforce existing rigidities in the  labour

market, which could eventually make the Singapore  worker

less   competitive   than  his  counterparts   in   other

countries.   It  must  be  made more  flexible  and  more

resilient so as to better serve workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government knows that these changes will cause

some  difficulties  for  some of  our  CPF  members,  for

example,  the  50-55  age group or  those  earning  above

$5,000.  We are sympathetic that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>

they  have  to make this adjustment.  But the  underlying

driving  forces  causing  job  losses  in  many  sectors,

namely,  global competition, corporate restructuring  and

the  changes  in  the employment trends,  will  only  get

stronger with time.  We did not cause these changes.  But

we cannot avoid them.  So we must adjust to them.  Sooner

or  later, we have to adjust.  It is better to make these

changes  earlier, so that the younger members  have  more

time  to  prepare and will be better placed to  face  the

realities of competitive global environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to the issues raised

by  hon. Members.  I will group them into key areas where

the  changes  have  been recommended, starting  with  the

Minimum Sum.  The recommendation is to retain the Minimum

Sum, the present framework, to reach $80,000 by July next

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang supported the concept of

maintaining  the Minimum Sum framework and  he  asked  if

Government were to revise the Minimum Sum, what  will  be

the  future Minimum Sum like.  I believe Dr Amy Khor also

supported  the  idea  of  raising  the  Minimum  Sum  and

emphasised that it should be done gradually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we started to revise the Minimum Sum back in

1995.  By next year, ie, after 8 years, we will reach the

target  of  $80,000.   That Singaporeans  need  a  higher

Minimum  Sum  in future is beyond doubt.  The  Government

will  study what would be an appropriate Minimum Sum  and

the schedule of implementation after we have achieved our

current  target.   The amount will be  increased,  taking

into  consideration inflation, higher standards of living

and the rising expectation of basic retirement needs.  In

response  to Dr Khor who pointed out that we should  move

gradually,  let me assure Members that we will  give  CPF

members plenty of time to adjust to any revision  in  the

Minimum  Sum in future.  We will certainly not rush  this

issue.  We took eight years in the last revision.  We can

take equally long, or maybe a little longer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether we will allow

members  to opt out from the Minimum Sum Scheme, if  they

have  a  pension plan.  Let me point out that,  in  fact,

this is already the existing position.  Members who, upon

reaching the age of 55, can enjoy a pension that will pay

them an annuity, or a monthly pension, more than what the

Minimum  Sum  can pay, will be allowed to withdraw  their

Minimum  Sum.  Those who have enough in their CPF account

can  convert to an annuity at the age of 55.  An  annuity

which will pay more than what the Minimum Sum would allow

them  to  draw on a monthly basis would also  be  allowed

and, in fact, we encourage them to withdraw all their CPF

to purchase their annuity, or to place it in a bank which

will  then allow them to withdraw a monthly amount.   So,

in fact, we already have this mechanism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to the Special Account where the

recommendation is to increase the contribution rate  from

our  present rate of 4-6-6 to 5-7-9 for the different age

groups.   Here, like Mr Seng Han Thong, I was also  quite

surprised  that  Mr Low Thia Khiang has  taken  a  fairly

strong  position on this issue.  He has agreed  with  the

gradual adjustment, and he also pointed out that it  will

get people to be more self-reliant.  I agree with him.  I

would  like  to  say  that his  idea  is  not  wrong,  in

principle.  And I am also very glad that he supports  the

Government's principle of putting more into  the  Special

Account and also cutting back on the contribution to  the

Ordinary  Account for housing.  However,  his  scheme  of

having  four  age  groups  contributing  7-9-9-6  to  the

Special  Account is quite drastic.  It is  front  loaded,

very heavy for the younger workers, and will make it very

difficult  for young people to start buying  their  first

house.   So  we have no reason to cause people  to  delay

marrying, starting a family and buying a home.  In  fact,

that is what our home ownership programme is all about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is that they over commit either by

buying  too  big  a house, or by upgrading  beyond  their

financial limits.  So the way to address this concern  is

to  have a Special Account which increases with age.   So

there has to be a balance.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>

The  ERC  Work  Group's recommendation  of  having  5-7-9

percentage  point  contribution to  the  Special  Account

strikes  a  better  balance  between  old-age  needs  and

housing  needs of the younger CPF members.  The  proposed

four-step  rate  by  Mr Low Thia Khiang  would  have  too

adverse  an  impact on the existing younger members,  ie,

those in the 35-45 age group.  The sharp increase in  the

Special Account contribution would seriously affect their

ability  to  service their existing mortgages.   For  new

members  adopting the four-step proposal  it  will  delay

their  ability to purchase a first property  using  their

CPF  savings.   So, on balance, I would not  be  able  to

support Mr Low's proposal and I would prefer to go  along

with the ERC's  recommendation  of  5-7-9.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron Eusofe, Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr

Andy  Gan, Dr Chong Weng Chiew and Mr Zainudin  have  all

spoken on the proposal to facilitate pooling of CPF funds

for  investment in private pension plans.   They  support

the  idea, but they urge the Government to enhance public

education  in the use of pension plans because they  have

serious  doubts  whether  the average  Singaporean  knows

exactly how to participate in a pension plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public education on the use of CPF investment

scheme  or pool pension plans would be critical  for  its

acceptance  by Singaporeans.  We agree that  Singaporeans

need to understand the concept and the mechanics of how a

pension  plan  works in order to be  able  to  take  full

advantage  of  the  potential to  enhance  their  savings

through  pension plans.  So public investor education  on

pension plans should be driven along three tracks  -  the

Government, the non-profit industry body as well  as  the

financial  institutions  and  fund  management  companies

operating pension plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Central Provident Fund Board, we

will   disseminate   information  to   enhance   consumer

awareness  of  pension  plans.  We  will  promote  public

investor  education  on pension funds  through  publicity

activities as well as in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>

collaboration  with  agencies, such as  the  Ministry  of

Community   Development  and  Sports  and  the  Financial

Planner Association of Singapore.  Industry bodies,  such

as  the Investment Manager Association of Singapore could

also help consumers learn more about pension funds.   The

relevant  Government bodies will work with these industry

players to promote better understanding of pension plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF Board will also study existing

restrictions,   such  as  foreign  currency   denominated

equity, and the difficulty faced by CPF members to have a

flow  through of CPF contributions to pension plans.   We

will  facilitate members' access to these pension  plans.

Finally,   the  financial  institutions  and   the   fund

management companies themselves should also promote their

products professionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with each party playing their part in providing

information and educational material, CPF members  should

have ample opportunities to better understand the use  of

pension plans for their financial planning.  What we hope

to  achieve  is  to  provide all the information  to  CPF

members  so that he or she can make an educated  decision

on  whether  to  join any pension plan.   The  CPF  Board

cannot make this decision for the members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung suggested that we confine

investments   under   the  CPF   Investment   Scheme   to

investments in unit trusts and pension plans, and not  to

share  purchases.  We have been moving in that direction.

We started out with a fairly liberal regime under the CPF

Investment Scheme where members can invest about  80%  of

their investible funds in shares.  Then we scaled it back

to 50% and, I think, more recently, it was scaled back to

35%.   On the other hand, we allow them to invest  up  to

100%  of  the  investible  funds  in  the  professionally

managed  funds.  We also allow them to use their  Special

Account  savings for such investments.  So we are  moving

in   that   direction,  scaling  back  on  the   personal

investments   in  shares,  where  there   is   a   highly

speculative

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>

element,   and   encouraging  members  to  move   towards

professionally managed funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the salary cap recommended by the ERC Work

Group,  that  is,  to  lower  the  salary  cap  for   CPF

contribution from $6,000 to $5,000.  Dr Teo Ho Pin  asked

whether  the reduction in salary ceiling will affect  the

members' ability to upgrade their housing type in future.

Sir,   let  me  point  out  that  the  changes  will   be

implemented gradually in tandem with CPF restoration.  We

still  have this outstanding 4% CPF that has  got  to  be

restored  for  most of the workers over the  next  three,

maybe four, years, depending on how the economy performs.

So  any negative impact on mortgage payment would thus be

moderated because we are not implementing this measure in

one  go.   The  labour market itself will adjust  to  the

reduction in the employer's CPF contribution, and part of

this  will  work  its way back into the  member's  salary

which he can, of course, use to service his mortgage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Andy Gan asked whether

reducing the CPF salary ceiling may lead to higher  take-home pay for those earning about $5,000 or above, but  as

a  result  of  higher take-home pay, they  would  end  up

paying  more taxes.  Are they not worse off than  before?

Reducing the salary ceiling for CPF will enable  them  to

have  a higher take-home pay.  We have to look at it this

way.  All along we have used CPF for the past 47 years as

one-size-fits-all  kind of plan.   Everybody  contributes

the  same amount.  But increasingly, we notice that,  for

the higher income earners, there is less need for them to

have  the  same level of mandatory saving  as  the  lower

income.  I think we should start to free up some of this,

allow those in the higher income to have more control and

discretion  over how much more they should save.   Hence,

the idea of trying to limit the CPF to serve the 10th  to

80th percentile group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC Sub-Committee's recommendation to lower

the salary cap from $6,000 to $5,000 should also be taken

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>

together  with  the  previous  recommendation  to   lower

personal  income tax.  So CPF members in this income  tax

group  facing a cut in the ceiling will also benefit,  to

some  extent, from the new tax regime that was  announced

by  DPM  in the Budget Statement.  Furthermore,  for  the

higher  income group, while income tax obligation may  go

up,  we  now  have  a mechanism called the  Supplementary

Retirement Scheme for them to make tax exempt investments

to  mitigate  their  tax burden.   So  there  are  offset

mechanisms  available for this group of people  who  will

enjoy  a higher take-home pay as a result of this  change

in the ceiling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about the income floor, the

recommendation  here  is to raise the  income  floor  for

employee's  CPF contribution for low wage earners.   Many

MPs  have spoken on this.  Mr Gan Kim Yong, Mr Heng  Chee

How, Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr Ravindran, Mr Sin Boon Ann,

Mr  Ang Mong Seng, and Miss Penny Low all supported  this

move.   They understand that it will allow the low income

group  to  have  a  higher take-home  pay,  and  this  is

welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea behind this move to raise the CPF floor

level  is to encourage more part-timers to enter the  job

market.   Because in the past, with a wage floor of  $200

attracting  CPF  contribution,  many  would-be  part-time

workers, or odd job workers, say that by the time the CPF

contribution  is deducted, the take-home pay  becomes  so

small   and  miserable  that  they  just  did  not   feel

sufficiently incentivised to take on the job.   So,  with

this  raise of the CPF floor to $500-$750, we  hope  that

more homemakers and housewives will join the workforce to

supplement  their  household  income.   Others  who  will

benefit from this change include the odd-job workers.  We

hope  that  the higher take-home pay from odd  jobs  will

encourage more of such people to enter the job market  in

this manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to point out that there is no reduction

to  the  employer's CPF contribution for  this  group  of

workers.  So

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>

although  they  are not making full contribution,  as  an

employee, they still receive full employer's contribution

and  they are still saving some money for their old  age.

And   with  the  higher  take-home  pay,  they  will   be

supplementing  the family income and, I  think,  that  is

good  for  the family.  Of course, there are  those  with

very  low  income  and they would have  great  difficulty

saving for their future retirement needs, and this is the

group  that may eventually have to fall upon some  social

assistance  measures.   We also  have  schemes,  such  as

Medifund,  to look after the very poor to help them  meet

their  medical  expenses.   We have  rent  and  utilities

assistance  scheme and also many other community  welfare

schemes  to  help the very poor.  When the  economy  does

well  and  the  Government is able to  achieve  a  budget

surplus, then we will try to give some CPF top-ups or New

Singapore Shares.  We can try to allocate more  to  those

who  are  poor and those who are in greater need of  such

help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of older workers aged 50-55 has been the

most controversial element of the recommendations of  the

ERC Work Group.  Many Members have spoken on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to respond to Mr Leong Horn Kee,

who  suggested that the reduction in CPF contribution for

the  group of workers aged 50-55 should not be done  now,

but  should be done for future cohorts of older  workers.

We  are  beginning  to  see the emergence  of  structural

unemployment,  as I explained earlier on.   It  would  be

unwise  and irresponsible for this Government to  pretend

that there is no problem now and to leave the problem  to

be tackled for future cohorts of workers.  The problem is

emerging now.  The sooner we tackle it, the better off we

are.   We  should give notice that we are going  to  make

this  move.  The change itself is going to be phased  out

gradually, so that it is not a sudden shock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo observed that the non-restoration

of  CPF  contribution for the older workers in  this  age

group will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>

result  in an 8% reduction in the Ordinary Account,  from

22%  currently,  to  14%,  and this  could  affect  their

ability to meet their mortgage payment.  Workers in  this

age group will see an 8-percentage point reduction in the

Ordinary  Account  as a result of the non-restoration  of

CPF  contribution,  together with  a  4-percentage  point

reduction  in the employee's contribution, and  also  the

migration  of  1-percentage  point  to  Medisave  and  3-percentage  point  to Special Account under  the  earlier

recommendation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the 4-percentage point cut in the employee's CPF

contribution  is  not lost to the employee.   It  becomes

higher  take-home pay for him.  So, he should be able  to

use  that to supplement his mortgage payment through  his

CPF  account.   Effectively, the reduction for  this  age

group is only 4-percentage point, because today they  are

already short of 4-percentage point which is not going to

be  restored.   So,  the effective reduction  is  the  4-percentage  point which will be migrated to his  Medisave

and  Special  Account.   We feel that  the  shortfall  in

mortgage repayment will not be as drastic as suggested by

this  presentation  that the Ordinary  Account  has  been

reduced from 22% to 14%.  The impact is less than that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind Members that DPM Lee

announced yesterday that CPF members who are affected and

are  in  this age group will be allowed to draw on  their

Special  Account  to meet their mortgage  payment.   This

will  help  those  in  the 50-55  age  group  during  the

transition period to ease their financial burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia yesterday supported the changes

recommended by the ERC.  But he asked that we should  not

micro-manage the CPF system, that we should let employers

and  employees to decide on their own contribution  rate,

based  on company performance.  Dr Jennifer Lee,  Mr  Sin

Boon  Ann and many other hon. Members asked whether a  4-percentage  point  reduction in  employer's  contribution

will be effective.  Will it only just hurt the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>

worker by cutting his CPF, without actually enhancing his

employability?   We  have  to look  at  it  in  totality.

Freezing the contribution rate at 16% is one of the  many

measures  to  help  enhance the  employability  of  older

workers,  and  these  are the older workers  who  are  at

greatest   risk  of  retrenchment  and   who   are   most

vulnerable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have, over the years, tried to narrow the

salary  minimum-to-maximum ratio for  workers  doing  the

same  job.   Because of our seniority-based  wage  scale,

this  minimum-to-maximum ratio is quite  wide.   In  some

industries,  it may be as wide as two or even  more  than

two.    However,  despite  many  years  of  effort,   the

seniority-based wage system is still deeply entrenched in

Singapore.   Not many employers are able  to  change  the

system on their own.  Any change will also result in much

unhappiness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members who expressed reservations over this

recommendation had also at the same time considered  that

wage  cost is not an insignificant factor.   For example,

Dr  Jennifer  Lee  noted  that wage  cost  is  a  factor,

although  she questioned whether this 4-percentage  point

reduction would make a big difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we agree that we should make

greater  effort  to  replace  the  seniority-based   wage

system,  or to progressively change it to a system  where

wages  are  paid based on value of jobs and  performance.

But  this  will take time.  We just cannot wait  for  the

seniority-based wage system to be completely  phased  out

over  many, many years, in order to address the immediate

problem  of rising structural unemployment.  We  have  to

move  on  every front.  We have to tackle the problem  in

many  ways,  because  this is a problem  that  cannot  be

solved  with  one  magic bullet.  It is  a  problem  that

requires  a plethora of solutions or efforts in order  to

address it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, neither can we leave it entirely to the workers

to  negotiate  with their employers, as suggested  by  Mr

Steve Chia.  If, in fact, our CPF structure today

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>

reinforces or makes the seniority-based wage system  even

more   inflexible  and  difficult  in  this   competitive

environment,  then we should be prepared  to  restructure

and  change  it to make it more relevant to  the  current

employment market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while many Members have questioned whether the

4-percentage  point reduction will be sufficient  on  its

own,  I would like to point out that, yes, a 4-percentage

point reduction is not a very big difference.  It is  not

a  solution  or alternative for the seniority-based  wage

system.   But  it is a move in the right  direction.   It

sends  a strong signal.  Here, I am cheered when Mr Ahmad

Magad expressed the view that, in fact, it is a pragmatic

way  to  address  the  rigidity  in  our  labour  market.

Likewise,  Dr  Amy  Khor  and also  Dr  Warren  Lee  have

expressed  support for this move and said  that  it  will

help us to address the seniority-based wage system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on balance, while this is an issue that many

Members  have  reservations, we must also recognise  that

the  seniority-based wage system is going to be here  for

quite some time, and we will have to begin to address it,

and  this is the first step that we are taking to address

this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that the freezing of the employer's

CPF  for  the  50-55  age group is unfair  to  the  older

workers,  and  that  the 4% saving is  not  a  sufficient

incentive  to employ workers.  As I said, in  itself,  it

may  not solve the problem completely, but if it is  seen

as  part  of the rest of the measures - some of  which  I

will  touch  on  later on - it is a  step  in  the  right

direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam went on to say that it is unconstitutional.

Surprise!   Surprise!   If  it  is  unconstitutional,  he

himself  has decided not to do anything, but he suggested

to  my colleague, the Secretary General of NTUC, that the

unions  should  do something about it,  because  this  is

unconstitutional.  If indeed this is unconstitutional, Mr

Chiam  knows what the remedy is.  If he feels  that  this

measure is unconstitutional, he knows how to take it  up.

So, I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>

ask  Mr  Chiam  to follow up, rather than ask  the  trade

unions to do it, because the representatives of the trade

unions have in this House supported such a move.   As  Mr

Nithiah  Nandan has pointed out, he has to deal with  his

members' anxiety and difficulty in finding re-employment,

and  he sees this as one of the helpful measures.    Even

though  it is not the single most important solution,  it

will  help  his  members in addressing  their  structural

unemployment concerns.  So, I will leave it to Mr  Chiam.

If  he sincerely believes that it is unconstitutional, he

certainly knows what to do with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong made an interesting point that by

freezing  the employer's CPF contribution for  the  50-55

age group, we are creating a situation where there is  no

longer  equal  pay  for  equal  work.   I  do  not  quite

understand the logic behind that.  I would like to  point

out that under today's seniority-based wage system, there

is already an element of distortion.  In some jobs, where

two  persons are doing the same work, an older person can

get  paid  one-and-a-half or even twice as  much  as  the

younger person.  So, there is already this element.  What

we  are  doing  with this freezing of the employer's  CPF

contribution  is to take one small step to try  to  level

the  playing field, to try to bring it back, and make  it

more  equal.   So,  I hope that Dr Ong, who  believes  in

equal  pay for equal work, will support the NTUC in their

effort  to  promote revision of the seniority-based  wage

system to promote paying workers by job rate.  If he does

so,  then  he will be helping us to overcome the rigidity

in our employment market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we accept this recommendation to freeze the

employer's  CPF contribution, employers should  also  not

just  stay  put and keep to the old mindset  about  older

workers,  and  be  too  quick to want  to  release  older

workers  in  the  event that they have to restructure  or

reorganise  their companies.  We hope employers  will  be

more   open-minded  and  more  willing  to  employ  older

workers.    Many  of  the  older  workers   are   equally

productive  and reliable in their jobs.  In this  regard,

our  employer  organisations in  Singapore  have  a  very

important role to play in changing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>

the mindsets of employers.  DPM Lee had already announced

yesterday that the Government will set the example in the

civil  service by providing civil servants with a special

payment,  the  Transitional  CPF  Non-restoration  Top-up

Component,  to offset the non-restoration of the  4%  CPF

contribution.   I certainly hope that this  will  send  a

strong  signal  to  employers in the  private  sector  to

consider adopting the same approach to return all or part

of this non-restored CPF portion to older workers who are

making  good contribution to the company.  Employers  can

do  so by way of giving mid-year and end-of-year bonus or

some other variable payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many other Members have also spoken about the

need  not  just to freeze the employer's CPF contribution

to enhance employability of the 50-55 age group, but also

to  enhance  their  skills.  Skill is  a  very  important

factor.   I  agree with Mr Othman Haron Eusofe,  Mr  Heng

Chee  How,  Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang  and  Dr

Maliki that skills are a very important factor.  This  is

another  area that the Government is tackling  with  full

commitment.  In fact, freezing the older workers' CPF  is

not  the  only  way  that  we are  going  about  tackling

structural  unemployment.  We have,  indeed,  implemented

programmes   to   help   older  workers   enhance   their

employability through skills upgrading and training.   We

have  put  in  place  programmes to  address  the  skills

mismatch between older workers and the new jobs that  are

being created in the economy.  We have introduced a  wide

range   of   programmes,  including  the  People-for-Jobs

Traineeship  Programme,  to help particularly  the  older

workers  to  acquire  the necessary skills  to  meet  the

requirements of the new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With immediate effect, workers above age 50 can

qualify for an additional three months, after the initial

six  months  of  wage  support under  the  People-for-Job

Traineeship  Programme.  This means we are extending  the

People-for-Job  Traineeship  Programme  to  a  full  nine

months,  provided they were recruited after  retrenchment

or  switched jobs with some retraining required  for  the

new jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member asked whether we would extend it for two

years.   Let  me  say  that we should proceed  with  this

extension,  try it out and then, based on the  experience

that  we  get from managing this more generous  programme

for  another year, we can decide whether it needs  to  be

extended  for  a  longer period.   We  are  open  to  the

suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to programmes like the People-for-Job Traineeship Programme, we have also set up a job task

force chaired by the Minister of State, Dr Ng Eng Hen, to

look  more  holistically into ways of helping  the  older

workers  who are retrenched or who are unable  to  secure

alternative jobs. This would, in a way, address the point

raised  by  Ms  Irene  Ng that we need  some  central  or

national body to look at the plight of the older workers.

This  Committee would continue to examine ways of helping

older   workers   to  enhance  their  employability,   to

facilitate skills upgrading and retraining for them.   We

will  certainly continue to work with the  employers  and

the trade unions to invest in worker training because  we

believe  that ultimately, it is the skills and competency

of  our workers that would ensure their employability  in

the  future.  It is more so for the older workers because

there  is an increasing challenge for them. Each  younger

cohort  of workers that goes into the job market is  more

skilled,  better educated, more capable  than  the  older

workers.  It must be so because of our education  system.

The   older   workers  are  going  to   be   increasingly

challenged.  We will have to invest efforts in continuing

education and training so that they can also keep  up-to-date  and  also  face the increasing challenge  from  the

younger workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah and Mr Heng Chee How spoke on the need

to  introduce greater flexibility in our wage  structure.

This  is  exactly  what  the ERC's  recommendation  about

restructuring the CPF scheme is all about.  We do want to

introduce greater flexibility in our wage structure.   So

freezing  the employer's CPF contribution for this  group

of  workers,  aged 50-55, should be seen as part  of  the

overall   package  to  enhance  employability  and   also

flexibility

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>

of  our  wage  structure for this group of  workers.   In

terms  of flexibility of wage structure, we will continue

to  promote and push the idea of building up the  monthly

variable  component  so  that companies  can  make  quick

adjustments  to  their wage costs when they  face  severe

business  downturn,  instead of having  to  rely  on  the

across-the-board CPF cut, as we had done twice already in

recent history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me respond to Mr Othman Haron Eusofe.

The  point he made was that older workers need to upgrade

their skills.  I agree with that.  As I have said earlier

on,  we will continue to invest in efforts to upgrade the

skills  of the older workers to help them cope  with  the

new skills demand in the job market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has suggested setting aside 1%

for  personal  training from the CPF  account.  Sir,  our

problem   today  is  that  allocating  the  limited   CPF

contribution  to the three accounts for home,  retirement

and  healthcare is already a difficult balancing act,  as

we  have  all debated over the last two days.  We  should

not further complicate the matter by creating another sub-account within the overall CPF framework, even though  it

is  for  an admirable objective of encouraging the member

to  be more responsible for his continuing education  and

training.  Let me say that this does not mean that people

will  have  no  opportunity to go for training.   On  the

contrary,   the   Government   already   provides   ample

opportunities  and  financial support  for  training  and

skills upgrading for all workers.  These programmes  will

continue  to be reviewed, updated and when necessary  and

beneficial,  it would be enhanced.  Let us  make  use  of

these resources, instead of trying to draw on the already

limited CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee mentioned a not quite related point

but allow me to respond.  That is the difficulty faced by

self-employed who want to renew their trade  licence  but

did not contribute to their Medisave. This is actually an

unrelated issue but let me assure him that the CPF  Board

is very sympathetic.  If a self-employed cannot renew his

licence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>

because  he is not up-to-date with his Medisave  payment,

all  we  require  is that he makes us a promise  that  he

would  make  some  payment.  We  will  work  out  a  very

reasonable  instalment payment plan for him  to  pay  the

contribution.  But bear in mind that it is not  really  a

payment  - he is contributing for his own future  medical

and healthcare needs.  Self-employed are well-advised  to

keep  their Medisave updated so that they do not run into

this difficulty.  But if they do have the difficulty, let

me   assure  Dr  Warren  Lee  that  the  Board  is   very

sympathetic  and we will help the self-employed  to  work

out an appropriate payment plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in summary, the ERC Work Group's

recommendation  is  wide-ranging.   It  touches  on  many

people.   It  sets  in  train a  series  of  changes  and

adjustments for the CPF system.  But these are not sudden

changes.  These  are  changes that  would  be  introduced

gradually  and progressively over time as we restore  the

CPF  to  the target contribution rate of 20% plus another

20%  from the employee.  If we do not make these changes,

if  we remain status quo, we will be allowing rigidities,

employment problems and inadequacy of retirement  savings

to become more deep-rooted and intractable.  If we tackle

these  problems  head-on  and  early,  we  will  have   a

reasonable  chance of overcoming them.  By acting  early,

quickly  and  decisively, we will  be  better  placed  to

enhance   our  long-term  competitiveness  and   economic

progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, only clarification, no

speeches, no debates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Minister

said  in  his  speech that my proposal  is  not  feasible

because  it  would affect the ability of Singaporeans  to

own  flats.   Is he referring to younger Singaporeans  to

own HDB flats or private properties?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the vast

majority  of younger Singaporeans' first home  is  a  HDB

flat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, further clarification. If

that is the case, then does the Minister agree that ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, that is a question. No

question is allowed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am clarifying with the

Minister.  Since he is saying that this is related to the

ability of Singaporeans to afford HDB flats, I would like

to  clarify  with  him  whether  he  is  aware  that  the

Government is committed to provide affordable housing  to

Singaporeans.  Currently, the commitment is that  90%  of

Singaporeans should be able to afford a 4-room flat.   If

the   change  that  I  propose  results  in  the  younger

generation  of Singaporeans not being able to afford  HDB

flats,  is  it  not  the Government's  responsibility  to

adjust the selling price of HDB flats?  I would also like

to clarify with him ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, Mr Low, I must insist that you

either seek your clarification or you resume your seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> No, I am clarifying with him

because he is saying ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then, do so. You are making a speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> No, I am asking a question and

asking for clarification and his views, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do it now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would he clarify that the

Government is basing affordability of HDB flats based  on

the  calculations of the balance in the Ordinary  Account

of the CPF that people have?  I believe that the more CPF

Singaporeans  have  in the Ordinary Account,  the  higher

would  be  the  selling price of a HDB flat.   The  other

clarification is he refers to ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, I must insist that you resume

your seat and let the Minister reply.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I have another clarification on

front rolling.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, just let the Minister reply.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's

policy  is indeed to help Singaporeans to own a home,  at

least  to  own  a home over their lifetime  of  work  and

saving, not to just have a home given to them.  You  have

to  work,  you have to save and you have to pay  for  the

mortgage.  So Mr Low's example of having 7-9-9-6,  having

a  very  high contribution to the Special Account, simply

makes  it  more difficult for the younger CPF members  to

put  aside sufficient CPF savings by the time they  reach

the  typical  marriage age of around 28-30  to  meet  the

downpayment  to buy a home that they want.  What  we  are

saying   is   that   we  should  not  handicap,   further

disadvantage  or make it more difficult for this  younger

group  of  Singaporeans.  We should  allow  them  to  put

sufficient savings into their Ordinary Account at a young

age  to  be able to afford their first home.  Thereafter,

they  will have to plan carefully if they want to upgrade

to  a  bigger  home,  or  to even upgrade  to  a  private

property.  The prices of HDB flats are not based  on  how

much money that is left in the Ordinary Account.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Ong, do you want to seek a

clarification too?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to clarify my point because the Minister  said

that  he could not understand what I meant yesterday.   I

was  saying  that the main problem of the  older  workers

being  unable to find a job is, we all know,  because  of

the  seniority-based wage system.  But if we  freeze  and

lower  the  CPF  contribution  rate  for  this  group  of

workers,  it may result in a certain reluctance  when  we

really want to push for a job-based wage system.  Because

from  the  employers' point of view, they say that  since

the  Government will take care of it from the CPF  front,

they  do not have to do anything.  Therefore, there is  a

reluctance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>

there.  From the workers' point of view, they say that if

they  are going to accept a CPF cut when they grow older,

why should they accept a job-based wage system?  That  is

what I meant that by introducing this CPF freeze, it  may

create some problems later when we want to push for a job-based wage system.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, he was actually

making a speech rather than seeking a clarification.   As

I  explained  in  my response, we should  work  from  all

fronts.  We do not just try to find one solution for  the

problem.  We all know that the seniority-based wage scale

is   a  rigidity  in  our  employment  market.   That  is

something  we have to address, in the light  of  all  the

changes  that are happening. Freezing the employees'  CPF

contribution for the older workers is one of the  parcels

of  measures  that  we  have to  do,  along  with  skills

upgrading, retraining for the workers, redeploying  older

workers  to  new  jobs in different sectors.   All  these

would  have to be done.  And also, the continuing  effort

to scale back this seniority-based wage system. The trade

unions  have  done much work on this.  In fact,  in  some

sectors, if I am not mistaken, from the starting  pay  to

the end point, it used to be a factor of 2.5.  Today,  it

is  probably back to maybe 1.5 or 1.8.  Even then,  there

is  still a valid element of seniority pay which, earlier

on,  we  heard  from Mr Lim Boon Heng how this  has  done

damage to Japan in its competitiveness.  We should  learn

from those lessons.  We should try as many measures as we

can in order to address this problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Low, what is your

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister mentioned that my

proposal is front rolling.  I would like to clarify  that

in  my  speech  yesterday,  I mentioned  that  the  ERC's

proposal is actually back rolling, especially for the age

group  between  50-55.   This group  of  people  actually

suffers  a  double blow. On the one hand, the  total  CPF

contribution  rate was cut to 32%, and then  we  increase

the contribution to the Special Account to 9%,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>

another  3%,  and  only  14%  of  the  balance   of   the

contribution is left in the Ordinary Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say this would put the age group in a

difficult  position  because of the  life  cycle  of  the

person's age, where a person has probably committed to  a

second  property or already upgraded to another property.

They  would  probably need more money  to  service  their

mortgage  loan.  Secondly, in such a life cycle, probably

their  children are in tertiary education,  like  in  the

polytechnics,  they may need CPF money to  finance  their

children's  education.   I  find  that  this  is  totally

unbalanced.   I am of the view that it is perhaps  better

to  have  a  balanced front loading that will enable  CPF

members  to save while they are young and still  working,

and not be in a position where they could lose their jobs

suddenly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I responded

to  Mr  Low earlier, I said that I agreed with his  idea.

In   fact,  I  was  happy  that  he  was  supporting  the

Government's  effort to try to put more  money  into  the

Special Account.  But the question is one of balance.  We

have  to  balance home ownership with retirement savings.

His  proposition will make home ownership very much  more

difficult  for  the younger group of Singaporeans.   Yes,

there will be more savings for them in their old age.  We

want to have a situation where there is a little bit more

balance  in the sense that the younger workers  will  not

face  an  uphill  task in putting aside enough  money  in

their  Ordinary  Account  to  finance  their  first  home

purchase.   And  if  they  want to  upgrade,  that  is  a

different matter.  They have to carefully work out  their

financial position, whether or not they will be  able  to

afford  it  with  the new CPF contribution  rate  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are already affected by the CPF cut

and  non-restoration, we are going to allow them  to  use

the  Special Account, as announced by DPM Lee, to  bridge

this  transition period.  But for many other CPF members,

the  sooner  we send the signal that they have  to  think

carefully for their future upgrading, the better off

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>

are  we.   Otherwise, more and more people will get  into

this  cycle  and they become over committed to  property.

They  buy  properties  right up to the  limits  of  their

capability.   I  do not think we are going  to  be  in  a

better position.

Bow Tan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow

HDB  will be implementing bank origination of HDB  market

rate  loans  from 1st January 2003.  Let me elaborate  on

this  and  related issues, as well as respond to Members'

comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me explain the difference between

HDB's  concessionary loans and market rate loans because,

I  believe,  some Members may not have fully  appreciated

the distinction between the two, and the fact that we are

actually making changes only to one and not to the other.

HDB  provides mortgage loans at a concessionary  interest

rate in order to ensure that HDB flats are affordable  to

those  who  need  them.   And  this  includes  first-time

subsidised flat buyers as well as second-time buyers  who

are  upgrading  from  the  smaller  flats.   We  peg  the

interest  to the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate  plus

0.1%.   Last  year, 63% of the loans granted by  the  HDB

were concessionary rate loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM Lee mentioned yesterday, the changes related

to  the  use  of CPF for the purchase of HDB flats  -  in

other   words,   the  valuation  limits  and   the   cash

downpayment requirements - will not apply to these loans.

In  other words, the majority of HDB flat buyers will not

be  affected  by these changes.  I believe  this  is  the

group of buyers that most Members are concerned about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from concessionary rate loans, HDB currently

also provides loans at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>

market  rates.  Market rate loans are for HDB flat buyers

who  have  either  previously consumed HDB  housing  loan

subsidies  or  who do not qualify for HDB  loans  in  the

first  place.  There are five categories of such  buyers.

Let me go through them one by one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Singapore permanent residents. Obviously, non-citizens are not eligible for HDB subsidy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Private property owners. Again, it is quite

self-evident that private property owners should  not  be

eligible for HDB subsidised concessionary rate loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The high income households. In other words,

those  who earn $8,000 or more a month.  Again,  I  think

Members would agree that this is self-evident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Those who have already enjoyed two

concessionary loans.  In other words, they have bought at

least  two  HDB subsidised flats, and are now  going  for

another  flat and therefore we do not wish to offer  them

any more concessionary loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Those who have previously enjoyed one

concessionary  loan  and are buying a  similar  sized  or

smaller HDB flat - those who are moving sideways or those

who are downgrading.  The rationale here is that for both

these  categories of buyers, they would  have  some  cash

left  over  from  the  sale of their previous  flats  and

therefore they can make use of this cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB market rate is pegged to the interest rate

that  DBS  Bank imposes on its ex-Credit POSB  customers,

and this currently stands at 3.75%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that I had informed this House

during  the  Budget  debate earlier  this  year  that  my

Ministry was reviewing the roles and functions of the HDB

to  see  in  what way HDB could better fulfill  its  core

responsibility;   in  other  words,  to   provide   basic

affordable  housing  to  the  majority  of  Singaporeans.

That is HDB's core responsibility.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, HDB should consider allowing the

private sector to take over those functions which  extend

beyond  this  core responsibility.  One such activity  is

the  provision of market rate loans.  As these loans  are

not  subsidised and are pegged to commercial rates, there

is  really  no  special reason for  HDB  to  continue  to

provide  them.  Furthermore, the private sector  is  well

positioned to provide such loans.  Currently,  there  are

more than 100 financial institutions licensed by MAS  who

are  allowed to provide housing loans, and this  includes

the  three local banks as well as the six qualifying full

banks (QFBs).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided that HDB will

no  longer provide market rate loans with effect from 1st

January 2003.  Flat buyers who are not eligible for HDB's

concessionary rate loans can take market rate loans  from

the many banks which are licensed to offer housing loans.

Existing  HDB  market rate mortgagors can transfer  their

remaining mortgages to the banks if they so wish.

<br>4.50 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat buyers can enjoy immediate benefits from

bank origination.  HDB market rate loans which are pegged

to  the  interest rate that DBS Bank imposes on  its  ex-Credit POSB customers currently stands at 3.75%.  Several

Members, including Mr Ravindran, Dr Lily Neo and  Dr  Ong

Chit  Chung, commented that while the banks may be giving

promotional  rates now, in the first  few  years  of  the

mortgage,  HDB's  market  rates  may  actually  be   more

attractive than the rates offered by the banks  over  the

longer term.  I wish to just alert them to the fact  that

this  market rate loan of 3.75% that is currently offered

by  HDB,  one  cannot assume that this rate  will  remain

forever.   If Members will recall, DBS Bank had  actually

stated its intention, at some point in time, to harmonise

the  mortgage  rate imposed on ex-Credit  POSB  customers

with  its board rate, and the board rate stands at  5.75%

at this moment.  If and when that happens,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>

then HDB market rate loans would also go up to that 5.75%

figure, and it may become more expensive.  In fact,  some

members  of the public have been asking us why they  must

take  loans  from  HDB  instead of the  banks  which  are

offering  more competitive mortgage rates, especially  at

this point in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the move in bank origination, HDB flat buyers

will now have more choices and the opportunity to take up

the  most  competitive interest rates.   They  may  enjoy

longer  repayment periods because I understand that  some

banks  do offer loans up to 35 years, as compared to  the

maximum  of 30 years which HDB currently offers.   Others

may  decide to offer customised special loan packages for

HDB  customers.  And banks also do not require mortgagors

to  fully draw down their CPF balances before giving them

the  mortgage loans, unlike HDB, and this may  appeal  to

some HDB flat buyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the implementation of bank origination will

allow  HDB to exercise greater flexibility in the  future

for  those  who take market rate loans to buy HDB  flats.

It will reduce HDB's role as a lender.  It will allow HDB

to  focus  on  the  provision of subsidised  housing  and

subsidised  loans.   It is another step  towards  further

relaxation of HDB's rules and regulations in the purchase

and  resale of HDB flats.  This is something that MND has

been  studying as part of the review of HDB's  roles  and

functions.    And  this  is  also  in   line   with   the

recommendation of the ERC to help home-owners to monetise

their  assets, something which the Government accepts  in

principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, allow me at this point to briefly explain why

we  have these rules and regulations in the first  place.

Our  public  housing programme started in the  early  60s

when  many  people  lived in overcrowded  and  unhygienic

conditions.   The  Government  needed  to  provide  basic

housing  fast.   At the same time, we wanted  to  promote

home  ownership to give people a stake in Singapore.   To

achieve   this,   subsidies   were   given   to    ensure

affordability.  Safeguards to protect HDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>

home-owners  were  also put in place.  For  example,  the

Housing   and   Development  Act  prevents  third   party

creditors  from recovering their loans from the  sale  of

the HDB flat upon the bankruptcy of the flat lessee.   At

the  same time, restrictions on the use of HDB flats were

imposed  to  ensure  home ownership and  to  justify  the

subsidies enjoyed by HDB flat lessees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules have been relaxed over time. In the

60s, lessees who wanted to dispose of their flats had  to

return  them to HDB.  In the early 70s, HDB allowed  flat

lessees to sell their flats at market prices in the  open

market  after  satisfying the minimum occupation  period.

In  the  80s,  the eligibility criteria for resale  flats

were broadened to include permanent residents as well  as

private  property  owners.  In the 90s,  the  rules  were

relaxed  further to allow single citizens to  buy  3-room

and   smaller  resale  flats,  and  also  to  permit  the

subletting of whole flats under certain circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By moving towards market practice, bank origination

can  gradually pave the way, at the appropriate time, for

HDB  to  further  relax  its  rules.   Mr  Ong  Kian  Min

suggested yesterday that with loans being given by banks,

we  should  at  the  same time relax rules  such  as  the

minimum   occupation  period  policy  and  the   existing

subletting restrictions.  Ms Irene Ng, Miss Penny Low, Dr

Warren  Lee,  Dr  Amy Khor and many others  made  similar

suggestions  along  these lines.  Sir,  I  believe  their

suggestions are reasonable and logical, and I would  like

to  inform  Members that MND is actively  studying  these

issues  to see whether and how we can make such  changes,

so  that  we  can treat HDB flats bought with bank  loans

more like private properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, while allowing banks to grant loans to give

flat  buyers  greater flexibility, I want to stress  that

this   greater   flexibility  also  comes  with   greater

responsibility.   Flat buyers should  exercise  financial

prudence and buy a flat within their means.  They must go

into the purchases

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>

with  their  eyes  wide open.  They  must  expect  to  be

subject  to the mortgage financing rules that are imposed

by  the  commercial  banks, including  credit  assessment

rules and foreclosure policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concern that the

implementation of bank origination is, in fact, a partial

withdrawal  by Government of its social safety  net.   In

particular, several Members, like Mr Ravindran,  Mr  Andy

Gan, Dr Lily Neo and Dr Maliki, have pointed out that the

HDB  is  generally very sympathetic towards flat  lessees

who  are  in arrears, and only repossesses flats  due  to

loan  default  as a last resort.  They are  worried  that

banks would be less forbearing compared to HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address these concerns, which are valid

concerns, by making the following points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I wish to assure Members that there is no

change in the Government's commitment to the provision of

basic  housing in the form of subsidised HDB  flats.   We

are  not  touching  our basic housing  safety  net.   Our

housing  subsidies  have enabled  the  vast  majority  of

Singaporeans to own their own homes.  When we started  in

1960, 9% of Singaporeans lived in public housing.  Today,

it is 85%.  Almost all of them, or 96% of them, own their

flats.   Concessionary  loans are  a  key  instrument  to

promote  home  ownership.   Hence,  the  Government  will

continue  to provide HDB loans at concessionary rates  to

eligible buyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with this move, the Government is indeed

pulling back the safety net a little bit at the edges for

those  who  should not need the safety net in  the  first

place.  They are the financially better off, they are the

ones  who  already have a flat.  And who are  we  talking

about?   Specifically, we are talking about non-citizens.

We are talking about the private property owners.  We are

talking  about  the high-income owners.  We  are  talking

about  the  second or even third-timers  who  are  either

moving  sideways or downgrading.  They are not those  who

are buying a flat

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>

for  the  first  time.  I believe this is  the  group  of

people  whom Mr Ahmad Khalis was most concerned about  in

his  speech.   And  they  are  not  the  people  who  are

upgrading to a second flat when they are ready to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not tenable for Government to continue to

maintain  such a wide safety net such that people  become

over-dependent on Government and are unable  to  exercise

individual responsibility.  This move will give them more

flexibility.  But, as I said, at the same time, they must

be  prepared to exercise more responsibility, as Dr Chong

Weng  Chiew mentioned just now, and as Dr Amy Khor agreed

with.  It is in line with what we have been talking about

in   remaking   Singapore  -  how   to   encourage   more

entrepreneurship and more risk-taking, how to let  people

take  more responsibility in their lives, how to be  more

dependent   on  themselves  rather  than  on  Government.

However,  let me assure Members that we are  not  yanking

away  the  safety net from those who need  it.   We  will

continue  to  maintain  our  home  ownership  policy   by

providing subsidised loans for subsidised flats, so  that

eligible  Singaporeans  can afford  good  quality  public

housing.   To  ensure that this remains so,  the  changes

announced  yesterday will not apply to  such  buyers.   I

wish  to assure Dr Ong Chit Chung that the social compact

between  Government and people that he talked about  will

not be diminished by these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, like banks, the HDB today already conducts

credit   evaluation  for  most  buyers  before   granting

mortgage  loans.  As a result of this, the  arrears  rate

for  HDB  market rate loan is not excessive.   Government

will continue to encourage prudence and responsibility in

housing  purchases,  regardless of whether  the  loan  is

provided  by HDB or by banks.  While it is probably  true

that  the  HDB  is  more forbearing  than  banks  in  the

collection  of  arrears, I must inform Members  that  HDB

does  exercise its right to take back the flats when  the

lessees  are in arrears and are unlikely to  be  able  to

repay their loans, although such cases are not that many.

It is important for buyers to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>

continue  to  exercise prudence.  We have  cases  of  HDB

mortgagors  running into arrears within a few  months  of

their  flat purchases.  In one case, the lessee was  only

able  to  service  two instalments before  he  went  into

trouble, and that was for his third HDB flat.  Obviously,

HDB  must constantly review its own mortgage policies for

flat  buyers who clearly do not have the means to service

their mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with bank origination, HDB flat buyers should

exercise greater financial prudence before taking up bank

loans.   We  cannot expect the banks to behave like  HDB.

It  is  not  their social responsibility to  do  so.   We

cannot, for example, tell the banks not to foreclose  for

hardship   cases,   as  suggested   by   Dr   Amy   Khor.

Nonetheless,   the   Government  recognises   that   bank

origination is a very significant move for some HDB  flat

buyers and, therefore, intends to keep certain safeguards

intact, in their place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Mr Ravindran that the current

protection  clause  in the Housing  and  Development  Act

against third party creditors will be retained.  We  have

no  intention of changing this.  This ensures  that  flat

buyers and their families do not lose the roof over their

heads as a result of claims by third parties, other  than

the  banks, in the event that the owners become bankrupt.

In  addition, we will continue to disallow a HDB flat  to

be  used as collateral for purposes other than to finance

its  purchase.  In other words, one cannot, for instance,

mortgage the flat to raise capital for business ventures.

The refinancing of existing loans will also be capped  at

the outstanding loan amount.  So, these measures will  be

adopted for prudential reasons and they will minimise the

risk of default in mortgage payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, some Members have suggested that Government

should provide a safety net for those who lose their  HDB

flats due to foreclosure by the banks.  I do not think it

makes  sense for us to pull back the safety  net  in  one

form and then replace it in another form, in the form  of

subsidised rental housing.  I would like to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>

stress  again that the individual must exercise care  and

prudence  in deciding what type of flat he wants  to  buy

and   how  much  he  wants  to  borrow  from  the   bank,

particularly  if it is for the purchase  of  his  second,

third or even fourth flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think Members here will know

that  HDB  looks at all appeal cases carefully and  where

there  are deserving cases, HDB will bend over backwards,

forward,  sideways, as Mr Ahmad Khalis put it, to  render

appropriate assistance.  So, I do not think that Dr  Lily

Neo has anything to worry about that she no longer has  a

role to play.  She will have a lot of things to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Members were also concerned that CPF Board

would  rank  second  to  the mortgagee  for  bank  loans,

despite  the need to safeguard CPF savings for retirement

needs.  As DPM Lee explained yesterday, allowing banks to

stand first is very necessary for prudential reasons.  In

addition, I would like to point out that in the  case  of

HDB  flats, there is really no change to the status  quo,

because  HDB  currently already has first charge  on  the

mortgage  loans that it lends out, followed by CPF  Board

standing second.  So, the banks will merely step into the

shoes  of HDB and take first charge on the mortgage  when

they  grant  loans to HDB flat buyers, come  1st  January

2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the changes related to the imposition of

valuation  limits  and cash downpayment requirements  are

necessary and major changes.  So, it is prudent that they

be phased in slowly to allow HDB flat buyers to adjust to

them.   Capping CPF withdrawals for housing purchases  is

necessary  to  encourage  prudent  housing  purchase  and

safeguard CPF savings for retirement.  The limit has been

set  at  150% of the property value initially,  gradually

going  down  to 120% over five years.  These limits  will

apply to HDB flat buyers who take loans from banks.   But

they  will not apply to the new market rate loans granted

by HDB between 1st September 2002 and 31st

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>

December  2002;  in  other  words,  this  year.   As  the

valuation limits will be gradually phased in, they should

not have a significant impact on the HDB resale market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat buyers taking loans from banks will pay a

minimum  10% cash downpayment, so that there is a  buffer

to protect their CPF savings against losses in case of  a

down  market.  Again, there will be ample time given  for

HDB  flat  buyers  to get used to this cash  downpayment,

because we will be phasing it in over five years.   There

will be no change, come 1st January 2003; in other words,

zero  cash  payment will continue from 1st January  2003.

The  cash  payment will then be imposed,  two  percentage

points   from  1st  January  2004,  increasing   by   two

percentage points a year until we reach 10% in 2008.   So

long  as  borrowers  do  not over-stretch  themselves,  I

believe  there  should  be  no problems  with  this  cash

downpayment requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will work with CPF, MAS, the banks and other

relevant  agencies on the administrative and  operational

issues  to  ensure that the transition from HDB  to  bank

originated loans will be a smooth one.  Flat buyers  will

be fully informed and they will be advised on the changes

so   that  they  can  benefit  from  this  move  to  bank

origination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, bank origination of HDB market

rate  loans  is  a  major step towards injecting  greater

flexibility into the public housing market.  At the  same

time,  it  allows  the private sector  to  take  over  an

activity  which  is not part of HDB's core responsibility

of  providing  basic affordable public  housing.   So  it

gives  flat buyers more choice and it allows HDB to focus

on what it does best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I believe it is in the right direction.

Together  with the changes that we will make in the  CPF,

this  will  ensure  that  our  home  ownership  programme

remains  relevant  in  the years  ahead  and  our  public

housing  market  can  cope  with  the  challenges   going

forward.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I be

allowed to seek a clarification?  The Minister said  that

MND is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>

reviewing regulations to relax restrictions on HDB  flats

purchased  with bank loans.  Does the review  cover  also

HUDC  flats  that have not been privatised but  they  are

also purchased with bank loans?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> HUDC flats that are not privatised,

if  they are covered by the Housing and Development  Act,

yes, they will be part of the review.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b>

Madam, may I clarify with the Minister?  For the purchase

of  HDB flats where the owners can actually get the loans

from the bank, would they also be allowed to buy the  CPF

housing protection insurance, in this case?  Would it  be

affected?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, I believe that those who take

the  housing loans from the banks will be required to buy

housing protection insurance (HPS).

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> From the CPF Board?

<br>5.14 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance

(Mr Lee Hsien Loong):  Mdm Deputy Speaker, it has been  a

long  debate and I shall be brief.  I would like to  take

up  just  three  or  four  points  which  have  not  been

addressed by the two Ministers and then wind up with some

general remarks on the whole thrust of this approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the 50-55 age group. This is the key and

most controversial recommendation in the ERC report -  to

cap the employer's CPF contribution for this age group at

16%.   What  is not challenged, and what all the  Members

agree,  is  that  older workers in  this  age  group  are

vulnerable.   They  are vulnerable  to  competition  from

labour  forces elsewhere, better educated or  less  paid.

They  are  vulnerable because their education and  skills

levels  are lower than younger workers, and also  because

the seniority-based wage system ends up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>

paying   them   more  than  productivity  can,   strictly

speaking,  justify.  The question is how  to  solve  this

problem.  Training and skills upgrading, that is a given.

We  need to do it, but it is not easy.  And if you  heard

Mr Nithiah Nandan, you will know that it is a slog.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to bring wage costs in line with, or at

least,  more in line with, productivity.  We will  tackle

the  seniority-based wage system.  But doing  that  is  a

prolonged and arduous process.  Because the labour market

is  inflexible downwards, not just in Singapore  but,  in

fact,  everywhere.   Because  if  we  are  talking  about

bringing   down  people's  wage  levels,   the   national

psychological resistance is very, very strong.   Even  if

someone has lost a job, and has agreed to accept a  lower

pay  for  a  new  job, he has to overcome a psychological

hurdle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To undo the seniority-based system, either the older

workers must get paid less than now, or have their pay go

up  not  as  fast as the younger workers and as  fast  as

productivity.   Hopefully, over a period  of  time,  this

will  narrow the gap and reduce the problem.  But neither

is  easy  to  accept.   To bring down  wages  immediately

generates a strong psychological reaction.  To go up less

slowly   than  other  people  will  generate   the   same

psychological reaction, as we can see when we are talking

about  the non-restoration of CPF in this case.   We  are

not  talking  about bringing down the CPF rate.   We  are

just  saying,  hold  it while the CPF  rates  go  up  for

others,  and your wages will go up in time.  But this  is

not easy to accept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF adds to wage costs, because it is a

compulsory  scheme.  I did not use to  believe  this.   I

used  to  argue  that  the  CPF is  the  worker's  money.

Putting $1 into his account, it is the same as paying him

$1,  and  he does not mind.  And the employer should  not

mind too.  So it is not a tax.  But, actually, the worker

does mind.  The worker prefers $1 taken home, instead  of

$1  locked up on his behalf.  Because what he took  home,

he  could  save if he wishes.  What is locked up  on  his

behalf, he cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>

spend even if he wants to.  So when you impose the CPF on

top   of   wages,   particularly   the   employer's   CPF

contribution rate, in fact, you are adding to wage  costs

and adding to the inflexibility of the wage system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for older workers who are most vulnerable, the

less you do this, the less problem you are going to cause

their  employment prospects.  In fact, because wages  are

seniority-based and the CPF is a percentage of the wages,

when  everybody  has a 20% rate of CPF contribution  from

the  employers,  the older workers have a  higher  burden

than  the younger workers.  So this is a good reason  why

if  you  want to lower the burden on employment of  older

workers,  we have to lower the CPF contribution rate  for

older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said it is unconstitutional and that it is

an   enormity  which  has  just  been  perpetrated   upon

Singaporeans.   But  there  is  nothing   new   in   this

principle.  Already, there is a step-down at 55 and there

is  another  step-down at 60.  What we are saying  is  to

start   stepping  down  at  55,  in  terms  of  the   CPF

contribution  rate, is a little bit late.  Let  us  start

stepping  down at the age of 50.  So from 40%, below  50;

you  go to 32%, when you cross 50; and then to 20%,  when

you reach 55.  So there are even steps downwards in order

to  help  workers adjust, and in order to help keep  them

employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four percent on the employer's CPF is not going to

make a big, or immediate, difference to retrenchment  and

hiring  decisions.  It is not a quick fix.  But it  is  a

step in the right direction.  The employers who have been

interviewed, none of them want to take the flak and  say,

"Well, this is going to help me."  So they say, "Well, 4%

is neither here nor there.  I don't need this."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Seng Han Thong said just now, "If you do not

need  it,  why  don't you contribute it to  the  workers'

welfare fund?"  I would put an opposite argument, just to

think through this exercise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>

Supposing we had taken literally the argument,  which  Dr

Jennifer  Lee  made  yesterday,  to  say,  reducing   the

pressure  is  bad because then you will not  address  the

seniority-based  wage  system.  We  should  increase  the

pressure.  Supposing we had then said that, in  order  to

increase the pressure, we will raise the CPF contribution

rate for this group from 20% to 24%.  Can you imagine the

row,  the uproar, the outrage, the anxiety and the  extra

burden  which is put on older workers, and  how  that  is

going  to  impact  the  employers  and,  therefore,   the

employees?   It is still the same 4%.  But  I  think  the

psychological effect would have been different.  Now,  we

are talking about reducing it by 4%, from 20% to 16%.  It

is  a  small adjustment, but it is an adjustment  in  the

right direction, and one which will help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also reducing the employee's contribution by

4%,  from 20% to 16%.  Members have not discussed this  a

great  deal, but it is a significant move too.   In  most

cases,  when we reduce the employee's contribution  rate,

it will flow straight through to higher take-home pay for

the  worker.  It will not affect the employer.   But,  in

some  cases, if the employer is facing a tough  situation

and   if  he  has  to  retrench,  I  think  a  lower  CPF

contribution  will  make it easier for  the  employer  to

persuade the worker to accept a wage cut, keep his  take-home  pay  constant, reduce total wage cost and keep  his

job.   Without  that, wage cut means less take-home  pay.

With that, there is some scope for adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by reducing the combined CPF contribution rate to

32%  for  this age group, we are actually making the  CPF

system less inflexible.  And we are not intervening  more

into the labour market.  We are intervening less into the

labour  market by offsetting part of the negative effects

of  the  seniority-based system.  And we  are  making  it

easier for older workers to hold on to their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This non-restoration is part of the move to a more

competitive  wage  structure in Singapore.   We  have  to

reduce the statutory component, not as a substitute

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>

for greater wage flexibility, but as part and parcel of a

broader shift.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have to start doing this now. We can address

the  problems of the present cohort of the  50-55s.   The

civil  service has got the TCTC.  It is a catchy acronym.

I  hope  the idea also catches on.  It is not  a  problem

which  is  upon  us today, but it is a problem  which  is

coming  upon us which we can see and we can either  start

addressing  it  now, or we can talk about  it,  and  then

postpone  the  problem for 4-5 years.  I  discussed  this

with  several of the union MPs before we decided on this.

And  I  said,  the alternative for us is to  say,  "Let's

postpone  this  problem.  Restore to  40%.   After  that,

gradually  bring it back down again because I would  have

given  due  warning, 4-5 years would have  passed  and  I

would  take  another five years to bring it down.   Would

you prefer that?"  And they said, "No.  You know there is

a  problem.  You are at the point when people accept that

things have to be changed.  Better change now."  Over  10

years, any number of mishaps can come along.  We may have

another  crisis  come our way, better to  get  this  done

with, and past.  And that is why we are proposing to  act

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue, which I would like to address

briefly, is bank loans - the question of charge reversal.

Several  MPs  have  asked why we need  to  do  this.   Mr

Ravindran  said  the present system of CPF  having  first

lien  is fundamentally sound.  Dr Lily Neo asked why  fix

it if it ain't broke.  I can understand this because this

is an arrangement which we have made for 21 years and now

we   have  decided  to  change  the  arrangement.    But,

unfortunately, there is a need to change the arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic reason is this. As things now stand, when

you  have  a  mortgage loan, it is not really  a  secured

loan.   A secured loan means that when you borrow,  there

is a house, the house is a surety.  If you do not service

the  loan, the house is available and it can be sold  and

the  bank can recover its money.  Therefore, the bank has

confidence.  But as it stands today, the CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>

ranks  first.  And it is not just 10% or 20% of the value

of  the  house which is the CPF's claim, but all of  your

CPF money you put into the house month by month, year  by

year, stands first, and stands more and more at the front

and grows every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as you service the loan, as the loan matures, far

from the bank feeling relieved that the journey is nearly

over,  in fact, the bank is getting into a more and  more

serious   position  when  its  loan  is  less  and   less

collateralised.  This is fine if your property  value  is

increasing because then, although you put money  in,  the

value  increases even more and there is always a  buffer.

And  before  you get into trouble, you sell the  property

and move on to another project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the property value falls, which is not

inconceivable, then beyond a point, the mortgage may  not

be  collateralised at all because the CPF you have put in

may  be worth more than the current value of the property

after  five  or seven years.  And then the bank  actually

has an unsecured personal loan in everything, but name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We start off with the 20% cash buffer when you buy a

house.  It is a requirement which MAS imposed in 1996 and

which   we  have  stringently  adhered  to  despite   any

entreaties, pleadings, demands, requests, we  just  said,

"no".   Because we knew we were in a vulnerable  position

and we needed this 20% cash buffer at the bottom.  It  is

a  buffer for the bank and, then beyond that, buffer  for

the  CPF.   But  because the CPF claim  builds  up  quite

quickly  within  five  or  six  years,  the  cash  buffer

actually  is  reduced to zero, unless the property  value

has gone up.  So the cash buffer is necessary, but it  is

not sufficient.  We have not had a serious problem up  to

now.   Firstly, because property values have  appreciated

steadily  over the last couple of decades, and typically,

people  have  resold properties frequently.  On  average,

from  bank  mortgages, the duration is only  five  years,

which  means  on average, every five years,  people  sell

their  property, they pay off their mortgage, they go  on

to  buy  a new property.  But going forward, this is  not

going to be the situation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason we have not had a problem so far

is  because, even though some of the mortgages are  under

water,  people have continued to service their mortgages.

It  is partly a cultural thing.  You feel that it is your

duty to pay back the loan, and not just to default on it.

And  partly  it  is  our good luck that our  unemployment

rates are not that high and most people are working  and,

as  long as he is working, the customer will service  the

loan.  But that is not the experience in other countries.

In  America, if your loan is under water, you  ask,  "Why

should  I  bust my guts out?  I return the  keys  to  the

bank,  and  good luck to the bank."  Now,  if  ever  that

happens  to Singaporeans, we are in very serious trouble.

Therefore, we have to reverse the lien.  The CPF is  your

own  money.  You are borrowing from the bank.   The  bank

has to come first before you and therefore CPF.  Just  as

you  borrow from HDB, HDB has to come first.  So you must

pay back the bank before you get back your own money.  It

is a basic principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, refinancing. Mr Leong Horn Kee suggested

allowing  refinancing of existing loan not to be  subject

to the Valuation Limit.  We have examined this in detail.

The  arguments  go  both ways.  It is  not  a  very  tidy

situation because the old loans were on one set of  rules

and the new loans are put on to a different set of rules,

reversal  of  lien plus the Valuation Limit.   But  after

much deliberation, we have decided in MAS that if you are

refinancing with another bank, then the new mortgage must

be  subject to the Valuation Limit, because there will be

a  new agreement.  The new agreement has to have a charge

reversal and you must have the bank standing first, which

is  different from the status quo where the  bank  stands

second.   We  cannot allow the CPF to have second  charge

and,  on  top  of that, to have the CPF not capped  by  a

Valuation Limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you are going to a second bank to refinance

your  loan,  then new rules will apply.  We also  do  not

want  the second bank to make a new mortgage on old terms

and  have the CPF rank ahead, in which case, the  problem

which was with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>

the  first  bank is now taken and has moved to  a  second

bank, and we will be in a situation where you do not know

where  the  bad  loans are and the bad  loans  are  being

shuffled  around.   So, if we have a refinancing  with  a

second bank, then the new mortgage will be subject to the

Valuation Limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, if your current bank is willing to

vary  and  improve  the  terms of the  mortgage,  without

reversing  the  lien  position,  and  without  having  to

conclude a new agreement, it is between you and your bank

and the CPF is not involved, then we will allow that.  It

is  not entirely what Mr Leong Horn Kee hoped for, but it

is what is practical to do in this situation and, I hope,

will be of some help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I make a few

remarks on the overall philosophy of this exercise.   The

CPF is a critical part of our social safety net.  It is a

good  system.   It is based on individual  responsibility

and  on  self-funding.  It is comprehensive.   It  covers

retirement  as well as housing and medical expenses.   It

allows  members  a very wide range of investment  choices

and, if we allow pension funds, an even wider range.   It

enables Singaporeans to own homes, gives them a stake  in

Singapore and substantial savings, whose value they  will

want to protect.  So, they will not take a chance with  a

government  which will devalue our currency  or  let  the

country go down the drain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is a unique system. It evolved in special

circumstances during the period of our economic take-off.

It  was  built  up  over  many  years,  starting  at  10%

contribution  rate  in  1955, long  before  independence.

After  independence, we built up the  contribution  rates

steadily year by year.  At the time of our economic take-up  when the economy was growing at 8%, 9%, 10%, 12%  per

year, wages went up correspondingly, and we put aside 2%,

3%,  sometimes 4%, a year into the CPF as wages went  up,

in  order to enable Singaporeans to own their homes.   By

1984 - which was nearly 20 years after

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>

independence - we had built up the rate from 10% to  50%.

But  we could not keep it there.  The following year,  we

had a sharp recession, we had to bring the rate back down

all the way to 35% to get out of the recession.  Then  we

built it back up again painfully.  This time, we did  not

aim for 50%; we aimed for 40%.  It took us six years.  We

got there in 1991.  But when the Asian crisis struck,  we

had  to  reduce the rate in 1998, and we had to bring  it

down to 30% again.  Now we are back to 36%, hoping to get

back to 40% over the next 2-4 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we lose this unique institution, we will never

get  it  back again.  Therefore, we have to build on  and

preserve this system.  Every country needs to provide for

the  retirement needs of its people.  Our system is based

on  savings.  In other countries which do not  have  high

savings  rates and a CPF-type system, their  solution  is

tax  - social security based on tax or on social security

contributions  -  pay as you go.  In  other  words,  this

generation of young people pays tax to contribute to  the

pension  for  the current generation of old people.   And

when  they themselves grow old, they had better hope that

there  are  enough young people who are  willing  to  pay

enough  taxes  to  meet their needs.  It creates  serious

problems of solvency and sustainability.  It has done  so

in  Europe.   The Americans have had their share  of  the

problems.  Our CPF avoids that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee recommendations will

adjust the balance in the CPF between the retirement  and

housing needs.  It will focus the scheme on the needs  of

the  central group of Singaporeans, ie, those between the

10th  and the 80th income percentiles, and it will reduce

the  negative impact of too high a CPF rate on the  older

workers.   These are very important improvements  to  the

CPF system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB changes are also a significant policy shift.

It  is not just a matter of banks offering lower mortgage

rates  than the HDB can.  The issue is how extensive  our

housing   safety   net  should  be,  and   how   we   can

progressively allow and encourage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans  to  be  more  self-reliant,   rather   than

depending on the Government for many of their needs.  The

core of our home ownership policy remains unchanged.  But

at the margins we need to adjust, not only to free up the

housing  market, but to have Singaporeans make their  own

decisions, and take responsibility for them.  If  we  are

talking  about  being entrepreneurial, taking  risks,  or

about   people   being   self-reliant,   answering    for

themselves,  then  we have to be self-propelled  and,  we

have to be, to a much greater extent than before, on  our

own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By shifting to bank origination, and allowing banks

to  take first charge when granting housing loans, we are

taking just one important step in this direction.  We are

taking  it  carefully, we know there are risks,  we  know

there will be consequences, and there will be some people

who  will  still think there is a safety net.   And  when

they  realise there is not one, they will try and  create

one,  and may look for Dr Lily Neo and the other  Members

to  ask  for one.  But these are problems which  we  will

have to manage in the context of our moving forward to  a

more   self-reliant  system.   And  today's  move  is   a

significant  step,  as  far as a housing  safety  net  is

concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank all Members for participating in this

debate  and I beg leave, Mdm Deputy Speaker, to  withdraw

the Motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion, by leave, withdrawn.

<div align="center"><b>CURRENCY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>5.38 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the Government announced its

plans  to  merge the Board of Commissioners of  Currency,

Singapore (BCCS) with the Monetary Authority of Singapore

(MAS).  The merged entity

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>

would still be called the MAS.  This is an organisational

change to streamline our institutional structure.   There

will  be  no change in the way currency is managed.   The

Singapore  dollar notes and coins that are  currently  in

circulation  will  continue to be  fully  backed  by  the

Currency Fund.

<br><br><i>Background</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCCS was set up in 1967 to implement the currency

board  system,  which  Singapore  then  practised.    The

features  of the currency board system were:  first,  the

exchange rate was fixed between the domestic currency and

a  specified foreign currency; second, domestic notes and

coins  were fully convertible at the fixed exchange rate;

and  third,  the  domestic currency was fully  backed  by

foreign assets or gold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has progressively evolved away from the

system  of  a  fixed  exchange rate since  the  Singapore

dollar  was floated in 1973.  In 1982, convertibility  of

domestic  currency notes and coins into  gold  and  other

foreign  currencies on demand was repealed.   Today,  the

exchange rate of the Singapore dollar is managed by  MAS,

against  a  basket  of  currencies of  our  main  trading

partners, with the objective of keeping inflation low and

maintaining the purchasing power of the Singapore dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only feature of the currency board system that

we  have  retained  is the full backing  of  currency-in-circulation  by  external assets.   Hence,  Singapore  no

longer  operates a currency board system, except for  the

full   backing  of  currency-in-circulation.    This   is

required  under the Currency Act, and has contributed  to

confidence  in the Singapore dollar.  This  feature  will

not  change  after  the  merger.  Currency-in-circulation

will  continue to be fully backed by external assets  all

the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a broader perspective, confidence in the

Singapore dollar exchange rate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>

derives  from  the  consistency  and  soundness  of   our

monetary  and  fiscal policies, as well  as  our  foreign

reserves.  The merger of MAS and BCCS will enable  us  to

rationalise  common  functions  and  realise   efficiency

gains,  without compromising the overriding objective  of

managing the currency and maintaining confidence  in  the

Singapore dollar.  MAS will become a full-fledged central

bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks legislative amendments to the

Currency Act to effect the merger of MAS and BCCS.   This

Bill also contains other amendments which are intended to

update  and  streamline certain procedures and provisions

in the Currency Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now highlight the main amendments

proposed in the Bill.

<br><br><i>BCCS Funds</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Currency Act requires that the face

value  of  the currency issued by BCCS must be  at  least

100%  backed by external assets in the Currency Fund.   A

separate fund - the Currency Reserve Fund - serves  as  a

buffer  for  the  Currency Fund,  as  the  value  of  the

external  assets  that  make up  the  Currency  Fund  may

fluctuate.   All  dividends, interest, or  other  revenue

from the Currency Fund and the Currency Reserve Fund  are

paid  into a Currency Fund Income Account.  All  expenses

incurred by BCCS are charged to this Currency Fund Income

Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the merger, the Currency Fund and the Currency

Reserve  Fund will be combined into one fund, which  will

still be called the Currency Fund.  The new Currency Fund

will  continue to provide at least 100% backing  for  the

currency-in-circulation at all times.   Clause  6  amends

section 21 to provide that assets in the Currency Fund in

excess   of  100%  of  the  face  value  of  currency-in-circulation could be transferred to MAS' other  funds  at

any time.  Section 21 is also amended to provide that any

deficiencies  in the Currency Fund will be made  up  from

MAS'  funds.  If MAS' funds are insufficient, the balance

of  the  deficiency will be paid out of the  Consolidated

Fund.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 repeals sections 22A and 23 pertaining to

the  Currency Reserve Fund and the Currency  Fund  Income

Account.   Under  the new arrangement,  income  from  the

Currency Fund will be ploughed back to the Currency  Fund

itself,  and  expenses arising from  currency  issue  and

investments will be charged against the Currency Fund.

<br><br><i>Definition of Legal Tender</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, section 13 provides the legal tender

limits  for  the various denominations of  the  currency.

The notes and coins issued by BCCS are legal tender up to

the  value  specified in section 13 for  the  purpose  of

discharging any debt or paying for goods and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, BCCS has regularly received queries

from  the  public  regarding  the  definition  of  "legal

tender".  Some members of the public were unclear whether

merchants could refuse to accept certain coins  of  small

denomination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment for goods and services is essentially a

contractual  agreement  between a  willing  buyer  and  a

willing  seller.   Neither party can be forced  to  enter

into a transaction unless he willingly does so.  In order

to  clarify the intent and purpose of the law,  clause  5

will amend section 13 to allow a merchant to specify that

he  will not accept one or more denominations of notes or

coins  as  payment  for his goods or  services.   If  the

merchant does not specify any conditions on how he  would

like to be paid, then he must accept legal tender for the

settlement of the debt, or else the debt may be forgiven.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments in this Bill are part of the

legislative amendments required to implement  the  merger

of BCCS with MAS.  The proposed transfer of past reserves

from   BCCS  to  MAS  as  past  reserves  would   require

amendments  to  the Constitution.  This will  be  covered

separately  in the Constitution (Amendment)  Bill,  which

would be presented

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>

for  Second  Reading at the next available sitting.   The

Constitution  (Amendment)  Bill  will  also  propose  the

deletion  of  BCCS  from  the  Fifth  Schedule   of   the

Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>BILLS OF EXCHANGE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bills of Exchange Act provides the legal

framework  of  bills of exchange, cheques and  promissory

notes.  It was last amended in April 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Act for the purpose of

establishing a Cheque Truncation System, or CTS in short.

<br><br><i>Overview of Cheque Truncation System (CTS)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by giving an overview and benefits of

the  Cheque Truncation System.  Singaporeans have written

an  average of more than 83 million cheques a  year  over

the  last  10 years.  In 2001, the figure was 92 million.

Significant costs are incurred by the banking industry to

clear  these  cheques.  Today, after  a  bank's  customer

deposits  a cheque at his bank, also referred to  as  the

presenting  bank,  the bank will batch it  together  with

other   cheques  and  transport  them  to  the  Automated

Clearing  House.   The  Clearing  House  then  sorts  the

cheques  for  the  respective paying  banks  to  collect,

whereupon  each paying bank verifies whether the  cheques

can be paid.  If the cheque

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>

cannot  be  paid, it is then returned to  the  presenting

bank in the same way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the banking industry in Singapore

has  introduced new technologies to improve  this  cheque

clearing process.  An example of this is the magnetic-ink

character recognition (MICR) information on cheques  that

banks  have  been exchanging to facilitate faster  cheque

clearing.   However, physical cheques are still  required

by   the   paying  bank  because  they  need  to   verify

information such as dates and signatures on the cheques.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cheque Truncation System, to be launched later

this  year,  leverages  on  new imaging  technology  that

enables  banks to exchange electronic images of  cheques.

Cheques   will  be  scanned  when  deposited  and   their

electronic  images  will  be transmitted  throughout  the

entire clearing cycle.  The new system will use a private

network  with  public  key cryptography  to  ensure  that

images  are  encrypted and transmitted  securely  between

banks.   In  addition, the system includes a  centralised

image  archive  for  banks to store and  retrieve  cheque

images.   Since a cheque image contains all the necessary

information  required  by  a  paying  bank  to  determine

whether  the  cheque can be paid, there is no  longer  an

operational  necessity  for them  to  have  the  physical

cheque.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill contains amendments to allow banks to

present a cheque by electronic means in place of physical

presentment.  This Bill will also recognise the rights of

a  holder  of an Image Return Document, or IRD in  short,

which  is  a  document that banks will issue  instead  of

returning   the  original  cheque  when   a   cheque   is

dishonoured.   The amendments have been drafted  so  that

under  the new process, the respective rights and  duties

of the various parties to a cheque will be the same as at

present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other jurisdictions have passed, or are in the

process  of  passing, similar amendments to their  cheque

legislation.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>

United  Kingdom has allowed the clearance and payment  of

cheques    using   magnetic-ink   character   recognition

information  instead of physical presentment since  1996.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board is in the

process  of  getting Congress to enact a Check Truncation

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain the proposed amendments in

detail.

<br><br><i>Allowing   electronic  presentment  to  replace  physical presentment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill introduces section 87A that

will  allow  the  presentment between banks  to  be  done

through  electronic  transmission  of  cheque  image  and

payment  information  instead  of  the  physical  cheque.

However,  the  paying bank will still have the  right  to

demand that the physical cheque be presented instead,  if

it deems it necessary.

<br><br><i>Image Return Document (IRD)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 also introduces section 87B, which will

allow  for  the presenting bank to issue an Image  Return

Document  (IRD) instead of returning the original  cheque

to  its  customer  if  the cheque is dishonoured  by  the

drawer's bank.  An IRD is a banking document bearing  the

image   of   the  cheque  together  with  other   related

information.   However,  if  the  customer  requires  the

original cheque, he or she can still request it from  the

bank.   The  bank may also choose to return the  original

cheque  instead of issuing an IRD.  If the holder of  the

IRD  deems that the reason for the original dishonour  is

no  longer  valid, for instance, the original cheque  was

post-dated  or the account had insufficient  funds,  this

holder  can  present  the IRD for  payment  at  the  same

presenting  bank as if the IRD were the original  cheque.

The Bill also gives a person who has lost an IRD the same

rights  of recourse against the drawer that are currently

available to a person who has lost a cheque.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 49 to allow an IRD to serve

as a notice of dishonour to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>

the drawer of the cheque, as per a dishonoured cheque  in

today's  context.  The holder of the IRD will be able  to

use the IRD to notify the drawer that the cheque has been

dishonoured.   The  holder can then  request  for  a  new

cheque from the drawer if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 86 of the Act to clarify

that the new cheque truncation provisions in the Act that

are  applicable  to  cheques will  also  apply  to  other

instruments such as cash cheques and banker's drafts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of section 87C of the Act will allow

the   Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore  (MAS)  to  make

regulations  relating  to  cheque  truncation  with   the

approval  of the Minister.  MAS intends to prescribe  via

regulations, the electronic payment information  required

when  a  cheque  is  presented  electronically  and   the

particulars contained in an IRD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has incorporated the various comments that

MAS has received through consultation with public bodies.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Cheque Truncation System

will   enhance   the   banks'  efficiency   by   reducing

transportation  and  microfilming  costs,  thus  allowing

banks to offer new services to customers.  The amendments

in   this  Bill  will  enable  banks  to  keep  up   with

technological changes and help Singapore move to  a  more

efficient payment system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I

understand  that under the Cheque Truncation System,  the

physical cheque is deposited with the presenting bank but

is  no  longer transported physically to the paying  bank

for   verification.   Instead,  the  cheque  is   scanned

electronically into the CTS and the image is  transmitted

to  the  paying bank for clearance. At the paying  bank's

end, the signature

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>

would  be verified based on the electronic image  of  the

scanned cheque and the customer's specimen signature.  If

the  signature  tallies,  the  presenting  bank  will  be

notified  and funds will be paid to the payee's  account.

If  a cheque is dishonoured, the original cheque need not

be   returned  unless  it  is  requested.   Instead,   an

electronic image of the dishonoured cheque will be  given

back to the holder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that we are the first in the world to

adopt this system.  My concerns are:  is it secure?   Are

there  adequate  safeguards  against  electronic  frauds?

Under  the current paper-based system, cheque frauds  can

be  committed  when  someone gets hold  of  the  physical

cheque  and forges the signature, figures, etc,  and  the

officer  at  the paying bank did not detect the  physical

discrepancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the CTS, I would like to know firstly, how

foolproof  are  the safeguards against  hacking?   Is  it

possible  for  outsiders to hack into the  system,  steal

images of signatures and scan them into other documents?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what systems are in place in the banks to

ensure that there is no internal fraud, for instance,  to

prevent  employees, who are authorised to handle archived

signatures,    from   misusing   the    signatures    and

misappropriation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, will verifying against an electronic image

be  less  accurate  than verifying  against  an  original

cheque?  I suppose that for any kind of electronic image,

it is more or less not as accurate as the original one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, who is making the decision whether to

clear  the cheque, ie, whether the signature matches  the

specimen that the customer has with the bank?  Is it by a

human being, like a bank officer, or is it automated?  If

it  is automated, then how stringent are the criteria for

matching  as opposed to human judgment?  If  it  is  more

stringent,  then it will lead to dishonouring of  cheques

caused  by variation in the customer's signature  due  to

natural process.  We all understand that our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>

signature  may  not always be the same.  If  it  is  less

stringent, then the system is less safe than the  current

system.   Will  the banks be underwriting the  customer's

losses under CTS?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would also like to know what

evaluation system has been conducted to ascertain that it

will work.  What is the confidence level of the result of

this  evaluation,  because we are  changing  to  quite  a

drastic system of clearance?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me congratulate the Member

for  displaying  a tremendous knowledge  of  the  system.

First of all, although Singapore may be the first country

to  adopt this system as a whole, because we are a  small

country,  it is therefore easy for us to implement.   But

in  many countries, this system is implemented by a group

of  banks or within a state.  He is partially right  that

we are the first country to adopt this system nationally.

But  this  technology and practice is  fairly  widespread

between groups of banks or within states.  As I mentioned

in  my  speech, countries like the UK or US  are  already

progressing to make this a national system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that security is of paramount

importance to the Cheque Truncation System.  I can assure

Members  here that much effort has been put in to  ensure

that  the  infrastructure is fully trusted  and  secured.

The  cheque  images that are captured  at  the  point  of

deposit   are  sealed  and  encrypted  before  they   are

transmitted,  and  therefore they are tamper-proof.   The

presenting  bank  will  also take the  responsibility  to

ensure that the scanned cheque images are of sufficiently

good  quality for the paying bank to rely on  for  cheque

verification.  The whole idea of this system is  that  we

are  handling more than 80-90 million cheques and we need

very good technology for the images for verification  and

automation.   But, at the same time, we  must  make  sure

that the customers have confidence in the system and,  to

do so, the system that the banks

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>

have  put  together  has  to  comply  with  international

standards of security and of encryption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signature matching is done by matching the

images and the specimen signature.  Human intervention is

avoided  unless there is a controversy.  The  Association

of Banks, in implementing this system, has taken relevant

steps to bring this system progressively.  This has  been

worked  on  for many years.  We started in the middle  of

this  year, and it will only be fully implemented  around

October  this  year. They have gone through  the  system.

They  have  verified it.  I agree with  the  Member  that

security is of the utmost importance, so that people have

confidence in the system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Do the banks underwrite to

cover losses of customers if there is a problem with  the

CTS?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If there is any doubt with the

cheque  and  it  is  dishonoured and  sent  back  to  the

original  drawer, then, of course, the person can  verify

whether the reason for the dishonoured cheque is valid or

not  -  whether  it is because of the date,  insufficient

funds or that the signature does not match, in which case

he  can  go through the same processes today to  get  the

drawer  to  re-issue the cheque.   I  do  not  think  the

processes  of writing cheques and verifying cheques  have

changed  by  the process of introducing this new  system.

This  is  just a way of using technology to  replace  the

human  verification that goes on today in  our  automated

clearing system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I am referring to a case of

forgery.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I said, the system has not

changed  compared to present practices.  If  there  is  a

forgery or fraud and there is an investigation, then  the

investigation  will  determine who is  at  fault  in  the

forgery or fraud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>6.05 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b>

Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br><i>New driving licence</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police currently issues driving licences to

those  who  pass  the driving test.  The driving  licence

serves  as  a reference document not just for the  Police

but  also other interested parties like insurance and car

rental   companies,  overseas  traffic  authorities   and

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing driving licence has remained unchanged

since 1969.  It is made of paper, flimsy, and awkward  to

carry  around  in  standard  card  holders.   Unlike  the

driving  licences of many other countries,  it  does  not

bear a photograph of the licence holder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current system, drivers are required to

renew  their  licences once every  one  or  three  years,

paying  a  fee  of $20 or $60 respectively.   Each  year,

approximately  700,000 people renew their licences,  with

about  62%  of  drivers renewing their licences  for  one

year,  while  the  remaining 38% of drivers  renew  their

licences for three years.  This current system of regular

renewals was introduced a long time ago when the lack  of

computer  technology  made it difficult  to  retrieve  or

check  licensing records that were more than three  years

old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes to amend the Road Traffic Act to

introduce  a  new driving licence.  This driving  licence

will  be  durable,  credit-card sized  and  will  bear  a

photograph of the licence holder.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>

new  driving  licence will also be  valid  for  life  for

Singaporean citizens and permanent residents.  Technology

now  allows  Traffic Police to maintain  licence  records

over  long  periods  of time.  This  system  of  lifetime

driving  licences is already in place in several European

countries,  such as Belgium, France, Germany, Norway  and

Switzerland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, foreigners who convert their native driving

licences  to the new photocard driving licence  will  not

receive the lifetime licence, but one that is valid for a

maximum  period of five years.  This is because  many  of

them  will not be working in Singapore after five  years.

They will not need the Singapore licence when they do not

live  and work here anymore.  If they do, they can  renew

their licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road safety will not be compromised by the

introduction of the new lifetime driving licence.  As  is

the  case now, elderly drivers will still be required  to

undergo  regular medical checks at age 60, 63  and  every

year  thereafter to certify their fitness  to  drive,  in

order to retain their licences.  The Traffic Police  also

has  several  measures in place to  revoke,  suspend  and

disqualify the licences of incompetent drivers,  such  as

the Driver Improvement Points System.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new photocard driving licence will be introduced

in  December this year.  Existing drivers will only  need

to  obtain  the  new driving licence upon the  expiry  of

their existing paper driving licences.  For example, if a

motorist currently holds a licence that expires  in  July

2003,  he  will only be able to obtain the new  photocard

driving licence in July next year.  There is therefore no

need  to  rush  to obtain the new driving  licence.   All

drivers will be able to obtain it progressively, as their

existing paper licences expire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the new driving licence will

bring  greater  convenience and reduce cost  for  licence

holders.  Motorists will only pay a fee of $50 to  obtain

the  new driving licence, instead of the $20 or $60  they

pay  every one or three years currently.  Traffic  Police

informed me that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>

most drivers obtain their driving licence around the  age

of  21.   If  they drive until the age of 60, they  would

have to pay a total of $780 over the years to renew their

licence,  under the current system of periodic  renewals,

assuming, of course, the fee remains unchanged at $20 per

year,  and assuming that they stop driving at  60.   With

the  new  driving  licence, they only have  to  pay  $50,

provided  they  do  not  lose  or  damage  their  driving

licence.   Motorists will also no longer  need  to  worry

about the hassle of renewing their licences every year or

every  three years.  If their licence is lost or damaged,

then they would have to pay $25 for a replacement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will affect a large number of

Singaporeans,   and   Members'  constituents   may   have

questions regarding the new driving licence.  The Traffic

Police  will  send a letter to every household  informing

them  about the changes.  They will also post a  list  of

questions  and  answers  on  their  Internet  website  to

explain the details.  I had earlier on asked the Clerk of

Parliament  to distribute to all Members a  copy  of  the

questions and answers, and the press release on  the  new

driving   licence.   I  hope  Members  will  find   these

materials useful.

<br><br><i>Deletion  of section 62A (2) and section 62A (3)  of  the Road Traffic Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also taking the opportunity to delete some

obsolete  sections in the Road Traffic Act.  In 1990,  my

Ministry  introduced section 62A(1) to  disallow  drivers

above  70  years of age from driving heavy vehicles.   At

that  time,  we  gave elderly drivers a three-year  grace

period,  up  till  April 1993, to comply  with  this  new

provision.   This  was to ensure that no  elderly  driver

would  suddenly  be  deprived of a livelihood.   Sections

62A(2)  and  (3) provided for this 3-year  grace  period.

Now  that  the  grace  period is  long  over,  these  two

provisions are therefore obsolete and will be repealed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to emphasise that section 62A(1)

still remains in force, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>

we  have  not  changed  our stand on disallowing  drivers

above 70 years of age from driving heavy vehicles.

<br><br><i>Enhanced measures against hit-and-run drivers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Road Traffic Act is also amended to enhance the

measures  we  can take against hit-and-run drivers.   The

number   of  hit-and-run  cases  involving  injuries   or

fatalities  remains  high.  There  were  179  hit-and-run

cases  in  the year 2000, and 154 cases in  2001.   These

figures were higher than any of the preceding years since

1993.   The  act  of  hitting a person  and  driving  off

without   stopping  is  wholly  unacceptable.   This   is

especially  so  when such a failure to render  assistance

can  mean  the difference between life and death  to  the

victim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to enhance the measures against

hit-and-run drivers in the following ways:

.     Firstly, the Deputy Commissioner of Police will  be

empowered to suspend the licence of a driver charged  for

failing to stop in an accident, which has caused death or

serious  injury, while he awaits court trial.  Under  the

Road Traffic Act, a serious injury means any injury which

causes  a  person to be in severe bodily pain, or  to  be

unable to follow his ordinary lifestyle, for a period  of

seven days, as certified by a medical doctor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will enhance the penalty for hit-and-run drivers by making it mandatory for the court to

disqualify a person convicted of a hit-and-run case, from

holding  or obtaining a driving licence for at  least  12

months from the date of conviction.

.     Thirdly,  Police officers will be given  powers  of

arrest,  search and seizure without a warrant in hit-and-run  cases.  This power is crucial as investigations into

these   cases   are  time-sensitive.    In   past   cases

investigated  by the Traffic Police, the  Traffic  Police

have found drivers who would attempt to replace or remove

damaged parts of their cars to evade

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>

arrest.   For example, in one case, a hit-and-run  driver

had  tried  to evade arrest by replacing his car's  front

bumper,  bonnet and side mirror, which had  been  damaged

because  of  the  accident.  With the powers  of  arrest,

search  and  seizure  without a  warrant  in  hit-and-run

cases,  the  Police  would be able to  swiftly  search  a

suspect's  car and seize any evidence before  the  driver

tries  to  dispose  of  it.  Such  powers  are  therefore

necessary  to prevent offenders from tampering  with  any

evidence of the offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a person convicted of hit-and-run where

death  or serious injury is caused can expect to be fined

up  to  $3,000 and/or imprisoned for a term of up  to  12

months.   However, there is currently a disparity between

the  penalties  for drink-driving and  hit-and-run.   The

existing penalties for drink-driving are a fine of up  to

$5,000  and/or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months,

and  mandatory disqualification from driving all  classes

of vehicles for a period of 12 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This disparity between the penalties may result in a

drink-driver  who causes an accident to flee  the  scene.

If the culprit driver surrenders himself to the Police or

is traced through Police investigations after the alcohol

in  his body has subsided several hours later, the Police

will  not  be  able to prove that the driver was  driving

under  the  influence of alcohol, as his  blood  specimen

will  not indicate the presence of alcohol.  In this way,

a drink-driver who flees the accident scene will not face

mandatory disqualification of his driving licence even if

he  had caused death or serious injury in the hit-and-run

accident.   To  address this, the amendment to  introduce

mandatory disqualification of the driving licence in  the

case of hit-and-run drivers where death or serious injury

is  caused, will create parity in the penalties for  both

drink-driving and hit-and-run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, these measures will make our

roads safer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the Bill.

I  particularly  welcome  the  move  to  provide  driving

licences for life at a reasonable cost announced  by  the

Minister  of  $50.   I  do hope that the  Minister  would

consider  free licences, as is the case with ICs  or,  at

least, on a cost recovery basis for such licences.   But,

I  suppose,  $50 would be regarded by most as  reasonable

for a life-time licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the powers of suspension of licences which

have been increased as far as the Deputy Commissioner  of

Police is concerned.  This is a very necessary power  but

must be used judiciously.  This is especially so when the

driver  is  the sole breadwinner of the family  and  when

driving  is  a necessary part of his work.   Very  often,

hon.  Members  would have to write to Traffic  Police  to

review the suspension of drivers whose family incomes are

seriously affected when the drivers are suspended.  While

I  am,  of  course, not questioning the need for  such  a

power or the exercise of it in appropriate circumstances,

I  would  hope  that  there will be at  least  an  appeal

procedure set up for the driver to take when he wishes to

contest suspension.  Decisions made must be consistent as

this is a quasi-judicial function and made only after due

consideration is given to the seriousness of the offence,

the driving record of the driver concerned and the effect

such an suspension has on the driver and his family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to ask the Minister to look

into  the rule that says that after a driver is suspended

for a reasonably long period such as a year and above, he

or she must retake the road test.  While I agree that the

driver must show proficiency in driving after such a long

layoff, I would also like to suggest that they be allowed

to take the test, and perhaps an amended test, as soon as

the  period of suspension ends, instead of waiting in the

queue  with  the others.  This has frequently meant  that

they are actually suspended for a longer period currently

while waiting for the test.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>

In   many  instances,  their  income  has  already   been

seriously affected and this prolongs the suspension  even

more.   The suspended driver should be allowed to  return

to  driving  within a reasonable period  and  that  means

providing a test as soon as practicable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Traffic Police and LTA have been doing a

good  job in educating the driving community to drive  or

ride  with care and not to speed.  It would seem that  in

many  instances, the public education campaigns  may  not

have  had  the desired effects and I would hope that  the

Minister  would  still look into new  ways  of  educating

drivers,  especially those booked for speeding  offences.

Suspension  should  be  used only  on  the  most  serious

offences  with  the  demerit  system,  and  with  certain

offences  having  their  points  increased,  it  is  easy

especially  for  those who drive for  a  living  to  fall

within  the suspension range.  I believe we should review

the system to see whether before suspension, a driver can

have  sufficient  warning about his poor  driving  record

and,  if  needed, educate as to how he may  be  a  better

driver before he commits another offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Madam Deputy Speaker, regarding

the  power given to the Deputy Commissioner of Police  to

suspend  the driving licence of a person who  is  charged

for  hit-and-run where death or serious injury is caused,

such  power is not new.  In the case of a person  charged

for  causing  death or serious injury to  another  person

while  under  the  influence of drink  driving,  reckless

driving or dangerous driving, the Deputy Commissioner  of

Police  already  has such powers.  But I can  assure  the

House  that  the  Deputy Commissioner will  exercise  his

power  to  suspend the driving licence  judiciously.   It

will  only  be  invoked  if the errant  driver  has  been

charged  for an offence of hit-and-run.  He will  not  be

suspended if he has not been charged.  The moment  he  is

charged, then, of course, the Deputy Commissioner has the

power to suspend the licence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the suspension or disqualification of a

person's driving licence may cause some hardship  to  the

family,  especially  if the person makes  his  living  by

driving,  such suspension or disqualification of  driving

licence  is  necessary in the interest of safety  of  all

other road users.  Suspension or disqualification takes a

dangerous  driver off the roads and, therefore,  it  will

ensure  that  other  road users are protected  from  such

people.  Of course, the person who is to be suspended can

always  make  an  appeal.  The Deputy  Commissioner  will

consider the appeal.  But when considering the appeal, he

will  be very cautious in not putting a dangerous  driver

back on the roads again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who have been suspended or disqualified from

driving  for  a year or more are required to  retake  the

driving  test, as is currently the case.  This is because

these  are  persons  who have already  committed  serious

traffic  offences.   By  requiring  them  to  retake  the

driving test, it will then ensure that they have improved

on  their  skills  and  they have changed  their  driving

habits  before they are allowed to get on  to  the  roads

again.   In the case of a person who makes his living  by

driving, the Traffic Police is always prepared to help to

speed  up his retest if he has a case to ask for an early

test.  But that depends on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked whether under the demerit point

system,  we warn drivers about their poor driving  record

if  they  have  a poor driving record.  Indeed,  this  is

already  done  by  the Traffic Police.   Under  the  Road

Traffic  Act,  the  Traffic Police is  required  to  warn

drivers  by giving them notice in writing when  a  person

accumulates  50% of the maximum number of demerit  points

at which suspension will be imposed.  More importantly, I

would  say  for  such people who have to  make  a  living

through driving, they should be more careful on the roads

and  not  to do anything that may cause danger  or  great

harm  to  other  motorists or road users, so  that  their

licence would not be suspended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of educating the motorists, I think

every year the Traffic Police

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>

conducts road safety campaigns.  People do not pay  heed.

They  think  that they are safe drivers, until  they  get

into  trouble.   For  those who speed anyway,  they  will

continue to speed until they get caught.  While we try to

educate  them as much as possible, basically  it  is  the

attitude  of the drivers to be courteous on the road,  to

give way to other people and to consider the interest  of

other  road users as well.  I hope that our motorists  on

our  roads  can be as courteous as some of the others  in

other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>6.22 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b>

Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Industrial Relations Act (Cap. 136)

provides for the regulation of the relations of employers

and  employees and the prevention and settlement of trade

disputes  by  collective  bargaining,  conciliation   and

arbitration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing laws, executive employees are already

allowed  to  form  their own unions  to  represent  their

interests  and  engage  in  collective  bargaining   with

employers.  However, the current Industrial Relations Act

prohibits  rank-and-file trade unions to seek recognition

in   representing   employees  holding   managerial   and

executive    positions.     The   Industrial    Relations

(Amendment) Bill presented to the House today would allow

rank-and-file  unions  to  represent  certain   executive

employees in limited areas.  However, representation will

not be enabled for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>

those  executive  employees  entrusted  with  substantial

managerial  and decision-making responsibilities  as  the

employer  is  granted  the  right  to  object  to   their

representation by the rank-and-file unions.  This  is  to

avoid  conflicts  of  interest  and  consequent  loss  of

management effectiveness and flexibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive employees can only be represented by the

rank-and-file  unions  in disputes concerning  dismissal,

retrenchment benefits and breach of individual  contract.

I  also  like to point out that representation is allowed

only on an individual basis.  There will be no collective

bargaining   rights   for   executive   employees    when

represented by rank-and-file unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last major review of the Act was carried out in

1968.   The  1968 amendments restored certain  management

rights  to  employers  and  put  in  place  a  collective

bargaining, conciliation and arbitration system which has

enabled  Singapore to achieve industrial harmony  through

tripartite cooperation for the past three decades.   This

Bill   will  further  strengthen  the  harmonious  labour

relations that Singapore has enjoyed over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments presented in the Bill are in line

with  recommendations  from the Tripartite  Committee  on

Union  Representation of Executives formed  in  September

1999  and  chaired  by  the then Minister  of  State  for

Manpower,  Mr  Othman Haron Eusofe.   During  the  months

preceding the formation of this Tripartite Committee, our

economy was in severe recession following the 1997  Asian

financial  crisis.  That recession saw a higher incidence

of  retrenchment  of  both  executive  and  rank-and-file

employees.    While   their   rank-and-file   colleagues,

especially those represented by trade unions,  were  paid

reasonably good compensation by their employers based  on

the company's financial position, industry norm and years

of  service, some executives and managers received little

or  no compensation.  Consequently, dissatisfaction among

them grew.  Since executive employees are not covered  by

the Employment Act, their only legal recourse

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>

was  under the Common Law.  Civil litigation is, however,

a  costly affair.  The desire to form executive unions to

provide  them  with  a lower cost alternative  for  their

disputes therefore increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was against this backdrop that the Tripartite

Committee  on  Union  Representation  of  Executives  was

appointed.  In its deliberation, the Committee noted that

the  profile of our local workforce had changed with more

employees  joining the executive ranks.  Correspondingly,

the  rank-and-file membership would dwindle, giving  rise

to  concern  that the trade union movement  led  by  NTUC

might reduce in relevance, if that trend persisted.   The

Committee also noted that as the number of executives and

managers grew larger, the formation of executive  unions,

and  hence  increase  in the number of  unions  within  a

workplace,   would   be  inevitable.    This   would   be

undesirable  as  multiple unions, by their  very  nature,

tend  to  represent the interests of different groups  of

employees.   Indeed,  the experience of  other  countries

confirms  that  the  dynamics arising  from  many  unions

within  a workplace hinders labour-management cooperation

and teamwork resulting in lowered productivity.  Within a

single  union, the interests of employees could be better

harmonised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriately, the Committee recommended that

certain   executives  and  managers  should  be   allowed

representation  by rank-and-file unions to  provide  them

with  an  additional  avenue to  seek  remedy  for  their

disputes.   To  address  employers'  concern  that   such

representation  would give rise to conflict  of  interest

and  undermine  management effectiveness,  the  Committee

sensibly  recommended  that senior management  staff  and

certain   core   management  personnel   could   not   be

represented.   These included those involved  in  hiring,

firing,  promotion,  dismissals and disciplinary  duties;

those  with access to confidential information,  such  as

payroll  and  budgeting information; those who  represent

employers' interest in union-management matters and those

whose union affiliation would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>

give  rise  to conflict of interest.  Executive employees

could  only be represented by rank-and-file union  on  an

individual,  but  not for collective bargaining  purpose.

Representation should be limited to only three  areas  of

disputes, involving dismissal, retrenchment benefits  and

breach  of contracts.  Further, these executive employees

cannot  be  involved in industrial action  although  they

would  be  allowed to hold union office  to  enhance  the

leadership  of  rank-and-file  unions.   The  Committee's

recommendations have been accepted by the Government  and

now form the basis of these legislative amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of these legislative amendments are

given  in  the Explanatory Statement at the  end  of  the

Bill.  Now let me address the key features of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Representation of Executives by Rank-and-File Unions and Procedures for Negotiation and Conciliation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, as mentioned earlier, the

current  Industrial  Relations Act, specifically  section

16(3), prohibits unions, the majority of whose membership

consists  of employees in non-managerial or non-executive

positions,   that   is,   rank-and-file   unions,    from

representing   employees  in  managerial   or   executive

positions.   As  it  is a departure from  section  16(3),

clause  5  of the Bill inserts a new Part IIIA to  enable

rank-and-file   trade   unions  to  represent   executive

employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IIIA consists of six sections, ie, sections 30A

to   30F.    While  section  30A  provides  the  required

definitions  to  support  the  operation  of  Part  IIIA,

section 30B stipulates that an executive employee may  be

represented  by  a  rank-and-file  union   only   on   an

individual  basis and limited to disputes  pertaining  to

dismissal, retrenchment benefits and breach of contracts.

Section  30B allows employers to raise objection to  such

representation on the ground that the executive  employee

performs, or exercises a function, duty or power that may

give rise to a real or potential conflict of interest  if

he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>

or  she  is represented by the trade union.  The  section

further  provides that, where an employer raises such  an

objection,  the  employer and trade union  shall  make  a

joint application to the Industrial Arbitration Court for

arbitration,  if  the dispute cannot be  settled  through

conciliation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 30C to 30F prescribe procedures to regulate

negotiation   and   conciliation  of   disputes   between

executives who are represented and their employers.

<br><br><i>Court to Take Cognizance of Trade Disputes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 31 by inserting a new

paragraph  (ca)  to  allow  trade  disputes  relating  to

retrenchment   benefits  and  breach  of   contracts   of

executive  employees  to  be  submitted  to  arbitration.

Paragraph (ca) empowers the Industrial Arbitration  Court

to  take  cognizance of a trade dispute  related  to  the

retrenchment  benefits payable to an executive  employee,

or  a  breach of contract of employment by the  executive

employee, or his employer.  To enable the court  to  take

such  cognizance of the dispute, either the  employer  or

the trade union representing the employee may make an exparte  application, or unilateral request, in writing  to

the Registrar.

<br><br><i>Inducing Persons Not to Join Trade Unions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under section 79(2), an employer can

require  an employee who is to be appointed, or promoted,

to a managerial, or executive position, to cease to be an

officer  or member of a rank-and-file trade union.   This

section  will  be  amended to disallow an  employer  from

imposing such a condition.

<br><br><i>Consequential Amendments to the Trade Unions Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill makes consequential amendments

to  sections 27 and 39 of the Trade Unions Act.   Section

27  is amended to prohibit a rank-and-file union and  its

members  from participating in, or taking any  industrial

action, in connection

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>

with  any  trade  dispute  between  members  employed  in

managerial  and  executive positions and their  employer.

The amendment will also prohibit members in executive and

managerial  positions from participating in or commencing

any industrial action taken by the trade union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 39 is amended by inserting subsection (1A)

to prohibit rank-and-file trade unions from conferring to

members employed in executive or managerial position  the

right  to vote in secret ballot taken for the purpose  of

commencing a strike, or any form of industrial action.

<br><br><i>Repeal of Section 25 of the Industrial Relations Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, section 25 of the Industrial

Relations Act has outlived its usefulness, and this would

be  an  appropriate  time for it  to  be  repealed.   The

section  prohibited collective agreements from containing

terms  and conditions that are more favourable than those

contained  in  Part  IV of the Employment  Act.   It  was

introduced  in  1968  to  impose  a  ceiling  on  certain

employees'  benefits  which are contained  in  collective

agreements.  These benefits in the collective  agreements

are  now  in line with those in non-unionised sector  and

are  determined by market forces.  Hence, the prohibition

is no longer necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill is introduced to repeal section

25.   Consequent  on  the repeal of section  25,  section

42(b) is also deleted, while sections 42(a) and 59(1) are

amended.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the

recommendations  of  the Tripartite  Committee  on  Union

Representation of Executives were formulated taking  into

account  the  concerns  of employers,  trade  unions  and

executive employees.  To prevent conflict of interest and

ensure   that  management  effectiveness  would  not   be

undermined,  safeguards have been introduced by  limiting

the   representation  of  executive  employees  to  three

pertinent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>

areas on an individual basis and by allowing the employer

to  object  to  the  representation of senior  management

personnel  and certain categories of executive employees.

Further,  employees  who  can be  represented  and  their

unions as well as their rank-and-file colleagues are  not

allowed  to  commence, or participate in  any  industrial

action  in connection with a trade dispute affecting  the

executive employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative amendments would serve the interest

of the executive employees in that they will provide them

with  an additional and lower cost alternative to  settle

their employment disputes.  The amendments will serve the

interest  of  the rank-and-file unions as it would  allow

them  to  enlarge  their membership and invigorate  their

leadership.   The amendments also serve the interests  of

the  employers as this will discourage the  formation  of

multiple  unions  at the workplace since  executives  can

choose  to  be  represented by the rank-and-file  unions,

instead  of  forming  executive  unions.   A  multi-union

workplace  could subject employers to tedious  collective

bargaining processes, or costly and time-consuming  civil

litigation  to  settle  disputes.  As  representation  is

limited  to  three areas and allowed only  an  individual

basis  with  no collective bargaining rights,  management

effectiveness   will  not  be  undermined.    Since   the

necessary  safeguards are in place, we do not  anticipate

any  major problems during the process of implementation.

However,  as with any new piece of legislation,  teething

problems  could arise.  It is envisaged that  with  close

tripartite  cooperation and the release of the tripartite

guidelines   to   facilitate  the  implementation,   such

teething  problems  could be resolved amicably  with  the

common goal of maintaining our industrial harmony for the

benefit of executive employees, unions, employers and the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

I support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road leading to this Bill has been a long one.

The labour movement here has, for a long time, called for

both  executives and rank-and-file workers to be  allowed

to  join  the same union.  Although the current law  does

not  prevent executives from forming unions,  and  indeed

there  are  already  several executive  staff  unions  in

Singapore, executives however, under our law,  cannot  be

represented by unions whose membership consists of  rank-and-file employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, executives, like rank-and-file

workers,  are  affected  by restructuring  in  companies.

Executives,  like rank-and-file workers, also  want  fair

treatment  in  the workplace.  Therefore,  executives  in

Singapore,  like executives in all other countries,  have

felt the need to be represented by trade unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement has not made much progress on

this  in  the  past.  Our current law takes the  position

that  executives should be able to look after  their  own

interests  as they are better educated and can  negotiate

and  enter  into  employment contract by themselves.   We

also face resistance from employers.  The usual objection

from  the  employers is that there will be  "conflict  of

interest" on areas, such as management control, grievance

and disciplinary matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, this concern is overstated. In

Singapore, unions are not confrontational.  They act in a

very  responsible  manner.  While the situation  did  not

cause  any  major problems in the past, it was  far  from

desirable.   It  became  pronounced  during   the   Asian

financial   crisis.    We  see  more  executives   facing

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at some of the statistics. For

the  year 1998, the percentage of retrenched workers with

post-secondary,  diploma  and degree  qualifications  was

getting higher.  It was at 20.8%.  For year 1999, it went

up  to  27.4%.   And for last year, as  we  were  hit  by

another downturn, the percentage went even higher to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>

30.2%.   And for this year, with only the first quarter's

figure, the percentage is 31.8%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, at the height of the Asian

financial crisis, the labour movement found an increasing

number  of  executives coming to us for help.  They  were

mainly  over  retrenchments, dismissals,  non-payment  of

retrenchment  benefits and salaries.  The  problems  they

faced  were  no different from the rank-and-file  workers

that  our  unions  represent.  It was a clear  sign  that

something must be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 1999, I filed a question in Parliament and

the  Manpower Minister, Dr Lee Boon Yang, agreed that  we

should  review the law.  And here, we are today  debating

on the amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, much has happened since 1999

when  the  NTUC  first  started pushing  for  legislative

changes  of union representation for the executives.   We

recovered  from the Asian financial crisis only  to  find

ourselves in another downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the recession last year and even now, we

again  saw many executives looking for help, as I  showed

you  the  figures  just  now.   Although  executives  can

approach MOM to assist in conciliation, there is  no  law

to   compel   employers  to  respond  to   requests   for

conciliation.  Executives who feel aggrieved  would  have

to  resort  to costly legal action.  At that point,  some

union  leaders  wished the laws had been  amended.   They

wished  they  could do more for the executives  who  were

retrenched  or  faced  dispute  arising  from  breach  of

employment terms, but they felt helpless!  They asked why

the process took so long!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I have also wished that the laws had

been  amended before this recession so that we would have

been  able  to do more for the executives who  have  been

affected by the downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, we can expect workers to get better

educated and the proportion

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>

of  executives  will  increase.   The  amendment  to  the

Industrial  Relations Act will thus be timely.   It  will

achieve a win-win-win outcome for workers, employers  and

Singapore as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For junior executives, the amendment will allow them

to  join  unions to protect their interest.  This expands

the  scope  of protection to those who are not  protected

under the current law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employers, they can continue to work with one

union   representing  all  their  workers,  rather   than

multiple   unions.   Having  one  union  will  strengthen

industrial  harmony,  and more  than  one  union  in  the

workplace  does not promote teamwork.  This  will  expand

the  scope  and depth of partnership between  unions  and

companies further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, the amendment will strengthen

industrial  harmony.   Executives can  seek  redress  for

their  grievances  through the unions.   It  avoids  them

having  to  seek  legal recourse,  which  is  costly  and

disruptive    to   industrial   harmony.    Strengthening

industrial  harmony  will give us a  greater  competitive

edge  as  we seek to attract more investments and  create

more jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the changes to the Act is a

positive step for industrial harmony in Singapore.  Thus,

I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the changing

landscape of the operating environment impacts us on many

fronts.   To be able to maintain an effective and  value-add  employment  relations climate, it is  important  for

both  employers and employees to evolve a new  engagement

deal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, employers are having to deal with a

more  sophisticated and educated workforce.   Singapore's

unique    tripartite   formula   and   the   increasingly

professional  and  pragmatic  HR  practices   have   been

instrumental  in  providing a congenial work  environment

and  nurturing  a  productive and competitive  workforce.

These  have contributed to attracting foreign investments

into Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is to address the outcry

from  the  many  executives,  managers  and  professional

staff.   The last two recessions had seen many executives

being  unfairly treated by their employers, some of  whom

had  even  faulted  on  payments.   These  professionals,

executives  and  managerial staff were  and  are  without

recourse to any institution other than the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is supposed to give the executives,

professionals and managerial staff an avenue of  recourse

at  MOM, as well as the Industrial Arbitration Court, but

via  the  trade union only.  While the intention  may  be

clear,  the  Bill,  in  fact,  will  still  exclude  many

professionals,  executives and managers.   Representation

is  only  by a "recognised trade union".  But by defining

the  term  to  mean  a  union  that  "has  been  accorded

recognition   by   an   employed   ...",   an   aggrieved

professional, executive or manager still does not have  a

recourse, if there is no union at his or her workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this amendment Bill is that it caters

for only the junior executives who are in companies where

there  are  unions that are already accorded recognition.

As  statistics show, union membership, as a percentage of

the  working  population, is low, at  about  16%  and  is

declining.   So,  there will still be  large  numbers  of

professionals, executives and managerial staff  who  will

be  unprotected, ie, the more senior levels, as  well  as

those  lower level executives who are in companies  where

there    are    no   unions.    For   these   unprotected

professionals, executives and managerial staff, going  to

court  is  not the solution when the outcomes  are  never

certain,  and  the fear of exorbitant legal  costs  looms

large over their heads.  What is the solution then?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM today actively encourages "best" HR practices

among  employers.  I would like to propose that MOM  take

the  lead to establish a self-regulatory body to  monitor

and deal with cases which do not come within the ambit of

the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>

This  will  cover  executives of all  levels  in  a  non-unionised environment, as well as senior executives in  a

unionised environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Employment Act should also incorporate a

proviso that addresses salary claims.  The last recession

has  borne out many cases of senior executives  who  were

not  paid  for work carried out, and yet had no  recourse

except  through  the costly and protracted  legal  route.

Other avenues that could be considered could be the Small

Claims Tribunal for claims up to a certain amount.   Such

additional   avenues  would  complement  and   supplement

existing  mechanisms to cater to the needs of  executives

who fall outside the ambit of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related amendments to the Trade Unions Act must also

be  considered.  The amendments leave open for executives

to  be  elected to the union's decision-making body,  ie,

the  executive  committee.  Once there,  they  can  bring

influence  to bear on the unions.  Therefore,  we  should

have  an  amendment that executives cannot serve  on  the

decision-making body of the union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the proposed repeal of section 25,

the rationale given is that this section has outlived its

usefulness and, therefore, it is appropriate for it to be

repealed.   This  rationale  is  questionable   for   the

following  reasons.   In  the  New  Economy  and   global

business era, Singapore will be attracting a new breed of

investors.   With  the  repeal  of  section   25,   these

investors   may   perceive  themselves   to   be   at   a

disadvantage,  if  the  unions  chose  to   invoke   more

favourable   benefits  than  what  the   Employment   Act

provides.   In the initial years of a new investment,  no

investor  or his management would want to be  engaged  in

unnecessary discussion or negotiation for enhancement  of

terms  if the management could simply benchmark its terms

to an existing piece of document, ie, the Employment Act.

In  other words, I do not see the main existing terms  in

section  25  making things worse off.  So,  if  it  ain't

broke, why fix it?  If the management feels that it could

afford to give more, then let them do it on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>

their  own  accord.  What is important is to ensure  that

the minimum terms are specified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this argument, section 25 should not

be  repealed  for  the reason given,  ie,  "outlived  its

usefulness".   The purpose and intent of  section  25  is

still  relevant.  It is important to assure our investors

that the amendment to the Industrial Relations Act serves

to  enhance the employment relations climate and  promote

Singapore's economic competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

thank  you for giving me the floor.  I rise to  speak  in

support of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes two key amendments. The first one

concerns  section  25  of the Industrial  Relations  Act,

which the Bill proposes that it be repealed.  Section  25

was  inserted  by way of an amendment to  the  Industrial

Relations  Act  in  1968.  Under this provision,  pioneer

status  companies  are  prohibited from  giving  benefits

which  are more favourable than that provided under  Part

IV   of   the  Employment  Act.   In  practice,   though,

exemptions  are  allowed from this  provision  which,  in

practical terms, apply only to the annual and sick  leave

entitlements  under the Act.  Most employers  treat  such

leave  entitlements as minimum standards, and the pioneer

status  companies that want to attract good staff  cannot

provide  benefits  which are less  favourable  than  that

provided   by  the  market.   So,  many  pioneer   status

companies  had  to  ask  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  for

exemptions.   The  NTUC  had for  many  years  asked  the

Government to remove these restrictions, as they  are  no

longer  relevant  and hinder the implementation  of  good

human  resource practices at the workplace.  It  is  also

impractical  as  good employers can give other  forms  of

paid  leave  without violating the law, so long  as  they

provide  paid  leave to their employees in  the  form  of

child-care leave, marriage leave or compassionate  leave,

for instance, they will not be breaking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>

the  law.  Hence, it is nonsensical that an employer  can

provide other forms of paid leave but cannot provide more

annual leave without approval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for this reason, I would disagree with the point

raised  by my parliamentary colleague, Mdm Ho Geok  Choo,

because  I  think the amendment is appropriate,  relevant

and necessary, as it has very limited application and  is

really no longer relevant in the present context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also very happy that the Government has

acceded  to  our request to remove this anachronism  from

our  law.   I am also glad to say that by repealing  this

provision,  our Government is bringing our  law  more  in

line  with  ILO  Convention 98, which is  on  freedom  of

association and the right to collective bargaining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the second key amendment

concerns  section 16(3) of the Act.  This  provision  was

also  inserted  into  our  law  in  1968  by  way  of  an

amendment.  The original law did not restrict  the  right

of  executives to join and be represented by a  rank-and-file union, so long as its constitution permits it.   The

law  was  amended in 1968 to prohibit unions representing

non-managers   and   non-executives   from   representing

managers   and   executives,  to  prevent   conflict   of

interests.   This restriction remains in our laws  today.

But  what  the present amendment seeks to do is to  allow

such  rank-and-file  unions to  represent  executives  in

their  individual  capacities on  matters  pertaining  to

retrenchments,  dismissals and breach of contract.   This

amendment  is  a step forward and is beneficial  to  both

executives and employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, executives already have the right to form

their  own  unions  to represent their interests  in  the

workplace,  and  have full collective bargaining  rights.

But,  because of their small number, this is not  a  very

practical solution.  At the same time, as executives  are

not covered under the Employment Act, they cannot legally

seek  recourse  through the Ministry  of  Manpower.   The

alternative  for them is to pursue their  claims  through

common

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>

law.  Legal actions, however, are costly, time-consuming,

and  attract unnecessary publicity, which may be  adverse

to  the  executive  as  it could  jeopardise  his  future

employment prospects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a fundamental issue that we need to

address.   Do we prefer employment matters to be  settled

through  the  courts, or do we want them  to  be  settled

through  union and management negotiations  and,  failing

which,  through conciliation by the Ministry of Manpower?

The  experience of other countries, such as the  US,  has

shown  that  more litigation over employment disputes  is

disadvantageous to employers as well, as long  protracted

disputes  affect productivity and increase the  level  of

hostility in the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the last recession was a turning

point for many executives.  Many were retrenched but find

that  they  have  little  recourse,  except  through  the

courts.   The Ministry of Manpower had rendered  a  great

deal   of  assistance  to  such  executives,  but   where

employers  are  reluctant or unwilling to cooperate,  not

much can be done as there are no laws to compel employers

to  attend  conciliation  meetings.   We,  in  NTUC,  had

received  many requests for assistance, and  we  too  had

rendered  as  much help as we possibly could, considering

the  constraints.   There  is no  reason  why  executives

should be treated so differently from other rank-and-file

employees,  as  they too have families to  think  of  and

loans to service.  They, too, need protection and a voice

to represent their interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the NTUC strongly

supports  this amendment, as it is reasonable  and  fair,

and  would make it easier for us to assist executives who

are  in need of help in companies where there is a  rank-and-file  union.   On  the  concerns  expressed  by  some

employers  over union representation of executives  under

this  Bill,  I  wish to state that employers,  who  treat

their employees fairly and with respect, have nothing  to

worry about.  On

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>

the  other  hand,  I think it is not in the  interest  of

employers to protect the errant ones among them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mdm Deputy Speaker, now that the Government

is  amending this law and, therefore, clearly sending its

signal  that  it  supports the principle of  fairness  at

work,  can I ask the Ministry of Education to review  its

policy  of  asking  school principals  to  indemnify  the

Ministry  of  Education for losses of  school  assets  or

properties.    One  of  NTUC's  affiliated  unions,   the

Singapore Teachers' Union, has raised this issue with us,

and  we think that it is unfair to impose such an onerous

obligation  on them.  We know that principals  cannot  be

represented  by the Singapore Teachers'  Union.   But  in

line  with  this  new amendment and the  spirit  of  this

amendment,  I  wonder  whether  we  should  now  ask  for

principals  to  be represented, so that we  can  take  up

their grievances officially.  We all know that principals

who  fail  to discharge their duties will be  subject  to

disciplinary  action, which is, by itself,  a  very  huge

deterrent   to   irresponsible  behaviour.    There   is,

therefore, no need to go one step further and ask them to

indemnify for the losses.  Imagine the principal who,  in

addition  to losing her job, has also to pay the Ministry

of  Education $1 million, for instance, if  that  is  the

total cost of the losses incurred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any other employees in Singapore,

not even other civil servants, who have to undertake such

an  indemnity.  I hope that, once again, in the spirit of

this  amendment, the Ministry of Manpower, together  with

the  Ministry of Education, can seriously look into  this

matter and allay the fears of our principals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I support this

Bill,   as   it   will   further  strengthen   tripartite

cooperation  and  partnership in  Singapore,  and  ensure

continued industrial harmony.

<br><br><!-- Mr Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nithiah Nandan:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I agree with

the amendments that will allow rank-and-file unions to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>

represent   employees   in   managerial   and   executive

positions.   These amendments will provide protection  to

these  executives,  and  encourage  greater  bonding  and

cohesion amongst different categories of employees.  This

bonding will, in turn, promote harmony at workplaces  and

generate an increase in productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly support the intent of the Bill. It

will  avoid multiple unions in one organisation.  A union

representing  executive and non-executive employees  will

be  in  a better position to understand the workings  and

needs  of  a company in the broader sense.  It  can  work

with  the  company  to  achieve  its  objectives  without

undermining the interests of all the employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a knowledge-based economy, the composition of our

workforce constantly changes.  The new entrants into  the

job  market  are mostly diploma and degree holders.  They

have  different needs and aspirations.  The economy needs

them.  It is therefore in the interest of the nation that

they be given fair and adequate protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, as we are all aware, the only thing that is

constant  in  the industry and business are the  changes.

Restructuring, liberalisation, mergers and  globalisation

become  the norm in both the private and public  sectors.

These  changes, if not handled properly, can  destabilise

the  strong industrial harmony and stability that we have

built   and   sustained  through  tripartie  partnership.

Hence,  it is more critical now that we place a mechanism

that can respond quickly and efficiently to address these

changes,   and  minimise  the  impact  on  the   workers.

Therefore,  I  strongly believe that these amendments  to

allow   the   rank-and-file  unions  to   represent   the

executives  will pave the way to a smooth  transition  in

effecting the changes.  I say this with strong conviction

because, as the Executive Secretary of the Union of Power

and   Gas  Employees  (UPAGE)  and  the  Senior  Officers

Association  of Singapore (SOASPOWER), a house  union,  I

saw  and  experienced the practicality and  effectiveness

when one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>

union  represents  both the executive  and  non-executive

employees of the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, please allow me to elaborate a

little  on  this  experience.  In April 2001,  the  power

industry  was  liberalised.  As a result, the  generation

companies, namely, Senoko Power Limited and Power  Seraya

Limited  were  divested and no longer form  part  of  the

Singapore Power group.  They each became an entity of its

own.  The managerial and executive staff of the companies

thus could no longer be represented by SOASPOWER, a house

union.   Jointly,  UPAGE and SOASPOWER  highlighted  this

difficult  situation  to  the  management  of   the   two

companies.   The  senior management of Senoko  Power  and

Power  Seraya  saw  the  merit of  having  one  union  to

represent both the executive and non-executive employees.

They  allowed UPAGE, a rank-and-file industry  union,  to

represent  both  categories of  their  employees.   Thus,

UPAGE   made  parallel  representations  for   both   the

executives   and  non-executives  on  industrial   issues

arising  out  of  the  divestment of the  two  generation

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberalisation and divestment process went very

smoothly with no effect on the function and operation  of

the   companies  involved.  Today,  we  have   a   highly

productive  workforce, working towards the betterment  of

the companies.  Conflict of interest is a non-issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UPAGE and SOASPOWER are now in the process of

merging into a single union, representing the interest of

employees  in  the power and gas industries.   This  will

further  strengthen the union and its strong  links  with

the  companies.   The  senior  managements  of  Singapore

Power,  Power Seraya and Senoko Power, acknowledging  the

benefits of such a pact, lend further support by  joining

as general branch union members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, earlier on, Mdm Ho mentioned

about  repealing section 25.  I disagree with  her  view.

In fact, section 25 is no longer relevant.  Besides that,

she also mentioned about representation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>

non-union members.  I think the way to go forward is  for

everyone to join a union.  If there is no union in  their

workplace  and  if Members of Parliament  are  in  senior

positions   in  companies,  they  should  encourage   the

formation  of  unions.  I think that is  the  way  to  go

forward   and   more   should   join   the   unions   and

representation  of  executives or even senior  management

can be properly handled through a union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I fully support

the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, many of the

points  I  wanted to make have been made by  my  esteemed

colleagues.  I rise in support of the Bill.  I just  want

to  say  how happy I feel now that there is an  amendment

that  would  allow  the  representation,  especially   in

retrenchment  and business practices, for executives  and

junior  managers because, previously, these people  would

have nowhere to go.  At the same time, employers need not

fear  that there would be a conflict of interest  in  the

proper functioning of the companies with respect to trade

disputes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  last  year's economic downturn has  set  a  new

precedent  in  terms  of unemployment,  in  that  it  has

affected many more mid-level executives in comparison  to

the Asian financial crisis or the 1985 recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my understanding that a large number of

executives were retrenched by irresponsible companies and

employers  without  any form of severance  break  pay  or

retrenchment benefits.  This has resulted in many of them

running  into  major  difficulties owing  to  their  high

financial  commitments,  particularly  in  home  and  car

purchases.  To make matters worse, the prolonged downturn

has  made  securing  another job  more  difficult.   Many

prospective employers also took advantage of the soft job

market by offering lower pay.  In desperation to gain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>

employment, many unemployed executives have to settle for

lower   paying  jobs  in  comparison  to  their  previous

positions.   They are suffering in silence.  I  therefore

see  this Bill as timely to allow executives to join  the

rank-and-file unions, so as to protect them in situations

of  dismissals,  retrenchments and breach  of  employment

contracts.  It is important to stress that the areas  for

union  representation  for  executives  are  limited   to

individuals in these three areas only and that collective

bargaining,  as  a  separate class, is  disallowed.  This

should  be  reassuring to employers  and  provide  for  a

greater expediency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on this Bill, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would

like to give my perspective from an employer's viewpoint,

considering the fact that I am also responsible  for  the

operation  of a multi-national company here.   Generally,

it  is  my  opinion  that  this amendment  Bill  is  well

conceived  and  has  provided for sufficient  safeguards,

particularly to prevent conflict of interest between  the

employer and the executive who chooses to join the union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that new section 30B(2) clearly

provides  for  an  employer to  object  to  an  executive

joining a trade union if the executive performs duties or

exercises  functions which, among others, involve  access

to  confidential  information  and  decision-making.    I

believe the stipulations in this section are detailed and

therefore  adequately stipulate the  real  and  potential

areas of conflict of interest.  This should alleviate the

concerns  of  the  management of companies  and  preserve

management effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, like Mdm Ho Geok Choo, my only concern is

the  repeal  of  section  25 which  prohibits  collective

agreements  in new selected business ventures to  contain

terms and conditions of service to be more favourable  to

employees  than  those permissible under  the  Employment

Act, unless such provisions are approved by the Minister.

I  am afraid I have to disagree with both Mdm Halimah and

Mr  Nithiah with regard to the repeal of section  25.   I

believe  the presence of this section has served us  well

throughout the years, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>

it has also been instrumental in attracting investors and

putting  them at ease from a standpoint that there  would

not  be any surprise or sudden pressure by the unions  to

demand  for  unreasonable terms.   In  the  light  of  us

continuing and wanting to attract higher value-added  and

capital-intensive investments into our country, which was

also  stressed  by Mdm Ho earlier on,  I  would  like  to

suggest that section 25 not be repealed, or if it  is  to

be  repealed,  it should be postponed to  a  later  date.

This would ensure that new investors and new undertakings

feel protected with the presence of such restrictions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mdm Deputy Speaker, it is my hope that the

intent  of  this amendment Bill is not aimed at primarily

enlarging  the  membership of the trade  unions,  but  to

inculcate  greater  responsibility at the  workplaces  in

tandem  with the changing profiles of our workforce.   As

Mr  Yeo Guat Kwang has said earlier on, this would  be  a

win-win situation for all parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Madam, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am gratified

by  the  response  from  Members speaking  on  behalf  of

employers and unions in supporting this Bill.  They  have

very strongly endorsed that this is needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have disagreed on section 25 and this is

illustrative  of  the tensions that would  arise  in  any

negotiations between employers and unions.  Those  issues

were  extensively deliberated in the tripartie committee,

and  this is the best case scenario.  We never get  quite

what  we  want but we have arrived at the best  position,

anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo also argued that, in fact, junior

executives should be even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>

more  protected,  and  that they should  have  even  more

avenues  apart from unions.  Yes, this is being  studied.

With  the review of the Employment Act, we will be making

more deliberations regarding whether protection is to  be

extended to junior executives as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah spoke on principles and indemnity. She

and  I both know that this is quite a departure from  the

subject  that is being discussed.  But I would compliment

her  on  her creativity and choose another time to answer

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, this piece of legislative

amendment, which allows limited representation of certain

executives  by rank-and-file unions, has no precedent  in

other  countries.  It is illustrative of the ability  and

the   uniqueness  of  our  relationships  and  the  close

tripartite consultation and cooperation that have allowed

this.    This  implementation  would  benefit  employers,

executives,  employees,  trade  unions  as  well  as  our

economy.
